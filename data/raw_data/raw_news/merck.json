            "content": "NEW YORK, April 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Gross Law Firm issues the following notice to shareholders of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK).\n\nShareholders who purchased shares of MRK during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery.\n\nCONTACT US HERE:\n\nhttps://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/merck-co-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=140388&from=4\n\nCLASS PERIOD: February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025\n\nALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\" Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \"not recovered to the level we had expected.\" Following this news, Merck's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck's stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nDEADLINE: April 14, 2025 Shareholders should not delay in registering for this class action.

            "content": "A recent Court of Appeal decision highlights the value of taking a proportionate approach to the enforcement of a court order. By seeking the court\u2019s declarations on the meaning of the order and making clear that it did not intend to use the court\u2019s findings as the basis for contempt proceedings, the Claimant achieved its objectives.\n\nWhat was the background?\n\nThe underlying case concerned the Defendants\u2019 misuse of the \u201cMerck\u201d brand. There had been a long-running controversy between the Claimant and the Defendants about the use of the brand, following its parallel development over many decades by separate entities based in Germany and the USA respectively. In summary, the German entity (the Claimant) effectively holds the rights to the Merck brand globally, except in North America, where the rights are held by the Defendants.\n\nThe first set of proceedings\n\nThe Claimant and Defendants co-existed under the common Merck brand for many years, subject to a series of agreements. However, after the USA entity merged with Schering-Plough in 2009, the Claimant became increasingly concerned about the Defendants\u2019 use of the Merck brand outside North America. This resulted in litigation in the English courts and elsewhere.\n\nThe English courts ultimately found that the Defendants had breached an earlier agreement regulating the use of the Merck brand and had infringed the Claimant\u2019s trade marks. This resulted in a court order in July 2020 restricting the Defendants\u2019 use of the Merck brand in the UK (the Order).\n\nThe second set of proceedings\n\nThe precise terms of the Order are not relevant for the purposes of this article. In summary, by October 2021, a dispute had arisen as to whether the Defendants were in breach of the Order. This resulted in an application to the English High Court by the Claimant in March 2022 for a declaration that the use of \"Merck\" by one or more of the Defendants was in breach of the Order (the Application).\n\nThe High Court found the Defendants to be in breach of the Order in respect of some, but not all, of the activities which the Claimants had complained about, and made a court declaration to this effect.\n\nThe appeal\n\nThe Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. Their grounds of appeal concentrated in part on the Judge\u2019s finding of facts. However, the focus of this article is the Defendants\u2019 contention that the Judge had no power to make a declaration concerning the Defendants\u2019 alleged breaches of the Order by making findings that specific acts committed by them constituted breaches. In this respect, the Defendants argued that the proper remedy for the Claimant was to bring contempt of court proceedings.\n\nThroughout the course of making the Application, the Claimant was careful to explain that it would not bring contempt proceedings in respect of the specific acts identified in the Application. However, it reserved the right to bring contempt proceedings in relation to any new acts or acts identified as breaches that continued or re-commenced after the date of the declaration they were asking the court to make. On appeal, the Claimant went further and gave an undertaking to this effect for the avoidance of any doubt.\n\nThe importance of this distinction is that allegations of contempt of court involve procedural safeguards for defendants, including the application of the higher criminal standard of proof rather than the civil standard. This is because individuals found guilty of contempt of court can be sent to prison or fined, and companies can have their assets seized.\n\nThe Court of Appeal accepted that, given the Claimant\u2019s clear explanation (and undertaking to the Court) that they would not bring contempt proceedings in respect of these allegations, there was no need for the additional protections for the Defendants. The legal standard for determining and making declarations about breaches of the Order was therefore the lower civil standard of proof, as the Judge in the lower court had correctly decided.\n\nThe Court of Appeal endorsed the Claimant\u2019s approach of applying for declaratory relief as a low-key method of resolving the dispute about the interpretation of the Order and its application to a wide range of alleged breaches. The court pointed out that the Defendants\u2019 alternative approach would lead to a position where the parties would be involved in high-stakes applications for contempt of court. This would be likely to heighten the level of dispute when the role of the courts should be to enable parties to have their disputes resolved in the most dispassionate, efficient and proportionate way possible.\n\nWhat are the practical implications?\n\nThis case illustrates that the English courts do not require parties to go for the \"nuclear option\" of contempt proceedings when breaches of court orders are in issue. Of course, an applicant can pursue that route if they choose to, aware of the higher evidential burden and consequent risks involved. However, this decision demonstrates that a more measured approach can still lead to the applicant establishing that breaches of a court order have occurred and, in doing so, issue a final warning to a defendant regarding their conduct.\n\nThe full Court of Appeal decision is here: Merck KGaA v Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC & Anor [2025] EWCA Civ 343 (28 March 2025)\n\nThis publication is a general summary of the law.

            "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Merck (MRK) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMerck currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRK\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MRK\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Merck here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Merck, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

The company\u2019s top-line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate is contributing well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio are beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive. Robust advertising businesses are also contributing well. Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus into generative AI is a major plus. We expect 2025 net sales to increase 8.6% from 2025. However, Amazon announced disappointing guidance for the first quarter. Management cited foreign exchange headwinds and the absence of an extra Leap Year Day as factors likely to impact growth in the current quarter. (You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>> ) Oracle\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+13.8% vs. -6.2%). The company reported mixed fiscal Q3 2025 results, wherein earnings and revenues missed estimates. Revenues were driven by continued momentum from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business, including from winning cloud-computing contracts from AI-focused startups. ORCL\u2019s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. ORCL\u2019s partnership with Amazon for Oracle Database@AWS and general availability of Oracle Database@Google bodes well. Oracle\u2019s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence clientele. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. The Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 7.7% from fiscal 2024. However, higher spending on product enhancements, toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion. (You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>> ) Shares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-29.7% vs. -4.7%). The company is facing rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and persistent challenges for Gardasil in China remain overhangs. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to successfully navigate the Keytruda loss of exclusivity period and potential competition for Keytruda. However, Keytruda\u2019s sales are expected to remain strong until it loses patent protection. Estimates are stable ahead of Q1 results. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. Nevertheless, Blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving Merck\u2019s sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health is also contributing to growth.

This mechanism of action allows Winrevair to restore balanceto vascular proliferation, a key pathway that is altered in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In particular, PAH patients see high excessive cell proliferation in key arteries, leading to thickened blood vessel walls and, in turn, impaired blood flow.\n\nWinrevair was approved by the FDA to treat PAH in March 2024, making it the first-ever drug for the disease that targets activin signaling.\n\nMerck continues to build its evidence base for Winrevair. In March 2023, the pharma unveiled full data from the Phase III STELLAR trial, touting a 40.8-meter improvement in 6-minute walk distance in patients with PAH following treatment with the drug. Winrevair also cut the risk of death or clinical worsening by 84% versus placebo.\n\nMerck is also running the Phase III HYPERION study to assess the benefit of Winrevair when used with background therapy. In January 2025, the company ended the trial ahead of schedule , in line with the recommendations of an external committee, because of strong efficacy findings in an interim analysis. Results from HYPERION will be presented later this year, according to Merck\u2019s Monday announcement.\n\nCorrection (4 April): This story has been updated to correct the rate of at least one major morbidity or mortality event in ZENITH\u2019s placebo group to 54.7%.

Subscribe here to receive future editions.\n\nThe race to develop more convenient versions of drugs that lower cholesterol is heating up after AstraZeneca released encouraging new data on an experimental pill.\n\nAstraZeneca and Merck are the main drugmakers testing oral versions of so-called PCSK9 Inhibitors, which reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or what is known as \"bad\" cholesterol. Those medications, such as Amgen's Repatha, are typically injections.\n\nHigh LDL cholesterol is the top driver of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Still, more than 70% of patients taking statins aren't reaching the target level for cholesterol, according to Mina Makar, who heads AstraZeneca's global cardiovascular, renal and metabolism biopharmaceuticals business.\n\nHe said that leads to 4 million to 5 million deaths worldwide due to elevated cholesterol. While PCSK9 injections have helped treatment reach more patients, their use has still been \"very limited,\" Makar said. That's due to several factors, such as challenges related to cost and access and hesitancy among some cardiologists and primary care physicians.\n\n\"That's why we're really excited about our oral PCSK9,\" Makar said. \"I think it has the chance to really democratize access to what these patients really need, which is something to get the majority of them\" to their target cholesterol levels.\n\nIn a note last week, Goldman Sachs analysts said oral treatments could drive growth of the PCSK9 class to around $12 billion in sales by 2034, up from about $4 billion currently. The analysts expect AstraZeneca's oral PCSK9 to be \"well-placed in the class,\" and they forecast peak sales of the drug to be around $4 billion by 2037.\n\nNow, let's dive into the new mid-stage trial data. It was presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, the experimental pill lowered LDL cholesterol by nearly 51% when taken once a day on top of a standard statin therapy, according to AstraZeneca. The pill helped 84% of patients meet the recommended cholesterol level, compared to just 13% of those who took statins alone.\n\nPatients in the trial tolerated the pill well, and adverse side effects were comparable between those who took AstraZeneca's drug and people who received a placebo.\n\nThose results show promise against Merck's treatment, though it is difficult to compare data without head-to-head clinical trials. Merck's oral PCSK9 is also much further along in development, with late-stage trial data expected this year.\n\nEarly data also suggests Merck's drug could be more effective than AstraZeneca's treatment, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. But they still see \"significant opportunity\" for AstraZeneca's pill given the size of the market for PCSK9s and the \"potential for differentiation on convenience.\"\n\nMerck's drug is what's known as a macrocyclic peptide, which requires patients to fast before taking it to allow for proper absorption. That \"could be burdensome and exacerbate compliance issues in an asymptomatic disease area where there is reluctance to intensify therapy,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.\n\nBut AstraZeneca's pill is a small-molecule drug, so it does not have any food restrictions or fasting requirements.\n\nMakar said another advantage of having a small molecule drug is that it is easy to combine with other therapies in the company's pipeline. For example, AstraZeneca is considering combining it with its statin, its GLP-1 drug for weight loss or its treatment ezetimibe, which is a cholesterol medicine for patients who can't tolerate statins, he said.\n\nMerck has similarly discussed the potential of combining its oral PCSK9 with other treatments, calling it a \"pipeline in a product.\"\n\nWe'll continue to follow the ongoing race to develop oral PCSK9s, so keep track of our coverage!\n\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com.",

This authorization permits the vaccine's marketing across all 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.\u200b\n\nCapvaxive is specifically designed to protect adults from the serotypes responsible for the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases. The EC's decision follows a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in January 2025, which was based on safety and immunogenicity data from the Phase 3 STRIDE clinical program.\n\nCapvaxive targets serotypes responsible for most invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases in adults. Clinical data from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain indicate broader coverage than PCV20, supported by pivotal Phase 3 trials, including the STRIDE-3 study. Already approved in the US (June 2024), Canada (July 2024), and Australia (January 2025), the vaccine is under review in Japan and additional countries.\n\nHeather Platt, MD, clinical director at Merck, emphasized the significance of this milestone. \u201cWe are really excited to have received a positive opinion from CHMP in the EU, and that was in January of 2025, which means that we are on the precipice of a decision from the European Commission. And we couldn\u2019t be more excited to bring this vaccine to more people.\u201d\n\nMerck is working to ensure global access to Capvaxive, particularly in lower-resource settings. \u201cOne thing that we always consider, that we do, is that for any of the countries that participate in our clinical studies, we make sure that we have a plan to bring that vaccine to those patients in that country,\u201d Platt said. \u201cFor the Phase 3 program, we were quite broad. We conducted the Phase 3 clinical program in 26 countries. So that means we have a lot of work to do, and we\u2019re ready to do it.\u201d\n\nPlatt also highlighted the vaccine\u2019s importance for adult populations at higher risk of pneumococcal disease. \u201cAdults have an increased risk of pneumococcal disease, and that can mean pneumococcal pneumonia, that can mean invasive disease, where patients have a chance of getting sicker, right? Once that bacteria is in the bloodstream, or, you know, crosses the barrier, meningitis. These are severe disease manifestations, and the risk increases with age. So Capvaxive was developed for adults.\u201d\n\nBeyond regulatory approval, Merck is focused on understanding the vaccination landscape across different regions. \u201cWe have work to do to identify what are the countries that are going to benefit, who has this burden of disease, which countries also have a really strong implementation process and can support vaccination of adults,\u201d Platt explained. \u201cWe also need to understand the barriers to vaccination so we can work with those countries as well.\u201d\n\nThis conversation serves as a follow-up to our earlier discussion with Platt when this recommendation first occurred, reinforcing its relevance and importance. Stay tuned for the next part of our conversation as we continue exploring Capvaxive\u2019s global impact and accessibility.\n\nReference\n\nNews Release.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) stands against other AI news and ratings making waves on Wall Street.\n\nAccording to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global data center market, valued at $242.72 billion in 2024, is expected to grow to $585 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7%. North America led the market in 2024, holding a nearly 39% share.\n\nAccording to the report, generative AI is significantly impacting the sector, as its deep learning models require substantial computing power, scalable storage, and high-performance infrastructure. The market is also shifting towards hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, enabling organizations to integrate public, private, and on-premise solutions efficiently. Additionally, modular data centers are gaining traction due to their cost-effectiveness, scalability, and faster deployment compared to traditional facilities, the report stated.\n\nMeeting AI Demand with Scalable and Sustainable Data Centers\n\nThe expansion of AI infrastructure through large-scale data center investments reflects the growing need for computational power. Companies are securing energy sources and developing specialized facilities to address scalability, sustainability, and efficiency challenges. For example, Related Companies is advancing into AI-driven data center development through its new division, Related Digital, using its expertise in renewable energy to meet rising demand from major tech firms.\n\nIn an interview at CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street,\u2019 CEO Jeff Blau highlighted the company\u2019s strategic move to assemble a specialized team to lead these projects. To support the growth, Related has secured sites with over five gigawatts of power across the U.S., investing $500 million of its own capital while planning to raise an additional $8 billion. With firms like Microsoft and Alphabet significantly increasing their capital expenditures, demand from hyperscalers remains strong. To mitigate risk, Related is securing long-term, 15-year commitments from tenants before beginning construction. Given the limited availability of power on the grid, Blau sees the company\u2019s early investment in securing capacity as a major competitive advantage in the fast-evolving AI infrastructure landscape.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at [email protected] or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.\n\nThe class action concerns whether Merck and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n\nYou have until April 14, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com.\n\n[Click here for information about joining the class action]\n\nOn July 30, 2024, Merck issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2024 and held an associated earnings call. Among other items, Merck announced a significant reduction in demand in China for its HPV vaccination Gardasil, resulting in higher than normal inventory levels at Merck's distributor in China. Accordingly, the Company advised that shipments of Gardasil to China might fall below contracted levels for 2024.\n\nOn this news, Merck's stock price fell $12.53 per share, or 9.81%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, Merck announced that it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted target of $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030, as the Company planned to cease Gardasil shipments to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\"\n\nOn this news, Merck's stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.07%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nPomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China.

Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Nestled within this landscape is Merck & Co, a colossal presence in the pharmaceutical domain, quietly defying the downtrodden trajectory with its promise of a shining upside. Here, innovation and potential stand shoulder-to-shoulder, offering a tantalizing 82% surge that beckons savvy investors.\n\nMerck, a titan in the pharmaceutical cosmos, pioneers with a relentless drive in developing life-altering vaccines and remedies. Its crown jewel, Keytruda, isn\u2019t just another drug; it\u2019s a beacon of hope for patients battling cancers like melanoma and lung cancer. Sales of Keytruda surged to an impressive $29.5 billion in 2024, marking a robust 18% leap from the previous year, painting a picture of vigour and resilience.\n\nBut Keytruda isn\u2019t the lone warrior in Merck\u2019s arsenal. Gardasil, the acclaimed vaccine fighting the human papillomavirus, amassed $8.6 billion in sales, continuing to safeguard the health of millions globally. Meanwhile, their R&D division stands as a cornerstone of future breakthroughs, bolstered by an investment of $17.9 billion, setting the stage for the next generation of blockbuster drugs.\n\nAdding to Merck\u2019s roster of triumphs is Winrevair, recently approved to combat adult pulmonary-arterial hypertension. Its swift acceptance in the market, raking in $419 million in sales, illustrates Merck\u2019s enduring ability to bring transformative treatments to light, consistently outperforming Wall Street\u2019s forecasts by a striking $117 million.\n\nYet, despite this remarkable trajectory, Merck\u2019s stock price tells a different story. With a 9% dip over the year, driven perhaps by modest projections for 2025, there\u2019s a sense that the stock\u2019s current valuation underestimates its true worth. However, seasoned analysts view this as a hidden treasure. Barchart\u2019s latest insights reveal that the optimistic among them predict the stock could skyrocket from a modest $92.25 to an exhilarating $168.\n\nThe prudent investor might see an opportunity in this apparent anomaly\u2014a chance to blend growth with income through Merck\u2019s dividend, currently yielding 3.58%. In a world of fluctuating rates and volatile markets, Merck\u2019s potential for income generation remains an alluring prospect.\n\nAs the financial melodies of 2025 loom, Merck embodies a remarkable paradox: one foot grounded in historic success, the other poised for boundless potential. Investors, acutely aware of this dynamic, might just find that Merck is not merely a stock, but a symphony of innovation and opportunity, waiting to reveal its crescendo.\n\nUnlocking the Potential of Merck & Co: Is It a Hidden Gem for Investors?\n\nMerck & Co, a powerhouse in the pharmaceutical industry, continues to impress with its strong portfolio of drugs and vaccines, despite recent stock market challenges. Here, we delve deeper into the opportunities and questions investors may have about this pharmaceutical giant, exploring its innovations, market trends, and investment potential.\n\nKey Products and Pipeline\n\n1. Keytruda\u2019s Expansion:\n\n\u2013 Global Reach: Originally approved for melanoma, Keytruda has expanded its indications, now addressing over 20 types of cancer. This expansion positions Merck as a leader in oncology and continues to drive revenues.\n\n\u2013 Ongoing Trials: New clinical trials are underway to further extend Keytruda\u2019s use, including combinations with other therapies, which could open up new markets and enhance its profitability.\n\n2. Gardasil and Public Health Impact:\n\n\u2013 Preventive Power: Gardasil\u2019s success as a vaccine against HPV not only contributes to Merck\u2019s bottom line but also plays a crucial role in public health by reducing the incidence of cervical cancer.\n\n3. Emerging Therapies:\n\n\u2013 Winrevair: Following its success in treating pulmonary-arterial hypertension, Winrevair highlights Merck\u2019s ability to swiftly transition new drugs from approval to market dominance.\n\n\u2013 R&D Investments: With nearly $18 billion allocated to R&D, Merck is strategically positioned to release innovative treatments that secure future revenue growth.\n\nFinancial Insights and Market Forecasts\n\nCurrent Market Position:\n\n\u2013 Despite a stock price dip by 9%, largely due to conservative 2025 projections, Merck\u2019s fundamentals suggest a robust growth potential. Analysts forecast the share price could rise to $168 from $92.25\u2014an increase of over 80%.\n\nDividend Appeal:\n\n\u2013 With a dividend yield of 3.58%, Merck offers a reliable income stream amidst market volatility. This makes it attractive for income-focused investors seeking stability.\n\nIndustry Trends and Investment Matters\n\n1. Biopharmaceutical Growth:\n\n\u2013 The pharmaceutical sector is expected to grow substantially, given the demand for innovative drugs and vaccines. According to Grand View Research, the global pharma market size could expand at a CAGR of 8% through 2028, benefiting companies like Merck.\n\n2. Sustainability and ESG:\n\n\u2013 Merck is increasing its focus on sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices, which could further attract long-term investors interested in socially responsible investing.\n\nAddressing Investor Concerns\n\nControversies and Limitations:\n\n\u2013 Pricing and accessibility of drugs are ongoing concerns that could impact Merck\u2019s public perception and regulatory landscape.\n\n\u2013 Investors should stay informed about potential risks from generic drug competition as patents expire.\n\nActionable Recommendations\n\n1. Diversify Portfolio: Include Merck as part of a diversified investment strategy to balance risk and return.\n\n2. Monitor Developments: Stay attuned to Merck\u2019s R&D announcements and market approvals for insights into growth catalysts.\n\n3. Evaluate ESG Impact: Consider Merck\u2019s sustainability initiatives as part of an investment decision.\n\nConclusion\n\nMerck & Co stands resilient, bolstered by a robust product portfolio and future growth potential.

Inc. (MRK) Went Up On Friday?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nShares of Merck & Co. rallied by 1.86 percent on Friday to end at $89.23 apiece following news that it would officially launch in October this year a subcutaneously injectable version of its blockbuster cancer treatment, Keytruda.\n\nAccording to the company, it targets the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment on September 23 ahead of its October 1 official launch target. The peak adoption rate is expected to hit two years later.\n\nBy injecting Keytruda under the skin rather than intravenous delivery, the time it takes for patients to receive the medicine would significantly reduce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be shipping product immediately following approval, in the first week or two following approval is the expectation, and we\u2019ll have more than enough supply to meet the market demand,\u201d said Joanne Monahan, MRK senior vice president in oncology division.\n\n\u201cWe expect the greatest uptake, at least initially, in patients who take monotherapy, oral combinations, and those who have early-stage cancers,\u201d she added.\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 10th on our list of firms that end Friday strong. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The current patent for the drug\u2014which brought in $29 billion last year\u2014is set to expire in 2028.\n\nThe pivotal phase III study in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, dubbed 3475A-D77, met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to the IV version. In two trial markers, the subcutaneous formulation actually beat the IV version, achieving a higher blood concentration after administration.\n\nThe subcutaneous version achieved a slightly higher overall response rate when combined with chemotherapy (45.4% versus 42.1% for IV), and a slightly higher progression-free survival (8.1 months versus 7.8 for IV).\n\nMerck noted that median overall survival has not yet been met in either trial, meaning that more than half of the patients in the trial were still alive as of the data cut-off.\n\nPatients also spent about half the time in the clinic receiving the treatment as compared to the IV version, according to the readout.\n\nAdverse effects occurred at about the same rate\u201447%\u2014for both formulations, with a death rate related to the treatment of 3.6% for the subcutaneous drug and 2.4% for the IV version.\n\nBased on these results, featured Thursday at the European Lung Cancer Congress (ELCC) 2025 and simultaneously published in Annals of Oncology, the FDA has accepted a biologics license application (BLA) for the new formulation across all of Keytruda\u2019s previously approved solid tumor indications. The agency set a decision date of September 23, 2025.\n\nPrevious data from MK-3475A-D77 in November 2024 showed that the subcutaneous version was equally effective in treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer compared to the IV infusion. At the time, Guggenheim analysts said those results were \u201can important step for the longevity of the Keytruda franchise.\u201d\n\nThursday, Merck added equivalent pharmacokinetics to the record to build its case for approval. The New Jersey-based pharma compared the original IV version of the drug with Keytruda plus berahyaluronidase alfa, a human protein manufactured in a collaboration with Alteogen that allows drugs to be administered in a subcutaneous injection. Patients in the trial were newly diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nMerck is simultaneously conducting a Phase II patient preference study called 3475A-F11, evaluating whether patients show a preference between the IV or subcutaneous version of Keytruda, according to Merck\u2019s announcement.",

            "content": "Four of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average represent the healthcare sector. Within that group, biotechnology giant Amgen (AMGN 0.60%) has been the best-performing stock in 2025, returning an impressive 21% year to date. Meanwhile, shares of its pharmaceutical rival Merck (MRK 0.32%) have lagged, down 8% in the same period.\n\nAmgen shareholders are celebrating, but have you wondered which stock is cheaper right now? Let's discuss whether Amgen or Merck stock offers better value.\n\nAmgen and Merck: The P/E ratio\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a financial metric that divides a stock's price by its earnings per share (EPS) as a quick way to assess a company's valuation. A lower P/E ratio suggests the stock is cheaper relative to its earnings, though growth prospects and financial health add critical context.\n\nBased on Wall Street analyst estimates for 2025 EPS, Amgen trades at 15 times its projected earnings, while Merck sits at a forward P/E of 10. By this measure, Merck is the cheaper stock and a relative bargain, reinforced by its larger dividend yield of 3.4% compared to Amgen's 2.9%.\n\nAmgen deserves its premium\n\nAmgen may be the more expensive stock, but several things suggest that it deserves its valuation premium and that its stock price can keep climbing.\n\nAmgen is generating stronger growth. Its 2024 revenue increased by 19% year over year, well above Merck's 7% annual change. The company has seen robust demand across its portfolio, including multiple best-in-class blockbusters. There is also anticipation building for MariTide, its experimental obesity drug entering phase 3 trials, which could position the company to enter the GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes market.\n\nOn the other hand, Merck faces greater headwinds. Disappointing sales for its Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), alongside uncertainty regarding the looming loss of patent exclusivity for its Keytruda cancer drug, continue to weigh on its stock price. Ultimately, the P/E ratio is a good starting point for further investing research.",

The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of Sept. 23, 2025. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated an extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form and new route of administration for Keytruda.\n\nIn addition, results of a prospective, observational time and motion descriptive analysis conducted alongside study 3475A-D77 show that, compared to IV Keytruda, subcutaneous pembrolizumab reduced time for patients spent in-chair and in the treatment room by 49.7% and 47.4%, respectively, and reduced the total active time spent by healthcare professionals (HCPs) on treatment preparation, administration process and patient monitoring by 45.7%.\n\n\u201cKeytruda has helped transform the treatment of certain cancers, and we continue to pursue innovations that build on this breakthrough medicine to give patients and those who treat them better experiences,\u201d said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cIf approved, we are excited about the potential of subcutaneous pembrolizumab to become a new meaningful treatment option that may increase access and save time needed for administration compared to IV Keytruda.

            "content": "Merck (MRK 0.32%) is a top healthcare company with one of the best drugs ever made in its portfolio: Keytruda. While there are concerns about its patent losses in the future, its sales are still growing. And the company has been working on ways to try and extend its growth into new areas. Plus, other drugs could generate billions more in the future.\n\nDespite this potential, the stock has fallen by 25% in the past 12 months -- so is it a bargain buy right now?\n\nKeytruda's sales rose by 21% last quarter\n\nDuring the last three months of 2024, Merck achieved solid 9% revenue growth (excluding the impact of foreign currency), with its top line hitting $15.6 billion. A big part of that was Keytruda, which brought in $7.8 billion on its own, as it achieved an organic growth rate of 21%. There has been an increase in demand for the drug, as it can help patients battle multiple types of cancers.\n\nBut while its growth has been impressive, the risk is also evident. The drug accounted for half of the company's sales last quarter. Merck is hoping that a new subcutaneous version of the drug (it's currently administered intravenously) could help offset the loss of sales, as its key patent expires in 2028. A new version could have patent protection until 2040, and perhaps even beyond that.\n\nThe big question is, even if successful, whether many patients will opt for the new form of treatment, which may be more convenient, since it wouldn't need to be administered in a hospital setting. But at a lower price, patients may still prefer generic or biosimilar versions of the IV form for the sheer cost savings. It seems inevitable that Keytruda's sales will decline; it's really a question of how much and how quickly.\n\nMerck has other promising treatments in its portfolio\n\nAlthough Keytruda is a huge part of its business, Merck does have other products that can also generate billions in revenue in the future.\n\nGardasil, its vaccine for the human papillomavirus (HPV), may generate $11 billion in revenue by 2030, according to the company's estimates. Demand has, however, been a bit underwhelming of late, particularly in China, which is a key market for the vaccine. But if you believe the company's projections, there could be a few more billion dollars in revenue from this product alone; Gardasil's sales totaled $8.6 billion last year.\n\nAn even more promising blockbuster drug may be Winrevair, which the Food and Drug Administration approved last year as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Analysts believe that it may generate $6 billion in sales by 2029, and that it could also peak at $11 billion. Given that is in its early growth stages, this may have the largest impact on Merck's top line in the years ahead.\n\nThe company has also secured the rights to an experimental weight loss drug for up to $2 billion from Chinese healthcare company Hansoh Pharma. Given how massive the obesity drug market could be, topping $100 billion and more in the future, having an approved weight loss pill could also rake in billions for Merck down the road. While this is more of a long shot at this stage, it's an intriguing development for investors to monitor.\n\nIs Merck's stock worth buying right now?\n\nMerck's stock has been mired in bad news, with concerns around Keytruda and Gardasil's underwhelming performance weighing on its valuation. But to its credit, management is making moves that could offset potential declines in revenue in the future. And with multiple years still to go before Keytruda loses patent protection, all hope is not lost, not by a mile.\n\nThe healthcare stock is trading at a fairly modest 14 times its trailing earnings, and it offers a good margin of safety for investors willing to take a chance on the business. A lot of downside risk is effectively priced into the stock today, which is why it could make for a compelling buy.\n\nWhile there is some uncertainty around Merck, I find the company's pipeline promising, and I think the moves management is making are encouraging ones. And at a cheap price tag, this could indeed prove to be a bargain buy years from now.",

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy, by phone 310-692-8883 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors\u2019 options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck\u2019s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck\u2019s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil\u2019s growth in China.\n\nThe full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China \u201cthrough at least midyear\u201d to facilitate a \u201crapid reduction of inventory.\u201d Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had \u201cnot recovered to the level we had expected.\u201d\n\nFollowing this announcement, Merck\u2019s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025\u2014a decline of more than 9% in just one day.\n\nPlease visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.\n\nThe Portnoy Law Firm represents investors in pursuing claims caused by corporate wrongdoing.

From our bring you Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter, Anjalee Khemlani. So talk to us about what this data showed.\n\n00:12 Anjalee Khemlani\n\nYeah, so this data is for its Phase three for its injectable Keytruda. Now, we know Keytruda and Merk go together. It's one of their biggest selling drugs, really a significant contributor to their revenue, almost 30 billion last year alone. And so what what Merk is trying to do is test a form of the drug in an injection form. Think GLP ones, injectables. And that's not new. We've seen other companies do that like Roche and Bristol Myers Squibb, but we're looking at is Merk getting this product out there in tandem with chemotherapy. Some of the results showed that it is in a specific type of lung cancer, cuts the treatment time in by almost 50% and has the same efficacy as infusion or an IV and chemotherapy. Now, the FDA does have a timeline to decide on whether or not to approve of this drug and that is by September 23rd. Going back to what this could all mean for Merk, number one, we know that the company has a patent cliff for Keytruda that is in 2028. So it could open up longitudinal activity for this company, give them a little bit of a runway for the drug to stay as a profitable piece even though it could cost less because it's an injectable, not an IV. On top of that, there's questions about whether or not this could be helpful with Medicare price negotiations. We know that that has been a topic of interest for a lot of companies looking to maybe see this as a different product, so it doesn't fall under the original product when it goes off patent. So that is one other thing to look for. So analysts are, you know, a little bit of a view. The company has had a few pressure points, some headwinds in the last several months, including Gardasil slowdown in China, so that's been weighing on the stock. And so this came as a bit of good expected, but wanted news.\n\n03:33 Speaker A\n\nAnd expected I assume is why the stock is not getting a pop today because this was broadly in line, perhaps if they actually go through and get that FDA approval, that then would be the catalyst.\n\n03:52 Anjalee Khemlani\n\nAnd an even bigger catalyst is if they get it away from that negotiation, because that is expected for 2026. So Keytruda is likely going to be on the next list.\n\n04:14 Speaker A\n\nAll right. Thank you, Andre.",

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Within this broader timeframe, certain strategic moves contributed to their performance. For instance, Merck expanded its oncology offerings with approvals such as KEYTRUDA for renal cell carcinoma and locally recurrent triple-negative breast cancer, potentially driving revenue during this period. Meanwhile, significant collaborations with companies like Daiichi Sankyo have broadened Merck\u2019s strategic reach in burgeoning treatment areas. The company's manufacturing expansion in North Carolina with a US$1 billion facility indicates robust operational growth, feeding into its long-term strength.\n\nDespite these successes, Merck's performance over the past year saw challenges. The decision to pause GARDASIL shipments to China due to inventory issues marked short-term disruptions. Similarly, regulatory hurdles and stiff competition continue to pressure margins and revenue projections. As a result, Merck underperformed the US market and its pharmaceuticals industry peers, highlighting external challenges that influenced its recent performance trajectory.\n\nClick here to discover the nuances of Merck with our detailed analytical financial health report.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

(\"Merck\" or \"the Company\") (NYSE:MRK) and certain of its officers.\n\nClass Definition\n\nThis lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/MRK .\n\nCase Details\n\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (2) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (3) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.

(\u201cHengrui Pharma\u201d), a global pharmaceutical company focused on scientific and technological innovation, today announced that the companies have entered into an exclusive license agreement for HRS-5346, an investigational oral small molecule Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in China .\n\n\u201cElevated blood concentrations of Lp(a) provides a well-documented risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, affecting as many as 1 in 5 adults globally,\u201d said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cHRS-5346, an investigational oral small molecule inhibitor of Lp(a) formation, is an important addition that expands and complements our cardio-metabolic pipeline.\u201d\n\nUnder the agreement, Hengrui Pharma has granted Merck exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize HRS-5346 worldwide, excluding Greater China region. Hengrui Pharma will receive an upfront payment of $200 million and is eligible to receive milestone payments associated with certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to $1.77 billion , as well as royalties on net sales of HRS-5346, if approved.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with Merck, a global leader in cardiovascular care. We believe Merck\u2019s clinical expertise and global scale will help accelerate the development of HRS-5346 and potentially provide more patients with an additional option to reduce their risk of atherosclerosis,\u201d said Dr. Frank Jiang, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Hengrui Pharma.\n\nClosing of the proposed transaction is subject to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025. Merck expects to record a pre-tax charge of $200 million , or approximately $0.06 per share, to be included in GAAP and non-GAAP results in the quarter the transaction closes.\n\nAbout Lipoprotein(a)\n\nProduced in the liver, lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol, fats and proteins in the blood. Lp(a) can accumulate in blood vessel walls, forming atherosclerotic plaques similar to LDL cholesterol. These plaques can limit blood flow to vital organs and result in conditions such as heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Elevated Lp(a) is a genetically determined condition and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide have elevated levels of Lp(a).\n\nAbout Hengrui Pharma\n\nJiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

            "content": "Early last year, Aurobindo, one of the Defendants* in ANDA litigation against Merck, advanced the proposition that in cases where a patent had been reissued patent term extension (\"PTE\") under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 should be calculated based on the grant date of the reissue patent and not of the \"original\" patent from which the reissue was obtained. The Federal Circuit weighed in on this argument and found it unavailing (at least under the circumstances of these patents) in its Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. v. Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. decision handed down earlier this month.\n\nThe case arose in ANDA litigation between Plaintiffs Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V and Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC and a variety of Defendants over sugammadex (6-per-deoxy-6-per-(2-carboxyethyl)thio-\u03b3-cyclodextrin), the active ingredient in Merck's Bridion drug, which is used to \"assist[] patients' recovery of muscle function after a form of paralysis induced during surgery\":\n\n\n\nThe patent at issue was U.S. Reissue Patent No. RE44,733** having claims expressly reciting the active ingredient and methods of use thereof without cancelling any of the claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,670,340 from which it originated. Importantly, the '340 patent issued on December 30, 2003 and had an original expiration date of January 27, 2021. The reissue patent was granted on January 28, 2014, 686 days before FDA approval on December 15, 2015, and Merck applied for patent term extension (PTE) on the reissue patent. The USPTO granted to RE '733 the maximum PTE of five years (until January 27, 2026) due to nearly 12 years of FDA delay as calculated from the December 30, 2002 grant date of the '340 patent.\n\nDefendants did not challenge Merck's assertion that their generic sugammadex would infringe but instead argued that the portion of the term extending after December 14, 2022 was improperly granted. According to Defendants, the plain meaning interpretation of the statutory language of \u00a7 156(c) regarding proper calculation of PTE was from \"the date the patent issued,\" and because the patent whose term was extended was RE '733, not the '340 patent, the proper length of PTE should be 686 days, not five years (or 1,825 days). Their argument was that the PTO improperly interpreted the statute and they moved that the District Court determine the correct, shorter PTE term based on their statutory interpretation.\n\nMerck argued against Aurobindo's position by relying on \u00a7 251 and \u00a7 252 (regarding the effects of reissue), and \u00a7 156 of the Patent Act, as well as provisions in the MPEP (amended close upon this litigation) at \u00a7 2766:\n\nWith respect to calculating the amount of extension to which the reissued patent is entitled to receive, so long as the original patent claimed the approved product and the reissued patent claims the approved product, the original patent grant date would be used to calculate the extension to which the reissued patent would be entitled.\n\n(which constitutes current Office policy). While the PTO's position was not dispositive, the District Court stated that \"the Court may 'take notice of public reports and filings, such as those prepared by an administrative agency or pursuant to government regulation, to extent they have indicia of authenticity,\" citing In re Plum Baby Food Litig., No. 21-2417, 2022 WL 16552786, at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 31, 2022) (citing Sturgeon v. Pharmerica Corp., 438 F. Supp. 3d 246, 259 (E.D. Pa. 2020)).\n\nThe District Court held that, \"when read in its proper context alongside the provisions of the Patent Act addressing reissues,\" the use by the USPTO of the grant date of the '340 patent instead of the reissue RE '733 patent was proper \"unambiguously,\" inter alia, because it did not create a conflict with either \u00a7 251 or \u00a7 252 regarding the effect and characteristics of reissue applications, was consistent with established USPTO practice, and did not contravene the policy choices evinced by Congress in passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These policy provisions and considerations included that PTE established in the Act \"provides the holders of patents on approved patented products with an extended term of protection under the patent to compensate for the delay in obtaining FDA approval,\" citing Merck & Co., Inc. v. Kessler, 80 F.3d 1543, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The District Court opinion characterized Defendants' position as being \"an untenable reading of the statutory scheme on the whole, creating conflict with various provisions of the Patent Act as well as unintended results.\" And on policy grounds, the opinion asserted that Defendants' \"plain meaning\" of the statute \"would undermine the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act, in contrast to Merck's interpretation, which aligns with it.\" Finally, the opinion held that in the face of an ambiguity the District Court did not recognize but Defendants' contend has arisen in the statute, the District Court held that consistent PTO practice of using the grant date of the original patent deserves deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). This appeal followed.\n\nThe Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's determination that PTE was properly calculated from the grant date of the '340 patent, in an opinion by Judge Dyk joined by Judges Mayer and Reyna (a substantial percentage of which opinion was set forth in extensive footnotes). The panel differed with the parties on the relevant statutory term, stating that it was not the word \"issue\" but rather the term \"the patent\" with regard to which patent's issue date should be used under \u00a7 156(c):\n\nThe term of a patent eligible for extension under subsection (a) shall be extended by the time equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent is issued [.] 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156(c) [ emphasis added].\n\nThe Court agreed with the Patent Office that \u00a7 156(c) is ambiguous with regard to whether it is the original or the reissue patent that is \"the patent.\" Relying on the Supreme Court's opinion in Caraco Pharm. Lab'ys, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 566 U.S. 399, 412 (2012), the Court assessed the meaning of the term by the statutory text in the context in which it is used (wherein in Caraco the Court interpreted the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I))) regarding the distinctions, if there were any, between \"not an\" and \"not any\" for counterclaims a generic drugmaker could raise in ANDA litigation). In Caraco, the Court held that \"[w]ithin [the Hatch-Waxman Act's] framework, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the brand's assertion of rights over whichever discrete use (or uses) the generic company wishes to pursue.\" Here, the panel assessed the statutory meaning with regard to the \"specific\" context in which it was used and the \"broader\" context of the statute \"as a whole,\" citing Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997); Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 393 (2015); and Centripetal Networks, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 38 F.4th 1025, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 2022). That \"broader\" context involved Congressional intent to \"compensate pharmaceutical companies for the effective truncation of their patent terms while waiting for regulatory approval of new drug applications\" according to the opinion, citing Glaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1562, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Merck & Co. v. Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., 482 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2007); PhotoCure ASA v. Kappos, 603 F.3d 1372, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2010); and Merck & Co. v. Kessler.\n\nAccordingly, the opinion states that Congressional purpose was for PTE to be granted to patents (\"and only those patents\") that claimed drugs for which regulatory approval delayed the benefit of patent exclusivity. Finding for Merck, the opinion states, satisfies this Congressional intent, whereas agreeing with Aurobindo would \"den[y] Merck compensation for all but a small period of the delay.\" \"There is no reason why the Hatch-Waxman Act's purpose would be served by disabling extensions of the unexpired term solely based on a patent holder's decision to seek reissue, and Aurobindo offers none,\" according to the panel.\n\nThe opinion addresses Aurobindo's argument that it would be improper statutory construction to use the original patent grant date for calculating PTE term because that original '340 patent was \"dead\" upon reissue, citing case law interpreting the effects of reissue including Seattle Box Co. v. Indus. Crating & Packing, 731 F.2d 818, 827 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and others extending back into the 19th Century. The distinction the Court drew in rejecting this argument was that the status of the original patent was \"irrelevant\" because \"the reissued patent inherits 'the unexpired part of the term of the original patent'\" under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(a) and mentioning that this date is unambiguous (albeit stating in a footnote that the panel did not find the parties' reliance on this portion of the status to be helpful because \"it does not shed any light on the meaning of the term \"the patent'\" ). \"[A] 'reissue patent does not simply replace an original patent nunc pro tunc'\" according to the opinion, citing Intel Corp. v. Negotiated Data Sols., Inc., 703 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\nThe opinion holds further that the panel's conclusion is consistent with \u00a7 156(a) regarding the provision that \"the term of a patent . . . shall be extended . . . from the original expiration date of the patent \" (emphasis added) (stating this is \"the most natural reading\" of this statutory language to refer to the original patent) as well as \u00a7 154(a)(2) regarding calculation of patent term.\n\nThe opinion concludes by acknowledging that the panel's interpretation is also consistent with how the PTO has construed the statute (in the overwhelming number of cases in which the issue has arisen) and, in the face of Aurobindo's argument, expressly revised the MPEP in this regard (consistent with the Court's assessment of the Hatch-Waxman statutory scheme).\n\n* The complete roster of ANDA defendants before the District Court in consolidated actions were Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; Aurobindo Pharma, Ltd.; Eugia Pharma Specialties Ltd.; Gland Pharma Ltd.; Mankind Pharma Ltd.; Lifestar Pharma LLC; Mylan API US LLC; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Sandoz Inc.; LekcPharmaceuticals d.d.; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC; Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ltd.; and USV Private Ltd.\n\n\n\n** In a footnote, the panel noted that Merck filed its reissue application only after the Federal Circuit held that the addition of narrower claims could provide a proper basis for a reissue filing, in In re Tanaka, 640 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\n\nMerck Sharp & Dohme B.V. v. Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. (Fed. Cir. 2025)\n\nPanel: Circuit Judges Dyk, Mayer, and Reyna\n\nOpinion by Circuit Judge Dyk\n\n[View source.]",

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China.

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

MRK between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

The broader market index rose 0.64%, blue-chip stocks gained 0.85%, and the NASDAQ Composite, still in correction territory, closed 0.31% higher.\n\nEarly Tuesday, stocks began to decline again as investors focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting starting today. The key announcement for traders will come Wednesday when the Fed announces its interest rate decision, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Since September, the Fed has cut interest rates three times and still, the broader market entered a correction.\n\nDespite uncertainty from President Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies and geopolitical strategies, some analysts remain optimistic about AI\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe retain our view that there is more to go in stocks, and we keep our conviction in the long-term opportunities in stocks linked to both the artificial intelligence and power and resources transformational innovations,\u201d UBS chief investment office said in a note Monday, according to CNBC.\n\nAmid turbulence and uncertainty on Wall Street, looking at recent insider trades can provide valuable insights, as executives often have a deeper understanding of their companies. For example, when a CEO or CFO buys company stock, it may indicate strong confidence in the business\u2019s future.\n\nHowever, insider selling doesn\u2019t always signal a lack of confidence. It could be due to personal financial needs or a desire to diversify investments. These sales are often made through pre-arranged plans, like 10b5-1 plans, to avoid any appearance of improper timing.\n\nWhile insider activity can be informative, it\u2019s important to consider it alongside the company\u2019s financial health, market trends, and industry developments.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener to analyze recent trading activities in several popular stocks. For each stock, we noted the number of insiders who recently acquired shares and the company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit.\n\nCLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:\n\nhttps://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137388&wire=4\n\nMRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email\n\nat [email protected] or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\" Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \"not recovered to the level we had expected.\" Following this news, Merck's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck's stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.\n\nWHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMerck will close its pharmaceuticals plant in Riverside, Pennsylvania, next year, with plans to conduct phased layoffs affecting a total of 163 workers, a spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe health care company will conduct its first and second rounds of job cuts May 16 - May 30 and June 23 - July 7, according to a Pennsylvania Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification . A final round is scheduled for 2026.\n\nThe site\u2019s performance was not a factor in Merck\u2019s decision, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of global media relations, said in an email. The company continuously assesses its operations and evolving business needs, Ehrbar added.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe upcoming layoffs and impending closure of Merck\u2019s Cherokee Pharamaceuticals plant in Riverside are part of delayed plans that were initially announced in 2022.\n\nAround that time, the facility employed 300 workers and was scheduled to end production of its active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2024, BioSpace reported.\n\nMerck declined to say why the closure was delayed. The company said it will continue to support employees at the site through the transition and provide severance benefits.\n\nMerck has several manufacturing and supply locations across the United States, including in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia and Nebraska, according to its website. Recently, the company opened a new $1 billion vaccine manufacturing site in Durham, North Carolina, as part of a domestic expansion effort.\n\n\u201cMerck remains committed to Pennsylvania and employs approximately 14,000 people in the state,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nIts largest pharmaceutical manufacturing site is in West Point, Pennsylvania, located just outside of Philadelphia and spanning 400 acres. Merck has invested more than $3 billion in its Pennsylvania operations to date, according to the company.\n\nThe Riverside location, located off the Susquehanna River, has dealt with groundwater contamination issues over the years and affected some nearby residential wells, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Merck completed a clean-up plan to address contamination areas and concerns in 2008, and since then the facility has monitored groundwater and maintained the remediation system.\n\nPrior to Merck\u2019s ownership of the site, Heyden Chemical Company leased the site from the U.S. government to produce hexane for munitions during World War II.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other incredibly cheap dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nValue investing has long been a preferred strategy among investors, largely influenced by Warren Buffett, who continues to seek out stocks he believes are trading below their intrinsic value. While growth stocks have recently captured more market attention, value stocks have demonstrated strong long-term performance.\n\nInvestment experts such as Josef Lakonishok and David Dreman have emphasized the importance of patience and a disciplined approach, arguing that steady, well-researched investments often yield better results than chasing rapid growth. Their research suggests that value investing outperforms growth strategies about 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. Examining businesses across different market capitalizations, they found that, over extended periods, value stocks consistently delivered average annual returns exceeding 7%, outperforming their growth counterparts.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dividend Contenders List: Top 15\n\nLowell Miller\u2019s book, Single Best Investment, explored the principles of value investing, drawing on the research of Fama and French published in the Journal of Finance. The book explained that when a growth stock fails to meet investors\u2019 high expectations, its price often experiences a steep drop as the market reassesses its true worth. On the other hand, value stocks, which typically start with lower expectations, have the potential to surpass forecasts, leading to upward price adjustments. However, the book also underscored the importance of diversification, cautioning against concentrating too much capital on a single investment. Historically, a well-diversified portfolio has proven to be a safer strategy for investors.\n\nA report by BlackRock highlighted that value stocks can provide stability in volatile market conditions. This was evident during the 2022 market downturn when growth stocks suffered heavy losses, while value stocks experienced comparatively smaller declines. By nature, value stocks tend to trade at lower price levels than growth stocks, though the size of this discount has fluctuated over time.\n\nMarket analysis suggests that value stock valuations would need to rise by over 40% to return to their historical median, signaling potential upside if they regain investor favor. With growth stocks trading at high valuations, investors may increasingly shift their focus toward value stocks, particularly as the market broadens beyond mega-cap companies. While past performance does not guarantee future outcomes, history provides some perspective. BlackRock noted that the last time the valuation gap between the Russell Growth and Russell Value indexes was as wide as it is today\u2014back in December 2000\u2014value stocks went on to outperform growth stocks over the subsequent one-, three-, and five-year periods.",

(MRK), known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada, will present new clinical and outcomes research at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session - ACC.25 in Chicago from March 29-31.\n\nThe data highlights advancements in cardiovascular disease research, evaluating approved treatments and opportunities for improved disease management.\n\nOne of the key presentations includes results from the Phase 3 ZENITH trial evaluating WINREVAIR (sotatercept-csrk) for pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH patients at high risk of mortality. The findings will be shared in a late-breaking session on March 31. According to Dr. Eliav Barr, Merck has been committed to cardiovascular research for over 60 years, and the ZENITH trial's interim results were strong enough to conclude the study early due to overwhelming efficacy.\n\nMerck will also present four studies on cholesterol management. These include analyses of real-world data on healthcare utilization for dyslipidemia treatment and LDL-C measurement patterns, as well as a model estimating the impact of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) on clinical and economic outcomes. Dr. Bjorn Oddens stated that nearly two-thirds of individuals fail to meet LDL-C goals, and the research aims to identify gaps and improve patient management.\n\nKey data at ACC.25 includes results from the Phase 3 ZENITH trial on WINREVAIR\u2122 for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in high-risk patients (LBA402-16), a meta-analysis on residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in statin users (1062-36), and an analysis of real-world LDL-C measurement frequency and patient characteristics (1062-19). Additionally, research will cover the economic impact of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) on the U.S. health system (977-03) and an evaluation of healthcare resource use and treatment patterns among adults on LLT (977-15).\n\nAdditional studies will cover heart failure therapy optimization, the burden of PAH on women, and economic evaluations of ASCVD treatment patterns.\n\nWINREVAIR, approved by the FDA for PAH treatment, improves vascular function and reduces clinical worsening events. The therapy is licensed from Bristol Myers Squibb. Safety concerns include risks of thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, serious bleeding, and fetal harm, requiring close monitoring and contraceptive use during treatment.\n\nMerck has a long-standing commitment to cardiovascular research, continuously advancing treatment options. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and Merck aims to drive innovation to improve patient outcomes.\n\nMRK is currently trading at $94.08 or 0.68% lower on the NYSE.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "The bioprocessing industry, and many others, focus on working smarter\u2014perhaps now more than ever.\n\n\u201cSmart manufacturing represents an industry-wide paradigm shift in how companies design, make, and distribute products, from lifesaving medicines to cutting-edge electronics,\u201d says Michelangelo Canzoneri, PhD, who serves as the global head of group smart manufacturing at Merck KGaA, based in Darmstadt, Germany. \u201cIn our case, it\u2019s set to drive a profound transformation across the industrial landscape, unlocking far-reaching advantages, and that resonates throughout all companies, including the supply chains, and ultimately it will benefit people, patients, and our whole planet.\u201d\n\nBuilding such a global impact, though, depends on implementing changes in many areas.\n\n\u201cThe journey from traditional MANUfacturing to SMARTfacturing represents transformation of all operations by integrating advanced digital technologies, [information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT)] convergence, and AI-driven intelligence with established process and analytical methods. This shift enables us to address current challenges while proactively preparing for future disruptions,\u201d Canzoneri tells GEN.\n\nIn an era of rapidly changing market conditions, SMARTfacturing must be highly adaptive.\n\n\u201cWe envision a future of modular, reconfigurable factories capable of dynamically adjusting production processes, product designs, and logistics in response to shifting demands,\u201d continues Canzoneri. \u201cThese intelligent facilities feature reconfigurable production lines composed of adaptive robotic systems, flexible automation cells, and self-diagnosing machines that can optimize energy and resource utilization.\u201d\n\nFor example, equipment in a SMARTfacturing facility can predict maintenance needs and seamlessly collaborate with supply-chain networks in real time.\n\nMerck KGaA has developed a SMARTfacturing vision ecosystem, which is a structured, multi-layered framework integrating advanced and modular manufacturing technologies, data-driven decision-making, and automation/robotics. This SMARTfacturing model provides a holistic view of transformation in operations, defining the why, what, and how behind the company\u2019s strategy, explains Canzoneri.\n\nAt the core of this vision is a holistic control tower, enabling decision intelligence through AI, real-time data insights, and predictive analytics. This digital backbone allows Merck KGaA to optimize manufacturing, logistics, and supply-chain processes, which unlocks new opportunities in product innovation, sourcing strategies, and data-sharing, according to Canzoneri.\n\n\u201cAccessing data in a systematic way enables a deeper understanding of challenges and the ability to drive meaningful improvements,\u201d he says. \u201cOur approach is centered on addressing critical business challenges\u2014both existing and emerging\u2014while continuously enhancing our processes and solutions.\u201d\n\nThis transformation is supported by key technology enablers, including process science and technology, connected industrial equipment (convergence of IT and OT), and engineering and automation, underpinned by quality, regulatory compliance, IT/OT cybersecurity, and workforce readiness. By integrating these elements, Merck KGaA aims to be a major player in shaping the future of smart, data-driven, and sustainable manufacturing.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, the manufacturing industry in general made big strides in the transition from predigital to adaptive plants. \u201cThings are moving quite fast,\u201d Canzoneri says. There are many good reasons to continue this transition. For example, Canzoneri points out that SMARTfacturing could decrease maintenance costs by 25% and increase labor productivity by 90% based on industry benchmarks.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge is building a solid digital foundation to ensure fast scaling and quick adoption of SMARTfacturing capabilities. This foundational work is crucial before advancing to more complex digital capabilities and implementations. \u201cOnce this foundation is in place,\u201d explains Canzoneri, \u201cyou can fully leverage AI, automation, and data-driven insights to accelerate time to impact and innovation.\u201d\n\nAlthough going from predigital to SMARTfacturing takes time and investment, the process pays off, he says, adding that the company\u2019s commitment to SMARTfacturing is more than an operational shift; it\u2019s a long-term investment in industrial excellence and sustainability.\n\n\u201cScaling the adoption of SMARTfacturing will not only enhance operational resilience but also enable us to deliver innovative solutions faster, with greater precision and sustainability,\u201d Canzoneri concludes. \u201cUltimately, this transformation benefits our customers, patients, and the planet.\u201d",

            "content": "Merck made meaningful regulatory and clinical progress in 2024 across areas like oncology (mainly Keytruda), vaccines and infectious diseases while executing strategic business moves like the acquisitions of Eyebiotech Limited and Harpoon Therapeutics. In 2024, Merck also acquired a next-generation CD3xCD19 bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases from a private biotech called Curon Biopharmaceutical and signed license agreements with Chinese biotechs, Hansoh and LaNova.\n\nMerck is also developing a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda that can extend its patent life.\n\nMerck is working on different strategies to drive Keytruda's long-term growth. These include innovative immuno-oncology combinations, including Keytruda with LAG3 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. In partnership with Moderna MRNA, Merck is developing a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine (V940/mRNA-4157) in combination with Keytruda for patients with certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The companies are conducting pivotal phase III studies on V940, in combination with Keytruda, for earlier-stage and adjuvant NSCLC and adjuvant melanoma.\n\nKeytruda\u2019s sales are gaining from rapid uptake across earlier-stage indications, mainly early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Continued strong momentum in metastatic indications is also boosting sales growth. The company expects continued growth from Keytruda, particularly in early lung cancer.\n\nMerck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with blockbuster PD-L1 inhibitor Keytruda being the key top-line driver. Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounts for around 50% of the company\u2019s pharmaceutical sales. The drug has played an instrumental role in driving Merck\u2019s steady revenue growth in the past few years.\n\nThe decline in Merck\u2019s stock price and market value has left investors confused about whether to buy, hold or sell MRK stock. Let\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play Merck stock.\n\nWith a weak fourth-quarter earnings report in February along with an unimpressive guidance for 2025, Merck began the year on a dismal note\n\nThe numerous challenges plaguing the company resulted in the dilution of the stock\u2019s market value. Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and persistent challenges for its human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil in China remain overhangs. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to successfully navigate the loss of exclusivity period for its blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and potential competition for Keytruda.\n\nThe stock of Merck MRK has declined 19.2% in the past six months, losing almost $52 billion of its market value\n\nStory Continues\n\nMerck's phase III pipeline has almost tripled over the past three years, positioning it well to launch several new vaccines and drugs over the next five years, with many having blockbuster potential. Merck\u2019s new 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Capvaxive, and Winrevair have the potential to generate significant revenues for Merck over the long term. Both the products are witnessing a strong launch.\n\nMerck has other promising candidates in its late-stage pipeline, such as MK-0616, an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, tulisokibart, a TL1A inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Daiichi-Sankyo-partnered antibody-drug conjugates. A regulatory application seeking approval for clesrovimab, its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in June.\n\nMRK\u2019s Keytruda Faces Patent Expiration in 2028\n\nMerck is heavily reliant on Keytruda. Though Keytruda may be Merck\u2019s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that the company is excessively dependent on the drug and it should look for ways to diversify its product lineup.\n\nThere are rising concerns about the firm\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of the upcoming loss of exclusivity of Keytruda in 2028.\n\nAlso, competitive pressure might increase for Keytruda in the near future. In 2024, Summit Therapeutics SMMT reported positive data from a phase III study (conducted in China by partner Akeso) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, in which its lead pipeline candidate, ivonescimab, a dual PD-1 and VEGF inhibitor, outperformed Keytruda. Summit believes iivonescimab has the potential to replace Keytruda as the next standard of care across multiple NSCLC settings.\n\nDeclining Sales of Gardasil in China\n\nSales of Gardasil, which is Merck\u2019s second-largest product, declined 3% in 2024 due to a weak performance in China, which resulted from sluggish demand trends amid an economic slowdown. Lower demand in China resulted in above-normal channel inventory levels at Merck\u2019s commercialization partner in China, Zhifei. Accordingly, Merck has decided to temporarily halt shipments of Gardasil in China from February through at least mid-year 2025 to allow Zhifei to burn down existing inventory.\n\nGiven the economic conditions in China, Merck withdrew its previously issued long-term guidance of generating more than $11 billion in sales from Gardasil by 2030. However, Gardasil sales remain strong in almost every major region outside China, including the United States.\n\nMerck is also seeing weakness in the diabetes franchise and the generic erosion of some drugs.\n\nMRK Stock Price, Valuation & Estimates\n\nMerck\u2019s shares have lost 23.5% in the past year compared with a decrease of 4.3% for the industry. The stock has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 Index, as seen in the chart below. The stock is also trading below its 200-day moving average.\n\nMerck Stock Underperforms Industry, Sector & S&P 500\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Merck appears attractive relative to the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 10.30 forward earnings, lower than 16.85 for the industry as well as its 5-year mean of 13.18.\n\nMRK Stock Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $9.44 to $9.01 per share over the past 60 days, while that for 2026 has declined from $10.32 to $9.89 per share over the same timeframe.\n\nMRK Estimate Movement\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShort-Term Investors May Consider Selling MRK Stock\n\nMerck has one of the world\u2019s best-selling drugs in its portfolio, generating billions of dollars in revenues. Though Keytruda will lose patent exclusivity in 2028, its sales are expected to remain strong until then.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s problems are too many at present, including persistent challenges for Gardasil in China, potential competition for Keytruda and a bearish outlook for 2025. Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $64.1-$65.6 billion in 2025, indicating year-over-year growth in the range of 2% to 4% (excluding currency headwinds). However, the guidance fell short of expectations. Consistently declining estimates also reflect analysts\u2019 pessimistic outlook for the stock.\n\nAll these factors have raised doubts about Merck\u2019s ability to navigate the Keytruda loss of exclusivity period successfully.\n\nWe believe investors with a long-term horizon should stay invested in MRK stock due to its strong fundamentals. However, short-term investors should consider selling this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock as the company may take some time to recover.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other most undervalued biotech stocks to invest in.\n\nTrump\u2019s Tariffs and the Pharma Sector\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss Trump\u2019s tariffs and their effects on the American pharma sector. Although he was unsure of the intention behind these tariffs, he opined that the pharma industry was not all that special when compared to verticals such as industrials and technology, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nThe tariffs thus encompass the grander plan surrounding how the pharmaceutical industry fits into scaling up domestic manufacturing. A majority of pharma and biotech companies have a significant presence in the US. However, some questions still stand, such as whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America.\n\nHolz was unclear about the answers to these questions, but he believed that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. Further discussing the scenario, he said that boosting manufacturing facilities and capacities from scratch is not an easy endeavor, as it takes considerable years to reach a point where companies can domestically produce at a high rate. Therefore, the impact of tariffs on the production capacity and on-shoring of pharma companies remains fuzzy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 11 Best Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe further discussed the potential impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs and the performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on the 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

            "content": "Merck (MRK) ended the recent trading session at $94.02, demonstrating a -0.74% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.92%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.41%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the pharmaceutical company had gained 13.72% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's gain of 0.21% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.26% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Merck in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.16, reflecting a 4.35% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $15.75 billion, reflecting a 0.16% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nMRK's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.01 per share and revenue of $65.19 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +17.78% and +1.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Merck. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.04% downward. Merck presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nInvestors should also note Merck's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 10.51. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 14.82 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that MRK currently trades at a PEG ratio of 0.83. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry stood at 1.32 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 69, finds itself in the top 28% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow MRK in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Michael Cuggino, President and Portfolio Manager of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 and began discussing his fund\u2019s performance. Despite a challenging market environment, his fund achieved a 4% return this year, which he attributed to diversification rather than reliance on a single asset class like gold. The portfolio includes gold, silver, diversified equities, and bonds. When asked about market reactions to tariff-related headlines, Cuggino emphasized the importance of not overreacting to daily news fluctuations. He described the market\u2019s behavior as herky-jerky and advised investors to focus on long-term opportunities rather than reacting impulsively. His base case anticipated some turbulence due to the transition under the new administration\u2019s economic policies. His strategy involves identifying opportunities during volatile periods rather than making significant portfolio changes.\n\nThe discussion also featured David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, who provided insights on Washington\u2019s role in market volatility. Zervos acknowledged that while policies such as tariffs, immigration reforms, and drug policies were largely unfolding as expected, the speed of changes under the current administration was surprising investors. He pointed out rapid spending cuts and layoffs in the public sector as key contributors to market unease. For instance, courts recently ordered the federal government to rehire probationary employees who had been dismissed. Zervos likened this abrupt shift to transitioning from a public-sector-reliant economy to one driven by the private sector, which is a process that has introduced significant uncertainty. Regarding tariffs specifically, Zervos downplayed their overall impact on the US economy, which he described as domestically driven. While tariffs could affect specific industries like wine or automobiles with high overseas components, he argued that broader economic trends would be shaped by deregulation, reduced business costs, and a shift toward private-sector efficiency. He warned that the speed of these transitions could lead to short-term volatility but maintained optimism about long-term productivity gains.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top S&P 500 stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other profitable value stocks to buy now.\n\nMatt Powers, Managing Partner at Powers Advisory Group, joined the discussion on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Power Lunch\u2019 on March 11 to provide insights into the shift from growth to value investing and the resurgence of traditional dividend strategies. Powers emphasized that this transition has become increasingly evident, particularly following last week\u2019s market activity and the events of March 10. He noted that while the market behavior on March 11 might tell a slightly different story, the broader trend is unmistakable. For years, growth stocks dominated portfolios, but now investors are gravitating toward value and dividend investing, which had been largely overlooked for over a decade. Powers attributed this shift to various catalysts, which included tariffs and policy uncertainty from Washington and President Trump\u2019s unpredictable stances. He described investors as exhausted, and welcomed the normalization of equity markets and a return to diversification and traditional investing.\n\nPowers highlighted the importance of diversification, contrasting high-growth portfolios with those focused on dividends. He pointed out that ETFs have outperformed large-cap growth funds year-to-date, with a notable 11-point difference in returns. The dividend fund is up 5%, while the large-cap growth fund is down 6%. He explained that tech stocks dominate large-cap growth funds and account for nearly half of their portfolios. In contrast, dividend-focused funds are more diversified across sectors such as healthcare, financials, and staples. This diversification reduces concentration risk and provides defensive characteristics in an uncertain market environment. Powers elaborated on the leadership shift between these two types of funds. While growth ETFs feature holdings like the MAG7, dividend ETFs focus on blue-chip companies. A year ago, growth stocks were investor favorites, but now value stocks are taking the lead, which is a trend reflected in their performance. He stressed the importance of broadening diversification within portfolios and not ignoring value opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15.

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.65%) is one of the most-watched stock indexes on Wall Street. Its list of components is rather small; that small list, however, means these are cherry-picked companies that are both large and highly important businesses.\n\nIt makes sense for dividend investors to use the Dow Jones as a shortcut for finding high-yield stocks. But are the highest-yielding stocks in the index today worth buying? Here's a look at the top three.\n\n1. Verizon is a reliable high-yield stock with a lot of debt\n\nThe big draw with telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) is a dividend that yields 6.2% at recent prices. That's way above the 1.2% yield you would collect from the S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%), which is probably the most monitored stock index in the world. Also attractive is the fact that Verizon has increased its dividend annually for more than two decades.\n\nThere's just one small problem, and that's its balance sheet.\n\nVerizon's debt-to-equity ratio is 1.45. That's well above the 1.18 for AT&T (T 1.88%), its closest peer, and the 1.28 for T-Mobile US (TMUS -1.20%), the next most important competitor in the U.S. cellphone market.\n\nThis matters because building a cellular network is a very expensive process and requires constant upgrading to keep pace with the competition. Large capital investments are the norm, and Verizon's more leveraged balance sheet puts it at a disadvantage compared to peers.\n\nThis ends up being a risk/reward call. With roughly 57% of Verizon's free cash flow going to dividends in 2024, it's very likely the company can keep supporting that lofty yield and growing its payout, slowly, over time. But if you do buy it, you'll want to keep close tabs on the company's leverage, just in case.\n\n2. Chevron's yield is attractive in a volatile sector\n\nNext up is Chevron (CVX 2.22%) and its 4.5% dividend yield. Being an integrated energy giant means the company's business stretches from upstream operations (drilling for oil and natural gas), to midstream (pipelines), and all the way to downstream (chemicals and refining). This diversification helps to soften the highs and lows within the highly volatile energy sector.\n\nThe most notable feat achieved by Chevron, however, is probably its 37-year streak of annual dividend increases. That's the proof that its business model is capable of surviving even the most harrowing swings in oil and natural gas prices while rewarding dividend investors.\n\nOnce again, its balance sheet plays an important role, but this time it's because Chevron has very little leverage. That allows management to add debt during the lean times to support its business and dividend.\n\nWhen the oil market recovers, which it always has historically, management pays down debt to prepare for the next downturn. If you are looking for a dividend-paying energy stock, Chevron is a good all-weather choice with an attractive yield.\n\n3. Merck is a fine business, but it has been cheaper\n\nMerck (MRK -0.15%) is one of the largest drugmakers. It produces some of the world's most important medications, including in the fields of oncology, vaccinations, cardiovascular disease, and animal health.\n\nWith $64.2 billion in sales in 2024, Merck is clearly a dominant force in healthcare. And its dividend yield is an attractive 3.4%. It would be hard to suggest that investors would want to avoid this stock.\n\nIn fact, looking at traditional valuation metrics, its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are both below their five-year averages. And while the dividend hasn't been increased every single year, it has trended higher steadily over time. A good company at a good price: What's not to like?\n\nThe answer is that the dividend yield is actually only about average compared to the stock's long-term range. It probably wouldn't be a mistake for dividend investors to buy Merck today, but if income is your goal, it has been far more attractive in the past. You might want to watch it and wait for more of a market dislocation, when investors have a tendency to throw the babies out with the bathwater.\n\nBuy all three high-yield Dow stocks?\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no company here that investors should be so worried about that they couldn't buy it right now.\n\nVerizon's debt needs to be monitored, but it has deftly managed its balance sheet for years. Chevron operates in a volatile sector, but has proved to be a long-term survivor and reliable dividend payer. And while Merck's yield has been higher in the past -- which may keep some investors on the sidelines today -- it doesn't appear that it would be a mistake to buy the attractively valued stock, either.",

            "content": "Chinese drug maker Akeso, whose new cancer drug has outperformed a leading Western peer in clinical studies, is being hailed as the \"DeepSeek moment\" for China's drug industry, as biotech emerges as a new front in the escalating US-China tech war.\n\nAkeso's new immunotherapy drug targeting non-small cell lung cancer, called ivonescimab, allowed half of its patients to go 11.1 months without their condition worsening, a metric known as median progression-free survival (PFS), according to phase 3 clinical trial results the company published in The Lancet last week.\n\nThe median PFS for pembrolizumab - the world's most popular cancer drug, sold by US pharmaceutical giant Merck under the brand name Keytruda - was 5.8 months by comparison, the study said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAkeso, which first unveiled the findings in September last year at an international industry conference, garnered increased attention in China recently after a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference introduced ivonescimab at the \"two sessions\" last week.\n\nMedia outlets have referred to Akeso's cancer drug development as the Chinese biotech industry's \"DeepSeek moment\". Last month, Chinese start-up DeepSeek shocked the global tech industry with its high performance artificial intelligence (AI) models developed at a much lower cost than its peers.\n\nThe breakthrough was seen as a sign of resilience by China's tech industry under tight US restrictions on AI chips.\n\nAkeso's global innovation centre in Shanghai.

Photo: Handout>\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIvonescimab is a type of immunotherapy known as PD-1 inhibitors, which are antibodies that help the immune system recognise and kill cancer cells.\n\nIf the Akeso drug's efficacy is validated in more upcoming clinical tests, it means that China has gone from lagging behind the US by five years in the PD-1 field to leading by three years, Chinese venture capital fund Frees Fund wrote in a research report published on Wednesday.\n\nAkeso was founded in 2012 in Zhongshan, a city in China's southern Guangdong province.\n\nThe company kicked off with a 20 million yuan (US$2.76 million) angel investment, and received rent subsidies and equipment support from the local government, founder and CEO Michelle Xia said in an interview with Hong Kong online outlet Speakout HK in 2021.\n\nXia held senior positions at Western pharmaceutical companies including Bayer and Crown Bioscience before returning to China and establishing Akeso.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nXia decided to start a drug discovery venture because China had virtually no pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs at the time, and it would take eight to 10 years for newly launched foreign innovative drugs to reach Chinese patients, and even then at high prices, according to the transcript of a speech Xia gave at her alma mater Sun Yat-sen University in June last year.\n\nAkeso went public in Hong Kong in April 2020, with its HK$2.58 billion (US$330 million) offering oversubscribed 639 times.\n\nThe company, with several other cancer drugs in the pipeline, has licensed ivonescimab to US firm Summit Therapeutics for development and commercialisation in global markets in a US$5 billion deal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The pharmaceutical industry is no stranger to illegal practices and scandals involving shady businesses, leading to more money. Some of the largest drug companies have faced backlash for price hikes, lying to the public and FDA, unsavory business practices, and misleading data. Here are ten of the largest pharmaceutical scandals.\n\nRelated: 10 Business Scandals So Big They Shook the Economy\n\n10 Pfizer Celebrex Scandal\n\nCelebrex study shows less risk to heart health than expected\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nIn 2012, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was cherry-picking safety data for Celebrex. A lawsuit against the company revealed that research executives falsely represented data to fool the medical community about how effective the anti-arthritis drug was. The one-year study showed that Celebrex was no safer than other anti-inflammatory drugs. Still, the six-month data from the same study showed that the drug was safer on the stomach. Researchers promoted the six-month data to claim that the drug was superior to others, such as ibuprofen.\n\nDocuments revealed emails between researchers and executives that prove Pfizer officials used strategic decisions to make the data appear better. Celebrex was one of the most profitable drugs from Pfizer, but the company was forced to pay out more than $164 million to settle an investor class action lawsuit. The company still denied any wrongdoing.[1]\n\n9 EpiPen Scandal\n\nEpiPen Price Increase: Scandal Or Just Business?\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe EpiPen has literally been a lifesaver for many people suffering from a deadly allergic reaction. The product only cost Mylan about $1 to manufacture an EpiPen two-pack, but the company took advantage of the vital product. They decided to raise the price from $100 to more than $600 for consumers.\n\nIn their first five years of owning EpiPen, Mylan spent almost $8 million in lobbying to make their product mandatory in schools, and soon it was permitted or required in most states. Then, they lobbied to make a law that gave financial incentives to states requiring EpiPen. Once the government was on the hook, Mylan continued to raise the price until it toppled $600.\n\nAn investigation was launched into the large price hike, but Mylan defended the increase due to improvements made to the product. Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to resolve claims that the company avoided paying rebates owed primarily to Medicaid by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic drug.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Merck Vioxx Scandal\n\nThe Vioxx Scandal: Merck\u2019s Release of New Drug Despite Knowing Its Dangers to Users | SLICE EXPERTS\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nVioxx was a popular drug used to reduce pain and inflammation, and Merck, its manufacturer, had hoped to prove that the anti-inflammatory drug would reign superior over other similar drugs. The drug appeared to be doing its intended job, but studies revealed it was linked to an increase in strokes and heart attacks. The studies eventually led to a voluntary recall of the drug.\n\nThe FDA approved the drug in 1999 after data showed a low risk of cardiovascular illness. Studies then began showing the risks that Vioxx was having on patients, but Merck continued to claim that the studies were flawed. The FDA failed to act after seeing proof of the dangers the drug was causing, leading to rumors that Merck and the FDA were covering up potential health concerns. The disaster eventually led to fines and lawsuits.[3]\n\n7 Rochester Drug Cooperatives Opioid Scandal\n\nFeds: Fmr. Rochester drug company execs kept selling opioids to shady pharmacies\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe opioid epidemic centers on the rapid increase in abuse and overdose deaths attributed to drugs classified as opioids. Opioids are highly effective for treating pain, but they pose a risk of being addictive and could lead to overdose deaths. More than 600,000 Americans died from opioid use from 1999 to 2021. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors were blamed by the government for their role in fueling the epidemic, and soon, they would pay for their roles.\n\nRochester Drug Cooperative (RDC), a pharmaceutical wholesale distributor, was the first to be accused of drug trafficking as part of the opioid crisis. They were accused of shipping massive amounts of highly addictive drugs to pharmacies that they knew were illegally dispensing them. RDC admitted to drug trafficking and was soon shut down and declared bankruptcy.\n\nLaurence Doud, CEO of RDC, was later sentenced to 27 months in prison for his role in the crisis. The U.S. attorney claimed that Doud cared more about his paycheck than preventing opioids from making their way to people struggling with addiction.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Valeant Scandal\n\nThe Valeant Fraud Explained\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nValeant rightfully received anger from everyone over the dramatic drug price hikes at its firms, and this led to a federal prosecutor\u2019s investigation into the way the company priced and distributed its drugs. The price of drugs such as Isuprel, Isoprenaline, and Nitropress was rising before Valeant purchased them, but they then boosted Isuprel by six-fold and Nitropress four-fold after acquiring them.\n\nIn 2016, former executives Gary Tanner and Andrew Davenport were charged with running kickback schemes, and they were accused of conspiring to set up Philidor as a place to distribute their drugs. Former CEO Michael Pearson was investigated for possible fraud earlier in the year. Valeant has always conducted business in a shady manner, and price gauging their customers was only a piece of the pie.[5]\n\n5 Questcor Price Hike Scandal\n\nBig Pharma Greed Knows No Bounds As Infant Medication Increases By Nearly 100000%\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nQuestcor Pharmaceuticals is responsible for one of the largest drug price hikes in American history. Two whistleblowers from the company claimed that Questcor bribed doctors to increase sales of its drugs. The strategy was to help boost the sales of H.P. Acthar Gel, a drug that is known for treating a rare infant seizure disorder. The $40 vial of the medication in 2000 rose to around $39,000 in less than 10 years, almost a 97,000% increase.\n\nThe whistleblowers revealed that the company did everything from lying to the Food and Drug Administration to offering bribes if it led to more sales. The price increase led to more than $1 billion in annual sales for Questcor. About 25% of Acthar sales went through Medicare, and revenue from Medicare went from about $50 million in 2011 to $725 million by 2018. Not only were they hiking the price for individuals, but they were also robbing the government.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Merck MMR Scandal\n\nMarch 9, 2025 Cover Story MMR Whistleblower\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nThe MMR vaccine protects against Measles, Mumps, and Rubella and is usually administered in two doses to infants and young children in America. The MMR vaccine by Merck has also quietly been part of a scandal for the past 25 years. Merck faced a potential product recall of the vaccine in 1999 because the product might have been defective. The problem arose when the FDA found a potency issue with the vaccine. The live virus in the vaccine that makes the shot work was dying off due to the vaccine sitting on shelves for too long.\n\nMerck started \u201coverfilling\u201d by putting more of the virus into the vaccine to hope it would last longer, but the virus was still dying off too fast. The FDA hit Merck with two warnings for failing to report vaccine doses that might not meet potency requirements.\n\nLab workers for the company said they were told to change the date for it to look better. They ultimately filed a whistleblower lawsuit for taxpayer fraud. The case dragged on for years but was later dismissed before trial. Merck has denied any wrongdoing, but questions have been raised about whether the vaccine\u2019s potency has led to outbreaks among vaccinated people.[7]\n\n3 Roche Fraud Scandal\n\nRoche Obesity Pill Study: What Are the Side Effects of the Weight-Loss Drug?\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nRoche Pharmaceutical Group failed to properly report thousands of potential side effects that led to illnesses and death. The European Commission investigated allegations that the drug company failed to provide accurate details on the side effects of 19 medications. The initial reports showed that Roche could have been fined around $685 million for failure to report.\n\nAfter years of inspections, the European Commission closed the case after Roche worked diligently to remediate the deficiencies quickly and enhance their medical compliance. Even though the outcome was expected to be worse for the company, thousands of deaths may still be linked to the company for hiding their side effects.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Abilify Scandal\n\nAbilify: The Drug That Seriously Harms Your Impulse Control Center\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company were collaborative partners in the development and commercialization of Abilify, an antipsychotic medication used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. An investigation by 43 states was launched to look into the marketing of Abilify for off-label uses. They alleged that Bristol-Myers Squibb promoted the drug for unapproved uses, especially for elderly patients with dementia.\n\nA medication guide from Otsuka stated that the medication could produce an increased risk of death in elderly people with dementia. Bristol-Myers Squibb denied any wrongdoing, but they did agree to marketing restraints. The company also paid $19.5 million to settle the allegations that they promoted Abilify for unapproved uses and misled doctors about the potential dangers of the antipsychotic medication.[9]\n\n1 Pharma Bro Scandal\n\nMartin Shkreli: The Pharma Bro Scandal \u2013 Greed, Controversy & Justice\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nOne of the most well-known pharmaceutical scandals involves the infamous and hated \u201cPharma Bro.\u201d Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, was given the nickname after he was to blame for jacking up the price of medication. Daraprim was a medication that treated a rare parasitic disease that attacked cancer patients, AIDS patients, and pregnant women. The price of Daraprim rose from $13.50 a pill to about $750.\n\nShkreli said his decision to jack up the price was capitalism at work. Still, his choice sparked outrage all around America. In 2015, he was arrested on securities fraud charges related to hedge funds he was involved with, and the next day, he resigned as CEO of the company. He was convicted of the crime and was given a seven-year prison sentence. Shkreli was also ordered to return $64.6 million in profits that his former company gained by raising the price of Daraprim.[10]\n\nfact checked by Darci Heikkinen",

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or call (212) 363-7500 to speak to our team of experienced shareholder advocates.\n\nTHE LAWSUIT: A class action securities lawsuit was filed against Merck & Co., Inc. that seeks to recover losses of shareholders who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China.\n\nThe full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\" Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \"not recovered to the level we had expected.\"\n\nFollowing this news, Merck's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck's stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Merck KGaA doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Merck KGaA's Profit Performance\n\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from Merck KGaA's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Merck KGaA's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. While it's really important to consider how well a company's statutory earnings represent its true earnings power, it's also worth taking a look at what analysts are forecasting for the future. So feel free to check out our free graph representing analyst forecasts.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Merck KGaA's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "A federal court ruled in favor of Merck on Tuesday, finding that the pharma had not been remiss in its duty to inform patients about alleged safety risks associated with its HPV vaccine Gardasil.\n\nAccording to reporting from Reuters, Judge Kenneth Bell of the District Court of North Carolina agreed with Merck\u2019s argument that at the time these safety signals were occurring, the company did not have enough data to conclusively link Gardasil to the side effects.\n\n\u201cFederal law requires more than speculative inferences prior to adding dire warnings to lifesaving vaccines that discourage their use,\u201d Bell argued. \u201cThat evidence is lacking here.\u201d Merck in a statement to Reuters said it is \u201cextremely pleased\u201d with the ruling, while counsel for the plaintiffs\u2014patients who claimed to have suffered from side effects after receiving Gardasil\u2014had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Gardasil lawsuits stretch back to 2020, when dozens of claimants sued Merck, alleging that the pharma had downplayed the side effects of the vaccine, including an increased risk of ovarian failure and the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\nAs per the Reuters report on Tuesday, there are currently more than 200 such cases nationwide to which Bell\u2019s decision will apply.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Merck announced a $1 billion bump to its vaccine manufacturing capacity in the U.S., earmarked for the construction of a new production facility at its campus in Durham, North Carolina. The pharma has pumped more than $12 billion into its U.S. footprint since 2018 and plans to add another $8 billion by 2028.\n\nAside from Gardasil, Merck\u2019s vaccine portfolio includes the 21-valent pneumococcal shot Capvaxive and the hepatitis A vaccine Vaqta. The company also produces shots for measles, mumps, rubella, ebola and other infectious diseases. In 2024, the Gardasil line was Merck\u2019s second-best-selling product franchise, bringing in nearly $8.6 billion.\n\nThe vaccine has suffered from strong geopolitical headwinds, however. In August 2024, Merck flagged what it called a \u201csignificant step down\u201d in Chinese shipments for Gardasil, which analysts pinned on weak demand. China is an important market for Gardasil, Guggenheim Partners\u2019 Vamil Divan told BioSpace at the time, noting that the Asian giant makes up around 67% of the vaccine\u2019s total international sales.\n\nThe situation only worsened last month, when Merck announced that Gardasil shipments to China would be suspended at least until the middle of 2025.\n\nGardasil is also set to lose key patent protections in 2028.",

            "content": "Within dividend investing, companies with a consistent track record of dividend growth tend to attract greater investor interest. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that firms with ample cash reserves are better positioned to sustain and expand their operations while continuing to pay stable or increasing dividends. To assess the sustainability of dividends, companies must evaluate whether their payouts are supported by cash generated from operating activities and the availability of free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\u2014such as spending on property, plants, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014from cash flow generated through operations. Excess cash can be allocated toward dividends, debt reduction, share buybacks, or business expansion.\n\nThe significance of dividend stocks is well established, with extensive research examining their long-term performance. A study by Robert Arnott found that over a period of more than 200 years, ending in 2002, the US stock market delivered an average annualized total return of 7.9%, with dividend reinvestment accounting for 5% of that growth. Beyond enhancing overall returns, dividends also provide a buffer during market downturns. Various studies have shown that companies paying dividends tend to experience lower downside risk and recover losses more quickly, ultimately leading to higher risk-adjusted returns over extended investment periods.\n\nThe Dobermans of the Dow strategy serves as an alternative to the well-known Dogs of the Dow approach, offering a more selective screening process. While the Dogs of the Dow ranks stocks solely based on dividend yield, the Dobermans method prioritizes high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations. The selection process involves two key steps: first, the 30 stocks in the Dow are ranked by Return on Equity (ROE), with the top 20 retained. Then, these 20 companies are further ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, narrowing the selection to the final ten stocks, which form the Dobermans portfolio. Historically, a hypothetical portfolio following this approach and rebalanced annually has delivered superior performance compared to the Dow, the broader market, and the Dogs of the Dow strategy, according to a report by Forbes. The report further mentioned that since 2000, this methodology has generated a cumulative return of 810%, more than doubling the long-term performance of these benchmarks.\n\nWe recently published a list of Dobermans of the Dow: 10 Stocks to Consider . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other Dobermans of the Dow to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA positive or growing free cash flow often signals stable or increasing profitability. Since strong free cash flow may indicate a healthy balance sheet, S&P Dow Jones conducted an analysis to determine whether free cash flow yield\u2014measured as annual free cash flow per share divided by stock price\u2014provides valuable insights into investment returns. The underlying investment thesis suggested that all else being equal, companies with a higher free cash flow yield are preferable, as they generate greater free cash income for each dollar invested.\n\nAn analysis of the broader market universe, divided into quintiles based on free cash flow yield, revealed that the top-quintile stocks delivered an annualized return of 15.7% between December 1990 and June 2017. This performance exceeded the returns of all other quintiles and outpaced the broader market by an average of 3.6%. While the bottom two quintiles also achieved respectable returns of 11.0% and 8.6% annually, respectively, both underperformed relative to the overall equity market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered the Dow stocks by Return on Equity, narrowing the list to the top 20. These are then ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, with the top 10 earning the title \u201cDobermans of the Dow.\u201d The stocks are ranked according to their free cash flow yield. In cases where multiple stocks had the same free cash flow yield, the number of hedge fund investors was used as a deciding factor. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (MRK): Among Dobermans of the Dow to Buy\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: 0.08\n\nWith a cash flow yield of 0.08, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) tops our list of the Dobermans of the Dow. The American multinational pharmaceutical company is well recognized for its extensive portfolio of treatments covering oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, vaccines, and infectious diseases. Beyond pharmaceuticals, it also has a sizable animal health division and is actively engaged in biotechnology, extending beyond traditional drug development. This diverse business model, combined with a strong history of innovation, makes Merck an attractive investment choice.\n\nSince the start of 2025, shares of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) have dropped by nearly 4%, largely due to its full-year revenue forecast falling short of market expectations. The company projected revenue between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, below analysts\u2019 estimates of $67.31 billion. In addition, its outlook has been affected by the temporary halt of Gardasil shipments to China, though deliveries are expected to resume by mid-2025.\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s outlook fell short of investor expectations, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) delivered strong fourth-quarter results for 2024. Revenue reached $15.6 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same period a year earlier. Merck has solidified its presence in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its leading cancer treatment, Keytruda, playing a crucial role in cancer care while driving significant revenue growth. Its strong market position has allowed the company to generate robust cash flow, supporting its commitment to returning value to shareholders. In fiscal 2024, Keytruda sales rose 18% year-over-year, reaching $29.5 billion.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) offers a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.40%, as of March 10. The company has been growing its dividends for 14 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 1st on our list of Dobermans of the Dow to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the presentation of positive results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of the investigational, once-daily, oral, two-drug regimen of doravirine/islatravir [DOR/ISL (100mg/0.25mg)] in adults with HIV-1 infection that is virologically suppressed on bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamidei [BIC/FTC/TAF (50mg/200mg/25mg)] in trial MK-8591A-052) or antiretroviral therapy [baseline antiretroviral therapy (bART)] in trial MK-8591A-051. In both trials, DOR/ISL met the primary efficacy success criterion for non-inferiority to comparator antiretroviral therapies and primary safety objectives at Week 48. The findings will be shared in late-breaking oral presentations at the 32nd Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) being held in San Francisco and were featured in a CROI press conference. Merck plans to begin submitting applications for marketing authorization to regulatory agencies by mid-2025.\n\nIn the double-blind trial MK-8591A-052 (Abstract #204A), results for the primary endpoint (HIV-1 RNA \u226550 copies/mL) showed that 1.5% of participants who switched to DOR/ISL had a viral load of \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48, compared to 0.6% on BIC/FTC/TAF (treatment difference 0.9%, 95% CI -1.9, 2.9). At Week 48, 91.5% of participants who switched to DOR/ISL maintained viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) compared to 94.2% of participants who continued receiving BIC/FTC/TAF (treatment difference -2.6%, 95% CI -7.1, 2.6; secondary endpoint).\n\nIn the open-label trial MK-8591A-051 (Abstract #204B), results for the primary endpoint (HIV-1 RNA \u226550 copies/mL) showed that 1.4% of participants who received DOR/ISL had a viral load of \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48, compared to 4.9% on bART (treatment difference -3.6%, 95% CI -7.8, -0.8. At Week 48, 95.6% of participants who switched to DOR/ISL maintained viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) compared to 91.9% of participants who continued on bART (treatment difference 3.7%, 95% CI -0.3, 8.9; secondary endpoint).\n\nAcross both trials, the safety profile of DOR/ISL was generally comparable to the comparator antiretroviral regimens, including BIC/FTC/TAF in MK-8591A-052. At Week 48, the mean percent change in total lymphocyte and CD4 counts were similar for DOR/ISL and comparator regimens. No treatment-emergent resistance to DOR or ISL was observed in either trial.\n\n\u201c Despite the availability of multiple daily antiretroviral therapies, the needs of people living with HIV are evolving. Many people living with HIV are older and also managing comorbidities, making it important to have daily treatment options that can help meet each person\u2019s unique health needs,\u201d said Professor Chloe Orkin, Dean for Healthcare Transformation, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom. \u201c I\u2019m excited to see that DOR/ISL has potential as a new daily treatment option for people living with HIV who may benefit from this two-drug regimen.\u201d\n\nIslatravir, Merck\u2019s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI), blocks HIV-1 replication by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of reverse transcriptase translocation resulting in immediate chain termination and delayed chain termination from structural changes induced in the viral DNA.\n\n\u201c We are excited that DOR/ISL is the first two-drug regimen without an integrase inhibitor to demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety to the three-drug InSTI-based regimen, BIC/FTC/TAF, in a Phase 3 pivotal trial,\u201d said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201c Merck has been a research pioneer in HIV for decades. These data and our work on the longer-acting islatravir-based therapies in our pipeline show our continued commitment to help find new options that address the evolving needs of people living with HIV.\u201d\n\nAbout the Phase 3 data from MK-8591A-052\n\nMK-8591A-052 is a Phase 3, double-blind randomized, active-controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a switch to investigational, oral, once-daily DOR/ISL (100mg/0.25mg) in adults with HIV-1 infection that has been virologically suppressed on BIC/FTC/TAF (50mg/200mg/25mg). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48 (non-inferiority margin 4%). In this trial, 513 adults with HIV-1 who had virologic suppression for three months or more on BIC/FTC/TAF, no history of treatment failure and no known resistance to DOR were randomized (2:1) and switched to DOR/ISL (n= 342) or continued treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF (n=171). The median age of participants was 47 years; 21.4% were assigned female sex at birth, 30.8% were Black or African American, and 22.8% were Hispanic or Latine. The median duration of BIC/FTC/TAF treatment prior to trial enrollment was 3.4 years (IQR 2.0-5.0).\n\nResults for the primary efficacy endpoint showed that five participants (1.5%) treated with DOR/ISL and one participant (0.6%) in the BIC/FTC/TAF group had a viral load of \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48, demonstrating non-inferiority of DOR/ISL to BIC/FTC/TAF (treatment difference 0.9%, 95% CI -1.9, 2.9). The superiority criteria were not met. Results for a secondary endpoint, the proportion of individuals with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48, showed that participants who switched to treatment with DOR/ISL or continued BIC/FTC/TAF maintained comparable rates of viral suppression at Week 48 (91.5% on DOR/ISL vs. 94.2% on BIC/FTC/TAF (treatment difference -2.6%, 95% CI -7.1, 2.6). No treatment-emergent resistance to DOR or ISL was observed.\n\nAt Week 48, the mean percent change in total lymphocyte and CD4 counts were similar for DOR/ISL and BIC/FTC/TAF. There were identical rates of discontinuation for protocol-specified decreases in total lymphocyte and/or CD4 counts (two participants (0.6%) in the DOR/ISL group and one participant (0.6%) in the BIC/FTC/TAF group).\n\nDrug-related adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations due to drug-related AEs were similar between groups (n=35, 10.2% for DOR/ISL and n=16, 9.4% for BIC/FTC/TAF; n=4, 1.2% for DOR/ISL and n=2, 1.2% for BIC/FTC/TAF, respectively). Rates of toxicity grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious AEs were similar for DOR/ISL and BIC/FTC/TAF (n=25, 7.3% for DOR/ISL and n=13, 7.6% for BIC/FTC/TAF; n=15, 4.4% for DOR/ISL and n=11, 6.4% for BIC/FTC/TAF, respectively). Mean change in weight from baseline to Week 48 was minimal (-0.03 kg for DOR/ISL versus 0.28 kg for BIC/FTC/TAF; difference -0.30 kg, 95% CI -1.13, 0.53). The most common AEs (>6% in either study arm) were arthralgia, COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, and fatigue. One participant on DOR/ISL discontinued due to a drug-related serious AE (immune thrombocytopenia). There were two cases of low-level hepatitis B (HBV) viremia (HBV DNA <50 IU/mL) with no antigenemia or elevated transaminases in the DOR/ISL group and no cases in the BIC/FTC/TAF group; there were no cases of clinical HBV reactivation.\n\nAbout the Phase 3 data from MK-8591A-051\n\nMK-8591A-051 is a Phase 3, open-label randomized, active-controlled, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a switch to investigational, oral, once-daily DOR/ISL (100mg/0.25mg) in adults with HIV-1 infection that has been virologically suppressed using ART. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48 (non-inferiority margin 4%). In this trial, 551 adults with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for three months or more on oral 2- or 3-drug ART, with no history of treatment failure and no known virologic resistance to DOR were randomized 2:1 and switched to DOR/ISL (n=366) or continued baseline antiretroviral therapy (bART) (n=185), stratified by bART regimen. The median age of participants was 51 years; 39.7% were assigned female sex at birth, 45.4% Black or African American and 14.5% Hispanic or Latine. At baseline, 64.2% were treated with an InSTI-based regimen, 30.3% with an NNRTI-based regimen, and 5.4% with a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen, with median duration on current ART of 3.8 years (IQR 2.0-6.3).\n\nResults for the primary efficacy endpoint showed that five participants (1.4%) in the DOR/ISL group and nine participants (4.9%) in the bART group had a viral load of \u226550 copies/mL at Week 48, demonstrating non-inferiority of DOR/ISL to bART (treatment difference -3.6%, 95% CI -7.8, -0.8). Results for a secondary endpoint, the proportion of individuals with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48, showed that participants who switched to treatment with DOR/ISL or continued bART maintained comparable rates of viral suppression at Week 48 (95.6% on DOR/ISL vs. 91.9% on bART; treatment difference 3.7%, 95% CI -0.3, 8.9). No treatment-emergent resistance to DOR or ISL was observed. Two participants discontinued DOR/ISL early after virologic failure at Week 4 with multiple resistance-associated mutations that were also present in baseline proviral DNA. These two participants were later found to be not eligible for the trial due to history of prior virologic failure and exclusionary DOR resistance.\n\nAt Week 48, the mean percent change in total lymphocyte and CD4 counts were similar for DOR/ISL and bART. No participants discontinued treatment due to decrease in total lymphocyte and/or CD4 counts.\n\nIn this open-label study, drug-related AEs were more commonly reported with DOR/ISL (n=44; 12.0%) than bART (n=9; 4.9%). Rates of toxicity grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious AEs were similar for DOR/ISL and bART (n=39, 10.7% for DOR/ISL and n=18, 9.7% for bART and n=23, 6.3% for DOR/ISL and n=9, 4.9% for bART, respectively). There were no drug-related serious AEs and there were no discontinuations due to serious AEs in the DOR/ISL group; there was one drug-related serious AE and two discontinuations due to serious AEs in the bART group. The most common drug-related AEs were diarrhea (DOR/ISL 3.3%, bART 0%), fatigue (1.9%, 0.5%), dizziness (1.9%, 0.5%), abdominal distention (1.6%, 0%), weight increased (1.6%, 0%), and headache (1.6%, 1.1%).\n\nChange in lipid parameters from baseline were similar between treatment groups for all bART strata. Mean change in weight from baseline to Week 48 was 0.94 kg for DOR/ISL and -0.18 kg for bART (difference -1.13 kg, 95% CI 0.31, 1.94). For baseline regimens without EFV or TDF, the difference in weight between DOR/ISL and bART was 0.82 kg (95% CI -0.22, 1.87). There was one case of low-level HBV viremia with no antigenemia or elevated transaminases in the DOR/ISL group and no cases in the bART group; there were no cases of clinical HBV reactivation.\n\nIndications and usage for PIFELTRO\u00ae (doravirine) and DELSTRIGO\u00ae (doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in the U.S.\n\nPIFELTRO is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior ARV treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to doravirine.\n\nDELSTRIGO is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior ARV treatment history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on a stable ARV regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DELSTRIGO.\n\nSelected Safety Information\n\nWarning: Posttreatment Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) for DELSTRIGO\n\nAll patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV before initiating ARV therapy. Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in people with concomitant HIV-1 and HBV who have discontinued products containing lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which are components of DELSTRIGO. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue DELSTRIGO should be monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping DELSTRIGO. If appropriate, initiation of anti-HBV therapy may be warranted.\n\nContraindications\n\nPIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO are contraindicated when coadministered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A enzyme inducers (including the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin; the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide; the antimycobacterials rifampin and rifapentine; the cytotoxic agent mitotane; and the herbal product St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum)), as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations may occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of DELSTRIGO and PIFELTRO.\n\nDELSTRIGO is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to lamivudine.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nSevere Skin Reactions\n\nSevere skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported during the postmarketing experience with doravirine-containing regimens. Discontinue PIFELTRO or DELSTRIGO, and other medications known to be associated with severe skin reactions, immediately if a painful rash with mucosal involvement or a progressive severe rash develops. Clinical status should be closely monitored, and appropriate therapy should be initiated.\n\nNew or Worsening Renal Impairment\n\nRenal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, have been reported with the use of TDF. DELSTRIGO should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (eg, high-dose or multiple NSAIDs). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in people living with HIV with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF.\n\nPrior to or when initiating DELSTRIGO, and during treatment, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue DELSTRIGO in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Discontinue DELSTRIGO if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL/min.\n\nBone Loss and Mineralization Defects\n\nIn clinical trials in adults living with HIV, TDF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher. Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported with the use of TDF. The effects of TDF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adults are unknown.\n\nImmune Reconstitution Syndrome\n\nImmune reconstitution syndrome can occur, including the occurrence of autoimmune disorders with variable time to onset, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nBecause DELSTRIGO is a complete regimen, coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended.\n\nCoadministration of PIFELTRO with efavirenz, etravirine, or nevirapine is not recommended.\n\nIf DELSTRIGO is coadministered with rifabutin, take one tablet of DELSTRIGO once daily, followed by one tablet of doravirine (PIFELTRO) approximately 12 hours after the dose of DELSTRIGO.\n\nIf PIFELTRO is coadministered with rifabutin, increase PIFELTRO dosage to one tablet twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).\n\nConsult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for more information on potential drug-drug interactions.\n\nDosage and Administration/Specific Populations\n\nRenal Impairment\n\nBecause DELSTRIGO is a fixed-dose combination tablet and the dosage of lamivudine and TDF cannot be adjusted, DELSTRIGO is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe most common adverse reactions with DELSTRIGO (incidence \u22655%, all intensities) were dizziness (7%), nausea (5%), and abnormal dreams (5%). The most common adverse reactions with PIFELTRO (incidence \u22655%, all intensities) were nausea (7%), dizziness (7%), headache (6%), fatigue (6%), diarrhea (6%), abdominal pain (5%), and abnormal dreams (5%).\n\nBy week 96 in DRIVE-FORWARD, 2% of adult participants in the PIFELTRO group and 3% in the darunavir+ritonavir (DRV+r) group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication.\n\nBy week 96 in DRIVE-AHEAD, 3% of adult participants in the DELSTRIGO group and 7% in the efavirenz (EFV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication.\n\nIn DRIVE-FORWARD, mean changes from baseline at week 48 in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were pre-specified. LDL-C: -4.6 mg/dL in the PIFELTRO group vs 9.5 mg/dL in the DRV+r group. Non-HDL-C: -5.4 mg/dL in the PIFELTRO group vs 13.7 mg/dL in the DRV+r group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.\n\nIn DRIVE-AHEAD, mean changes from baseline at week 48 in LDL-C and non-HDL-C were pre-specified. LDL-C: -2.1 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs 8.3 mg/dL in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. Non-HDL-C: -4.1 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs 12.7 mg/dL in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.\n\nIn DRIVE-SHIFT, mean changes from baseline at week 24 in LDL-C and non-HDL-C were pre-specified. LDL-C: -16.3 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs -2.6 mg/dL in the PI + ritonavir group. Non-HDL-C: -24.8 mg/dL in the DELSTRIGO group vs -2.1 mg/dL in the PI + ritonavir group. The clinical benefits of these findings have not been demonstrated.\n\nIn DRIVE-AHEAD, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported in the three pre-specified categories of sleep disorders and disturbances, dizziness, and altered sensorium. Twelve percent of adult participants in the DELSTRIGO group and 26% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported neuropsychiatric adverse events of sleep disorders and disturbances; 9% in the DELSTRIGO group and 37% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported dizziness; and 4% in the DELSTRIGO group and 8% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group reported altered sensorium.\n\nThe safety of DELSTRIGO in virologically-suppressed adults was based on week 48 data from participants in the DRIVE-SHIFT trial. Overall, the safety profile in virologically-suppressed adult participants was similar to that in participants with no ARV treatment history.\n\nSerum ALT and AST Elevations: In the DRIVE-SHIFT trial, 22% and 16% of participants in the immediate switch group experienced ALT and AST elevations greater than 1.25 X ULN, respectively, through 48 weeks on DELSTRIGO. For these ALT and AST elevations, no apparent patterns with regard to time to onset relative to switch were observed. One percent of participants had ALT or AST elevations greater than 5 X ULN through 48 weeks on DELSTRIGO. The ALT and AST elevations were generally asymptomatic, and not associated with bilirubin elevations. In comparison, 4% and 4% of participants in the delayed switch group experienced ALT and AST elevations of greater than 1.25 X ULN through 24 weeks on their baseline regimen.\n\nPregnancy/Breastfeeding\n\nThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to PIFELTRO or DELSTRIGO during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.\n\nInform individuals with HIV-1 infection of the potential risks of breastfeeding, including: (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-1\u2013negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-1\u2013positive infants), and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults.\n\nAbout Islatravir (MK-8591) and Merck\u2019s HIV Research\n\nIslatravir (MK-8591) is Merck\u2019s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) under evaluation in multiple ongoing early and late-stage clinical trials in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1. Trials with islatravir are designed to offer different dosing options as potential daily and once-weekly treatments. In addition to the MK-8591A-051 and MK-8591A-052 trials, ongoing Phase 3 trials of daily DOR/ISL (100mg /0.25mg) include MK-8591A-053 in people with HIV who had not previously received treatment (treatment-na\u00efve), and MK-8591A-054 evaluating open-label DOR/ISL (100 mg/0.25 mg) in individuals who participated in earlier Phase 3 trials of DOR/ISL (100 mg/0.75 mg).

The pharmaceutical firm, which has spent more than $12 billion on U.S. capital investment since 2018, plans to invest another $8 billion in the country by 2028.\n\n\"Expanding our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Durham marks a significant milestone in our efforts to strengthen our production and manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.,\" said Sanat Chattopadhyay, head of Merck\u2019s manufacturing division, in a statement.\n\nMerck sells a number of vaccines, including Gardasil, which protects against human papillomavirus, as well as shots for pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nIn February, the CEOs of Merck, Pfizer and Eli Lilly met with Trump and reportedly discussed the president\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports if drugmakers don\u2019t reshore production to the U.S.\n\nLilly, which makes the popular GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro, has made a big push in that direction, later announcing it will invest $27 billion to build four drug production facilities in the U.S.\n\nPfizer has not announced any new investments, but its CEO said in March that it could move overseas manufacturing to existing plants in the U.S.\n\nAs a vaccine manufacturer, Merck could face pressure beyond tariffs, too. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a noted vaccine critic, could shake up the process by which new shots are reviewed and recommended. Two scheduled federal advisory meetings on vaccines have been delayed or canceled since Kennedy was sworn in.\n\nFaced with a growing measles outbreak, Kennedy has promoted fringe theories and treatments like cod liver oil, while questioning the risks of vaccination. While he recently wrote an op-ed encouraging people to consult their doctor about the measles vaccine, he also described the choice to vaccinate as a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and promoted the use of vitamin A.\n\nKennedy, who has for years linked the rise in autism to vaccines despite evidence disproving a connection, was previously involved in litigation against Merck over its Gardasil shot. The lawsuit claimed Merck overstated the vaccine\u2019s benefit and concealed side effects from the public.",

Merck said it now employs more than 1,000 workers in Durham.\n\n\"We're talking $1 billion expansion,\" Durham Mayor Leonardo Williams said. \"That means more opportunities for more jobs right here in Durham, more training programs that we could actually employ, just more opportunities for them to become a bigger, more impactful corporate neighbor.\"\n\nABC11 Eyewitness News spoke with Mayor Williams as he was in D.C. to talk about the economy and its impacts on the Bull City with other leaders nationwide. Williams said the expansion is a \"great advantage\" at the local level to strengthen the economy.\n\n\"If Merck is expanding their footprint, we're expanding opportunities to have more workforce development,\" Williams said.\n\nThe expansion comes as the life sciences industry is \"growing dramatically\" in North Carolina, according to the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, also known as NCBiotech.\n\nSenior vice president for science and business development, Mary Beth Thomas, said in just 2024, there were 25 different company announcements about growth and expansion.\n\n\"Of those 25 announcements, there were 4,500 jobs that are proposed to be made, and that ends up equating to over $10 billion of investment from those companies influencing 16 different communities across the state,\" Thomas said. \"So this is really dramatic, but that growth has been really incredibly high here in Durham County.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty at the federal level under the Trump Administration, including threats to medical research funding, which is a core aspect of the life sciences industry, the outlook appears healthy, according to Thomas.\n\n\"We have a lot of great institutions that have not only gotten started but are actively expanding in North Carolina,\" Thomas said. \"They are significant investments that are not going to go away in just an overnight type of situation. They will continue, and our hope is they will continue to grow here in North Carolina.\"\n\nSEE ALSO | Durham to be home base for new 'Smart USA' CHIPS manufacturing, a first-of-its-kind\n\nSEE ALSO | Biotech giant Amgen celebrates opening of new campus in Holly Springs",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other oversold blue chip stocks.\n\nThe uncertainty related to the tariff announcements continues to influence Wall Street. Reuters reported that the S&P 500 is down 4.3% since Trump took office on January 20, and tariffs are the main concern for investors as they believe that can adversely impact the economic growth and be inflationary. While Trump believes that tariffs can increase the country's revenue, fuel broad-based growth, and can be used as a negotiating tool with other countries, the investors believe that trade policies can weaken consumer confidence and limit the capital spending from companies.\n\nLong Term Outlook Remains Intact\n\nAs per Franklin Templeton, the US equities have managed to provide strong gains over the past few years, with the S&P 500 repeatedly touching record highs, thanks to the Magnificent Seven\u2019s dominance in AI. Despite elevated valuations, the broader market outlook is positive. Innovation and investment continue at a pace, sales growth has been accelerating, and earnings are expected to see a double-digit rise this year. Also, the US economy has a more business-friendly administration. That being said, there are risks, mainly related to the US trade policy and the expected impact of tariffs on critical sectors, including technology.\n\nAmidst such uncertainties, Franklin Templeton believes that investor confidence in the US equities is expected to remain strong. While the risks might be elevated, the new administration\u2019s policy changes are expected to finally result in long-term positives for the broader US economy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlue Chips to Provide Shelter\n\nWhile the Mag 7 stocks are well-placed for the long-term growth, the market leadership is expected to broaden as and when acceleration in innovation occurs, says Franklin Templeton. The investment firm believes that active management is of utmost importance. The pivot from AI infrastructure to platforms remains well underway. Therefore, identifying the right companies at the right time\u2014ones possessing the technology, strategy, and adaptability to maintain and sustain long-term growth\u2014are expected to be critical to investment success.\n\nThe US equities, mainly large caps, have been performing strongly, courtesy of the innovation and investment. Notably, over the past 6 months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen an increase of over ~4.5%. Even though the Mag 7 stocks continue to support the market momentum, the investment firm sees growing opportunities beyond such market leaders. With the continuation of AI-driven cycle, the competitive landscape remains dynamic and has been creating new growth areas.",

            "content": "Hickey weighed in on the uncertainty dominating markets, emphasizing that no one can predict the full impact of tariffs. He referenced Target CEO Brian Cornell\u2019s comments earlier in the day about the lack of certainty regarding tariffs, taxes, rates, and the economy. Hickey remarked that this stew of uncertainty is keeping investors cautious. He noted that intraday rallies, such as the one seen earlier in the day after bouncing off the 200-day moving average, are often short-lived due to unpredictable policy developments. For instance, Trump\u2019s speeches have recently been followed by market declines, adding to investor hesitancy. He also highlighted historical context for pullbacks like the current one: since World War II, there have been 64 instances of a 5% drop from all-time highs in the S&P 500. While not uncommon, he advised caution in the short term due to unpredictable market reactions.\n\nCamporeale highlighted the difficulty of navigating the rapid pace of headlines surrounding trade discussions out of Washington. Entering the year with a 10% equity overweight, JP Morgan has since reduced this to 5%, reallocating some exposure to US, developed non-US, and emerging markets. Camporeale noted that while policy uncertainty raises questions about growth and earnings outlooks, the US economy remains strong, with a 4% unemployment rate, 3% GDP growth, and solid corporate balance sheets. He said that despite short-term market turbulence, recession risks remain low, and their portfolio maintains an equity overweight alongside high-yield exposure. He also pointed out that it is still early in President Trump's second term and too soon to draw definitive conclusions about its impact. He believes that lower interest rates could pave the way for positive fiscal and deregulation policies that have yet to fully materialize. Despite current market fears, he remains optimistic about the economy\u2019s strength and low recession probability.\n\nOn a down day for major market averages, Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, and Phil Camporeale, portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, discussed the ongoing volatility. They both appeared on CNBC's 'Closing Bell Overtime' on March 5 to talk about how tariff policy raises uncertainty around growth and earnings outlook.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Undervalued US Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other undervalued US stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBoth experts agreed that uncertainty around tariffs and other policies will continue influencing market behavior in the near term. However, they emphasized different aspects, Camporeale focused on economic strength and strategic positioning within portfolios, while Hickey stressed caution amid ongoing unpredictability in policy-driven market movements.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top US stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 6: 10.34\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare leader that operates through its Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments and delivers innovative therapies and solutions. These include oncology treatments, vaccines, and veterinary products, which are driven by established brands and strategic collaborations.\n\nThe company's oncology segment, which is led by KEYTRUDA, is a primary revenue source. In Q4 2024, KEYTRUDA sales surged 21% to $7.8 billion, driven by global demand in both metastatic and earlier-stage cancers. US growth spanned various tumor types, with increased adoption in combinations for urothelial and endometrial cancers, and as a standalone for lung and breast cancers. International growth mirrored this trend, particularly in early-stage breast cancer. Regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA-based regimens were secured in China, Japan, and the US.\n\nAt upcoming medical meetings, the company will present detailed findings from oncology studies, which include subcutaneous pembrolizumab and KEYTRUDA in head and neck cancer. It's also progressing sac-TMT through multiple Phase 3 trials. Sac-TMT is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being developed by Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in collaboration with Kelun-Biotech.\n\nGreensKeeper Asset Management stated the following regarding Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\nOverall MRK ranks 6th on our list of the most undervalued US stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "NEW YORK, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

            "content": "Merck Faces Patent Battle with Halozyme Over Latest Keytruda Injection\n\nby Steven Chung Share To\n\nMerck\u2019s plan to extend Keytruda\u2019s market dominance with a new injectable version faces a major hurdle. Halozyme Therapeutics has accused Merck of infringing its patents on a hyaluronidase enzyme used for drug delivery. The dispute threatens Merck\u2019s strategy to maintain sales after Keytruda\u2019s intravenous patents expire. In response, Merck is challenging the validity of Halozyme\u2019s patents, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal battle.\n\nHyaluronidase Enzyme Patents Raise Questions about Injectable Keytruda Claims\n\nHalozyme Therapeutics alleges that Merck\u2019s new subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda infringes on its patented hyaluronidase enzyme technology for drug delivery. The claim threatens Merck\u2019s efforts to transition Keytruda to an injectable format as patents for the intravenous version near expiration. Merck, however, disputes the validity of Halozyme\u2019s patents, signaling an intense legal battle that could shape the future of its blockbuster cancer drug.\n\nMerck told Reuters, \u201cWe strongly believe that any Halozyme patents attempting to cover this variant are invalid,\u201d adding that it has already filed invalidity petitions with the U.S. patent office. In November, researchers found Merck\u2019s injectable Keytruda to be equally effective as the IV version, which generated $29.5 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nMerck has partnered with South Korea-based biopharmaceutical firm Alteogen to utilize a hyaluronidase enzyme variant, enabling large-volume subcutaneous (under-the-skin) drug administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Halozyme, a competitor of Alteogen, also employs hyaluronidase enzymes for injectable drug development, supporting treatments from Roche, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer, among others. Halozyme prefers to establish licensing agreements with companies using its intellectual property for drug delivery but has declined to comment on potential litigation. Merck is still conducting clinical trials for the injectable Keytruda and anticipates launching it by early 2026.\n\nFDA Approves Keytruda for Priority BLA Review\n\nMerck announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The application seeks approval for its anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy for patients with resectable locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC). The proposed regimen includes Keytruda as a neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant therapy with standard radiotherapy (with or without cisplatin) and continued as a single agent.\n\nThe FDA has set a target action date of June 23, 2025, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The sBLA is supported by Phase 3 KEYNOTE-689 trial data (NCT03765918), which showed statistically significant improvements in event-free survival (EFS) and major pathological response (mPR) compared to adjuvant radiotherapy alone, with a consistent safety profile.\n\nMerck Seeks Keytruda Expansion Under Project Orbis\n\nThe review falls under Project Orbis, an FDA initiative for simultaneous oncology drug reviews across multiple countries, including Israel, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Brazil, and Switzerland. Dr. Marjorie Green, Merck\u2019s head of oncology clinical development, emphasized the urgent need for new treatment options for LA-HNSCC, as current standards have remained unchanged for over two decades.\n\n\u201cBased on the compelling results of the KEYNOTE-689 trial, we hope to reduce the risk of recurrence and disease progression in earlier stages of disease. We look forward to working with the FDA to potentially bring Keytruda to these patients as soon as possible.\u201d said by Green.\n\nWith this, Merck aims to reduce recurrence and disease progression at earlier stages of the disease. Regulatory agencies across multiple global markets, including the U.S., Europe, China, and Japan, have already approved Keytruda as a monotherapy and in combination therapies for metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC.\n\nThe dispute highlights the competitive landscape around hyaluronidase enzyme-based drug delivery systems, with Merck partnering with Alteogen and Halozyme working with other major pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAuthor Steven Chung",

JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 10.34\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, based in New Jersey. The company is widely known for its broad range of treatments spanning oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, vaccines, and infectious diseases. In addition to its pharmaceutical business, the company has a significant animal health division and is actively involved in biotechnology beyond traditional drug development. This diversified portfolio, along with its strong track record of innovation, makes Merck an appealing investment option.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has declined by over 5%, primarily due to the company\u2019s revenue forecast for the year falling short of market expectations. The company projected revenue between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, below analysts\u2019 estimates of $67.31 billion. In addition, its outlook has been impacted by the temporary suspension of Gardasil shipments to China, though deliveries are expected to resume by mid-2025.\n\nThough the company\u2019s guidance did not meet investors\u2019 expectations, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) delivered solid results in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company posted $15.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 7% rise compared to the same period last year. Merck has strengthened its foothold in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with Keytruda, its flagship cancer treatment, making a substantial impact on cancer care while contributing to significant revenue gains. Its strong market position has helped the company generate healthy cash flow, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns. In fiscal 2024, Keytruda sales climbed 18% year-over-year, totaling $29.5 billion.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.45%, as of March 6. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 14 years in a row.\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 4th on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Township officials have fielded a plan from Merck to modify two areas of wetlands on their West Point campus, changes that could pave the way for future work.\n\n\u201cMerck has applied for a joint permit for wetlands relocation,\u201d said Merck spokesman Greg Landis.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is remove about 0.35 acres of current site wetlands, in exchange for wetlands that are already in place, within the Schuylkill River service area. And this is an accepted practice \u2014 where we buy these credits, and then we\u2019re allowed to fill in ours, and use theirs in exchange,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past several years, Merck has sought and secured approvals for expanding the existing \u201cBuilding 45\u201d for labs and office space in October 2020, a new \u201cBuilding 50\u201d of roughly 101,000 square feet of manufacturing space in February 2021, a new \u201cBuilding 32\u201d for freezer space approved in May 2021, expansion of the proposed \u201cBuilding 50\u201d in August 2021, and a new \u201cBuilding 63A\u201d production facility approved in November 2021.\n\nIn early 2024 Merck also secured approvals for a new \u201cBuilding 41\u201d to be located toward the center of the company\u2019s 320-acre complex, a new lab analysis and testing building to be built on the site of a research building that had stood on the company\u2019s Sumneytown Pike campus from 1955 to 2021.\n\nThe latest plans, Landis told the township commissioners on Monday night, call for work that could impact four minor areas totaling 2.8 acres, and require approvals from the township, state, and federal Army Corps of Engineers, he said, as he showed a map with those areas highlighted.\n\n\u201cThe site has four small areas of existing wetlands, that if removed give us some flexibility with the site, to add additional parking initially, and then possible future site development,\u201d Landis said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fill those in, and the wetlands get replaced through this program, down near [Philadelphia]. It\u2019s moved off of our campus, and we\u2019re given permission to replace them in another location outside the township,\u201d he said.\n\nThat exchange is done under a Quaker Mitigation Bank program administrated by the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, Landis told the board, and PA DEP would also be part of the permitting process needed to do work on the wetlands, convert them to parking, and add drainage piping and stormwater management features. The township\u2019s zoning officer and engineer have vetted the plans and raised no concerns or issues, he said.\n\nCommissioners President Katherine Carter asked if Merck would be responsible for maintaining the offsite wetlands, and Landis said it\u2019s managed by others once the company buys the credits to do so.\n\n\u201cEssentially, you\u2019re buying out of the obligation to maintain the wetlands currently on the site,\u201d said commissioner Greg Moll. Landis agreed, and pointed out that several large stormwater basins on the Merck campus, that are capable of handling several million gallons of stormwater combined, would remain.\n\n\u201cThe big basins remain. We still have to maintain the balance of our stormwater management onsite. So the basins have to be capable of handling a 100-year storm \u2014 that doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Landis said.\n\nThe formal actions sought from the township commissioners, a waiver of land development and two other waivers regarding pipe size and inlet size, were also vetted and OK\u2019d by the township\u2019s consultants.\n\n\u201cWe modeled it, and we have capacity in these pipes already, at the smaller size,\u201d Landis said, and township engineer Nick Cross agreed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of what we review. We don\u2019t allow those waivers, unless they can show the system that they\u2019re designing can handle the capacity,\u201d Cross said.\n\nUpper Gwynedd\u2019s commissioners next meet at 7 p.m. on March 10 at the township administration building, 1 Parkside Place For more information visit www.UpperGwynedd.org.\n\nThis article appears courtesy of a content share agreement between North Penn Now and The Reporter.

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "As you might know, Merck KGaA ( ) recently reported its annual numbers. Revenues of \u20ac21b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at \u20ac6.39, missing estimates by 4.1%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nFollowing the latest results, Merck KGaA's 15 analysts are now forecasting revenues of \u20ac22.1b in 2025. This would be an okay 4.4% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 21% to \u20ac7.73. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of \u20ac22.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20ac7.72 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at \u20ac180. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Merck KGaA at \u20ac206 per share, while the most bearish prices it at \u20ac160. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same are performing. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Merck KGaA's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 4.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 5.6% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 3.3% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Merck KGaA is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Merck KGaA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

            "content": "The board of Merck KGaA (ETR:MRK) has announced that it will pay a dividend of \u20ac2.20 per share on the 30th of April. This means the annual payment will be 1.6% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average.\n\nView our latest analysis for Merck KGaA\n\nMerck KGaA's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, Merck KGaA's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 40.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nXTRA:MRK Historic Dividend March 9th 2025\n\nMerck KGaA Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was \u20ac1.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of \u20ac2.20. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.2% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Merck KGaA has impressed us by growing EPS at 17% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nMerck KGaA Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Merck KGaA might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

The share hit a 52-week low of \u20ac132.80 on February 12, 2025, considerably below its August 31 peak of \u20ac177.00. However, recent quarterly results suggest a potential turning point.

For the full year, Merck achieved \u20ac21.2 billion in revenue, representing 2% organic growth, while adjusted EBITDA rose 6.9% to \u20ac6.1 billion. Despite these positive developments, net profit declined slightly by 1.7% to \u20ac2.79 billion. The company plans to maintain its dividend at \u20ac2.20 per share, although analysts anticipate an increase to \u20ac2.35 for the current year.\n\nOptimistic Outlook for 2025\n\nThe company's leadership has expressed confidence regarding Merck's future performance, forecasting profitable growth across all business segments in 2025. Management projects organic revenue growth of 3-6%, targeting between \u20ac21.5 and \u20ac22.9 billion, with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase organically by 3-8% to \u20ac6.1-6.6 billion. Strategic investments in semiconductor materials for AI chip systems appear particularly promising, while the laboratory business has shown clear recovery signals since mid-2024. Additionally, Merck confirmed discussions regarding a potential acquisition of a US cancer specialist, potentially strengthening its pharmaceutical division following setbacks in clinical trials of two promising candidates. Despite current price weakness, analysts remain optimistic, setting an average price target of approximately \u20ac183\u2014suggesting potential upside of over 35% from current levels.\n\nAd\n\nFresh Merck information released.

            "content": "Merck KGaA is continuing development of its lupus therapy despite the negative announcement. Image credit: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.\n\nMerck KGaA\u2019s oral TLR7/8 inhibitor enpatoran has failed to meet the primary endpoint in a subgroup of patients, but development of the drug is set to continue.\n\nAnnounced in the company\u2019s Q4 earnings call, lupus drug enpatoran failed to meet the primary endpoint of British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-Based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response after 24 weeks in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nThe randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled WILLOW study (NCT05162586) was investigating the therapy in 456 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and SLE. The study investigated three doses, notably low, medium, and high, of enpatoran versus placebo. The full data has not yet been announced from the study.\n\nIn October 2024, Merck KGgA reported positive data from the CLE patient cohort, announcing this arm met its primary endpoint.\n\nDespite the disappointing update, chief financial officer Helene von Roeder said that the company will continue to develop the therapy.\n\n\u201cWe now have all the data from the WILLOW study of enpatoran, both for SLE and CLE cohorts. Even though the SLE did not meet the primary endpoint, the previous success of the CLE cohort and the previous success of certain, predefined populations in the SLE cohort, make us optimistic about the potential for further development,\u201d said Roeder.\n\nThe diagnosed prevalent cases of SLE in the seven major markets (7MM: US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) are projected to increase from 0.55 million in 2021 to 0.58 million in 2031, registering an annual growth rate (AGR) of 0.51%, estimates GlobalData.\n\nIf approved, GlobalData predicts sales of enpatoran to reach $85m in 2030.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nStudies of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have shown promise in SLE and lupus nephritis (LN) lately. According to GlobalData\u2019s Pharmaceutical Intelligence Centre, there are 38 CAR-T therapies in development for lupus.\n\nIn the earning\u2019s call, Roeder also revealed that Merck KGgA received negative topline data from a Phase II study of ompenaclid. The Phase II trial (NCT05983367) is evaluating the drug in combination with bevacizumab and FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, irinotecan and leucovorin) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCC).\n\nMerck KGgA gained the rights for ompenaclid in January 2024 as part of a deal with Inspirna, paying $45m upfront costs for licensing rights to the therapy. As a result of this, the company \u201cwill not exercise the US option\u201d for the therapy.\n\nCorrection notice: All references in the article to Merck have been corrected to Merck KGaA",

Feel free to contact Angela Gabriel at angela.gabriel@biospace.com.\n\nGRO Biosciences\n\nMarch 14\n\nGRO Biosciences began exploring strategic alternatives about six months after raising a Series B funding round and recently cut an undisclosed number of employees, including research staff, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based synthetic biology company founded in 2016 also no longer lists two key executives on its leadership page, Fierce noted: Daniel Mandell, the founding CEO, and Christopher Gregg, the chief scientific officer.\n\nBorn out of genetics professor George Church\u2019s lab at Harvard University, GRO Biosciences closed its Series B round in July 2024, raising $60.3 million to help advance its pipeline and further develop its platform. The company planned to use the money mostly to start a Phase I clinical trial for its lead program ProGly-Uricase, an investigational enzyme-based therapy that had been proposed for severe and refractory gout. GRO is now exploring strategic alternatives to advance that program, Fierce reported.\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarch 7\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals let go about 25% of its workforce this quarter, a cost-cutting move that\u2019s expected to save roughly $15 million through 2027, the company announced March 6. The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

Kendra Johnson, who has made it her mission to better the lives of fellow Delawareans, is honored as one of USA TODAY's Women of the Year.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Merck may build a $900 million manufacturing facility near Greenville.\n\nThe state of Delaware has offered Merck a $30.2 million grant to encourage the company to choose the Wilmington-area location.\n\nIf Merck accepts the grant, the company would be required to create 375 full-time jobs and operate the facility for at least 20 years.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy\u2019s approval in 2011.\n\nMerck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.\n\nMerck's potential $900 million investment\n\nMerck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.\n\nMerck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.\n\nAccording to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.\n\nUnder the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.\n\nThe company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.\n\nIf Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be Merck\u2019s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.\n\n$30.2 million approved for the company\n\nThe Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Feb. 24.\n\nThe grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.\n\nAlthough nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.\n\n\u201cThis new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.\n\nSusan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership, echoed that the move would boost Delaware\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\u201cThis project would reinforce Delaware\u2019s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,\u201d Colby said.\n\nMore corporate news: DuPont revises plans to split into three companies. Here\u2019s what this means\n\nAs for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck\u2019s global media relations, kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.\n\nWhat is the CRISP Campus?\n\nThe CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state\u2019s evolving life sciences investment.\n\nFormerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware\u2019s life science laboratories and research facilities.\n\nAmenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.\n\nChemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February 2024.

Shares have added about 3.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Merck due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nQ4 Earnings & Sales Beat Estimates\n\nMerck reported adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share for fourth-quarter 2024, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. In the year-ago period, management reported adjusted EPS of 3 cents. Earnings increased significantly as the year-ago quarter\u2019s number included a one-time charge of $1.69 per share related to a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n\n\nThe fourth-quarter EPS included a charge of 23 cents related to M&A deals with LaNova Medicines and Hansoh Pharma.\n\n\n\nRevenues rose 7% year over year (9% excluding Fx) to $15.62 billion driven by Keytruda, new products like Winrevair and strong performance of the Animal Health segment, partially offset by lower sales of Gardasil vaccine and diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet. Sales also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.56 billion.\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $14.04 billion, up 7% year over year (8% excluding Fx). Higher sales of oncology and cardiovascular drugs were partially offset by lower sales of Merck\u2019s vaccines, diabetes, immunology and virology medicines. Pharmaceutical segment revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.9 billion.\n\n\n\nAll sales growth numbers discussed below exclude Fx impact.\n\n\n\nKeytruda, the biggest product in Merck\u2019s portfolio, generated sales of $7.84 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. Keytruda sales benefited from rapid uptake across earlier-stage indications like triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Continued strong momentum in metastatic indications also boosted sales growth. Keytruda sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.73 billion and our estimate of $7.62 billion.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter, U.S. sales of Keytruda benefited from approximately $200 million of wholesale inventory buy-in, which is expected to reverse in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nAlliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter.\n\n\n\nAlliance revenues from Lynparza increased 18% to $365 million in the quarter, driven by increased global demand. Lenvima alliance revenues totaled $255 million, up 14% due to favorable timing of shipments in some international markets.\n\n\n\nWelireg recorded sales of $160 million, up 123%. Sales benefited from the increased uptake for the additional indication of previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma in the United States.\n\n\n\nIn vaccines, sales of HPV vaccines \u2014 Gardasil and Gardasil 9 \u2014 fell 18% to $1.55 billion due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher sales in most international markets, particularly Japan. Gardasil sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion and our estimate of $1.71 billion.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, sales benefited from price as well as demand, partially offset by unfavorable CDC purchasing patterns. Sales declined in China due to a significant decline in demand due to unfavorable economic conditions.\n\n\n\nMerck announced its decision to temporarily halt shipments of Gardasil in China from February through at least mid-year 2025.\n\n\n\nGiven the economic conditions in China, Merck withdrew its previously issued long-term guidance of generating more than $11 billion in sales form Gardasil by 2030.\n\n\n\nProquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $594 million, up 9%. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq, fell 25% to $139 million, while Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) vaccine sales declined 12% to $74 million. Sales of Vaxneuvance, Merck\u2019s pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, were $161 million, down 9%, primarily due to lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure, partially offset by growth from launches in Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Capvaxive generated sales of $50 million in the fourth quarter, driven by demand from the retail pharmacy channel.\n\n\n\nIn the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine, Bridion injection generated sales of $449 million in the quarter, up 5%. While the drug\u2019s sales benefited from higher demand and pricing in the United States, they were partially offset by generic competition in certain ex-U.S. markets (mainly Europe and Japan).\n\n\n\nPrevymis recorded sales of $215 million, up 23% year over year.\n\n\n\nJanuvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales declined 36% year over year to $487 million. The drug\u2019s sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets, mainly Europe and Asia Pacific region. Supply constraints in China also hurt sales.\n\n\n\nSales of Lagevrio (molnupiravir) declined 37% to $121 million in the quarter.\n\n\n\nNew PAH drug Winrevair, which was approved in March 2024, generated sales of $200 million compared with $149 million in the previous quarter. On the conference call, the company said that most of the sales came from the U.S. market as the company is steadily adding new patients. However, the holiday season hurt demand trends to some extent in the fourth quarter. In outside U.S. markets, the initial launch is progressing well.\n\n\n\nMerck\u2019s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.40 billion, up 9% year over year (13% excluding Fx impact), driven by higher demand and pricing for both Companion Animal and Livestock product portfolios. The Animal Health segment\u2019s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate, both of which were $1.34 billion.\n\n\n\nSales of companion animal products rose 10% to $508 million, driven by higher pricing.\n\n\n\nSales of livestock products rose 14% $889 million, driven by higher demand for poultry products, higher pricing and inclusion of sales from newly acquired Elanco\u2019s aqua portfolio.",

Image credit: Shutterstock/Below the Sky\n\nMerck KGaA reaffirmed its strong performance in the healthcare sector in its FY 2024 earnings report, but provided little additional information on ongoing acquisition talks with SpringWorks Therapeutics.\n\nSpeculation surrounding a potential transaction between the two companies first emerged on 10 February 2025, when Reuters reported that Merck KGaA was engaged in discussions to acquire SpringWorks. The same day, Merck KGaA acknowledged the negotiations, but stressed that there was no certainty a deal would be finalised. SpringWorks\u2019 stock price surged by 34% following the disclosure of the discussions, pushing its market capitalisation over $4bn.\n\nDuring a 6 March press call, Merck KGaA\u2019s CEO Bel\u00e9n Garijo stated that there \u201cis very little that we can say at this time,\u201d regarding the ongoing talks.\n\nA successful acquisition would provide Merck KGaA with SpringWorks\u2019 portfolio of targeted oncology therapies, including Ogsiveo (nirogacestat), which is approved for desmoid treating tumours, as well as the MEK inhibitor Gomekli (mirdametinib), which was recently approved in February 2025 for treating neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a rare genetic disorder.\n\nAccording to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center, Gomekli is projected to generate up to $564m in global sales by 2030, while Ogsiveo sales are expected to reach $1.2bn by the same year.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nGarijo emphasised that Merck KGaA\u2019s broader merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy remains focused on targeted, lower-risk deals aimed at strengthening its life sciences and healthcare portfolio, particularly through late-stage in-licencing opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be absolutely limited to clear cut, low risk deals that will create value from very early on. So rest assured, we will fully comply with this and stay extremely disciplined when executing our M&A agenda,\u201d said Garijo in a call to investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s healthcare division reported 7% net sales growth in 2024, reaching \u20ac8.5bn ($9.2bn). Oncology was a key driver of this performance, with sales in the segment increasing by 12.7% to \u20ac2bn ($2.17bn). The company has made moves in the oncology space in recent years, including an October 2024 acquisition of Modifi Biosciences, a Yale University-spinout focused on DNA repair-targeting cancer therapies. Merck KGaA acquired all outstanding shares of Modifi through a subsidiary for an upfront payment of $30m, with the potential for additional milestone payments totalling up to $1.3bn.\n\nMerck KGaA\u2019s top-selling product in 2024 was Erbitux (cetuximab), which generated \u20ac1.16bn ($1.25bn) in revenue. The drug \u2013 a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of certain head and neck cancers as well as colorectal cancer \u2013 is expected to see continued sales growth, with GlobalData\u2019s projections estimating it could generate $1.9bn in annual revenue by 2030.",

Public discussion of the dispute between the two companies is expected Wednesday at an investor conference.\n\nKeytruda was the highest selling drug worldwide last year, raking in nearly $30 billion in sales. With patent protections set to expire in 2028, Merck\u2019s moves to tweak its formulation could goose sales while the protections hold and potentially extend the patent runway.\n\nMerck began collaborating with the South Korean company Alteogen in 2020 to incorporate its hyaluronidase enzymes into an injectable Keytruda formulation. Last year, Merck alleged to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that seven patents for Halozyme\u2019s own hyaluronidase enzyme Mdase are too broad and therefore should not have been granted, according to the WSJ.\n\nHalozyme countered Merck\u2019s claims, saying that a new Keytruda formulation that uses the hyaluronidase enzyme infringes on those patents, and that Merck needs to sign a licensing agreement.\n\nThese petitions suggest the company is \u201ctipping their hand that the Halozyme patents might be a problem for them,\u201d Zachary Silbersher, co-founder of patent consulting firm Markman Advisors, told the WSJ.\n\nThe status of Alteogen\u2019s enzymes in the U.S. is unclear.\n\nIn November 2024, Merck\u2019s Phase III trial showed that the subcutaneous injection performed equally as well as the more invasive infusion delivery of Keytruda. Merck has estimated that if the injectable version is approved, up to 40% of patients taking Keytruda will switch within two years, according to the WSJ. The FDA is currently reviewing the application for the new formulation and Merck CEO Robert Davis said at the J.P. Morgan Conference in January that he expects to launch it this year, according to Seeking Alpha .",

Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other psychedelic stocks.\n\nThe Therapeutic Potential and Investment Boom in Psychedelic Medicine\n\nIn contrast to drugs like cocaine or marijuana, psychedelics are strong and give users access to a kind of \"alternate reality.\" One class of hallucinogenic substances that can produce unusual states of consciousness is psychedelics. LSD and chemicals originating from plants are among the many chemical substances included in this class. Psychedelics have the power to change or heighten feelings, thoughts, and energy levels, which frequently leads to spiritual experiences. They are divided into two primary categories: serotonergic chemicals (like LSD) and empathogens and dissociative drugs (like PCP). These medications are being investigated for therapeutic uses in addition to recreational ones, and they have shown promise in the treatment of several illnesses, including opiate addiction, severe depressive disorders, treatment-resistant depression, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe revival of interest in psychedelics has been greatly aided by venture capital investors. Startups in this sector saw a spike in investor interest around the beginning of 2020, which was dubbed the \"psychedelic renaissance.\" On February 16, 2023, Clara Burtenshaw, a partner at Neo Kuma Ventures, the biggest European venture capital fund specializing in psychedelic investments, shared her excitement about psychedelic healthcare, saying:\n\n\u201cPsychedelic healthcare is a very exciting area because it\u2019s this apex of drugs, clinics, and experimental treatments.\u201d\n\nGrowth and Promise of the Psychedelic Drugs Market\n\nMany psychedelic-focused pharmaceutical businesses are working to have their medications approved by the government. Psilocybin and other hallucinogens are showing great promise in treating disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The US psychedelic drugs market is projected to grow from $4.51 billion in 2025 to $15.62 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 16.8%. This growth is part of a larger global trend, with the worldwide market expected to reach $11.93 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 16.9%.\n\nPsilocybin (magic mushrooms) is the most widely used psychedelic drug in the United States, with an estimated 8 million American adults using it in 2023, according to a survey conducted by RAND Corporation. Around 12% of respondents reported lifetime use, and 3.1% used it in the past year. LSD use has also risen significantly, particularly among individuals aged 18-25, with usage increasing from 0.9% in 2002 to 4% in 2019. The LSD market is projected to grow from $145.9 million in 2024 to $265.7 million by 2034. MDMA, although not providing specific usage data, remains popular, especially in research for PTSD treatment. Ketamine has gained attention for its depression treatment potential, particularly with the FDA approval of Spravato nasal spray.",

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil's demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck's securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \"GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\" In addition, the current report stated Merck's \"decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\"\n\nOn this news, Merck's stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

This year\u2019s global campaign theme, \u2018#Accelerate Action,\u2019 was also highlighted during the gathering.\n\n\u201cAt Merck Biopharma Korea, it has become a norm to minimize out-of-hours contact for colleagues who are working reduced hours to accommodate their children\u2019s school schedules.\u201d Merck Biopharma Korea Head of Strategy and Operations Excellence Cho Gi-do said, \u201cIn a corporate culture where equal parenting is encouraged, I feel confident that I can successfully balance both childcare and my career in the future.\u201d\n\nMerck Biopharma Korea Regulatory Affairs Manager Jo Hye-lim also said, \u201cMerck Biopharma Korea fosters an environment where all employees, including team members and managers, are encouraged to utilize our workplace policies freely and without discrimination.\u201d\n\nJo stressed that she was able to resume a key role without any career gap after returning from maternity leave, which boosted her confidence and sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nMerck Biopharma Korea\u2019s commitment to gender equality and family-friendly policies is being widely recognized.\n\nIn April last year, it was selected as an exemplary company for work-family balance at a low birth rate response forum hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Council, and in October last year, the company received the Minister of Health and Welfare Award at the 4th Population 2.1 Seminar for its outstanding support for parental leave.\n\nTo support employees with children or those planning to start a family, Merck Biopharma Korea has implemented various policies, including shortened working hours for pregnancy and childcare, support for substitute workers during parental leave, and paid leave for prenatal checkups and fertility treatments.\n\nThe company also offers flexible work arrangements and allows employees to work remotely twice a week, regardless of gender, age, family structure, or job title.\n\n\u201cThrough this event, we gained deeper insights into what employees genuinely need to achieve a better work-life balance, regardless of gender or job level,\u201d Merck Biopharma Korea GM Christoph Hamann said. \u201cMerck Biopharma Korea has been recognized as a leading role model in work-family balance by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Seoul Metropolitan Government.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in November last year, the company served as co-chair of the Family Friendly Future Forum (FFFF) hosted by the European Chamber of Commerce in Korea (ECCK), Hamann added.\n\nHamann stressed that the company will continue collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure Korea\u2019s long-term sustainability in addressing demographic challenges.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 16\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 3.50%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a New Jersey-based multinational pharmaceutical company that offers innovative health solutions to its consumers. The company reported revenue of $15.6 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same period a year earlier. The company has solidified its position in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its leading cancer treatment, Keytruda, playing a pivotal role in advancing cancer care while driving significant revenue growth. Its strong market presence has enabled Merck to generate robust cash flow, supporting shareholder returns. For fiscal 2024, Keytruda sales surged 18% year-over-year, reaching $29.5 billion.\n\nOn January 28, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, maintaining its previous payout. The company has consistently increased its dividends for 14 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of March 3, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.50%.\n\nSince the start of 2025, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has declined by over 6% and in the past 12 months, it fell by nearly 25%. The recent decline in the stock price is largely due to the company\u2019s revenue forecast for 2025, which came in below market expectations. It projected revenue between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $67.31 billion. In addition, the company\u2019s outlook has been affected by the temporary halt in Gardasil shipments to China, though deliveries are anticipated to resume by mid-2025.\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 10th on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

We think that investors have missed some encouraging factors underlying the profit figures.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Merck\n\nNYSE:MRK Earnings and Revenue History March 4th 2025\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\n\nTo properly understand Merck's profit results, we need to consider the US$4.2b expense attributed to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Merck doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Merck's Profit Performance\n\nBecause unusual items detracted from Merck's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Merck's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at an extremely impressive rate over the last year. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. While conducting our analysis, we found that Merck has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Merck's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\" Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \"not recovered to the level we had expected.\" Following this news, Merck's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck's stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nDEADLINE: April 14, 2025 Shareholders should not delay in registering for this class action.

(Purdue University photo)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 Purdue University\u2019s position as a key player in the future of the pharmaceutical industry will be spotlighted at the Fast Company Grill on Saturday (March 8) during the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference & Festivals in Austin, Texas.\n\nPresident Mung Chiang will take the stage at the Brands That Matter panel titled \u201cInnovating What Matters: Driving Pharma Forward,\u201d along with Sean Bruich, senior vice president of artificial intelligence and data at Amgen, and Tatyana Kanzaveli, chief operating officer of Open Health Network. The panel will examine the transformation of the pharmaceutical industry through AI, strategic collaboration and next-generation innovation while discussing the importance of cross-industry partnerships to accelerate medical breakthroughs.\n\nPurdue has emerged as a global leader in pharmaceutical and biotech innovation, collaborating with corporate leaders and pharma partners to tackle critical issues facing the industry. In January, in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company and Merck & Co. Inc., Purdue launched the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, a collaborative effort to pioneer advances in making medicines. The consortium will elevate and enhance pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical advanced manufacturing by developing disruptive innovative technologies, autonomous systems, and smart AI and digital technology, together with industrially relevant education and training for the next generation of scientific leaders and researchers. The collaboration also underscores a commitment to onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing while bolstering domestic production.\n\nPurdue also teamed with Lilly this past August to form the Eli Lilly and Company and Purdue University Research Alliance Center, which serves as an essential hub for collaborative exploration of new technologies that enhance every phase of pharmaceutical research, from discovery to delivery.\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturing is a key component of Purdue\u2019s One Health initiative, which advances knowledge and innovation related to animal, human and environmental health and well-being through novel interdisciplinary research and industry partnerships.\n\nKelly Hiller, vice president of marketing for Purdue Brand Studio, will also participate in a high-profile panel, \u201cBold Moves: How Cultural Resonance Creates Brand Impact,\u201d on Saturday during SXSW. That event, which features a fireside chat with Hiller; Jeff Beer, editor-in-chief of Fast Company\u2019s Brands That Matter; and Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer of e.l.f. Beauty, will target marketing executives and industry leaders.\n\nPurdue\u2019s overall presence at SXSW, highlighted by the panel featuring Chiang, serves as a key starting point for the university\u2019s enterprise marketing campaign. Supported by Purdue Brand Studio, the university\u2019s central marketing and communications team and its own in-house agency, SXSW provides a major platform to amplify Purdue\u2019s renowned reputation while showcasing its thought leadership and global impact across industries.\n\nAbout Purdue University\n\nPurdue University is a public research university leading with excellence at scale.

            "content": "Analysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 10.13\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New Jersey. The company offers innovative health solutions to its consumers. The stock has declined by nearly 10% since the start of 2025. The recent drop in stock price is primarily attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance for 2025. The company projected revenue between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $67.31 billion. Another factor impacting its outlook is the temporary suspension of Gardasil shipments to China, with deliveries expected to resume by mid-2025.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $15.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 7% increase from the same period the previous year. The company has strengthened its leadership in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its flagship cancer treatment, Keytruda, playing a key role in transforming cancer care and driving substantial revenue growth. Strong market positioning has allowed Merck to generate significant cash flow, supporting shareholder returns. In fiscal 2024, Keytruda sales climbed 18% year-over-year, reaching $29.5 billion.\n\nOn January 28, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been growing its payouts for 14 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.62%, as of February 26.\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 9th on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Big Pharma Is Still Alive\n\nThe last few years have seen the healthcare sector change radically thanks to biotech innovation. The most visible part was mRNA vaccines, but the arrival of gene therapies, cheap genome sequencing, or stem cell therapies are all there to usher in a new era of medical marvels (you can follow the links for deeper coverage of these topics).\n\nMost of these innovations have been done by smaller companies, and R&D efforts by the biggest pharmaceutical companies have often been not very successful .\n\nNevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is still dominated by a few giant corporations. Such blue-chip multi-billion dollar companies are not only the historically dominant players but might as well stay on top for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is that? How is it that even radical innovation might not threaten incumbent companies?\n\nThe Big Pharma Business Model\n\nTo understand how \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can stay on top, we can look at the example of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe innovation itself was very much invented by BioNTech, which took an actually quite old scientific concept and turned it into an entire technology platform.\n\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it was the perfect time for such a \u201cprogrammable\u201d vaccine to shine. And it did. But BioNTech did not commercialize it themselves. They partnered with Pfizer to handle approval, production, and commercialization quickly. After all, rival Moderna and countless other companies were pushing for their own COVID-19 vaccine, so time was of the essence.\n\nSimply put, Pfizer brought to BioNTech needed resources in manufacturing, funding, distribution, sales network, clinical trials, handling of regulators, etc\u2026\n\nInnovation vs Acquisitions\n\nAnother way for Big Pharma to stay relevant is simply to buy out successful biotech companies.\n\nBiotechnology is a field littered with failed projects and companies. So when one turns out successful, both founder and investors might want to cash out after 10-15 years of patience, hard work, and a bit of luck.\n\nAnd who could be more qualified than Big Pharma firms, able also to take the innovative drugs and bring them forth to their network of tens of thousands of doctors at once?\n\nThey also have the needed financial firepower. For example, with $512B of market capitalization, Johnson & Johnson, the largest pharmaceutical company in 2021 by revenues , registered a net income of almost $18B and a free cash flow of $17B.\n\nMany biotech firms, astonishingly from a scientific and innovation point of view, often trade below a billion dollars. So, if you look at the yearly free cash flow of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, this is a lot of dry powder for acquisitions.\n\nTop 5 Blue Chip Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nTo qualify as a \u201cblue chip,\u201d we consider only the top 20 companies according to their 2021 revenues .\n\nThe term \u201ctop\u201d is rather subjective, as is here a mix of existing drug portfolio, historical performance, R&D pipeline, and financial position. We will highlight some of the central parts of the business and incoming important innovations instead of going deep into the entire therapeutics portfolio or the company's financial results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $ 1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences.\n\nOncology.\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe company has grown sales by 6% yearly in the last 20 years, with a 13.2% return to shareholders in the last 10 years. The stock is also one of the rare \u201cdividend aristocrats,\u201d having rising dividends every year for 60 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, Johnson & Johnson is a very safe bet on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on long-term holdings and the stock price compounding while also giving a moderate but stable and growing dividend.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nThe Danish company is highly focused on diabetes & metabolic diseases like obesity, together making 88% of the company's revenues.\n\nThe focus on obesity is rather recent, with significant growth in this segment in 2022\n\nThe company is also working on an expanding rare disease portfolio and chronic diseases like kidney or liver pathologies.\n\nThe company is well-placed to benefit from the worldwide rise of chronic metabolic diseases. This should provide very safe revenue streams and continuous growth in the short term.\n\nA key vulnerability for Novo Nordisk in the long term is the possibility of permanently curing diabetes through stem cells, gene editing, or another new therapeutic method. This is something we have discussed previously when covering Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics. This is more likely to happen soon for type-1 diabetes, with type-2, the most common, much more likely to be still treated by reducing symptoms for a longer period of time.\n\nSo Novo Nordisk provides a safe place for conservative investors, but they will want to monitor tightly the development of the diabetes market and the arrival of potential competitors. The entry of Novo Nordisk into new segments like chronic diseases and obesity might be the right option to sustain the company in the long run.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon .\n\nSo far, some of the consequently lost revenues have been compensated by the pandemic-boosted sales of the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nThe company is mostly active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nThe new start product of Merck is Keytruda, a cancer drug (monoclonal antibody), with sales growing 16%-27% over the last 3 years. It is already approved for multiple cancers and has 13 new applications under review in phase 3 of clinical trials.\n\nThe company's revenues and earnings have grown significantly in the last 3 years, especially in 2022.\n\nThis financial success should persist until 2028, when Keytruda loses its patent protection. So, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company can reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nBut Pfizer is not just mRNA vaccines, with a total of 10 products with more than $1B of sales per year.\n\nThe company is targeting new product launches: 4 in 2023 and up to 12 by 2024.\n\nIts' management is keen to insist that the growth story is not Covid-dependent, with plans to bring non-Covid sales from the current average of $50B to $84B by 2030.\n\nThey also insist that the windfall profits from the pandemic will \u201callow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation\u201d\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybean, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nBayer's valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of RounUp to cause cancer.\n\nSince then, the company's valuation has fallen to less than what it paid for acquiring Monsanto. This has been a distraction from its solid performance in the seeds, other pesticides, and healthcare segments.",

(NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best magic formula stocks for 2025.\n\nThe Magic Formula, as defined by Joel Greenblatt in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market, entails evaluating companies based on two metrics: earnings yield (EBIT/enterprise value) and return on capital. Greenblatt is one of the few fund managers who have regularly achieved double-digit percentage returns during their careers on Wall Street. His former business, Gotham Capital, had an incredible run from 1985 until 1994. During this time, the fund generated a net return of 34%. That said, even he was conscious that this method seemed too wonderful and easy to be true, which is why, throughout his book, he frequently questions the reader: what is the assurance, if any, that this investment technique genuinely works and is not just a fluke? In any case, he frequently underlines that the Magic Formula investment technique does not encourage investing in firms with average or low return on capital since the strategy creates a rating system to identify top companies with the best return on capital and earnings yield.\n\nHowever, like with any method, there is some risk involved, and the Magic Formula does not ensure success. Since the strategy is based on past data, it\u2019d be difficult to say if it could work well in the future, especially if market conditions change. Incidentally, a backtest of market performance from 2003 to 2015 found that the Magic Formula approach produced annualized returns of 11.4%, while the S&P 500 produced returns of 8.7%, thus failing to live up to Greenblatt\u2019s inflated claims despite beating the benchmark. Greenblatt himself admits that the Magic Formula fails in many cases and performs poorly in some others, particularly when the holding time is too short. The investor stated the following:\n\n\u201cMost people just won\u2019t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won\u2019t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy\u2014 usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it.\u201d\n\nMore recently, however, Joel Greenblatt\u2019s fund appears to have lagged behind the overall market as a result of his investment strategy. As of the end of January, the Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has only returned 10.86% over the last five years, while the S&P 500 has returned 15.17%. Nonetheless, the Magic Formula is one of many investment strategies that investors can opt for as they navigate the stock market.",

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.59%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.63%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the pharmaceutical company had lost 8.46% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 0.63% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.42% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Merck in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.16, up 4.35% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $15.75 billion, indicating a 0.16% downward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nMRK's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.01 per share and revenue of $65.19 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +17.78% and +1.6%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Merck. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 2.67% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, Merck is carrying a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nDigging into valuation, Merck currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.05. This denotes a discount relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 12.89.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MRK currently boasts a PEG ratio of 0.79. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry stood at 1.45 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 201, placing it within the bottom 20% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

(Photo: Sierra Space)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sierra Space, a leading commercial space company and defense tech prime that is Building a Platform in Space to Benefit Life on Earth\u00ae, announced today new initiatives to advance research and development of biopharmaceutical solutions in low-Earth orbit during the Dream Chaser spaceplane's inaugural mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The plans include conducting experiments to identify new ways to deliver cancer therapies to patients on Earth, in collaboration with Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada.\n\nThe collaboration highlights the reason Dream Chaser was designed for smooth re-entry to Earth with the ability to land on commercial runways at fewer than 1.5g\u2019s, a capability that allows for safe return of experiments without rough splashdowns in the ocean or hard landings in the desert. Dream Chaser\u2019s ability to land on runways also provides for rapid access to unload critical cargo from the spaceplane, which is a key advantage when dealing with sensitive biopharma materials.\n\n\u201cWe know there are vast benefits to conducting science experiments in low-Earth orbit, but we also need to safely return the results of these experiments back to Earth,\u201d said Paul Reichert, Merck Principal Investigator. \u201cDream Chaser\u2019s ability to safely return payloads from the ISS laboratory via the same runway as a commercial airplane will greatly increase the survival rate of these delicate materials and hopefully accelerate the advancements of critical treatments.\u201d\n\nAmong the research initiatives being undertaken in collaboration with Merck is the investigation of experimental formulations of monoclonal antibody therapies for cancer. This research aims to leverage the effects of microgravity to develop high-concentration amorphous suspensions, paving the way for improved therapeutic drug delivery methods. For instance, new formulations could allow for injections administered subcutaneously rather than through intravenous transfusion. Additional potential benefits include the creation of therapies with greater stability, potentially enabling storage without the need for refrigeration.\n\nAll of this will be made possible in the Merck Formulation Research Platform that will ride aboard Dream Chaser. The Merck Formulation Research Platform was developed in collaboration with the Merck 3D Printing Department and Sierra Space.\n\nThis is the first announcement of a commercial contact partner for Sierra Space\u2019s upcoming Dream Chaser mission, highlighting payload \u201crideshare\u201d capabilities of the spaceplane. Cargo will also include NASA supplies for astronauts currently aboard the space station.\n\nSierra Space recently completed and passed its Joint Test 10B milestone in collaboration with NASA on Dream Chaser, demonstrating its ability to power-on, air-cool, and exchange data with powered payloads inside its pressurized cabin. This included testing of cold-stowage payloads that carry scientific matter.\n\nFor additional information about Sierra Space\u2019s work in microgravity, download this report.\n\nAbout Sierra Space\n\nSierra Space is a leading commercial space company at the forefront of innovation and the commercialization of space in the Orbital Age\u00ae, building an end-to-end business and technology platform in space to benefit life on Earth. With more than 30 years and 500 missions of space flight heritage, the company is reinventing both space transportation with Dream Chaser\u00ae, the world\u2019s only commercial spaceplane, and the future of space destinations with the company\u2019s inflatable and expandable space station technology. Using commercial business models, the company is also delivering orbital services to commercial, DoD and national security organizations, expanding production capacity to meet the needs of constellation programs. In addition, Sierra Space builds a host of systems and subsystems across solar power, mechanics and motion control, environmental control, life support, propulsion and thermal control, offering myriad space-as-a-service solutions for the new space economy.",

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit.\n\nCLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:\n\nhttps://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=132384&wire=3\n\nMRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \u201cthrough at least midyear\u201d to facilitate a \u201crapid reduction of inventory.\u201d Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \u201cnot recovered to the level we had expected.\u201d Following this news, Merck\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck\u2019s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.\n\nWHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other best vaccine stocks to buy now.\n\nWhat Will Trump\u2019s Tariffs Mean for the Pharma Industry?\n\nOn February 24, CNBC reported that President Trump declared that sweeping US tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada \u201cwill go forward\u201d in a statement before the expiry of their month-long delay on their implementation. When asked about the postponed tariffs at a White House press conference, President Trump said:\n\n\u201cThe tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that foreign nations have been taking advantage of the US in \u201cjust about everything,\u201d reiterating his plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the tariffs will go forward, yes, and we\u2019re going to make up a lot of territory,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to talk about these tariffs and the ways they could affect the US pharmaceutical sector. Although he was unclear about the exact intention behind these tariffs, he said that he did not consider the pharmaceutical industry to be all that special with respect to other verticals, including technology and industrials, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nTo him, the tariffs are not just about the generics or branded but are rather more about how the biotech or pharmaceutical industry fits into the grander plans around scaling up domestic manufacturing. Most biotech and pharma companies have a significant presence in the US. However, questions of whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America still stand without answers.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTariffs and On-Shore Capacity in the US\n\nAlthough Holz was unclear about the answers to such questions, he did say that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. The pharmaceutical companies would say that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as part of the Biden administration is incredibly crippling, and the business that needs to be tied up to make the earnings based on that is very challenging for the sector. Adding Trump\u2019s tariffs to the list would complicate the sector possibly more than others, with the tariffs acting as a \u201cthird strike\u201d against the US pharma sector.",

Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck\u2019s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China\u2019s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck\u2019s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck\u2019s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 \u201cthere was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%\u201d \u201cprimarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.\n\nABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP is one of the world\u2019s leading law firms representing investors in securities fraud cases.

            "content": "Image: Holley Robinson, EDRM with AI.\n\nIn Li v. Merck & Co., Inc., 2025 WL 429013 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2025), the court addressed a number of discovery disputes in a lawsuit by a terminated employee against her former employer. I have written three detailed blogs about the case:\n\nOne important holding of Li is that, on the somewhat unique facts presented, the Court held that plaintiff\u2019s consulting an attorney to find out her rights is not \u201cnecessarily\u201d the same thing as contemplating or anticipating litigation for purposes of triggering the common-law duty to preserve. Ms. Li admitted that she was looking for a lawyer on December 12, 2022. She contended, however, that her duty to preserve did not arise until her employment was terminated on March 10, 2023. Ms. Li \u201csays that she is a first generation immigrant who was entirely unfamiliar with her rights and that she sought legal consultation in an effort to understand her rights.\u201d\n\nIn the first blog, I suggest that the Li court considered a subjective factor in an objective test. While Sedona correctly states that the test is \u201cwhether a reasonable party in the same factual circumstances would have reasonably foreseen litigation,\u201d I have some questions about the Li Court\u2019s conclusion. What facts led Ms. Li to consult counsel at that time? It must have been more than mere academic curiosity about worker\u2019s rights to cause her action. We do not know what was said to the lawyer (privilege?) or what the lawyer said to Ms. Li (privilege?). What if the lawyer said \u201cyou\u2019ve got a great case, but you don\u2019t have damages until you\u2019re terminated?\u201d What if the lawyer simply said, \u201ceven though I have not been retained, I think you have a duty to preserve?\u201d\n\nA second interesting aspect of Li is that the court permitted discovery relating to spoliation. It compelled Ms. Li to answer interrogatories asking if she or anyone else had deleted or destroyed any information requested in defendants\u2019 discovery. For example, one interrogatory asked: \u201cTo the extent YOU deleted, destroyed, or threw away, directed anyone else to delete, destroy, or throw away, or are aware of anyone else deleting, destroying, or throwing away ANY DOCUMENTS called for by any of DEFENDANTS\u2019 document requests, describe in detail when, why, and how such documents were deleted, destroyed, or thrown away.\u201d This discovery on discovery was permitted without any predicate showing of any failure to produce responsive information. Cf. Court-Ordered Production of a \u201cDestruction/Unavailable\u201d Log (Oct. 18, 2024).\n\nA third holding addressed \u201cdocument unitization.\u201d Defendants complained of pervasive unitization problems. \u201cDocument unitization\u201d is the issue presented when a number of separate documents are combined as a single file, without natural breaks. If, for example, four separate documents are scanned as a single PDF, a search \u201chit\u201d on any one of them will return all four of them, resulting in false positives that are a waste of time and resources.[1]\n\nProper document unitization maintains the organizational structure of the original documents. It is logical and facilitates use in litigation support platforms. Improper unitization \u2013 jumbling a bunch of unrelated documents as a single large PDF \u2013 is an unsound practice. Document Unitization (Aug. 10, 2021).\n\nLitigation review software generally offers technological solutions to unitization problems. The Li court used sampling to evaluate the unitization complaint:\n\nWhile the Court does not want to review Plaintiff\u2019s entire document production, the Court would like to see a demonstration that the problems Defendants have identified are pervasive and that the issue is not just a couple of unfortunate examples. Accordingly, the Court ORDERS Defendants to file 200 to 300 pages of Plaintiff\u2019s produced documents, in the form produced by Plaintiff, that illustrate the problems Defendants see in her document production. Li v. Merck & Co., Inc., 2025 WL 429013 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2025).\n\nDocument unitization is an issue that could be addressed in a Rule 26(f) conference of the parties and an ESI Protocol. In the prior blog, I presented some suggested Protocol language.\n\nThe Li decision importantly addresses several issues that arise frequently.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] The term also applies to the opposite situation \u2013 where a single document is presented as multiple files. For example, a ten-page document may be produced as ten separate, single-page, files.",

The company seeks $4.7 million in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, these are performance grants and are dispersed after the company creates the new jobs and invests in the facilities,\u201d said Kurt Foreman, President and CEO of the Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP).\n\nThis project is expected to create 375 jobs and will begin construction this year, with plans to be fully operational by 2030.\n\n\u201cSounds like a long time away, but it takes years to build, fit out, and test these highly sophisticated facilities,\u201d Foreman said.\n\nMerck is considering developing the manufacturing facility at the Chestnut Run Innovation & Science Park also known as CRISP, located in unincorporated Wilmington.\n\n\u201cDPP is focused on the life sciences as one of its key focus areas since our inception, and Delaware has a prominent history in the sector which this project would build on and expand.\u201d\n\nHe points out Delaware\u2019s long history of investments in Delaware\u2019s Life science sector.\n\n\u201cThis is a competitive project and could be a game changer for Delaware and bring new jobs and investment\u201d. The company would offer career opportunities for Delawareans and contribute heavily to the state and county tax bases. Winning this project for Delaware would distinguish our state further as an ideal location for Life Sciences and innovation.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1891, Merck is an American-based company that uses cutting-edge technology to develop vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and biological therapies to help humans and animals improve and sustain their lives.\n\nMerck\u2019s headquarters currently reside in Rahway, New Jersey. Their manufacturing team looks to partner with external manufacturers to manufacture products, expand internal manufacturing networks, and build new sites.\n\nMerck has invested in designing a new manufacturing facility that\u2019s 450,000 square feet with multiple buildings for lab, laboratory operations, production, and warehousing, with the estimated cost exceeding $900 million.\n\nTo run the facility in its current state, Merck would be creating 375 new jobs that span from lab operations to facility management.\n\n\u201c But all the jobs, what they do have in common, they all come with family-sustaining, salaries and benefits and that\u2019s what\u2019s most exciting about the project for us, and why we looked for siting locations that had access to talent, and especially in biologics,\u201d said Tim Keppel, Merck\u2019s Executive Director of Manufacturing Network Strategy.\n\n\u201cAnd so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we had been focused on Delaware and the growing biologics talent pool\u2013we think that we could also enhance if we were to select Delaware. So we\u2019re excited about this opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what Merck\u2019s commitment was to using Delaware\u2019s workforce for this project, Keppel confirmed Merck\u2019s preferences to utilize Delaware-based contracting and tradespeople to perform work for this site.\n\n\u201cWe have relationships with existing architectural engineering firms, the ones that are already been working on design, but also on the construction management side, that already know our policy, building standards, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Delaware is a strong contender, Merck is still evaluating other locations and finalizing key aspects before making a final decision.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a signed lease\u2013but we are in the final stages of making that decision,\u201d Keppel said.\n\nOnce a lease or purchase agreement is signed, construction and hiring will commence immediately. Keppel said that the decision is time-sensitive and that construction would begin immediately after approval.\n\nMerck\u2019s application was motioned for approval by the council.\n\nClaudia is a Philadelphia-based journalist and reporter passionate about storytelling that informs and engages the community.

The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024.\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China \u201cthrough at least midyear\u201d to facilitate a \u201crapid reduction of inventory,\u201d citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had \u201cnot recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.\u201d Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030.\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further.\n\nWhat Is The Lawsuit About?\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\n\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.\n\nContact Us To Participate or Learn More:\n\nIf you wish to learn more about this action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact us at:\n\nLaw Offices of Frank R.

            "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Merck (MRK).\n\nMerck currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRK\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MRK\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Merck here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Merck, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil's demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck's securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \"GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\" In addition, the current report stated Merck's \"decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\"\n\nOn this news, Merck's stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

The FDA granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster drug, Dupixent, for a new indication, bullous pemphigoid. Ionis Pharmaceuticals announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results.\n\nHere's a recap of the week\u2019s most important stories.\n\nIONS\u2019 Better-Than-Expected Q4 Results\n\nIONS reported better-than-expected top and bottom-line numbers for the fourth quarter. Its loss of 66 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.12 per share. Total revenues of $227 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137.5 million.

Approvals for these two indications were based on data from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 studies. Welireg is already approved for both indications in the United States.\n\nFDA\u2019s Priority Tag to SNY\u2019s Dupixent sBLA for Bullous Pemphigoid\n\nSanofi and Regeneron announced that the FDA has accepted and granted priority review to an sBLA seeking approval of Dupixent for treating bullous pemphigoid, a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing skin disease.

The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \u201cthrough at least midyear\u201d to facilitate a \u201crapid reduction of inventory.\u201d Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had \u201cnot recovered to the level we had expected.\u201d Following this news, Merck\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck\u2019s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.\n\nWHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

            "content": "The R&D World Index saw a slight gain last week amidst a landscape of innovation and cost-cutting within global industries. Pharma giants Eli Lilly and Merck announced a partnership with Purdue University to launch the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, aimed at bolstering domestic pharmaceutical production. However, automotive supplier Continental AG revealed further job cuts in its R&D segment due to weak demand and competition, mirroring broader challenges within the European automotive sector. The week also saw strategic collaborations in the battery sector and the introduction of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e, featuring the company\u2019s in-house developed cellular chip.\n\nHealthcare & Pharmaceuticals\n\n1. Pharma consortium formed by Lilly and Merck\n\nAutomotive & Manufacturing\n\n2. Continental AG to cut 3,000 R&D jobs\n\nPharma and RDW Index members Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, and Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey, announced last week that they are partnering with Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, to launch the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, which will research and develop new production technologies. The consortium brings together companies invested in pharmaceutical manufacturing to span the value chain, including big pharma, startups, equipment manufacturers, instrument manufacturers, packaging companies, and venture capitalists. Their initial focus will be on bolstering domestic production, which could be especially important as new tariffs threaten to raise costs and exacerbate shortages.Lilly has already said it will invest $3 billion in these efforts, including expanding a manufacturing facility it bought in April 2024 and adding new capabilities to produce injectable medicines.Lilly also recently invested $9 billion in an Indiana manufacturing site and opened a new facility in North Carolina.Purdue\u2019s Elizabeth Topp (Professor in the Department of Industrial and Molecular Pharmaceutics) said they\u2019re very keen on having companies of all kinds join their consortium in the form of equipment donations or donations of computational resources.\n\nAutomotive supplier Continental AG, Hanover, Germany, announced last week that its automotive branch will cut 3,000 jobs in its R&D segment by the end of 2026. This action comes on top of 7,000 job cuts already announced in an overall restructuring program that has been in place for over a year. The company plans to reduce its R&D ratio to below 10% by 2027. Less than half of the job cuts will take place in Germany, with sites in Babenhausen and Frankfurt being the most affected, with a 12% and 5% reduction planned, respectively. Europe\u2019s overall automotive sector is struggling with weak demand, higher production costs, and competition from China, which has led many companies to announce layoffs and plant closures.\n\n3. CATL and Volkswagen sign battery MOU\n\n4. Mercedes-Benz to shift production abroad\n\n5. Nikola Corporation files for bankruptcy\n\nCATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd.), a company in Fujian, China, signed a strategic memorandum of understanding (MOU) last week with Volkswagen AG, a company in Wolfsburg, Germany, to develop a partnership in battery R&D, new materials application, and component development. Volkswagen China also vowed to work with CATL to jointly develop cost-competitive battery products and explore battery recycling and swapping, among other fields of cooperation.Mercedes-Benz, Stuttgart, Germany, announced last week that it will cut some jobs and shift production from German factories to lower-cost countries in 2025. Following a sharp drop in its 2024 earnings, the company is expected to drop significantly in 2025. For now, the company has ruled out shutting any German plants. It will seek cost reductions by cutting capacity in Germany and shifting production to lower-cost countries, such as Hungary. Overall, the German headcount will come down with the company planning voluntary redundancy programs, while employees leaving the company through natural attrition will not be replaced. The company said it is making itself leaner, faster, and stronger while readying an intense product launch campaign for multiple new vehicles.\n\nElectric truck maker Nikola Corporation, Phoenix, Arizona, filed for bankruptcy last week after struggling with high costs and an industry reluctant to abandon diesel engines. The company plans to wind down operations following a rapid rise with the promise of environmentally friendly vehicles and failed sales realizations. Sweden\u2019s battery developer, Northvolt, Stockholm, recently filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAdditional developments\n\n6. Apple introduces iPhone 16e R&D\n\nRDW Index member Apple, Cupertino, California, introduced its iPhone 16e last week. This low-cost model of its flagship device is the first Apple device to use its in-house developed cellular chip to enable cellular connectedness. The chips, which Apple labels C1, will replace the communications chips Apple purchased from Qualcomm in San Diego. The new 16e will be available at the end of February for $599, consistent with previous generations of affordable Apple iPhones. This version is a test vehicle, and Apple wants to get field data on how well it works before they release it into the iPhone 17, which is expected to be released in September 2025. Only 20% of the iPhone 17s release will have Apple-produced modems this fall. The rest will have Qualcomm modem chips. Apple expects to wean itself entirely from Qualcomm chips by 2027.\n\n7. Duracell relocates R&D headquarters\n\nBattery maker Duracell, Chicago, announced last week that it is moving its global headquarters for R&D from Bethel, Connecticut, to Atlanta. The new $56 million R&D center is slated to open in summer 2026. The new headquarters will be adjacent to Georgia Tech\u2019s Midtown Atlanta campus at Science Square. This is also about 70 miles northeast of Duracell\u2019s manufacturing facility in LaGrange, Georgia, which has been in operation since 1980\n\n\n\nThe R&D World Index\n\nR&D World\u2019s R&D Index is a weekly stock market summary of the top international companies involved in R&D. The top 25 industrial R&D spenders in 2020 were selected based on the latest listings from Schonfeld & Associates\u2019 June 2020 R&D Ratios & Budgets. These 25 companies include pharmaceutical (10 companies), automotive (6 companies), and ICT (9 companies), which invested a cumulative total of nearly 260 billion dollars in R&D in 2019, or approximately 10% of all the R&D spending in the world by government, industries, and academia combined, according to R&D World\u2019s 2021 Global R&D Funding Forecast. The stock prices used in the R&D World Index are tabulated from NASDAQ, NYSE, and OTC common stock prices for the companies selected at the close of stock trading business on the Friday preceding the online publication of the R&D World Index\n\nR&D World Index Week Ending February 21, 2025",

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Cheap Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other pharmaceutical stocks.\n\nThe Evolving Landscape of Healthcare and Biopharma Innovation\n\nAlmost no other industry goes as far as the phrase \u201cdefensive\u201d as the healthcare sector, which encompasses a wide range of companies that provide patient care, research and development of new medicines, and design, manufacture, and sell diagnostic instruments and tests. Patient care has evolved due to advancements in therapeutic techniques, drugs, and medical technology. Pharmaceutical companies in particular have received much attention as the demand for speedy results has increased. Grand View Research predicted that the value of pharmaceutical manufacturing worldwide was $516.48 billion in 2022. The sector is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.63% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nThe biopharma industry now has the most extensive and varied clinical pipeline to date, due to decades of groundbreaking research. In 2012, there were 3,200 distinct medications under development; by 2022, that number had nearly doubled to 6,100. The average cost of producing a single treatment is over $1 billion, while just 14% of medications in clinical trials reach FDA clearance, according to MIT research. This could be a game-changer for AI. For instance, generative AI helps identify illness patterns in large data sets to determine the optimal medicine combinations while enabling researchers to investigate far more possible compounds than they could with conventional techniques. Additionally, according to PwC, AI-driven analytics and automation could cut operational costs by more than 30% and process timeframes by 60\u201370%.\n\nIn a similar vein, the market has grown significantly due to consumer interest in weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. According to a recent study in the scientific journal Addiction, GLP-1 medications may reduce the prevalence of alcohol and opioid addiction by as much as 50%. Additionally, these medications are being evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other disorders that are frequently associated with obesity. The development of GLP-1s is becoming crucial for pharmaceutical businesses that want to be leaders in fields like cardiovascular and renal health. Competition with the leading companies in the anti-obesity business, which is expected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, is no longer the main emphasis.\n\nThe possibility for additional participants to enter the field is growing along with the possible applications of GLP-1s. For example, the Swiss business Roche entered the weight-loss drug sweepstakes in 2023 when it paid up to $3.1 billion to acquire California-based Carmot Therapeutics. The corporation wants to \u201cfast-track\u201d its anti-obesity medicines to regain faith in its pipeline and take a share of the weight-loss market.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities in the Pharmaceutical and Biotech IPO Market\n\nThe pharmaceutical sector may appear to be flourishing at first glance. However, it has its own set of difficulties, just like every other industry. Compared to 2021, funding for biotech and pharmaceuticals fell by a sharp 48.6% last year. In 2022, the IPO market also saw a significant decline, with profits falling as a result of market volatility and instability. Many general investors were apprehensive of the spike in drug-developer initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2020 and 2021, which garnered about $46.5 billion, more than the total from the preceding eight years combined.\n\nFuture initial public offerings (IPOs) are being closely watched due to the high-risk, high-reward nature of the biotech sector as well as macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that impact larger markets. However, as of September 3, 2024, drug developers had raised $2 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) this year, a 24% increase over the same period in 2023. However, according to BNN Bloomberg, over two-thirds of these funds were raised in the first two months as a result of a spike in new listings. However, pharma companies\u2019 portion of U.S. IPO profits has decreased from 17% in February to 6.5%, with less than $800 million raised in the next six months.\n\nTim Hunt, CEO of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), emphasized increased funding in cell and gene therapies in 2024 in his opening remarks at the October 7 conference. According to him, thirteen of the fifteen biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world by market capitalization now have an \u201cactive presence\u201d in this area. Major pharmaceutical corporations are increasingly turning to cell and gene therapies to fill possible revenue shortages as many product patents are about to expire. Despite this optimism, there has been a reduction in related patent filings, and the number of cell and gene therapy deals in the pharmaceutical industry fell by 38% in Q2 2024 compared to the same time in 2023. Nevertheless, the sector is appealing and should not be disregarded by possible investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best cheap pharmaceutical stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur methodology involved selecting stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $3 billion, a P/E ratio below 40, and a price target upside of more than 10%. We then ranked these stocks based on their upside potential, as of February 17.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 46.72%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a biopharmaceutical company that delivers health solutions to advance the treatment and prevention of diseases in animals and people. Its pharmaceutical division sells vaccinations and pharmaceuticals for human health, which usually include both preventative and therapeutic ingredients. A variety of vaccinations and veterinary pharmaceutical products are developed, discovered, produced, and marketed by its Animal Health sector.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales outlook is being adversely affected by certain factors. For example, because of low discretionary spending, it has temporarily halted the distribution of its HPV vaccine Gardasil to China until the middle of 2025. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) maintains excellent operations despite these short-term difficulties, which are bolstered by high demand for its inventive and varied portfolio. The company\u2019s Keytruda cancer treatment medication is doing well, and the introduction of Winrevair, a medication for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is also helping to increase revenue growth.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has a competitive edge in the market due to its pipeline, which includes over 20 novel growth drivers with blockbuster potential. Its late-stage pipeline in cardiometabolic, cancer, and infectious disorders further supports its prospects for the future. The firm is positioned as an appealing investment with a strong long-term development trajectory because of its innovative pipeline, diversified portfolio, and good commercial execution, which provide it resilience against short-term setbacks.\n\nThe investment management firm GreensKeeper Asset Management published its investor letter for the third quarter. The fund said the following:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\nOverall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the cheap pharmaceutical stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other expensive stocks. We previously covered the 10 cheapest stocks insiders are buying recently.\n\nThe broader market returned around 21% over the past 12 months, and it is also doing well this year. Since the beginning of the year, it has moved 3.45%. As the January effect starts to cool off, we thought it could be useful to look into some of the stocks that insiders have recently not been shy to spend money on. Instead of the standard P/E ratio, today we decided to focus on the average price per share.\n\nWhy are expensive stocks worth considering? High-priced stocks are often perceived as more reliable long-term investments due to the belief that their higher price reflects a history of strong performance and lower volatility. While in investing there is not a single rule that guarantees results, taking more factors into account, such as price, insider trading activity, recent results, analyst coverage, and recent company moves and strategies, might help.\n\nBoth insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives that\u2019s why it is important to consider these moves within the broader context of the company\u2019s fundamentals, industry trends, and overall market conditions. Due diligence before any investment is of crucial importance. However, insider trading activity, combined with other relevant factors, can provide valuable insights into a company\u2019s capabilities, helping investors make more informed decisions.\n\nWhat are some of the most expensive stocks insiders have been buying over the last 30 days? To find out, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener, focusing only on stocks where at least two insiders had purchased shares recently. From there, we ranked the 10 stocks with the highest average price per share.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences.

            "content": "It's been a rough start to 2025 for Merck (MRK -0.28%) shareholders following a less-than-stellar fourth-quarter earnings report. Even as the pharmaceutical giant exceeded Wall Street estimates with 7% revenue growth and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.72 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, weak sales in China and soft forward guidance were seen as a disappointment.\n\nAs of this writing, Merck's stock is down 16% year to date, hovering near its lowest point since 2022. Despite the recent setback, there are ample reasons for investors to maintain optimism. Below, I'll discuss whether now is a good time to buy Merck stock.\n\nMixed signals into 2025\n\nMerck is recognized for its extensive product portfolio covering treatments in areas like oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, vaccines, and infectious diseases. The company also operates a major animal-health segment, while engaging in biotechnology development beyond traditional pharmaceuticals. This diversified profile, with a long history of innovation, is a big part of the attraction of Merck stock as a possible investment.\n\nThat being said, the importance of the company's Keytruda immunotherapy drug -- recognized as a global standard of care for various cancers -- and its Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) can't be overstated. Together, they contributed approximately 59% of total company revenue last year.\n\nThere's good news and bad news. First, Keytruda remains a growth driver, with sales climbing 19% year over year in 2024 as management cited strong global demand for various indications. On the other hand, there's a question mark as to how much longer that momentum will last, given Keytruda could lose its patent exclusivity by 2025, opening the door for biosimilar alternatives to capture Merck's market share.\n\nMore pressing will be dealing with underwhelming trends from the company's second-best-selling product. Instead of breaking records, Gardasil revenue fell 3% in 2024, with a more dramatic 17% decline in the fourth quarter, compared to 2023.\n\nIn this case, Merck explains ongoing weakness in the Chinese market, where slow sales have forced the company to cut back on shipments, with an expectation that distributors will need to rebalance inventories. Even with China considered a strategically important market in the long run, Merck has withdrawn a previously announced goal of reaching $11 billion in Gardasil sales worldwide by 2031 (compared to $8.6 billion in 2024), based on the unclear timetable for a demand recovery.\n\nThe balancing act between the positive performance of Keytruda and smaller drugs against more volatile results from other parts of the portfolio defines an otherwise muted growth forecast for 2025. Merck is guiding for full-year sales between $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion, representing a range from a 0.2% decline to a 2.2% increase, compared to 2024.\n\nThe silver lining here is the stronger target for EPS. Merck expects to earn $8.88 to $9.03 per share this year, marking a 16.1% to 18% improvement over 2024. This captures improving profitability margins, compared to significant restructuring charges incurred in 2022 and 2023.\n\nMetric 2024 2025 Estimate Sales (in billions) $64.2 $64.1 to $65.6 Sales growth (YOY) 6.7% (0.2%) to 2.2% Adjusted Earnings Per share (EPS) $7.65 $8.88 to $9.03 Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) N/A 16.1% to 18%\n\nDevelopments to watch on the horizon\n\nThe market will be closely looking for signs of an improvement in Gardasil sales, but several other developments highlight a sense of overall fundamental stability. Notably, Merck's Winrevair pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) medication is on track to be the company's next blockbuster drug, already delivering $419 million in sales in just the first two quarters since its launch last year.\n\nInvestors can also look forward to a potential final approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Merck's Clesrovimab monoclonal antibody addressing the large pediatric need to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this year. Anticipation is also building for updated readouts on the company's Islatravir/Doravirine combination HIV treatment and its MK-0616 oral cholesterol-lowering therapy, which could be the catalysts Merck stock needs to sustain a rebound.\n\nWhat I like about Merck is its compelling value. Shares are trading at just 9 times the company's estimated 2025 EPS while offering an attractive 3.8% dividend yield. Recognizing the challenges facing Merck in 2025, investors who are confident that Merck can execute its strategy toward stronger growth may find the recent sell-off presents a good opportunity to buy the stock at a bargain price.",

(\"Merck\" or the \"Company\") MRK and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck's expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck's purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil's growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil's demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck's securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \"GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\" In addition, the current report stated Merck's \"decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\"\n\nOn this news, Merck's stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025 , inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc. , No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck as well as certain of Merck 's top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck 's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck 's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China , overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck 's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024 , Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 \"there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.\" On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025 , the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that \"GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion ; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%\" \"primarily due to lower demand in China , partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan .\" On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit.

A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit.

In fact, the success of chip manufacturing depends upon the reliability, safety and innovation of these chemicals and gases.\u201cMerck is looking to set up a plant to manufacture specialty chemicals here in India,\u201d a person aware of the plans of the German company said. \u201cThey are in talks with the government to establish a chemical plant for semiconductors, which could mean investment to the tune of around $300-500 million. The site for the plant has not been finalised yet.\u201dSpecialty gases firm Linde is planning to put up plants for high purity gasses, this person said.\u201cAs a leading global industrial gases and engineering company, Linde is an essential supplier to the semiconductor industry,\u201d Linde said in a statement to ET. \u201cLinde actively supports investments in this critical sector and is committed to supporting its growth in India.\u201dMerck, on its part, said it has been monitoring semiconductor manufacturing developments in India for the past couple of years.\u201cWe believe that India is becoming an increasingly important partner in the global semiconductor ecosystem,\u201d the company said in a statement to ET. \u201cHowever, at this time it is too early to talk about concrete investment numbers in India. We continue to closely follow opportunities that align with our strategic goals.\u201dSpecialty chemicals and gases enable precise control over the deposition and removal of materials on silicon wafers. They help perform critical tasks like etching, doping, cleaning and depositing layers, all the while maintaining the necessary ultra-high purity levels required for the tiny and sensitive components in semiconductors.Navin Bishnoi, country head at semiconductor company Marvell India, underscored the importance of such players coming in. He said it was crucial as without them, the ecosystem would not be complete.\u201cAncillary companies need to come and set up base in India.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nManufacturing investments have taken center stage in recent years \u2014 from some pharma giants ramping up GLP-1 manufacturing capacity to meet soaring demand to other companies focusing on advanced capabilities that could ensure an adequate supply of vaccines.\n\nWith the spotlight on the industry\u2019s need to increase capacity and make manufacturing more efficient, Eli Lilly and Merck & Co. have partnered with Purdue University to launch the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, which will research and develop new production technologies.\n\nElizabeth Topp, director, Young Institute Purdue University photo/Rebecca Robinos\n\n\u201cThe consortium brings together companies invested in pharmaceutical manufacturing, with the goal of spanning the value chain: Big Pharma, startups, equipment manufacturers, instrument manufacturers, packaging companies, and venture capital, to name a few. Our initial focus will be on drug product manufacturing,\u201d Elizabeth Topp, director of the Young Institute, said via email.\n\nThe collaboration also \u201cunderscores a commitment to onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing while bolstering domestic production,\u201d said a press release announcing the consortium. That could be especially important as new tariffs threaten to raise costs and exacerbate shortages.\n\nLilly has already put its money where its mouth is in that regard, saying it will spend $3 billion to expand a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin it bought in April and add new capabilities to produce injectable medicines. It also recently invested $9 billion in an Indiana manufacturing site and opened a new facility in North Carolina.\n\nAt the new Young Institute, companies will focus on experimentation.\n\n\u201cWe hope that innovations from our consortium will make it into \u2018real\u2019 manufacturing facilities, though,\u201d Topp said.\n\nOne major focus of the consortium will be improving aseptic processing technology, a key component of injectable drug manufacturing, through advances including AI, robotics and in-process sensors.\n\n\u201cAseptic processing maintains a sterile, microorganism-free environment during manufacturing without using heat sterilization. It's particularly important for injectable liquid products, where sterility is an absolute requirement but where the drug could be damaged by heating,\u201d Topp said. \u201cThese \u2018sterile injectables\u2019 include life-saving medicines like insulin and vaccines, and constitute most of the drug shortages in the U.S.\u201d\n\nHere, Topp explains more about the consortium\u2019s potential impact on the industry.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and style.\n\nPHARMAVOICE: Let\u2019s talk about how the consortium will leverage its manufacturing footprint. Will it include joint facilities and cost sharing?\n\nELIZABETH TOPP: Yes, joint manufacturing facilities will be involved. We're working on renovating space at Purdue that will be a testing ground for new manufacturing technologies. It won't be operated under full regulatory approval (under GMP conditions), so we won't actually be making any drug products. We're very keen to have companies of all kinds join our consortium \u2014 proposals for joining by cost share, in the form of equipment donations or donations of computational resources, are welcome.\n\nHow will these efforts eventually benefit the broader pharma industry?\n\nMember companies and the industry as a whole will benefit in several important ways. For example, our members will have the opportunity to develop new manufacturing technologies, and to drive the focus areas of the consortium's research efforts toward the critical pain points for the industry. Those efforts will involve collaboration with Purdue's outstanding faculty, which is rich in science and engineering talent in a strongly entrepreneurial environment.\n\nIn addition, members will be able to speak collectively to regulatory agencies, in the form of best practices papers and consensus standards for new manufacturing technologies, with greater impact than individual companies speaking alone. Our members will also develop a direct connection with a great talent pipeline in the form of Purdue students and will have the opportunity to help shape the type of education and training they receive.\n\nWhat will participation look like for companies in the consortium?\n\nWe have three membership tiers with a range of financial commitment and influence. The tiers have been designed to encourage participation by the full value chain, from multinational pharmaceutical companies to startups and academic institutions.\n\nWill the consortium have an impact on the broader industry goal of onshoring more pharma manufacturing?\n\nIt's a great question and we certainly don't have all the answers. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is global, with many key raw materials and drug compounds being produced in countries like India and China. Because it's less expensive to manufacture in those countries than in the U.S., offshoring has helped control overall manufacturing costs. Imposing tariffs may decrease the offshore advantage, but with the risk of greater overall costs, costs that will probably be passed on to consumers.\n\nThere is also considerable interest in onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing to ensure that there's an adequate supply of critical medicines during pandemics or global conflicts. We hope that our initiatives to improve pharmaceutical manufacturing technology will help make onshoring achievable, and lessen the impact of tariffs, by improving efficiency, throughput, and supply chain management.",

Kennedy Jr., President Trump\u2019s choice to be secretary of Health and Human Services, appears before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 29, 2025.\n\nMerck & Co.\u2019s first trial over the safety of its blockbuster Gardasil cancer vaccine was cut short and rescheduled amid concerns that jurors might be influenced by controversy this month around Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s confirmation as President Trump\u2019s health secretary.\n\nMark Lanier, a lawyer for the plaintiff in the case, said Tuesday that Merck agreed to halting the trial in state court in Los Angeles about three weeks after it started because his team feared that extensive publicity around Kennedy\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings may taint the jury. Kennedy, a longtime plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, has collected fees over the years for referring potential vaccine victims to one of the law firms spearheading the Gardasil litigation.\n\n\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s nomination and his views about vaccines were all over the news and we just thought it would make sense to push the trial back until it died down,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cBoth sides wanted to make sure we had a fair trial.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLanier said there was no evidence jurors disobeyed the judge\u2019s instructions not to read or view reports tied to Kennedy\u2019s confirmation as head of the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration.\n\nMerck said it\u2019s pleased that a judge agreed to reset the trial for September with a new jury. In a statement, the company said it \u201cwould provide no financial or other consideration in exchange for the agreement to adjourn.\u201d A spokesperson declined to comment further.\n\nAs health secretary, Kennedy will have the power to influence immunization policies and approvals. During his mid-February confirmation hearing, Kennedy faced sharp questioning about his fitness for the position, including his record of criticizing vaccines. Democratic lawmakers also raised concerns that his family stands to benefit from ongoing vaccine litigation, including the mass litigation against Merck over its Gardasil shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGardasil is marketed to prevent human papillomavirus, which researchers have tied to cervical and other cancers. It generated more than $8 billion in sales for Merck in 2023.\n\nIn the trial that started at the end of last month, Merck was accused of wrongfully promoting the vaccine as safe by patient Jennifer Robi, who claims it caused a heart ailment that left her confined to a wheelchair. The company denies it mishandled Gardasil\u2019s marketing and says it properly outlined the vaccine\u2019s potential side effects on its safety label.\n\nAs head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy will oversee the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, set up in 1988 to compensate people injured by childhood vaccines. Since its inception, the program has paid out almost $5.3 billion to victims, according to the government. Robi\u2019s case was rejected by the program\u2019s in-house court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy disclosed he had referred hundreds of cases to Wisner Baum, a personal injury law firm in Los Angeles that is spearheading the Gardasil litigation. According to his federal ethics disclosure, he was poised to receive 10% of the fees awarded in contingency cases. He has pledged to reassign his financial claims to his son, a lawyer at Wisner Baum. The Senate voted Thursday to confirm him as health secretary.\n\nFeeley writes for Bloomberg.",

Tips are always welcome. \u2026\n\nPresident Trump intends to impose auto tariffs \u201cin the neighborhood of 25%\u201d and similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, the latest in a series of measures threatening to upend international trade, Reuters says. Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chips would also start at \u201c25% or higher,\u201d rising substantially over the course of a year. But he did not provide a date for announcing those duties and said he wanted to provide some time for drug and chip makers to set up U.S. factories so that they can avoid tariffs. Trump said he expected some of the biggest companies in the world to announce new investments in the U.S. in the next couple of weeks. He provided no further details. Since his inauguration four weeks ago, Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China, on top of existing levies, over China\u2019s failure to halt fentanyl trafficking. He also announced, and then delayed for a month, 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and non-energy imports from Canada.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in his first address to employees of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said a new presidential commission would scrutinize childhood vaccine schedules, psychiatric medications, and other frequent targets of his suspicion as part of his efforts to fight chronic disease, The New York Times informs us. \u201cNothing is going to be off limits,\u201d Kennedy said during a 22-minute address. He used the moment to also extend an olive branch, urging his new colleagues to set aside the partisanship and vitriol that surrounded his nomination. And Kennedy promised to keep an open mind, continue asking \u201cdifficult questions,\u201d and listen to \u201call the stakeholders\u201d \u2014 especially those with whom he has disagreed.",

Disease control rate in these patients was 85%. Arcus did not have progression-free survival (PFS) data at the time of the presentation.\n\nOther dosages of casdatifan\u201450 mg twice-daily and 50 mg once-daily\u2014also elicited strong response rates, with confirmed overall response rate (ORR) reaching above 25%. Median PFS in patients treated with 50-mg casdatifan twice-a-day had a median PFS of 9.7 months. Arcus has decided to take the 100-mg, once-daily dose forward for further clinical testing, according to the biotech.\n\nAs for safety, Arcus noted that casdatifan showed an \u201cacceptable and manageable\u201d adverse event profile across all three doses, with one patient dropping out due to anemia and two others due to hypoxia. At its go-forward dose of 100-mg once-daily, 7% of patients developed serious treatment-emergent adverse events related to the study drug.\n\nIn a note to investors Monday evening, analysts at Truist Securities said Arcus\u2019 readout \u201cwas strongly positive\u201d and points to casdatifan\u2019s \u201cfavorably differentiated\u201d profile from Merck\u2019s Welireg, \u201can approved competitor in the same drug class\u201d and indicated for advanced renal cell carcinoma.\n\nIn particular, Truist pointed to the \u201cstrong PFS\u201d data from casdatifan, which was \u201cwell above\u201d the firm\u2019s prior projection to support the asset\u2019s differentiation versus Welireg. In the pivotal LITESPARK-005 study, Merck\u2019s HIF-2a blocker achieved median PFS of 5.6 months\u2014though between-study comparisons are inconclusive without a proper and direct head-to-head design.\n\nStill, Truist pointed out notable baseline differences between Arcus and Merck\u2019s respective studies\u2014including the more heavily pre-treated population in the casdatifan study\u2014which the analysts contend \u201ccould mean [casdatifan] does better in a more defined Phase III trial.\u201d\n\nCompeting with Welireg could prove to be a tough challenge for Arcus, though, as Merck\u2019s drug continues to show strong growth, indicating improving uptake. In 2024, Welireg surged 133% year-on-year to bring in $509 million, a sum that is likely to increase in the coming years, particularly as Merck continues to seek regulatory approvals in overseas markets and works to expand its indications.\n\nArcus is likewise taking a broad approach to casdatifan to \u201cmaximize the opportunity\u201d in the space, the biotech said in its press announcement. Arcus currently has a Phase III study planned for the candidate, which will test it in combination with Exelixis\u2019 Cabometyx for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Meanwhile, the biotech is also working with AstraZeneca to run a Phase Ib study of casdatifan with an investigational anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody for the same indication.",

Kennedy Jr, the company and an attorney for the plaintiff said.\n\nMerck and the plaintiff plan to reconvene in a Los Angeles state court in September with a new jury, the company said in a statement provided to Reuters.\n\nKennedy, confirmed as HHS secretary last week, played an instrumental role in organizing mass litigation against Merck over Gardasil before taking office, but has not been involved in the Los Angeles trial after entering an initial court appearance in the case. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrior to his confirmation, Kennedy, 71, was an environmental lawyer who long sowed doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.\n\nOn Friday, plaintiffs' lawyers approached Merck and proposed the jury be discharged and the case adjourned, the company said. Merck agreed \"subject to an explicit stipulation that Merck would provide no financial or other consideration in exchange for the agreement to adjourn,\" the company said.\n\nMark Lanier, an attorney for plaintiff Jennifer Robi, said in a text \"it was really tough having the trial while the (Kennedy) confirmation hearings were ongoing.\" Lanier said he was uncertain whether the Kennedy hearings would have a positive or negative impact on jurors, and decided it was better to reconvene in September with a new jury. A new scientific study about Gardasil is also expected by then, Lanier said, without elaborating.\n\nBoth Merck and Lanier also pointed to upcoming proceedings in another Gardasil case consolidating lawsuits in a North Carolina federal court that might affect the Robi case as a reason for the delay.\n\nThe unexpected agreement to adjourn the case occurred after the trial had been underway for several weeks, the culmination of a lawsuit filed in 2016 that had survived legal challenges from Merck to make it before a jury.\n\n\"It seems to me unusual for plaintiffs, who have been working for this, to want a delay,\" said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco who specializes in legal and policy issues related to vaccines.\n\nRobi, 30, was vaccinated with Gardasil as a teenager and claims the shot led to impaired mobility that confined her to a wheelchair.

            "content": "Technology is changing the way pharmaceutical companies discover and develop new drugs. For Matt Studney, who joined Merck as a chemical engineer, technology changed the course of his career. In 2017, the pharma giant was one of several healthcare businesses breached by a cyberattack. Studney was tasked with leading the company\u2019s R&D recovery.\n\nStudney said the experience gave him a deep, inside look into Merck\u2019s technology stack. Now, as vice president of information technology of Merck Research Labs, his responsibilities include identifying and implementing new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that support the company\u2019s drug research. It\u2019s a big change from his initial work at Merck more than 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat I was doing under the hood in a lab, now we can do at much larger scales and produce that data and analyze that data without me having to do it myself as an individual,\u201d Studney said in recent interview. \u201cThe high throughput experimentation creates so much more data that it would be very difficult for a person to process at the speed at which we can today.\u201d\n\nThe AI tools Merck uses are a mix of internally developed and externally sourced technologies. From that foundation, Merck customizes these tools to its needs, Studney said. Merck takes a strategic approach to investing in AI. Sometimes it\u2019s a small investment to see how something could work within the company. If the technology indicates it could have a positive impact on drug research, Merck can then build a minimum viable product to introduce into its workflow.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of claims of what AI can do, like it\u2019s a magic button, but it\u2019s really not,\u201d Studney said. \u201cYou really have to be very focused and selective and invest where it can have a real impact.\u201d\n\nIn drug research, Merck uses AI to identify better potential targets and to quickly weed out targets that are unlikely to work. AI technology also helps the company build the chemical makeup of a potential drug faster and make it with properties desirable for a drug, Studney said. Merck can create deep learning models that will help scientists understand whether or not to pursue a certain drug structure. For example, the analysis can indicate the molecule will have an interaction with other drugs. That analysis shortens the time to get to better quality molecules.\n\n\u201cWe can leverage imaging technologies and predictions to identify things earlier and then, in some cases, cancel projects sooner and then move on, invest elsewhere,\u201d Studney said.\n\nIn addition to trying to improve the probability of success in drug discovery, Merck is also using AI to improve efficiency and reduce the time it takes move a drug through the cycle of development. Efficiency must be realized in the entire workflow, otherwise it can create bottlenecks elsewhere, Studney said.\n\nOne of the things Merck has learned is the importance of having fully closed systems. As an example, Studney said that after running an experiment about the design of a molecule, the result is fed back to the deep learning model. Knowing that outcome will enable the model to understand what happened so it can offer a better prediction the next time.\n\nOther applications of AI include compiling the documentation that forms the basis of regulatory submissions. An FDA filing can be made up of hundreds of thousands of pages. AI helps Merck more quickly generate a first draft, speeding up the journey to the final document submitted to regulators, Studney said. But he emphasized that AI is not replacing humans.\n\n\u201cWe always have a human in the loop,\u201d Studney said. \u201c[AI] is a tool to help our humans, our scientists, get through some of those earlier tasks faster, and then we have robust review cycles and processes in place.\u201d\n\nSome of the data that Merck analyzes with AI come from years and years of clinical tests of its own drugs, such as the blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Data from clinical trials are the gold standard for understanding a therapy in the treatment of patients, Studney said. Analyzing data from full responders, partial responders, and non-responders can help Merck understand which drug or drug combination could have better impact, he explained.\n\nFor all of these AI investments, there must be a business case, Studney said. More than the cost of acquiring and implementing a new technology, Merck looks at the technology\u2019s impact. Reducing cycle time and creating labor efficiencies has the effect of reducing cost to the company. The ability to more quickly generate documentation for a regulatory filing also leads to efficiencies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value in that, especially as you look towards the end of a clinical trial, and if it\u2019s successful the speed at which you can then pursue supplemental or new drug applications or [biologics license applications],\u201d Studney said.\n\nPhoto: Christopher Occhicone/Bloomberg, via Getty Images",

Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck as well as certain of Merck\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

            "content": "While there are expectations of equity markets making further progress over the year as a whole \u2014 largely fueled by earnings \u2014 they have become vulnerable to a correction either due to higher bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings, says Goldman Sachs. A fall in interest rates has been related to robust equity returns. In the US, the US Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycles have often coincided with higher stock prices as long as the broader economy avoids recession.\n\n=With the S&P 500 anticipated to post a marginal 7% return in 2025, other regions, sectors, and asset classes might become more attractive, says Morgan Stanley. Generally, the stocks and bonds have an inverse relation, offering a natural hedge in diversified portfolios. However, the current trends have demonstrated that such assets are moving in tandem, with both witnessing losses simultaneously, as was seen in 2022. Morgan Stanley believes that the higher bond yields and lower bond prices have been coinciding with lower stock prices. This trend highlights the importance of diversifying beyond traditional asset classes to mitigate risks.\n\nAs per Morgan Stanley, while several investors continue to favour recently successful approaches, like passive exposure to the broader S&P 500 Index, a more diversified investment strategy might provide better risk-adjusted returns. The benchmark US equity index remains richly priced and excessively concentrated. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 index make up for ~40% of its total market capitalization, making it excessively dependent on certain mega-cap tech companies continuing to exceed ambitious performance forecasts.\n\nStrong economic growth and the prospect of declining interest rates continue to support gains in global equities. That being said, elevated valuations over the past 2 years, mainly in the US, have put global stocks in a vulnerable position, opines Goldman Sachs Research. By the close of last year, the S&P 500 saw one of its strongest 2-year periods of returns since the year 1928. Much of this increase demonstrates better fundamental growth than investors had expected, with higher valuations acting as a significant contributor.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Most Oversold S&P 500 Stocks in 2024 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other most oversold S&P 500 stocks in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmidst a favorable backdrop, Goldman believes that 3 main factors complicate the outlook for the stock rally. First, the pace of recent gains reflects much of the optimism the analysts expect regarding economic growth. Second, elevated valuations might limit the forward returns. Finally, the third factor is the unusually high market concentration. As per Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist and head of Macro Research in Europe, equities tend to be more vulnerable to growth disappointments due to increased concentration of equity market returns.\n\nTherefore, investors are required to focus on companies trading at reasonable valuations, and that have strong fundamentals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Most Oversold S&P 500 Stocks in 2024, we used a screener and filtered out the stocks present in the S&P 500 Index. Next, we shortlisted the ones that have declined significantly over the past year. Finally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Most Oversold S&P 500 Stock in 2024?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\n% Decline In 1 Year: ~34.0%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company. The company has seen a decline in Gardasil revenues in China, resulting in a reduction in revenue estimates, opines Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital. The China market continues to be a key growth driver for many pharmaceutical companies, and this slowdown has raised concerns in the investors\u2019 minds about headwinds in this critical region. However, Evan Seigerman maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock with a price target of $136.00.\n\nDespite challenges, the analyst highlights Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\u2019s underlying strength. The analyst provides a strong area of growth, with higher organic demand and potential expansion in 2025 aided by upcoming trials. Seigerman focuses on Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\u2019s promising cardiovascular portfolio, and advancements in immunology and inflammation via strategic acquisitions, and partnerships, which are expected to drive growth. Elsewhere, Bank of America Securities also reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating with a $120.00 price target.\n\nGreensKeeper Asset Management, an investment management company, released its Q3 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\nOverall, MRK ranks 2nd on our list of most oversold S&P 500 stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \"there's still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\" He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper's comments about the market were precarious and didn't reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \"I mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation's precarious on Squawk Box. And it's not.\"\n\nInstead, Cramer shared \"These are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let's make a talk. Let's do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it's not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President's strategy, I think people say, is working.\" As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \"And the answer is why you would sell is because you don't believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn't exist. I come back and say, well I don't know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\"\n\nThe CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \"how can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they're getting that in spade,\" on the other hand he agreed that \"Yes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we're gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer was surprised by the President's China approach. He had \"expected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\"",

Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck's top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at [email protected].\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 \"there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.\" On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that \"GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%\" \"primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.\" On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit.

Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck\u2019s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China\u2019s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck\u2019s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck\u2019s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 \u201cthere was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%\u201d \u201cprimarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit.

Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Merck securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Merck class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34975 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Merck describes itself as a \u201cglobal healthcare company that operates through two segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, with a significant focus on prescription medications.\u201d\n\nFor more information, submit a form, email attorney Phillip Kim, or give us a call at 866-767-3653.\n\nThe Allegations: Rosen Law Firm is Investigating the Allegations that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Operations.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nWhat Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Merck & Co., Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their motions with the court by April 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery.

            "content": "Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -14.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share, indicating a change of +4.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18%. This estimate has changed -4.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +9.8% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

(\u201cMerck\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck\u2019s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants\u2019 statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck\u2019s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil\u2019s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil\u2019s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck\u2019s securities at artificially inflated prices.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.\u201d In addition, the current report stated Merck\u2019s \u201cdecision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\u201d\n\nOn this news, Merck\u2019s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "watch now\n\nA little-known biotech company stunned the biopharmaceutical industry last spring when it declared an \"unprecedented\" achievement: its experimental cancer drug looked more effective than Merck 's Keytruda in a clinical trial. The company, Summit Therapeutics , licensed the drug from Chinese company Akeso Inc. In October, a group of life science investors announced they were putting $400 million into creating a company called Kailera Therapeutics that would develop experimental obesity drugs it bought from Chinese company Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals. Then in a matter of days in December, Merck disclosed it would license a potential competitor to Summit's drug and a separate experimental obesity pill \u2013 both from Chinese companies. Suddenly, U.S. companies are racing to find medicines in China. Almost 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million up front involved Chinese companies last year, up from 20% the year before and none only five years before, according to data from DealForma. \"That's stunning to me,\" said Chen Yu, founder and managing partner at crossover fund TCGX. \"That's stunning.\"\n\nYu said 20 years ago, few biopharma companies were interested in China because they considered it a small market. His former firm, Vivo Capital, pioneered the concept of bringing U.S. medicines to the Chinese market. Today, the movement is going in the opposite direction. He never imagined the proliferation that's taking place now. Investors and industry insiders offer a few reasons for the trend: Chinese companies are creating better molecules than ever before \u2013 and more of them. They can start testing those compounds in humans sooner and at a lower price than in the U.S. Buyers have figured out a business model to essentially import the drugs through licensing deals. Venture funding in China has also dried up, forcing biotech companies to do deals. One thing all of those people in the industry agree on? This trend isn't going away. What's less clear is what the development means for the U.S. biotech sector. Some people contend it's terrible for American startups if large pharmaceutical companies can find a promising drug in China for a fraction of the price. Others argue competition makes everyone better, and American companies will ultimately reap the rewards of bringing medicines to the market. Either way, the influx could reshape the landscape of the U.S. biopharma industry. \"It's kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, 'We don't really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily,'\" said Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel's global health-care group. \"We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\" Bain Capital Life Sciences started making China a priority around 2018, said Adam Koppel, a partner at the fund. The private equity firm saw the Chinese government and the life sciences industry making a deliberate effort to evolve from its historical focus on copycat and fast-follower drugs that mimicked leading drugs to creating new chemical matter that China could export to the rest of the world. Since then, Bain has struck six biopharma deals in China. It bought an experimental asthma drug from Hengrui in 2023 and co-launched a company called Aiolos with a $245 million series A funding round. GSK acquired the company three months later for up to $1.4 billion. Koppel sees more large pharmaceutical companies growing comfortable with drugs coming out of China as they work with more of them and see their outcomes, he said. Buyers had held back in part because they worried data from China wasn't representative of a global population and U.S. regulators wouldn't accept it. \"As they're seeing assets then come out, they're seeing things that are having success, and eventually, as things get approved and used on the market, I think that that concern will become lessened,\" he said.\n\nPiotr Swat | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nThat narrative was on display when Summit Therapeutics last year said its experimental cancer drug beat Merck's mega-blockbuster Keytruda in a head-to-head study, a feat no other drug has accomplished. Summit's trial was conducted exclusively in China, making people question if the results would hold up elsewhere. When Summit's leaders were shopping for a drug they could develop, they made it a point to look in China because co-CEO Bob Duggan had read more new medicines were coming from the country. But it was late 2022, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had just rejected a few applications for drugs that were studied only in China, including one from Eli Lilly. When Summit announced it was licensing the cancer drug ivonescimab from Akeso, people questioned how Summit could do the deal knowing that the FDA would never accept it, said Summit's co-CEO and president, Maky Zanganeh. \"And suddenly after us, a lot of people opened their eyes,\" she said.\n\nIvonescimab had already undergone early studies and was in late-stage trials in China when Summit struck the licensing deal. Summit is now running three global phase 3 trials to satisfy the FDA's desire for drugs to be studied in diverse groups of people. Summit's strategy could become more common. Investors and other industry insiders said one of the draws about doing deals with Chinese biotech companies is they can find molecules that have already undergone early studies at a lower price than in the U.S. So the U.S. businesses know what they're getting, and they can probably get it for less. Gilead spends a lot of time in China looking for assets like it does in the U.S. and Europe, the company's chief financial officer, Andrew Dickinson, told CNBC. Gilead has seen a \"substantial shift\" in the quality and quantity of assets being developed in China and being offered to U.S. biopharma companies. \"The transformation over the last five years is real and impressive,\" Dickinson said.\n\nIt helps that more Chinese companies need to do deals now. The amount of venture funds raised by the Chinese biotech industry cratered to just $1 billion last year from a peak of $6.3 billion in 2021, according to data provided by TCGX's Yu. \"Why would we do any early-stage development in the U.S. anymore?\" Yu said. \"Why wouldn't we just get clinical proof of concept in China and then bring it over to the U.S. for the expensive clinical development when we actually know the drug works? And I think that could be a very revolutionary new way for our industry to become more efficient.\" That's an opportunity \u2013 or risk \u2013 for the U.S. biopharma industry, depending on who you ask. Some, like Yu, see it as a way to bring down the price of prescription drugs. Others worry it could hobble U.S. companies if Merck and other large pharmaceutical companies pass on acquiring American startups in favor of licensing assets from China.\n\nA worker is working on a drug production line at the production workshop of a pharmaceutical company in Meishan, China, on January 30, 2024.

In truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality.\n\nThe complaint alleges that on February 4, 2025, Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China \"through at least midyear\" to facilitate a \"rapid reduction of inventory.\" On this news, Merck's stock price fell more than 9%, from $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.\n\nWhat Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Merck & Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn this article, we will examine 10 companies with high dividend yields and explore the reasons behind declining stock prices.\n\nCompanies that pay dividends have been a reliable choice for investors seeking a passive and somewhat stable income. All the stocks in our list today have offered attractive yields, thus satisfying the expectations of these investors. But we have noticed them struggling in recent months.\n\nBroader market conditions, like a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US, have led to market volatility. Though the broader market remained unchanged, the Nasdaq composite faced a decline during the past few weeks. These changes are reflected in the price of many high dividend-paying stocks. Some companies are additionally experiencing company-specific challenges. The strategic transition of British Petroleum from oil and gas assets to green energy and divestment, for instance, has led to its underperformance. Comparatively, competitors who were focused on fossil fuels gained preference, owing to the analysts questioning the future dividend sustainability of BP. The shifting investor sentiment also has contributed to the downturn of some of the stocks in our list.\n\nWe find it difficult to point out any single sector as a worst-performing sector. The recent macroeconomic trends, inclusive of the inflationary pressures as well as the interest rate adjustments, cause ripples across multiple sectors in the US economy. Some companies have maintained stable payouts proportionately to an increase in their share value. Others face declining share prices because of weaker earnings and reduced interests among the hedge fund holders.\n\nDividend Aristocrats have historically provided stability and consistent income. They have been a popular choice among long-term investors. In the past few months, however, the stock prices of these companies have declined despite maintaining high dividend yields. The upward interest rates and inflation rates recently pressured some high-yield companies, making it hard for them to sustain dividend increases without debts. Thus, high yields may seem appealing, but it falls in the hands of the investors to assess the ability of these companies to maintain their payouts without jeopardizing financial health.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nThe article includes 10 high-yield dividend stocks experiencing a decline in their prices in the last 1 month. Each company on the list was added after ensuring that they have a market capitalization of over $1 billion and a minimum dividend yield of 2.5%. The article assessed financial sustainability using historical stock performance, dividend payout ratios, and earnings reports. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. The final list is ranked according to their dividend yields, as of February 11.",

            "content": "Big Tech and pharmaceutical companies are accelerating the implementation of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. Just last month, AWS and General Catalyst announced their partnership to speed up the development and deployment of healthcare AI tools. GE HealthCare teamed up with AWS to build generative AI for medical use in 2024.\n\nNow, Thailand-based healthcare startup HD has built a marketplace, HDmall, to digitize the fragmented medical industry in Southeast Asia. The startup helps users find healthcare providers like hospitals and clinics. It also assists people in finding specific surgeries and health checkups, aggregates services to lower costs and provides users with installment payment options.\n\nThe startup has secured $7.8 million in equity funding to enhance its marketplace and invest further in its AI technology. The recent funding marks the first investment of U.S. pharma giant Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) in a health tech startup in Asia Pacific. (MSD is the brand that Merck uses to operate outside the U.S. and Canada, and it launched an accelerator called IDEA Studios last June.) Other participants in HD\u2019s funding included SBI Ven Capital, M Venture Partners, FEBE Ventures, and Partech Partners also participated in the latest financing.\n\n\u201cMSD, which produces the HPV vaccines, reached out to [us] because we were already selling a lot of HPV vaccines online that were being administered at the hospitals and clinics we work with,\u201d co-founder and CEO of HD Sheji Ho said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cAnd if you look at the numbers, we [offer] the largest number for vaccines online in the markets.\u201d\n\nThe 5-year-old startup\u2019s marketplace has over 30,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) from more than 2,500 hospitals and clinics and a handful of pharmaceutical partners and 400,000 paying customers across Thailand and Indonesia, generating $100 million in annual gross transaction volume, Ho noted. It aims to reach 5,000 healthcare providers and 600,000 patients in 2025.\n\nThe latest financing, which brings HD\u2019s total funding to $18 million, comes less than a year after it raised a $5.6 million round.\n\nIn early 2024, HD started building an AI chatbot, Jib AI, which has been trained on anonymized healthcare product data, transaction data, and chat commerce datasets using advanced large language models. After implementing generative AI technology in its marketplace, almost 60% of customer interactions are managed by AI agents, which deliver \u201chigh-quality, instant 24/7 response to customers\u201d, Ho said.\n\nImage Credits:HD\n\nJib AI helps healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, and surgeons focus on providing quality patient care by handling most initial triaging and care navigation tasks.\n\nOver the next 12 months, the company aims to improve its AI agent capabilities by adding order and refund processing, assisted checkouts, scheduling, electronic health record checking, and medical information retrieval with the Jib AI Health Assistant and via AI-powered asynchronous virtual care with expert physicians.\n\nThe startup also says it plans to expand its network of external partners over the next two years, focusing on insurance and pharmaceutical companies, as well as employers and educational institutions.\n\n\u201cWhile US healthcare companies such as Transcarent and Accolade started directly with B2B care navigation, we see a unique opportunity in Southeast Asia to adopt a \u2018B2C2B strategy\u2019 as defined by Andreessen Horowitz,\u201d Ho told TechCrunch. \u201cThis approach leverages our existing B2C success to transition into B2B, effectively pursuing enterprise monetization from the outset.\u201d\n\nHealthcare in Southeast Asia\n\nMost venture-backed healthcare startups in Southeast Asia, including Singapore\u2019s Doctor Anywhere, Halodoc, and Alodokter in Indonesia, primarily focus on telehealth and virtual health services. But Ho says the approach is not sustainable in Southeast Asia. \u201cPost-pandemic, telehealth as a business model in SEA has encountered significant challenges and is rapidly losing favor among both consumers and investors.\u201d\n\nThe company now positions itself as a mix of Amazon One Medical in the U.S., Chinese outpatient healthcare platforms like JD Health and Alibaba Health, and the Indian inpatient healthcare platform Pristyn Care.\n\nThe healthcare industry is quite different in emerging Southeast Asian markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Without a family doctor system like in Western countries, patients often go straight to hospitals or clinics. This makes it difficult for patients to find the right healthcare services, know where to go, and understand how to handle the costs, Ho told TechCrunch.\n\nDue to 40% of healthcare costs being paid by individuals and low levels of private health insurance coverage, people are more sensitive to prices and feel more pressure when making decisions. This leads to a growing demand for platforms that offer clarity, transparency, and ease of comparison among various providers, Ho continued.\n\nHD\u2019s platform operates more like the \u201cAmazon of healthcare.\u201d Instead of listing individual GPs or offering physician appointment scheduling, it enables healthcare providers to sell productized services. \u201cOur offerings range from health checkups, cancer screenings, and IVF procedures to root canal treatments, HPV vaccinations, and surgeries like thyroid and hemorrhoid surgeries. This approach aligns with how most people in the region begin their healthcare journeys \u2014 by searching for specific services rather than individual doctors,\u201d Ho said.\n\nHD provides its services in Thailand and Indonesia, and it plans to enter Vietnam and Myanmar because of their similar healthcare systems.\n\n\u201cTheir healthcare model is quite similar in some ways to Mainland China. So it\u2019s a high cash payment, around 40%. There is no family doctor system, so people go straight to hospitals or clinics; thereafter, government social security coverage comes into play,\u201d Ho told TechCrunch. \u201cBut those budgets are getting smaller and smaller. This means that more of the pressure to cover healthcare is shifting towards the private sector, whether it\u2019s through cash or private insurance. This is why insurance going forward presents a big opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nMoreover, there is a rising trend toward self-empowerment in terms of user behavior in these markets. They are getting more accustomed to using tools such as Google Search or ChatGPT to search for healthcare-related subjects. This aligns well with what HD provides, as it empowers individuals to make their own healthcare choices, according to Ho.",

Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck\u2019s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China\u2019s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck\u2019s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck\u2019s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished.\n\nThe Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 \u201cthere was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint.\n\nThen, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that \u201cGARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%\u201d \u201cprimarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.\u201d On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit.

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Merck KGaA and BridgeBio Pharma, as well as updates from Biohaven, Third Harmonic Bio and AdvanCell that you might have missed.\n\nMerck KGaA is in discussions with SpringWorks Therapeutics about a possible acquisition, the German drugmaker confirmed late Monday. While discussions are \u201cadvanced,\u201d no legally binding agreement has been brokered and a transaction may not materialize, Merck KGaA said. \u201cCritical conditions have yet to be met,\u201d it added. Earlier on Monday, Reuters had reported the companies were in talks. Springworks shares rose by 34% Monday, but fell 4% Tuesday morning. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nThe European Commission on Tuesday authorized BridgeBio Pharma's Beyonttra for people with a condition called transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. Also known as acoramidis, the drug was cleared in the U.S. in November as Attruby. Sales since then have gotten off to a faster-than-expected start. The latest clearance triggers a $75 million milestone payment to BridgeBio from Bayer, which holds commercial rights in Europe through a 2024 collaboration. That deal gives BridgeBio at least a \"low thirties\" percent royalty on sales there.\u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will decide whether to approve Biohaven\u2019s experimental treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia within six months, granting the company\u2019s new drug application priority review. If approved, Biohaven\u2019s drug, called troriluzole, would be the first authorized medicine for the neurodegenerative disorder, which affects muscle movement and coordination. Testing, which compared study participants to an external pool of untreated patients, showed treatment slowed disease progression. Biohaven said it is prepared to launch troriluzole for spinocerebellar ataxia this year, should it win FDA clearance. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nThird Harmonic Bio will weigh \u201ca full range of strategic transactions\u201d as it works to advance its drug THB335 into Phase 2 testing for chronic spontaneous urticaria, the company said Tuesday. It plans to halve its staff and halt work on programs that aren\u2019t THB335, for which it reported Phase 1 study findings on Tuesday. The restructuring could lead Third Harmonic to a merger, sale or licensing deal as it looks to \u201cidentify opportunities to maximize shareholder value.\u201d As of Dec. 31, the company had $285 million in cash and cash equivalents. Third Harmonic raised $185 million in its 2022 initial public offering.\u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nEli Lilly will expand its collaboration with AdvanCell, a radiopharmaceutical drug developer that last week raised $112 million in a Series C financing round. The companies\u2019 work together will focus on AdvanCell\u2019s technology for producing Pb-212, a lead radioisotope. Lilly has invested in radiopharmaceuticals through various deals and investments. Financial terms of its agreement with AdvanCell weren\u2019t disclosed. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

            "content": "German pharma Merck KGaA is currently in \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d with SpringWorks Therapeutics regarding a potential acquisition.\n\nThe news, first reported by Reuters Monday and confirmed by Merck KGaA a few hours later, sent the cancer biotech\u2019s stocks soaring 34% and brought its value to approximately $4 billion at market close.\n\nMerck KGaA insisted in its news release that \u201cno legally binding agreement has been entered into\u201d despite the ongoing negotiations. Certain unspecified but important conditions have yet to be met and \u201cthere is no certainty that any transaction will materialize,\u201d according to the pharma.\n\nStill, in the original Reuters report, three anonymous sources claimed that if the discussions are successful, the acquisition deal could be inked in the coming weeks. Specific details of Merck KGaA\u2019s offer\u2014particularly the purchase price\u2014have yet to be revealed. Analysis from Wedbush suggested a $77 per share price, and with approximately 74 million shares outstanding, that would bring the total price to about $5.7 billion.\n\nSpringWorks\u2019 growth prospects seem bright, with an FDA decision due by the end of the month for its investigational MEK blocker mirdametinib, proposed for neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. If approved, mirdametinib will be the first therapy approved for both children and adults with the condition.\n\nSpringWorks therefore presents an attractive acquisition target for Merck KGaA, which has been on somewhat of a losing streak in the past two years. In December 2023, for instance, the German pharma\u2019s investigational BTK inhibitor evobrutinib failed a Phase III study in relapsing multiple sclerosis. Earlier that year, in April, the FDA placed evobrutinib on partial clinical hold after detecting signals of liver injury.\n\nUltimately, Merck KGaA announced in March 2024 that it would no longer be developing evobrutinib for multiple sclerosis. In June 2024, the pharma suffered another Phase III flop, this time for xevinapant in locally advanced head and neck cancer.\n\nIf the acquisition pushes through, Merck KGaA will gain ownership over SpringWorks\u2019 desmoid tumor therapy Ogsiveo, which in 2024 brought in $172 million, according to a preview of its full-year financial results presented at the 43rd J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last month. The Connecticut-based biotech had a cash position of nearly $462 million at the end of the year.\n\nMerck KGaA\u2019s acquisition of SpringWorks, if it materializes, will continue biopharma\u2019s dealmaking rally this year. Earlier this week, Bain Capital bought Japanese company Mitsubishi Tanabe for $3.3 billion, while GSK and Johnson & Johnson opened JPM25 with back-to-back buys worth $1 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & An Outfit Better Than DeepSeek. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer spent nearly all of the show either discussing stocks or the changed environment for AI data center stocks after the DeepSeek selloff. During the selloff, Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock lost close to $600 billion in market capitalization. Since then, AI data center investors have been greeted with several optimistic earnings call announcements that counter the narrative of DeepSeek leading to lower AI data center capital expenditure and lower demand for its products.\n\nSince the selloff though, the stock still hasn't risen to its former glory. While it dropped by 17% during the day and has gained 12.5% since then, the shares are still down by 6.6%. The shares appear to have regained some of their value due to growing evidence showing that the demand for AI chips still exists.\n\nThe rise is also relevant when we consider Cramer's remarks in the selloff's immediate aftermath. Back then, the CNBC host had outlined that he was watching two key metrics to determine the fate of the AI stock According to Cramer, the first metric is energy spending. Investors have piled into nuclear energy stocks due to the industry's demand for clean energy to power gigawatt data centers. Cramer believes that any drawdown in energy spending or a slowdown of plans such as those to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear reactors could signal a paradigm shift in AI data center investing.\n\nThe second metric is GPU orders. On this front, earnings calls from big tech firms have painted an optimistic picture as no firm has significantly reduced their expenditure. Yet, Cramer had cautioned back then \u201cBut that\u2019s not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, \u2018listen, I\u2019ve decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I\u2019m going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.\u2019 I\u2019ve not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\u201d\n\nWhile capital expenditure spending by big tech for data centers is an estimate of future capital outlays, a similar metric is the revenue earned by chip manufacturers. On this front, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer based in Taiwan announced in February that it had earned a cool $8.93 billion in January to mark an impressive 39% annual growth. This revenue is from chips that will ship later this year, and it presented investors with insight into semiconductor demand immediately after the DeepSeek selloff. Although, granted that these orders were likely made before the selloff, the shares of the AI GPU stock jumped by 2.7% on the news.",

So far, SpringWorks \u2013 which was spun out of Pfizer in 2017 and develops drugs for cancer and rare diseases \u2013 has yet to issue its own statement on the matter.\n\nIf a deal is reached, it will help shore up Merck's product pipeline at a time when it has suffered some R&D disappointments, including for much-touted head and neck cancer candidate xevinapant, which was abandoned after it failed a phase 3 trial last year, and multiple sclerosis therapy evobrutinib, which was dropped at the end of 2023.\n\nThe German group acknowledged at an R&D update in that year that it had a pressing need to bolster its pipeline, particularly through external 'bolt-on' partnership deals, and get drugs through development and onto the market more quickly. It set a target of launching a new product every 18 months.\n\nSpringWorks already has one product on the market \u2013 Ogsiveo (nirogacestat) \u2013 which is the first FDA-approved therapy for desmoid tumours, a rare type of non-malignant tumour that can aggressively invade neighbouring tissues and cause pain, disfigurement, and mobility problems.\n\nOgsiveo made sales of $172 million last year, even though desmoid tumours affect just a few thousand patients in the US, and SpringWorks ended 2024 with around $462 million in its cash reserves. It is hoping to launch the drug in Europe this year and is also developing it for follow-up indications, including ovarian granulosa cell tumours and multiple myeloma.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs have tipped the drug as having the potential to bring in revenues of more than $800 million at its peak.\n\nComing after Ogsiveo at SprongWorks is Gomekli (mirdametinib), an oral small molecule designed to inhibit MEK1 and MEK2 proteins, which has been submitted for FDA approval as a treatment for tumours caused by the genetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with a verdict due by the end of this month.\n\nMirdametinib has also been filed for the same indication in Europe, with decisions expected around the middle of 2025, and SpringWorks has pledged to set up a European headquarters in the coming months in anticipation of its first ex-US launch, which is slated to take place in Germany.\n\nThe drug is also in phase 2 for paediatric low-grade gliomas and phase 1 for NRAS-mutant solid tumours.",

            "content": "Merck & Co., Inc. is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare company. It was officially founded in 1891 as the US arm of Merck Group, headquartered in Germany. Merck Group was founded in 1668 when Friedrick Jacob Merck purchased a pharmacy in Darmstadt, Germany. The company transformed from a pharmacy into a drug manufacturer in 1827 with the commercialization of morphine and the perfection of the manufacturing process. The company will later gain recognition for isolating and commercializing the manufacture of cocaine as well.\n\nMerck Group sent Theodore Weicker to New York as its representative in 1889 and he quickly began to set up operations. The original investment of $200,000 resulted in a facility in lower Manhattan and the addition of Merck family member George Merck to the project. They began operations in 1891 and were in business as the US branch of Merck Group until 1917 and the onset of World War I.\n\nWorld War I brought about the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the nationalization of Merck Group\u2019s US operations. Those operations were repurchased at a government auction only 2 years later with the help of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, but the split was done. The company retained rights to the Merck name in the US but remained independent. One of many noteworthy achievements in the post-War period is the discovery of streptomycin, which was revolutionary in treating tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1953 the company merged with Sharp& Dohme to form the then 2nd largest US drug manufacturer. The merger brought smallpox vaccines to the portfolio and opened a new avenue of research for the business. Since then, advancements in vaccine technology include treatments for mumps and chickenpox. Other notable advancements include the discovery of statins as a cholesterol inhibitor and work in veterinary medicine.\n\nToday, Merck & Co operates through 2 segments and under 2 different names with a headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ. The company operates as Merck & Co in the US and as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the US and Canada. The 2 segments are Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. Revenue topped $49 billion in 2022 and employed more than 68,000 people. The company has 8 research facilities near major university systems, including 7 in the US and 1 in the UK. As of 2022, the company had 82 pipeline products in Phase 2 trials, 30 in Phase 3 trials and 3 under review.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment researches discover and commercializes human health products in several areas of medicine. These include but are not limited to oncology, acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes. This segment has 6 blockbuster drugs as of late 2022, with each generating more than $1 billion in revenue. The leading treatments are Keytruda for treating cancer-related immune conditions, Gardisil which is a vaccine for HPV and Januvia for treating Type-II diabetes. The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary healthcare products and services. Both segments sell to healthcare facilities and distributors.",

            "content": "This essay originally appeared in Fortune.\n\nWith relevance to current life science companies, the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, often labelled \u201cthe father of modern medicine,\u201d advised almost 3,000 years ago \u201chealing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.\u201d That counsel rings especially true for a pair of ostensibly beleaguered drugmakers, Pfizer and Merck, both of whose stocks have been battered this week despite reporting strong earnings, continuing a prolonged stretch of share underperformance for both companies even with paradoxically good revenues \u200c\n\nThese two iconic pharmaceutical firms have good company as virtually the entire pharmaceutical industry outside of the weight drug titans, GLP-1 companies, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are trading at near-record low valuations. But while they face different and unique challenges, both Pfizer and Merck stand out for the extent to which the investment community may be uniquely underappreciating their prescription for future success. For both drugmakers, investors seem to be addicted to bad news, but some good news could be exactly the antidote the doctor ordered.\u200c\n\nPfizer\u2019s pharma pipeline is underappreciated outside the labs\n\nWith yet another quarter where Pfizer handily beat consensus earnings expectations, it\u2019s even more clear that CEO Albert Bourla is already well on his way toward getting Pfizer back on track\u2014as we presciently wrote in Fortune last year. Not only is Bourla delivering on his cost-cutting pledges, but he is driving renewed sales stability and even impressive sales growth, with Pfizer apparently seizing COVID-19 vaccine market share from rivals such as Moderna.\u200c\n\nThat Pfizer\u2019s turnaround is already well underway is reflected by the fact that activist investor Starboard Value, led by Jeffrey Smith, wisely chose not to nominate any dissident directors to Pfizer\u2019s board ahead of this year\u2019s annual meeting, an apparent vote of confidence that the company is on the right track and apparently satisfied with their constructive, mutually respectful, fruitful engagement with Bourla\u2014for now at least.\u200c\n\nBut Starboard\u2019s decision to \u201cpass\u201d is also a tacit acknowledgment that when it comes to pharma, there are no quick, overnight fixes; and as reflected by Pfizer\u2019s stagnant stock price, current sales matter far less than pipeline excitement in driving drug stock performance. That is because drugmakers have a unique business model where they are only able to maintain the patents on their drugs for around 10-20 years before the patents expire and other companies are able to sell generic versions of the drug, known as loss of exclusivity (LoE); and thus must constantly seek out new, promising drug candidates to replace lost revenues as patents roll off the books continually, and develop those drugs through capital-intensive R&D over the span of years if not decades.\u200c\n\nWith some ~$17 billion in revenues scheduled to roll off Pfizer\u2019s books over the next five years from LoEs, the investment community is understandably laser focused on Pfizer\u2019s pipeline\u2014and admittedly, while the company has already refocused its pipeline to prioritize higher return investments, Pfizer could be much more aggressive in communicating how its pipeline is already poised for tremendous success. While Pfizer management should be commended for opting for a cautious, conservative \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver\u201d approach after being burned before, at the same time, many investors and analysts are ludicrously ascribing zero value to some of Pfizer\u2019s most promising drug candidates, amidst widespread uncertainty and misplaced anxiety.\u200c\n\nHere are some key facts when it comes to Pfizer\u2019s drug pipeline, which the company ought to be shouting from the mountaintops at every opportunity and conveying clearly with quantifiable return on invested capital metrics, not only technical scientific data.\u200c\n\nFirst, the financial returns on Pfizer\u2019s $43 billion Seagen deal have already exceeded the most optimistic internal estimates, with several oncology drugs poised to become blockbusters. Thanks to the Seagen deal paired with technological advances in drug discovery resulting from AI, Pfizer is poised to become the world\u2019s greatest oncology company, on the forefront of solving previously unsolvable cancers representing hundreds of billions in potential revenues.\u200c\n\nSecond, the returns on invested capital from Pfizer\u2019s $11 billion Biohaven transaction have also already exceeded the most optimistic internal estimates, with Nurtec sales growing exponentially en route to blockbuster status, after some initial challenges which are now firmly history.\u200c\n\nThird, many investors still fail to appreciate the full potential of Pfizer\u2019s oral GLP-1 drug candidate, danuglipron, which is on the verge of advancing to Phase 3 studies and is well positioned to become the second oral GLP-1 drug to market, years ahead of competitors\u2014and with the potential oral GLP-1 market dwarfing even the existing injectable GLP-1 market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Fourth, contrary to the myth that Pfizer can\u2019t do R&D and business development, Pfizer\u2019s return on invested capital across its homegrown drugs is near the top of its peer group, and management could be more proactive in quantifying that\u2014along with its strong capital allocation track record\u2014for skittish investors.\u200c\n\nOf course, there are some cynics who take a \u201cshow-me\u201d attitude, and fortunately for those cynics, a catalyst-rich 2025 will provide no shortage of potential sparkplugs, including the release of key GLP-1 danuglipron data in just a few weeks\u2019 time on top of four regulatory decisions, nine Phase 3 readouts, and 13 pivotal program starts. But in the meantime, it won\u2019t hurt Pfizer to sell the story a bit more to anxious investors, and it doesn\u2019t take overpromising or idle speculation to do so. The facts, and just the facts, are enough, and plenty compelling. Sometimes, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis quipped, \u201csunlight is the best disinfectant.\u201d\u200c\n\nMerck\u2019s keys to the future beyond Keytruda\n\nMerck\u2019s challenges are different from Pfizer\u2019s, yet not without some parallels. Similar to Pfizer, the company handily beat consensus earnings expectations this week, yet its stock plummeted 10% on the news that Merck is halting shipments to China of its cancer-preventing Gardasil vaccine while rescinding and lowering guidance.\u200c\n\nWhile Merck\u2019s candor and honesty in pulling Chinese sales of Gardasil off the table is commendable, what was lost amidst the market sell-off is the fact that all Gardasil sales around the world represents merely ~10% of Merck\u2019s revenues, a tiny fraction compared to Merck\u2019s blockbuster Keytruda powerhouse, which represents approximately half of all of Merck\u2019s sales\u2014not to mention that Gardasil sales remain strong around the rest of the world ex-China.\u200c\n\nSimply put, Keytruda is the far more important growth driver, and the story there is much more exciting. The continued soaring success of Keytruda speaks to the triumphant legacy of Merck\u2019s former CEO, the legendary Ken Frazier, who delivered countless blockbusters during his tenure at the top from which Merck continues to reap billions, ranging from Keytruda to Gardasil to Bridion to Lynparza to Lenvima. But with Keytruda facing a LoE in 2028, Frazier\u2019s successor Robert Davis has quietly but triumphantly developed an easier-to-use version of Keytruda 2. The new-and-improved version can be given through a simple needle rather than requiring an intravenous infusion, shortening the time required to administer it from 30 minutes to three minutes, and is poised to capture at least 40% the existing Keytruda market if not more\u2014meaning the Keytruda expiry in 2028 may not be the Armageddon it appears to be.\u200c\n\nEven beyond Keytruda, Davis has diversified Merck\u2019s pipeline by tripling over the last three years the number of drug candidates in late-phase development, which represents over $50 billion in potential revenues. Merck can still grow its pipeline even more through M&A, particularly in the GLP-1 space, thanks to $14 billion cash on hand and a nearly entirely de-levered balance sheet with less than 1x debt.\u200c\n\nDepressing investor value with RFK\u2019s distressing science values\n\nOf course, both Pfizer and Merck stocks have been hurt by the elephant in the room\u2014the impending confirmation of controversial Health & Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who many believe favors superstition over science.\u200c\n\nWhile some speculate that RFK Jr.\u2019s most fervent anti-vaccine instincts will be curtailed, his beliefs on vaccines are not only dangerous economically\u201469% of Trump-friendly major CEOs told us privately that they believe RFK\u2019s anti-vax instincts could pose a threat to public health and the American economy\u2014but also dangerous for public health, since the pharmaceutical industry, and vaccines, have played a leading role in improving public health and have been key drivers of extending the average lifespan of American citizens to record levels over the past few decades. In 1900, average global life expectancy was just 32 years; thanks to advances in medicine, today the average life expectancy is 72 years, and still rising, with seven previously deadly diseases near eradication, ranging from scourges such as smallpox to measles to polio.\u200c\n\nThe facts are powerful when it comes to vaccines\u2019 proven benefits. Should RFK Jr. actually try curtailing access to vaccines, he will be confronting a torrent of opposition from across civil society. Far from playing a pernicious role, drugmakers actually play a heroic role in investing in life-saving research, with trillions spent on life sciences R&D every year to advance new drug discoveries.\u200c\n\nThat R&D takes place not only at big pharma companies\u2014household names such as Pfizer and Merck\u2014but also at smaller, less well-known but no less heroic biosciences startups, such as Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s Roivant Sciences, which has brought many drugs to market tackling everything from autoimmune diseases to inflammation to dermatology. Another one is Vlad Coric\u2019s Biohaven, which is a pioneer in migraine treatment and neurological disorders.\u200c\n\nEven RFK Jr.\u2019s boss, President Donald Trump, has directed ire toward not the drugmakers, but rather the middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). As President Trump declared, \u201cwe have a thing called a \u2018middleman\u2019\u2026that makes more money than the drug companies, and they don\u2019t do anything except they\u2019re middlemen. We are going to knock out the middleman.\u201d\u200c\n\n\n\nClearly, despite the battering Pfizer and Merck have taken from investors, there is more good news than meets the eye. As Jim Cramer said on CNBC today, \u201cI am mystified\u2026[they] are doing everything they promised and more\u2026and that\u2019s why you buy!\u201d While investors might be addicted to bad news, an antidote is in order in all the underappreciated good news hiding in plain sight, as Pfizer and Merck fulfill their prescriptions for success.\u200c",

            "content": "Investors looking for ways to pump up their passive income streams might want to turn their heads toward the pharmaceutical industry. At recent prices, you can buy shares of Merck (MRK -0.17%) that offer a yield above 3%, and shares of Pfizer (PFE 0.08%) offer a yield above 6%.\n\nWhich of these two high-yield dividend payers is best for your portfolio? Let's weigh their strong points against some of the challenges they face, to see which stock is a better buy now.\n\nThe case for Merck\n\nShares of Merck have fallen about 34% from a peak they reached last year. The stock is under pressure because its lead drug, a cancer immunotherapy called Keytruda, is expected to lose patent-protected market exclusivity in the U.S. and Chinese markets in 2028.\n\nPatent protections regarding Keytruda in Europe are expected to expire in 2031, and incoming biosimilar competition could leave an enormous gap to fill. Fourth-quarter sales of Keytruda grew 19% year over year to an annualized $31.3 billion. That's a little over half of Merck's total revenue stream.\n\nNow that Merck stock has been beaten down, it offers a higher yield than we usually see from the well-established pharmaceutical giant. At recent prices, the stock offers a 3.7% yield.\n\nLast March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Winrevair, a treatment for adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fourth-quarter Winrevair sales climbed to an annualized $800 million and could go a long way toward offsetting upcoming Keytruda losses. Analyst estimates suggest Winrevair sales could reach $4 billion by 2029.\n\nBiologic drugs like Keytruda typically lose around 50% of sales within the first couple of years following a loss of patent-protected exclusivity. Annual Keytruda sales already exceed $31 billion, so Merck will need at least a few more Winrevair-sized drug launches to offset the upcoming losses. Behind Winrevair, though, there isn't much in Merck's pipeline to get excited about.\n\nBehind Winrevair, the most promising clinical-stage program in Merck's pipeline is a cholesterol drug tentatively named MK-0616. The company started a 17,000-patient phase 3 program to test MK-0616 in 2023, and initial results could be ready soon.\n\nMK-0616 is an oral PCSK9 inhibitor that greatly boosts the liver's ability to absorb low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Repatha, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor from Amgen, grew sales by 36% last year to $2.2 billion. Even if Merck's orally available option goes on to dominate the PCSK9 space, the company needs several more blockbuster drug launches before investors can comfortably expect a continuation of its dividend-payout raising streak after Keytruda loses market exclusivity.\n\nThe case for Pfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer are down by more than half from an all-time high the stock set in 2021. Fortunately for income-seeking investors, its dividend payout is moving in the right direction.\n\nLast December, Pfizer raised its payout for the 16th consecutive year to $0.43 per share. At recent prices, it offers a juicy 6.7% yield.\n\nOften, stocks offering ultrahigh yields of more than four times the market average are on the edge of a dividend cut. This doesn't appear to be the case at Pfizer. The pharmaceutical giant expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $2.80 and $3.00 per share this year. That's more than it needs to meet a dividend commitment it recently raised to $1.72 per share.\n\nSales of Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment and vaccine are down a long way from their peak, but the worst is over. Combined sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty fell by 11% to a combined $11.1 billion in 2024.\n\nEliquis, a blood thinner marketed in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, is Pfizer's largest revenue stream at the moment. It could begin competing with generic versions in the U.S. market in 2028, but the gap it leaves won't be too difficult to fill. Eliquis is responsible for only about 10.3% of Pfizer's total revenue stream.\n\nPfizer has several recently launched treatments in position to offset upcoming Eliquis losses. For example, Padcev, a new cancer treatment, racked up an annualized $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and could climb much higher. The FDA approved it to treat frontline bladder cancer patients in 2023, which is expected to push annual sales past $8 billion by 2030.\n\nThe better buy now\n\nCompared to Merck, Pfizer's upcoming patent cliffs will be relatively easy to manage. While Pfizer seems likely to continue its dividend-raising streak through the coming decade, the future of Merck's payout is much less certain.\n\nIf these two stocks offered identical yields, Pfizer would still be the better buy. With a much higher yield that seems likely to continue rising for at least another decade, Pfizer is clearly the better dividend stock to buy now.",

The Darmstadt, Germany-based company said that no legally binding agreement has been signed and there is no certainty a deal will materialize.\n\nSpringWorks declined to comment.\n\nIf the talks are successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, three sources told Reuters earlier in the day, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. They did not disclose the exact terms being discussed.\n\nSpringWorks' shares closed 34% higher on Monday, giving the company a market value of around $4 billion. The stock initially jumped nearly 49% on the Reuters report, and touched its highest level since April 2022.\n\nMerck's German-listed shares closed down 3.7%.\n\nDealmaking in the U.S. healthcare sector is showing signs of picking up, after a slowdown in activity in 2024 as large pharmaceutical companies took a breather to integrate big acquisitions they completed the previous year. Johnson & Johnson last month agreed to buy Intra-Cellular Therapeutics for about $14.6 billion.\n\nStamford, Connecticut-based SpringWorks, which listed its shares in New York in 2019, is a commercial-stage biotech firm that develops drugs to treat various forms of cancer, including rare tumors and uterine cancer. Its monotherapy drug for the treatment of desmoid tumors, which are dense, soft-tissue tumors, has been approved in the United States. The company is expecting the approval of a product that treats neurofibromatosis type-1, a rare genetic disorder, later in February.\n\nSTRATEGIC BET\n\nA transaction for SpringWorks would rank as one of the biggest pharma deals for Merck in recent years and boost its efforts to build out its cancer treatment pipeline.\n\nMerck has suffered high-profile setbacks recently in late-stage drug trials, prompting it to halt development of head and neck cancer drug Xevinapant. A major trial testing multiple sclerosis drug Evobrutinib failed in December 2023.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly earnings, Merck reported a 12% rise in adjusted quarterly earnings, helped by temporarily lower spending on drug development and a rebound in demand for its specialty materials.",

Here are 4 no-brainer reasons to buy this dip in Merck stock.\n\n1) Guidance Shortfall Was Due to a Deliberate Pause in Shipments to China\n\nThe whole of the top and bottom-line guidance shortfall can be attributed to Merck\u2019s deliberate decision to pause shipments of its Gardasil to China from February to mid-2025.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 100th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 24.4% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -2.86 News Sentiment 0.91 Insider Trading Acquiring Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 9.88% See Full Analysis\n\nGardasil is its human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which is used to prevent diseases and cancers caused by HPV. Gardasil sales in Q4 fell 17% YoY to $1.55 billion, which missed analyst estimates of $1.61 billion. For the full year 2024, Gardasil generated $8.6 billion in sales, down 3%.\n\nThe reason for the temporary shipment halts is to give the market a chance to work through its inventory in China and allow distributors to adjust inventory to demand. This obviously indicates a demand issue, but Merck insists that growth will resume in the second half of 2025. Gardasil dominates the market for HPV vaccines but still faces competition from GSK plc NYSE: GSK bivalent HPV vaccine Cervarix.\n\n2) Merck\u2019s Pipeline of Drugs Is Worth More Than $50 Billion\n\nIn its Q4 conference call, Merck CEO Rob Davis stated they have 20 potential new pipeline treatment growth drivers, almost all of which have blockbuster growth opportunities. Some of these include their adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE, now launching in the United States. Merck has many promising treatments in Phase 3 development. In fact, Merck has tripled the number of drugs in late-stage Phase 3 development in the past three years. Davis stated, \u201cBased on the significant progress, we see over $50 billion of potential revenue opportunity from these programs.\u201d\n\n3) Merck Stock Presents a Value At These Levels\n\nAfter the 10% price drop, Merck stock now trades at just 11.45x forward earnings compared to the industry average of 30.22x. Its trailing 12-month (TTM) price-earnings (P/E) ratio at 18.29 is below its 10-year median P/E of 25.36. Its price-to-sale (P/S) ratio is 3.45 compared to the industry average of 4.31. Its stock pays a 3.71% annual dividend yield with a strong debt-to-equity ratio of 0.79 and an A+ credit rating for its fortress balance sheet, generating a TTM operating cash flow of $18.26 billion. Shares are trading 35.3% off their highs, 37.91% off their consensus analyst price target, and at three-year lows.\n\n4) MRK Stock Is Nearing a Triple Monthly Support Level\n\nA triple support is comprised of three overlapping levels of trendlines, bumpers or indicators. Wider time frame charts tend to have firmer price levels.\n\nMRK\u2019s monthly candlestick chart illustrates a sharp decline from its highs. The stock is nearing a triple price level support. The three support levels converge around the $86.02 to $85.48 level, followed by another double support at the $83.05 to $82.56 level. The first triple support level is comprised of the lower tails trendline extension (purple), price support at $86.02 (green), and the monthly anchored VWAP support at $85.48 (orange). The second level of double supports is at the $86.02 support (green) and the $82.56 Fib 0.076 support (light green). The whole support cluster range is between $82.56 to $86.02.\n\nActionable Options Strategies : Bullish investors can consider using cash-secured puts at the Fib pullback support levels to buy the dip. If assigned the shares, then writing covered call at upside Fib levels executes a wheel strategy for income in addition to its 3.71% annual forward dividend yield.\n\nBefore you consider Merck & Co., Inc., you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently examined the latest market trends, highlighting some important themes where stocks have faced challenges, especially those reliant on business with China.\n\nHe pointed out that certain stocks often experience significant drops after earnings reports, a trend he has observed consistently. However, Cramer cautioned that finding buying opportunities from these dips is not always as simple as it may seem. While these stocks might appear attractive when they get hit, he emphasized that they are typically impacted unjustifiably, suggesting that if you buy them whenever they drop, you would likely see positive returns. He added:\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re probably saying, can it really be that easy? I mean, why aren\u2019t I a millionaire? Well, I\u2019ll tell you why. Because there are landmines, real landmines in the yellow brick road times when the dips are milling at the beginning so I\u2019m gonna spell those out for you too.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks and Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently\n\nOne of the first questions Cramer believes investors should ask themselves is whether a stock is tied to China in any way. This dependency, he mentioned, has severely impacted many companies recently. Cramer also pointed out that retailers, especially department stores, have taken a hit, as well as companies in the chemical sector, which heavily rely on Chinese demand. According to Cramer, these businesses need orders from China to stay afloat, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in that market.\n\nAnother factor Cramer highlighted is the growing impact of GLP-1 drugs, which have the potential to curb cravings for certain food products. Cramer pointed to beloved brands like Hershey, Oreos, and Fruit Loops, among others, which are now facing challenges as these drugs reduce consumer desire for such treats. He noted that with demand for these products waning, the stocks of companies producing them are suffering.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Always remember that there are indeed Teflon stocks in any market. The key? Don\u2019t buy them unless and until they get knocked down and then remember they\u2019ll get up again. You are never gonna keep them down.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 22.6x Merck KGaA ( ) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in Germany have P/E ratios under 16x and even P/E's lower than 10x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's as high as it is.\n\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Merck KGaA's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For Merck KGaA?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Merck KGaA's to be considered reasonable.\n\nTaking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 7.0%. This has erased any of its gains during the last three years, with practically no change in EPS being achieved in total. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over that time.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 13% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 16% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nIn light of this, it's alarming that Merck KGaA's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\n\nOur examination of Merck KGaA's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis.

            "content": "A landmark lawsuit against Merck is underway in a Los Angeles courtroom, marking the company\u2019s first jury trial over claims it misrepresented the safety of its highly profitable Gardasil HPV vaccine.\n\nNewly declassified documents in the trial have revealed troubling details about Merck\u2019s failure to conduct key safety tests.\n\nInternal emails reveal that Merck knew its Gardasil vaccine was contaminated with HPV DNA fragments from the vaccine's manufacturing process and lobbied regulators to bypass testing requirements.\n\nUncovering Residual DNA Contamination\n\nConcerns over Gardasil\u2019s residual DNA contamination have persisted for over a decade.\n\nIn 2011, Dr. Sin Hang Lee, a pathologist with extensive experience in DNA analysis, discovered high levels of HPV DNA fragments in 16 Gardasil vials from several countries, including the US, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Poland, and France. See previous story\n\nThese DNA fragments, originating from the plasmid DNA used in vaccine production to code for the HPV virus' L1 protein, are supposed to be removed during manufacturing.\n\nInstead, high levels of HPV DNA fragments remain in the final product and tightly bind to the aluminium adjuvant (AAHS). Unlike free DNA molecules in solution, the aluminium-bound HPV DNA is stabilised and resists breakdown by enzymes.\n\nOnce injected, these aggregates are absorbed by immune cells and activate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), triggering pro-inflammatory responses.\n\nAccording to Dr Lee, for some individuals, particularly those with genetic predispositions, this can lead to autoimmune conditions such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) or, in rare cases, sudden death.\n\nNotably, Gardasil\u2019s package inserts make no mention of the presence of HPV DNA or its potential to trigger immune responses.\n\nInternal Emails Reveal Negligence and Cover-Up\n\nDr. Lee is set to testify in the lawsuit, and his witness statement provides key evidence suggesting Merck was aware of the issue of HPV DNA contamination but failed to act.\n\nFollowing Dr. Lee\u2019s findings in 2011, Merck was asked by the Swiss drug regulator, Swissmedic, to provide data on HPV DNA levels in Gardasil.\n\nIn response, Merck\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Carlos Sattler, made a revealing admission to his colleagues in an internal email. On Sept 8, 2011, Sattler admitted \u201cWe did not specifically look for the HPV L1 plasmid DNA.\u201d\n\nDespite this, Sattler downplayed the significance of the contamination, stating that Merck had \u201cno plans\u201d to conduct any testing and that, even if small amounts were present, there was \u201cno evidence that this would be associated with any risk.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Merck scientist Annie Sturgess confirmed, \u201cWe have not directly measured HPV DNA\u201d in the vaccine.\n\nMerck attempted to satisfy Swissmedic by estimating the level of HPV DNA using \"yeast DNA\" content as a proxy, but the regulator rejected this approach.\n\nDr Thomas Hottiger of Swissmedic warned Merck that its method was \u201cnot entirely fit for purpose\u201d and explained that the company would need to use a PCR test specific for detecting HPV plasmid DNA, which behaves differently from yeast DNA.\n\nMerck\u2019s North American representative, Dave Wohlpart, expressed reluctance to perform such testing, and proposed to his colleagues that Merck \u201cnot do testing\u201d altogether.\n\nOn October 21, 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a public announcement claiming that Merck had actually known that \u201csmall quantities of residual recombinant HPV L1-specific DNA fragments remain in the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThis disclosure came as a surprise to Merck.\n\nFrank Vandendriessche, Merck\u2019s Director of Regulatory Affairs in Europe, reacted to the FDA\u2019s announcement, writing in an email that the company had \u201cnever tested specifically for HPV L1 DNA fragments.\u201d\n\nMerck used the situation to its advantage to suggest it was now a moot point. Armed with the FDA\u2019s announcement, Merck lobbied Swissmedic to withdraw its request for new data.\n\nSwissmedic obliged, granting a waiver for specific HPV DNA testing. Instead, Merck was instructed to make a minor change to the product's label\u2014effectively burying the issue.\n\nRegulatory Failure: Complicity or Incompetence?\n\nGardasil was approved and distributed globally without proper testing for HPV L1 DNA contamination. Instead of enforcing rigorous safety standards, regulators allowed Merck\u2019s flawed testing procedures to pass unchecked.\n\nEven when evidence of contamination surfaced, regulators largely overlooked it, revealing a pattern of negligence and wilful blindness.\n\nTheir reluctance to demand accountability suggests either regulatory capture or gross incompetence\u2014both of which have devastating consequences for the millions who have received the vaccine.\n\nThis trial may not only determine Merck\u2019s liability\u2014it could force a long-overdue reckoning with the regulatory agencies that have shielded pharmaceutical giants from scrutiny for far too long.\n\nDr Lee will take the stand and testify at the trial on 13 February 2025.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nFDA ignored residual DNA fragments in the Gardasil HPV vaccine\n\nWould you like Plasmids with that?\n\nGive a gift subscription\n\nShare",

The burden that complex allergies with increased morbidity place on the healthcare system motivate R&D in this area and the introduction of novel medicines. In addition, the prevalence of asthma and allergy respiratory illnesses has increased as a result of rising air pollution levels both inside and outside. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), rising pollen levels are the root cause of more than 25 million allergies.According to the Canadian Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Foundation, between 20 and 25 percent of Canadians suffer from allergic rhinitis. Additionally, traditional symptomatic drugs are ineffective in treating 50% of the affected individuals. As a result, major corporations are concentrating on creating novel immunotherapy medicines. As an illustration, in 2019 ALK made a filing to the Canadian regulatory agency for its experimental tree SLIT-tablet.List of Prominent Players in the Allergy Immunotherapy Market:\u2022 ASIT Biotech\u2022 Circassia\u2022 Mylan N.V.\u2022 Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation\u2022 Merck KGaA\u2022 Stallergenes Greer plc\u2022 Allergy Therapeutics\u2022 ALK-Abell\u00f3 A/S\u2022 DESENTUM OY\u2022 HAL Allergy B.V.\u2022 HollisterStier Allergy\u2022 LETIPharma\u2022 DBV Technologies SAExpert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Market Dynamics:Drivers-The global market for allergy immunotherapy is anticipated to expand as a result of the increasing incidence and prevalence of allergic illnesses. For instance, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, there were 19.2 million cases of hay fever in adults over the age of 18 and 5.2 million cases in children under the age of 18. Additionally, rising pollution and environmental changes are fueling the expansion of the global market for allergy immunotherapy. For instance, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) estimates that over 23 million Americans suffer from symptoms of ragweed pollen allergy. For those who have allergies, these symptoms can make life miserable. They can also create asthma symptoms worse for those who have allergies and asthma.Challenges:Despite the many advantages of allergy immunotherapy, there is a poor rate of population compliance due to several issues, including inadequate patient knowledge and a lack of adequate funding. For instance, a 2022 article in the NCBI claims that the inconvenience of SCIT and the negative effects of subcutaneous and sublingual therapy are the main causes of patients stopping these treatments. Additionally, the cost of allergy shots in the United States ranges from USD 1,600 to USD 4,000 annually for those without insurance coverage to USD 800 annually for those who receive sufficient reimbursement. Additionally, the SLIT drops in the nation have not yet received approval and are not insured. Hence, the high price for the therapy is limiting the market's expansion.Regional Trends:The region with the fastest CAGR was Europe, which is anticipated to maintain its lead throughout the projected period. This is explained by the substantial participation of key market players like ASIT Biotech, Circassia, Mylan N.V., and Merck KGaA. More than 150 million people in Europe currently have allergic illnesses, and by 2025, it is predicted that more than 50% of the region's population would have at least one type of allergy as a result of several factors, including industrialization, urbanization, climate change, and pollution.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In July 2022, The good findings regarding the significant advantage of sublingual liquid allergen immunotherapy treatment (AIT) on the beginning and worsening of asthma in patients with allergic rhinitis was released by Stallergenes Greer, a worldwide healthcare firm that specializes in allergen immunotherapy (AIT).Segmentation of Allergy Immunotherapy Market-By Treatment Type-\u2022 Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT)\u2022 Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT)\u2022 Tablets\u2022 DropsBy Allergy Type-\u2022 Allergic rhinitis\u2022 Allergic asthma\u2022 OthersBy Distribution Channel-\u2022 Hospital Pharmacy\u2022 Retail Pharmacy\u2022 Online PharmacyBy Region-North America-\u2022 The US\u2022 Canada\u2022 MexicoEurope-\u2022 Germany\u2022 The UK\u2022 France\u2022 Italy\u2022 Spain\u2022 Rest of EuropeAsia-Pacific-\u2022 China\u2022 Japan\u2022 India\u2022 South Korea\u2022 Southeast Asia\u2022 Rest of Asia PacificLatin America-\u2022 Brazil\u2022 Argentina\u2022 Rest of Latin AmericaMiddle East & Africa-\u2022 GCC Countries\u2022 South Africa\u2022 Rest of the Middle East and AfricaAbout Us:InsightAce Analytic is a market research and consulting firm that enables clients to make strategic decisions.

            "content": "Dividends are a strategy that requires patience, with rewards unfolding over time. For instance, if you had invested a dollar in the broader market in 1927 and didn\u2019t reinvest any dividends, it would now be worth $243. However, if dividends had been reinvested, that same dollar would have grown to $3,737. The good news is that you don't need to wait a century to see the growth potential of dividend stocks, as the near-term outlook is positive. A report from AGF Investments notes that global monetary easing in the latter half of 2024 has driven bond yields lower, making them less appealing compared to dividend-paying stocks. Moreover, companies that distribute higher dividends tend to have more financial leverage, and with lower bond yields, they can better manage their interest expenses, enhancing their financial performance and supporting continued dividend growth.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind as the AI boom and growing interest in tech stocks shifted investor focus elsewhere. The Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, underperformed relative to the broader market. However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of dividend stocks. This confidence is driven by the substantial cash reserves many US companies hold, which provide a strong foundation for sustaining or increasing dividend payouts. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reports that large-cap US companies collectively hold over $2.4 trillion in cash, creating significant opportunities to start or enhance dividends.\n\nAlmost all of the companies in the index distribute dividends to their shareholders, with some having stronger dividend records than others. While there is a lot of focus on AI-driven capital gains, it's important to keep in mind that dividends have consistently been a key component of total returns. Over the long term, their importance grows. From 1987 to the end of 2023, about 55% of market returns have been generated from reinvested dividends.\n\nThe Dow is a highly recognized and influential stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges, representing a wide range of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by nearly 16%, and it has delivered a return of over 5% since the start of 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChris Senyek, Chief Investment Strategist at Wolfe Research, offers an alternative approach to investing in dividend stocks. While most investors focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek recommends also considering companies that are starting to pay dividends or those that have recently cut their payouts. A new dividend often signals that management is confident in its ability to sustain earnings and cash flow, while also appealing to a broader group of investors.\n\nSenyek also pointed out that stocks of companies that reduce their dividends typically underperform before the cut, align with the broader market afterward, and then start to outperform about six months later. The strategy is to identify companies that might be at risk of cutting their dividends and reassess those that have already made cuts in recent months. To predict potential dividend cuts, Senyek looks for companies with high dividend yields, significant debt, and high payout ratios. For companies that might begin paying dividends, he focuses on those with strong free cash flow yields, active share buybacks, and manageable debt levels. With this in mind, we will now take a look at some of the best Dow dividend stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we examined the companies within the Dow Jones index and identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders. From that group, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of February 6. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(MRK): 'Forget It\u2026 It\u2019s China,' Jim Cramer on Vaccine Rollout Woes\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nUpside Potential as of February 6: 32.18%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company that offers innovative health solutions to its consumers. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company posted revenue of $15.6 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same quarter the previous year. The company has solidified its position as a leader in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, particularly with its flagship cancer drug, Keytruda, which has revolutionized treatment methods and driven notable revenue growth. The company\u2019s strong market presence generates significant cash flow, allowing it to provide returns to shareholders. In FY24, Keytruda\u2019s sales grew 18% year-over-year, reaching $29.5 billion.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has made significant strides in expanding its drug pipeline. Initially, it expected its new drug portfolio to generate an additional $35 billion in revenue by the start of 2024, but this estimate has now been revised to $50 billion. This growth is largely attributed to a substantial increase in its clinical trials, with 26 phase III trials currently in progress, compared to just nine in 2021. Several of these trials have the potential to develop into blockbuster drugs, especially in the HIV treatment sector. Moreover, the company has partnered with Gilead Sciences on a combination therapy that could revolutionize HIV care.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), one of the best dividend stocks on our list, has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 14 consecutive years. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.67%, as of February 6.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was included in 86 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these funds are worth over $7.1 billion in total. With over 14.6 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 1st on our list of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Merck & Co., Inc. is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare company. It was officially founded in 1891 as the US arm of Merck Group, headquartered in Germany. Merck Group was founded in 1668 when Friedrick Jacob Merck purchased a pharmacy in Darmstadt, Germany. The company transformed from a pharmacy into a drug manufacturer in 1827 with the commercialization of morphine and the perfection of the manufacturing process. The company will later gain recognition for isolating and commercializing the manufacture of cocaine as well.\n\nMerck Group sent Theodore Weicker to New York as its representative in 1889 and he quickly began to set up operations. The original investment of $200,000 resulted in a facility in lower Manhattan and the addition of Merck family member George Merck to the project. They began operations in 1891 and were in business as the US branch of Merck Group until 1917 and the onset of World War I.\n\nWorld War I brought about the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the nationalization of Merck Group\u2019s US operations. Those operations were repurchased at a government auction only 2 years later with the help of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, but the split was done. The company retained rights to the Merck name in the US but remained independent. One of many noteworthy achievements in the post-War period is the discovery of streptomycin, which was revolutionary in treating tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1953 the company merged with Sharp& Dohme to form the then 2nd largest US drug manufacturer. The merger brought smallpox vaccines to the portfolio and opened a new avenue of research for the business. Since then, advancements in vaccine technology include treatments for mumps and chickenpox. Other notable advancements include the discovery of statins as a cholesterol inhibitor and work in veterinary medicine.\n\nToday, Merck & Co operates through 2 segments and under 2 different names with a headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ. The company operates as Merck & Co in the US and as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the US and Canada. The 2 segments are Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.

Global recruitment of the waveLINE-010 trial has begun, with patients now enrolling.\n\n\u201cFollowing the encouraging results observed in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial, we look forward to evaluating the potential clinical benefits of a combination regimen with zilovertamab vedotin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to the current standard treatment,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cADCs have shown promise as an important modality in the treatment of different cancer types, and the initiation of this Phase 3 waveLINE clinical trial demonstrates our commitment to researching zilovertamab vedotin to help address unmet needs for patients with this aggressive and most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d\n\nWaveLINE-010 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06717347 ), which is enrolling an estimated 1,046 patients globally. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints include complete response (CR) rate at the end of the treatment, overall survival, event-free survival, duration of CR and safety.\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 waveLINE-003 dose confirmation and expansion trial (NCT05139017) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial (NCT05406401) in combination with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL. Merck recently presented data from this trial for the first time at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024.",

            "content": "RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the initiation of waveLINE-010, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating zilovertamab vedotin in combination with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) compared to rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) alone, for the treatment of patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Zilovertamab vedotin is Merck\u2019s investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). Global recruitment of the waveLINE-010 trial has begun, with patients now enrolling.\n\n\u201c Following the encouraging results observed in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial, we look forward to evaluating the potential clinical benefits of a combination regimen with zilovertamab vedotin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to the current standard treatment,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201c ADCs have shown promise as an important modality in the treatment of different cancer types, and the initiation of this Phase 3 waveLINE clinical trial demonstrates our commitment to researching zilovertamab vedotin to help address unmet needs for patients with this aggressive and most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d\n\nWaveLINE-010 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06717347), which is enrolling an estimated 1,046 patients globally. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints include complete response (CR) rate at the end of the treatment, overall survival, event-free survival, duration of CR and safety.\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 waveLINE-003 dose confirmation and expansion trial (NCT05139017) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial (NCT05406401) in combination with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL. Merck recently presented data from this trial for the first time at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024.\n\nAbout diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n\nLymphoma is cancer beginning in the lymphatic system \u2013 the network of organs, vessels and tissues that protects the body from infection. There are many subtypes of lymphoma, which is often categorized into two main types \u2013 Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of NHL, is derived from white blood cells that grow rapidly and uncontrollably, enlarging the lymph nodes and often migrating to other parts of the body. DLBCL accounts for approximately 25-30% of all NHLs worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL each year. The five-year relative survival rate for DLBCL is 60-70%.\n\nAbout zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)\n\nZilovertamab vedotin is an investigational ADC that targets ROR1. ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies. Merck is committed to research with zilovertamab vedotin across B-cell malignancies and is establishing a robust program of clinical trials under the name waveLINE. The waveLINE program includes a Phase 2/3 study in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (waveLINE-003, NCT05139017) and a Phase 2 study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (waveLINE-007, NCT05406401).\n\nAbout Merck in hematology\n\nMerck is committed to advancing innovation and care for people with hematologic neoplasms and malignancies. Building on its leadership in oncology, the company has a broad clinical development program that evaluates novel mechanisms of action to address longstanding unmet needs for patients with hematologic disorders. Among Merck\u2019s research efforts are studies evaluating multiple investigational medicines as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies across a range of hematologic neoplasms and malignancies.\n\nMerck\u2019s focus on cancer\n\nEvery day, we follow the science as we work to discover innovations that can help patients, no matter what stage of cancer they have. As a leading oncology company, we are pursuing research where scientific opportunity and medical need converge, underpinned by our diverse pipeline of more than 25 novel mechanisms.

The early response was not positive, with shares down 8.8% to US$89.67 in the past week. Revenues of US$64b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at US$6.74, missing estimates by 3.8%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Merck after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Merck\n\nNYSE:MRK Earnings and Revenue Growth February 6th 2025\n\nAfter the latest results, the 22 analysts covering Merck are now predicting revenues of US$66.0b in 2025. If met, this would reflect an okay 2.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 23% to US$8.34. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$67.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.79 in 2025. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the small dip in earnings per share expectations.\n\nThe analysts made no major changes to their price target of US$119, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Merck's valuation. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Merck, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$148 and the most bearish at US$95.00 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Merck shareholders.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Merck's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 2.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 9.8% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.2% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Merck is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.",

The early response was not positive, with shares down 8.8% to US$89.67 in the past week. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$64b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 3.8% to hit US$6.74 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Merck after the latest results.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Merck's 22 analysts is for revenues of US$66.0b in 2025. This would reflect a modest 2.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 23% to US$8.34. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$67.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.79 in 2025. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the minor downgrade to earnings per share expectations.\n\nDespite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the US$119 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Merck analyst has a price target of US$148 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$95.00. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Merck shareholders.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and growth estimates. We would highlight that Merck's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 2.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 9.8% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 9.2% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Merck.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$119, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks.\n\nWall Street\u2019s main indices all finished in the green territory on Tuesday, buoyed by news that the US is set to temporarily delay taxes levied on select goods from Canada and Mexico to make way for a potential negotiation.\n\nThe Dow Jones inched up by 0.30 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both jumped 0.72 percent and 1.35 percent, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, 10 companies bucked an overall positive market sentiment, leading declines mostly due to disappointing earnings performance in the past quarter. This article details the reasons behind their poor performance.\n\nTo come up with Tuesday\u2019s biggest losers, we only considered the companies with $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume.\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Dividend Stock on Robinhood?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nPharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) saw its share prices decrease by 9.07 percent on Tuesday to end at $90.74 apiece after providing a lower 2025 outlook guidance.\n\nThe company set a sales guidance between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion in full-year 2025, or lower than the Wall Street consensus of $67.4 billion.\n\nLikewise, its targeted earnings per share were lower at $8.88 to $9.03, as compared with analysts' expectations of $9.21.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Merck delivered a net income of $3.74 billion, which, albeit marking a swing from a net loss of $1.2 billion in the same quarter in 2023, was noticeably lower than Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $3.92 billion.\n\nFor the full year, Merck reported $64.2 billion in revenues, representing a 7 percent increase from 2023.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of Tuesday's biggest losers. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Additionally, Merck\u2019s vaccine elicited non-inferior immune responses in adults aged 18 to 49 years compared to those aged 50 to 64 years and had a safety profile comparable to PCV20.\n\nThe recommendation was also supported by results from the phase 3 STRIDE-4, STRIDE-5, STRIDE-6, STRIDE-7 and STRIDE-10 trials.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) will now review the positive opinion as it makes a final decision on Capvaxive, which is expected by the second quarter of 2025.\n\nPaula Annunziato, senior vice president, infectious diseases and vaccines, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories, said: \u201cThis positive opinion is yet another testament to the clinical profile of Capvaxive and brings us a step closer to helping protect adults in the EU against pneumococcal disease.\n\n\u201cInvasive pneumococcal disease can lead to serious consequences, including hospitalisation, organ damage and even death. We are pleased with the CHMP recommendation and look forward to the EC\u2019s decision.\u201d",

            "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nMerck in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in Rahway, Merck (MRK) is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of -8.79% so far this year. The pharmaceutical company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.81 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.57%. This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.24% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.51%.\n\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.24 is up 3.8% from last year. Merck has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.95%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Merck's payout ratio is 52%, which means it paid out 52% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nMRK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $9.12 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 19.22%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MRK is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And can they trust Merck\u2019s guidance on that decline?\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe problems with Gardasil relate entirely to sales of the vaccine in China, where Merck had been forecasting robust growth but where results have recently been disappointing. The company said its partner in China, Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products, has stocked up more Gardasil than it can sell. As a result, Merck will stop shipping Gardasil to Zhifei at least until the middle of the year.",

WELIREG 160 72 122% 123% Growth primarily driven by higher demand in the U.S., largely attributable to ongoing uptake of a new indication. SIMPONI - 171 N/M N/M Marketing rights in former Merck territories reverted to Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 1, 2024. Animal Health 1,397 1,278 9% 13% Growth primarily driven by higher pricing for both Livestock and Companion Animal product portfolios, as well as sales related to July 2024 acquisition of Elanco aqua business and higher demand for Livestock products. Approximately 3 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange were due to devaluation of Argentine peso, which were largely offset by inflation-related price increases. Livestock 889 808 10% 14% Growth primarily driven by higher demand for poultry products, sales related to acquisition of Elanco aqua business, as well as higher pricing across the portfolio. Companion Animal 508 470 8% 10% Growth primarily driven by higher pricing across the product portfolio. Sales of BRAVECTO were $209 million and $197 million in current and prior year quarters, respectively, which represented growth of 6%, or 10% excluding impact of foreign exchange. Other Revenues** 185 211 -13% 3% Decline primarily due to impact of revenue-hedging activities and lower revenues from third-party manufacturing arrangements, partially offset by payments received for out-licensing arrangements and higher royalty income. *Alliance revenue for this product represents Merck\u2019s share of profits, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs. **Other revenues are comprised primarily of revenues from third-party manufacturing arrangements and miscellaneous corporate revenues, including revenue-hedging activities.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales grew 10%. Approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange were due to devaluation of the Argentine peso, which were largely offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with practice in that market. Pharmaceutical sales growth was primarily driven by higher sales in oncology, particularly KEYTRUDA and WELIREG, as well as increased alliance revenue from Reblozyl and Lynparza. Higher sales in the cardiovascular franchise, reflecting the successful launch of WINREVAIR, as well as higher sales of certain hospital acute care products, particularly PREVYMIS, also drove revenue growth in 2024. Pharmaceutical sales growth in 2024 was partially offset by lower sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET, primarily reflecting lower pricing in the U.S. and generic competition in many international markets, lower sales of the COVID-19 medication LAGEVRIO, lower sales of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 and lower sales of SIMPONI and REMICADE, reflecting the transfer of marketing rights in former Merck territories back to Johnson & Johnson.\n\nFull-year 2024 Animal Health sales grew 4% to $5.9 billion. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 8%. Approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange were due to devaluation of the Argentine peso, which were largely offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with practice in that market. Full-year sales growth was primarily driven by higher pricing across both the Companion Animal and Livestock product portfolios, and higher demand for poultry and swine products, as well as sales related to the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business. Sales of BRAVECTO were $1.1 billion in 2024, which represented growth of 6%, or 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\n\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nThe table below presents selected expense information.\n\n$ in millions GAAP Acquisition-\n\nand\n\nDivestiture-\n\nRelated Costs3 Restructuring\n\nCosts (Income)\n\nLoss From\n\nInvestments\n\nin Equity\n\nSecurities Non-\n\nGAAP2 Fourth Quarter 2024 Cost of sales $3,828 $701 $121 $- $3,006 Selling, general and administrative 2,864 29 16 - 2,819 Research and development 4,585 12 (1) - 4,574 Restructuring costs 51 - 51 - - Other (income) expense, net 126 (31) - 152 5 Fourth Quarter 2023 Cost of sales $3,911 $454 $117 $- $3,340 Selling, general and administrative 2,804 24 29 - 2,751 Research and development 9,628 790 - - 8,838 Restructuring costs 255 - 255 - - Other (income) expense, net 78 (35) - (61) 174\n\n$ in millions GAAP Acquisition-\n\nand\n\nDivestiture-\n\nRelated Costs3 Restructuring\n\nCosts (Income)\n\nLoss From\n\nInvestments\n\nin Equity\n\nSecurities Certain Other Items Non-\n\nGAAP2 Year Ended December 31, 2024 Cost of sales $15,193 $2,409 $495 $- $ - $12,289 Selling, general and administrative 10,816 117 83 - - 10,616 Research and development 17,938 72 1 - - 17,865 Restructuring costs 309 - 309 - - - Other (income) expense, net (24) (79) - 45 - 10 Year Ended December 31, 2023 Cost of sales $16,126 $2,018 $211 $- $- $13,897 Selling, general and administrative 10,504 86 122 - - 10,296 Research and development 30,531 819 1 - - 29,711 Restructuring costs 599 - 599 - - - Other (income) expense, net 466 (47) - (279) 573 219\n\nGAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nGross margin was 75.5% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with 73.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9) and foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs) and higher amortization of intangible assets. Gross margin was 76.3% for the full year of 2024 compared with 73.2% for the full year of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9) and foreign exchange, partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets, as well as higher restructuring costs (primarily reflecting asset impairment charges) and higher manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs).\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher promotional and selling costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring costs. Full-year 2024 SG&A expenses were $10.8 billion, an increase of 3% compared with full-year 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative, promotional, selling and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring costs.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 52% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. R&D expenses were $17.9 billion for the full year of 2024, a decrease of 41% compared with the full year of 2023. The declines in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 were primarily due to lower charges for business development activity, lower intangible asset impairment charges, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increased compensation and benefit costs and higher clinical development spending.\n\nOther (income) expense, net, was $126 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $78 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The unfavorability was primarily due to net losses from investments in equity securities compared with net income from investments in equity securities in the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses and lower net interest expense. Other (income) expense, net, was $24 million of income in the full year of 2024 compared with $466 million of expense in the full year of 2023, primarily due to a $572.5 million charge in 2023 related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation. The favorability was also due to $170 million of income related to the expansion of an existing development and commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, as well as lower foreign exchange losses in 2024. Other (income) expense, net, in the full year of 2024 was unfavorably affected by lower net income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense compared with 2023.\n\nThe effective tax rates of 10.2% and 14.1% for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, respectively, include a 6.2 percentage point favorable impact and a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact, respectively, due to a reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits, resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessments related to certain federal tax return years.\n\nGAAP EPS was $1.48 for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with a loss per share of $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by lower charges for business development transactions, operational strength in the business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, and a benefit from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2020 federal tax return year. GAAP EPS was $6.74 for the full year of 2024 compared with EPS of $0.14 for the full year of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by lower charges for business development transactions, operational strength in the business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, a benefit from the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2020 and 2019 federal tax return years, and a charge in the prior year for settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\nNon-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 80.8% for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with 77.2% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin was 80.8% for the full year of 2024 compared with 76.9% for the full year of 2023. The non-GAAP gross margin improvements in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 were primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9) and foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs).\n\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $10.6 billion for the full year of 2024, an increase of 3% compared with the full year of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher promotional and selling costs and, for the full year, higher administrative costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.\n\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 48% compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $17.9 billion for the full year of 2024, a decrease of 40% compared with the full year of 2023. The declines in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 were primarily due to lower charges for business development activity and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increased compensation and benefit costs and higher clinical development spending.\n\nNon-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $5 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $174 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The favorability was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses and lower net interest expense. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $10 million of expense in the full year of 2024 compared with $219 million of expense in the full year of 2023. The favorability was primarily due to $170 million of income related to the expansion of an existing development and commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, as well as lower foreign exchange losses in 2024, partially offset by higher net interest expense.\n\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.2% for the fourth quarter and 16.8% for the full year of 2024.\n\nNon-GAAP EPS was $1.72 for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.65 for the full year of 2024 compared with EPS of $1.51 for the full year of 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by lower charges for business development transactions and operational strength in the business. The unfavorable effect of foreign exchange partially offset the increase in the full year.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is provided in the table that follows.\n\nFourth Quarter Year Ended $ in millions, except EPS amounts 2024 2023 Dec. 31, 2024 Dec. 31, 2023 EPS GAAP EPS $1.48 $(0.48) $6.74 $0.14 Difference 0.24 0.51 0.91 1.37 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2 $1.72 $0.03 $7.65 $1.51 Net Income (Loss) GAAP net income (loss)1 $3,743 $(1,226) $17,117 $365 Difference 629 1,292 2,327 3,472 Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below1,2 $4,372 $66 $19,444 $3,837 Excluded Items: Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs3 $711 $1,233 $2,519 $2,876 Restructuring costs 187 401 888 933 Loss (income) from investments in equity securities 152 (61) 45 (279) Charge for Zetia antitrust litigation settlements - - - 573 Decrease to net income/increase to net loss before taxes 1,050 1,573 3,452 4,103 Estimated income tax (benefit) expense4 (421) (281) (1,125) (631) Decrease to net income/increase to net loss $629 $1,292 $2,327 $3,472\n\nPipeline and Portfolio Highlights\n\nMerck made important advancements in its broad, diverse pipeline, meeting significant regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the fourth quarter.\n\nIn oncology, Merck announced positive topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 MK-3475A-D77 trial evaluating the noninferiority of subcutaneous pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa, in combination with chemotherapy, versus intravenous (IV) KEYTRUDA administered with chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC. Subcutaneous pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa has the potential to improve the patient experience and increase access for patients and health care providers compared to IV administration.\n\nMerck presented new data across multiple hematologic malignancies at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024, including promising Phase 2 data for its investigational antibody-drug conjugate zilovertamab vedotin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. With more than 20 abstracts presented, the data showcased Merck\u2019s continued progress in advancing clinical research for its expanding and diverse hematology pipeline.\n\nMerck also achieved several key regulatory milestones in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. Highlights include the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting Breakthrough Therapy designation to sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT) for the treatment of certain patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Additionally, Merck received new approvals for KEYTRUDA-based regimens in Japan and China, as well as for WELIREG and Lynparza in China.\n\nIn vaccines and infectious diseases, the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for clesrovimab, an investigational prophylactic long-acting monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of June 10, 2025. This regulatory milestone marks important progress toward having clesrovimab available in time for the 2025-26 RSV season. The filing was based on results from the pivotal Phase 2b/3 study of clesrovimab in infants for the prevention of RSV that was presented at ID Week 2024. In addition, Merck announced topline results from two pivotal Phase 3 trials of the investigational, once-daily, oral, two-drug, single-tablet regimen of doravirine/islatravir (DOR/ISL) in adults with virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection, in line with Merck\u2019s commitment to help address the needs of people living with HIV.\n\nIn January 2025, Merck also received expanded approval in China for GARDASIL. It is now the first HPV vaccine approved in China for the prevention of certain HPV-related cancers and diseases in males 9-26 years of age. In addition, the European Union\u2019s (EU) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of CAPVAXIVE for pneumococcal vaccination in adults, with a final decision for EU approval expected in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nIn cardiovascular disease, Merck announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 ZENITH study, evaluating WINREVAIR in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 functional class (FC) III or IV at high risk of mortality. Based on the positive results of an interim analysis, an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. In addition, in January 2025, Merck announced the Phase 3 HYPERION study evaluating WINREVAIR in newly diagnosed adults with PAH with FC II or III at intermediate or high risk of disease progression was also stopped early based on the positive results from the interim analysis of the ZENITH trial and a review of the totality of data from the WINREVAIR clinical program to date. All participants in both the ZENITH and HYPERION studies will be offered the opportunity to receive WINREVAIR as part of the open-label, long-term extension study, SOTERIA.\n\nMerck continued to execute on its business development strategy. The company announced the closing of an exclusive global license for MK-2010, a novel investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody from LaNova. Merck also entered into an exclusive global license agreement with Hansoh to evaluate MK-4082, an investigational preclinical oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonist.\n\nNotable recent news releases on Merck\u2019s pipeline and portfolio are provided in the table that follows.\n\nOncology FDA Granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to sac-TMT for the Treatment of Certain Patients With Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic Nonsquamous NSCLC With EGFR Mutations (Read Announcement) FDA Granted Priority Review to Merck\u2019s Application for WELIREG for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (Read Announcement) Merck Received Positive EU CHMP Opinion for WELIREG as Treatment for Adult Patients With Certain Types of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease-Associated Tumors and for Certain Previously Treated Adult Patients With Advanced RCC, Based on Results From Phase 2 LITESPARK-004 and Phase 3 LITESPARK-005 Trials (Read Announcement) Merck Received Positive EU CHMP Opinion for KEYTRUDA Plus Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Adult Patients With Unresectable Non-Epithelioid Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, Based on Results From Phase 2/3 IND.227/KEYNOTE-483 Trial (Read Announcement) KEYTRUDA Approved in China in Combination With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment, Then Continued as Monotherapy After Surgery as Adjuvant Treatment for Patients With Resectable Stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, Based on Results From Phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 Trial (Read Announcement) WELIREG Approved in China for Treatment of Adult Patients With Certain Types of VHL Disease-Associated Tumors, Based on Results From Phase 2 LITESPARK-004 Trial (Read Announcement) Merck Announced Phase 3 MK-3475A-D77 Trial of Subcutaneous Pembrolizumab With Berahyaluronidase Alfa Met Primary Endpoints (Read Announcement) Merck Announced Phase 3 KEYLYNK-001 Trial Met Primary Endpoint of Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (Read Announcement) Lynparza Demonstrated Clinically Meaningful Prolonged Survival Benefit in Early Breast Cancer, Based on Results From Phase 3 OlympiA Trial (Read Announcement) Investigational Zilovertamab Vedotin in Combination With R-CHP Demonstrated Complete Response Rate of 100% at 1.75 MG/KG Dose in Previously Untreated Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Based on Results From Phase 2 WaveLINE-007 Trial (Read Announcement) Vaccines Merck Announced FDA Acceptance of BLA for Clesrovimab (MK-1654), an Investigational Long-Acting Monoclonal Antibody Designed to Protect Infants From RSV Disease During Their First RSV Season; FDA Set PDUFA Date of June 10, 2025 (Read Announcement) Merck Received Expanded Approval of GARDASIL for Males in China (Read Announcement) Merck Received Positive EU CHMP Opinion for CAPVAXIVE for Pneumococcal Vaccination in Adults (Read Announcement) Merck Presented New Data From GARDASIL 9 Studies Reinforcing Importance of Gender-Neutral HPV Vaccination in Adults Up to Age 45 at International Papillomavirus Conference 2024 (Read Announcement) Cardiovascular Merck Announced Pivotal Phase 3 ZENITH Trial Evaluating WINREVAIR Met Primary Endpoint at Interim Analysis (Read Announcement) Merck Announced Decision to Stop Phase 3 HYPERION Trial Evaluating WINREVAIR Early and Move to Final Analysis (Read Announcement) Infectious Diseases Merck Announced Topline Results From Pivotal Phase 3 Trials Evaluating Investigational, Once-Daily, Oral, Two-Drug, Single-Tablet Regimen of Doravirine/Islatravir (DOR/ISL) for the Treatment of Adults With Virologically Suppressed HIV-1 Infection (Read Announcement)\n\nFull-Year 2025 Financial Outlook\n\nThe following table summarizes the company\u2019s full-year financial outlook.\n\nFull Year 2025 Sales* $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion Non-GAAP Gross margin2 Approximately 82.5% Non-GAAP Operating expenses2** $25.4 billion to $26.4 billion Non-GAAP Other (income) expense, net2 $300 million to $400 million expense Non-GAAP Effective tax rate2 16.0% to 17.0% Non-GAAP EPS2*** $8.88 to $9.03 Share count (assuming dilution) Approximately 2.53 billion *The company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to sales. **Includes $300 million for an anticipated milestone payment to LaNova associated with the technology transfer for MK-2010 expected to be completed in 2025. Outlook does not assume any additional significant potential business development transactions. ***Includes expected one-time charge of approximately $0.09 per share related to the $300 million milestone payment to LaNova upon completion of the technology transfer for MK-2010.\n\nMerck has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, given it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including intangible asset impairment charges, legal settlements, and income and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds, without unreasonable effort. These items are inherently difficult to forecast and could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s future GAAP results.\n\nMerck anticipates full-year 2025 sales to be between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2% at mid-January 2025 exchange rates. This sales range reflects a decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.\n\nMerck\u2019s full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be between 16.0% and 17.0%.\n\nMerck expects full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS to be between $8.88 and $9.03, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $0.35 per share. This range includes an expected one-time charge of $300 million, or approximately $0.09 per share, related to a milestone payment to LaNova, which will be recognized upon completion of the technology transfer for MK-2010. In 2024, non-GAAP EPS of $7.65 was negatively impacted by a net charge of $1.28 per share related to certain asset acquisitions, licensing agreements and collaborations.\n\nConsistent with past practice, the financial outlook does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.\n\nEarnings Conference Call\n\nInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the earnings conference call on Tuesday, Feb. 4, at 9 a.m. ET via this weblink.

            "content": "Shares of Merck slid Tuesday after the drugmaker surprised Wall Street with a lower-than-expected 2025 sales forecast due partly to a pause in shipments of one of its top-selling products to China.\n\nThe drugmaker plans to temporarily pause shipments of its Gardasil vaccine to China at least through the middle of the year. Chairman and CEO Robert Davis told analysts the pause will help pare inventory and support the drugmaker\u2019s commercialization partner in China, which owns the inventory.\n\nHe said market dynamics in China that include a soft economy and weak consumer demand remain challenging. Gardasil sales have slumped there for a few quarters. Davis said they need to see inventory come down \u201cmeaningfully.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last month forecast that China\u2019s economy, the second-largest in the world, would decelerate from 4.8% last year, to 4.6% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. A collapse in the Chinese housing market has undermined consumer confidence.\n\nOverall sales of Gardasil fell 17% to $1.55 billion in the final quarter of last year, mainly due to the lower demand in China.\n\nGardasil vaccine protects against cancer-causing human papilloma virus or HPV infections. The pause announcement comes a month after Merck received approval in China for use of the vaccine in males.\n\n\u201cWe believe China still represents a significant, long-term opportunity for Gardasil, given the large number of females and now males with our recent approval that are not yet immunized,\u201d Davis said.\n\nSeparately, company executives said they expect an immaterial impact to the company from proposed U.S. tariffs on goods made in China, Mexico or Canada. They said the company has low levels of manufacturing in those countries.\n\nFor 2025 Merck expects adjusted earnings to range between $8.88 and $9.03 per share on $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion in sales.\n\nThe data firm FactSet says analysts had been projecting earnings of $9.13 per share on $67.07 billion in sales for the Rahway, New Jersey, company.\n\nFor the recently completed fourth quarter, Merck booked an adjusted profit of $1.72 per share on $15.6 billion in revenue. Sales of top-selling cancer treatment Keytruda climbed 19% to $7.84 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected earnings of $1.61 per share on $15.48 billion in revenue.\n\nShares of Merck & Co. Inc. tumbled 10%, or $10.07, to $89.72 Tuesday while broader indexes climbed.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nMerck & Co. said Tuesday it is pausing shipments to China of its human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil to ease rising inventory at its marketing partner amid an extended slump in demand. As a result, company executives said they are no longer setting a target of $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030.\n\nThe pause will begin this month and continue \u201cthrough at least mid-year,\u201d in order to \u201cfacilitate a more rapid reduction of inventory and help support the financial position of our important and valued partner,\u201d Zhifei Biological Products, CEO Rob Davis said during Merck\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nMerck shares fell by as much as 12% in morning trading as investors reassessed their outlook on the company\u2019s second-biggest product. Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch cautioned against too much pessimism, writing \u201cthis continued uncertainty is likely driving more downside than warranted.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe issues with Gardasil sales in China emerged six months ago when Merck announced the first initial drop in sales. At the time, Merck executives said a number of factors may have led to the declines, including an anti-corruption probe aimed at some non-Chinese companies that have affected the market for medical products.\n\nIn the most recent call, Davis blamed \u201cincreased pressure on discretionary consumer spending,\u201d and that demand for the shot \u201chas not recovered to the level [Merck] had expected.\u201d\n\nFull-year 2024 sales of Gardasil shrank 3% to $8.6 billion, following flat sales through the first six months of the year and double-digit declines in the third and fourth quarters. China is the largest market for Gardasil outside of the U.S., accounting for 60% to 70% of overseas sales.\n\nExecutives, however, remained optimistic about re-establishing growth in China. \u201cChina still represents a significant long-term opportunity for Gardasil given the large number of females, and now males with our recent approval, that are not yet immunized,\u201d Davis said.\n\nGardasil\u2019s issues shadowed an otherwise largely positive quarter for Merck. Its biggest seller, cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, grew 21% over the previous year to $7.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and for the full year recorded sales of $29.5 billion. That helped drive overall sales up 7% for the quarter to $15.6 billion compared to 2023. Full sales for the year also rose 7% to $64.2 billion.\n\nThe main patent for Keytruda is nearing patent expiration in 2028, but Davis expressed optimism that a subcutaneous formulation as well as experimental drugs for cancer and infectious diseases in late pipeline development will help Merck \u201csuccessfully navigate\u201d the loss of exclusivity of a drug that accounts for nearly half of its revenue.",

            "content": "Shares of Merck declined more than 12% to $87.71 as the market opened Tuesday on the news that shipments of the Gardasil vaccine to China will be paused until at least mid-year. The company\u2019s move is the latest in an ongoing battle to restore sales of the HPV vaccine in the region and comes amid heightened anxiety about a trade war between China and the U.S.\n\nMerck reported a 2% decline in Gardasil sales for the full-year 2024 to $8.6 billion, according to a Tuesday morning Q4 and full year earnings report . Merck also today reduced its 2030 sales target of $11 billion for Gardasil. This change \u201cintroducing further doubt into the long-term potential of this franchise,\u201d according to Guggenheim analysts.\n\nIssues with the vaccine arose last summer , when Merck flagged a decline in shipments from its distributor of the vaccine in China.\n\n\u201cAs we close out 2024 and enter 2025, the market dynamics for Gardasil in China have remained challenging,\u201d CEO Rob Davis said on the earnings call. \u201cLike many other companies, we\u2019ve seen increased pressure on discretionary consumer spending, including across the vaccine space more broadly, and demand for Gardasil has not recovered to the level we have expected.\u201d\n\nThis led to elevated inventory levels, the CEO explained, and so, after discussions with the distribution partner Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., Merck has decided to pause shipments of Gardasil to China to allow inventory levels to recover.\n\n\u201cWe believe taking this action now will facilitate a more rapid reduction of inventory and help support the financial position of our important and valued partner,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe CEO would not comment specifically on how much inventory the partner has on hand but said the goal is to accelerate the drawdown. The pause could go on longer than the currently prescribed mid-year estimate.\n\n\u201cWe think if we can put the inventory situation behind us, we can get to a more normal market dynamic, one where with the underlying demand and the fact that we have the male indication coming, it can come back to growth,\u201d Davis said. The vaccine was recently approved in China for males, adding to a label that has seen more than 50 million females receive the shot . Davis said there are still about 100 million or more women eligible for the shot in China.\n\nThe CEO noted that sales outside of China were strong with continued momentum expected in those regions. He also said that Gardasil sales were always expected to plateau in time as the market shifted from adults back to younger children. CFO Caroline Litchfield added that growth in the oncology, animal health and new product launches more than offset the Gardasil headwinds.\n\nSo the challenges with Gardasil do not impact Merck\u2019s overall deal strategy as it looks to shore up its pipeline, Davis said. \u201cWe have always said we do believe we need to do more to continue to augment the pipeline we\u2019ve built, and so we will continue to drive business development.\u201d\n\nThe company is looking for deals up to $15 billion, including companies with commercialized products, Davis said. He added that vaccines are not really a focus right now, as \u201cwe just haven\u2019t seen that many opportunities in the space.\u201d\n\nTrade War Heats Up\n\nThe pause in shipments comes as tensions flared between the U.S. and China over President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs of 10% on imports of Chinese goods. While Trump paused the action on Canada and Mexico on Monday, the fees for China went into effect today. China responded by levying a 15% tax on certain energy products from the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not know the specifics of the trade war, any additional pressure on the U.S./China relationship is not good for the near-term commercial prospects of the product,\u201d BMO said of Gardasil.\n\nSpeaking to potential supply chain disruptions that could occur as a result of the tariffs, Litchfield said Merck has limited operations in China, Mexico and Canada, so the company is expecting \u201ca very immaterial impact\u201d from what was proposed over the weekend. Davis estimated that Gardasil sales in China represent about 1% of Merck\u2019s total revenue.\n\nOverall, Merck outperformed analyst expectations with worldwide sales of $64.2 billion, a 7% increase. The company clocked $15.6 billion for the fourth quarter alone, which was also a 7% increase over the same period a year ago. The company reported earnings per share of $6.74 for the full year.\n\nSales of Keytruda increased 18% to $29.5 billion for the full-year. This blockbuster is scheduled to go off patent TK, but David said he was confident in Merck\u2019s ability to ride out that loss of exclusivity.\n\nIndeed, the focus today was more squarely focused on China. BMO Capital Markets said that the ongoing struggles in that country are likely to impact Merck earnings throughout 2025.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the China situation figured out,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe need to lap this market dynamic and figure out what the actual growth and opportunity is in China.\u201d\n\nMerck now expects 2025 revenue of $64.85 billion and earnings per share of $7.99, which is 3% and 13% below BMO\u2019s consensus.",

The bad news: Its stock was down more than 10% in early trading, largely because of weaker-than-expected 2025 guidance.\n\nMerck reported $64.2 billion in sales for 2024, a 7% increase compared with 2023. That is near Wall Street's consensus of $64 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.65, just above Wall Street's $7.56 estimate.\n\nThe company reported $15.6 billion in global sales for the fourth quarter, a 7% increase from the same quarter in 2023 \u2014 about 1% more than Wall Street's estimates of $15.4 billion.\n\nMerck expects 2025 results to be only slightly higher than 2024, announcing between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion in expected revenue this year. Apparently, that didn't cheer up investors.\n\nAnalysts have had mixed feelings about Merck in recent years, with concerns the company, like other big pharmaceuticals, isn't doing enough to ensure that its pipeline of products remains robust in the face of competition and expiring patents.\n\nJefferies analysts said in a recent note to clients that Merck is \"in the penalty box\" and there has been investor frustration about the lack of clarity on the company's long-term approach. Comparisons to Pfizer (PFE), which also reported Tuesday, put both stocks in the category of \"cheap\" to buy for now but with positive long-term potential.\n\nMerck's two big revenue products are its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, and cancer drug Keytruda. The latter is facing patent expiry in 2028. Gardasil, meanwhile, has had weaker sales in China \u2014 an important market for Merck\u2014 which negatively impacted sales in 2024.\n\nIt is unclear how much Trump's China tariffs will disrupt the market for Merck, which also announced a pause of China shipments until \"at least mid-year\" due to the ongoing softness in demand. But Gardasil was recently approved for men, and the company expects sales to pick up starting next year.\n\nKeytruda brought in $29.5 billion in sales in 2024, an 18% increase compared to 2023, while Gardasil brought in $8.6 billion, a 2% decline compared to 2023.\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

They're intelligent systems combining large language models (LLM), AI models and tools to iteratively plan, execute and optimize tasks\n\nDid you know that LLMs can be leveraged as master multitaskers? These LLM-based multitaskers, often called AI agents, can execute different tasks simultaneously. Having a team of high-performing AI assistants that can each play different roles ultimately helps researchers at Merck Research Labs (MRL) focus on critical drug discovery and development.\n\nIn today\u2019s data-driven world, AI agents are emerging as a powerful tool for researchers and scientists to aid them in navigating the complexities of large data sets, refining hypotheses and executing both repetitive and differentiated tasks efficiently. Done manually, that kind of data gathering and analysis costs time and money.\n\nMerck researchers use AI to augment human ability\n\nA long-standing ambition for AI is to help find major scientific discoveries, learn on its own and acquire knowledge autonomously. This is what some call an \u201cAI scientist.\u201d While this concept is aspirational, advances in agent-based AI can help pave the way for the development of AI agents as conversable systems capable of reflective learning and reasoning that coordinate LLMs, machine learning (ML) tools, or even combinations of them.\n\nRather than taking humans out of the discovery process, AI can augment human ability to break down a problem into manageable subtasks, which can then be addressed by AI agents with specialized functions for targeted problem solving and integration of scientific knowledge. One significant advantage of these collaborative systems is their capacity for automation. Repetitive tasks, such as data cleaning or preliminary analysis, can be handled by AI agents, freeing our scientists to focus on higher level work and strategic decision making.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already deployed AI agents, including in development workflows like medical writing, where agents query and assemble knowledge, and evaluate both human and AI writing.\u201d Matt Studney\n\nVice president, information technology, MRL\n\n\u201cWe see broad applicability of AI agents, for example in orchestrating discovery workflows, where agents can help researchers in generating molecular design ideas and insights, optimize assay workflows and generate biology insights integrated across cells, organisms and human genomics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see agents making the R&D process faster and crucially driving higher quality results. Agents help capitalize on Merck\u2019s long-standing investments in AI/ML by rapidly accelerating the speed of our human researchers at scale.\u201d",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the upcoming market and corporate activity to look forward to this week, which will be dominated by earnings reports from various companies and an important inflation report from the Labor Department.\n\nCramer noted that Friday marked the heavy market focus on the prospect of the White House imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. As expected, the tariffs were announced, 25% from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, and the market, which had already been struggling, dropped further.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks\n\nCramer noted that the Dow plunged by 337 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Nasdaq declined by 0.28%. Adding fuel to the fire, President Trump later commented that he was \"not concerned about the market's reaction.\" Cramer, reflecting on this, wished he could share that same sense of ease. He added:\n\n\u201cFinally, on Friday, we get the Labor Department's non-farm payroll and right now the Fed is concerned that the economy might be running too hot. If we get robust job growth with higher wages, then I doubt we'll see any rate hikes in the first half of the year.\u201d\n\nHe then posed the question: if investors are hoping for a rising stock market, what would they want to see? Cramer explained that a job report that\u2019s just \"so-so\" would be ideal, strong enough to keep rate cuts on the table, but not so strong as to hinder quarterly earnings.\n\n\u201cBottom line: When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands because there's just too much data for any individual to process even for an AI-powered individual. By the way, oh, let's just throw in this DeepSeek stuff, which has made tech too maddening to buy or sell and too, let's say boring. So if in doubt, do nothing.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 31.

These short-term buying signals, along with a neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 50.39, suggest a continuation of the current trend, barring any earnings surprises.\n\nHowever, the story changes when looking at Merck stock\u2019s long-term trend. Its 50-day SMA of $99.64 and 200-day SMA of $114.28 are higher than its stock price, indicating that the stock may face resistance moving forward. Merck\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) of a negative 0.47 suggests bearish momentum in the near term, adding an element of risk.\n\nOn the flip side, analysts are bullish on Merck with a consensus target of $124, representing an implied upside of 20.25%. That positive outlook could be enough to offset the short-term technical pressure, making Merck stock a bit of a mixed bag heading into earnings.\n\nRead Also: RFK Jr. And Big Pharma: Health Secretary Hopeful Answers Pointed Questions On Drugs, Insurance, Trump Exec Orders\n\nPfizer Stock's Bearish Downtrend: Can It Overcome The Struggles?\n\nChart created using Benzinga Pro\n\nIn stark contrast, Pfizer stock is looking much weaker technically. The stock has been firmly entrenched in a bearish trend, with its share price sitting below its five-, 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), signaling ongoing selling pressure. Pfizer stock at $26.30 has eight-day SMA at $26.51 and the 20-day SMA at $26.56, both signals pointing to potential further downside.\n\nPfizer stock's 50-day SMA of $26.15 provides some minor support, but overall, the chart points to more trouble ahead. The MACD indicator of 0.04 shows only a glimmer of bullish potential, while the RSI of 47.61 reinforces the neutral sentiment surrounding the stock. While there's a chance for some short-term recovery, Pfizer's overall trajectory looks weaker than Merck's.\n\nDespite the challenges, Pfizer's analyst consensus price target is $36.74, offering an implied upside of 13.80%. However, with the Pfizer stock trading significantly below its 200-day SMA of $27.87, it's clear Pfizer has a tough road ahead.\n\nMerck Vs. Pfizer: Who Will Win The Earnings Showdown?\n\nWhen it comes to earnings, Merck's solid analyst outlook and bullish short-term signals seem to give it the edge over Pfizer, which is struggling with technical bearishness.\n\nWhile both stocks face risks, Merck's upside potential, supported by a 20% price target boost from analysts, makes it the more promising candidate for investors looking for stability and growth.\n\nPfizer, on the other hand, remains a riskier play, though it does offer some upside potential if it can overcome its technical hurdles.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Merck: Zah108; Pfizer: Vadi Fuoco",

            "content": "\u201cWhich one is which?\u201d my husband asked, peering at the side-by-side maidenhair ferns in 6.5-inch pots I\u2019d left on the dining room table. One had been planted in regular hardware store potting soil, the other in a mixture of potting soil and compost made from the previous month\u2019s kitchen scraps. \u201cThe one on the left,\u201d I said, gesturing to the shorter, yet visibly fuller, fern. It wasn\u2019t hugely larger than the other one, but it did look healthier.\n\nThe size of this victory depends on one\u2019s experience with the compost process\u2014and in-home electric composters\u2014in general. While throwing excess food outside in a pile and letting it decompose naturally is older than \u2026 well \u2026 dirt, countertop solutions designed for kitchens have been growing in popularity the past decade or so. Which is no surprise given that up to 40 percent of food produced in the US is wasted, most often ending up in landfills, where its decomposition results in a significant release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\n\nThe ideal composting situation is generally understood to be a municipal program, which not only keeps waste in its community of origin, but provides local jobs for its collection and processing. However, for those (including myself) who live in areas without municipal compost plans, it's hard not to wonder whether electric kitchen composters are worth the considerable outlay of cost and kitchen real estate, or yet another corporate greenwashing fad.\n\nTurning Up the Heat\n\nI first set out to investigate the world of these appliances by testing the Mill Food Recycler (6/10, WIRED Review), Nest cofounder Matt Rogers\u2019 $999 kitchen bin that grinds and dries kitchen scraps to either be used in your yard or shipped to Washington state in a plastic-lined box. While the resulting food grounds can be spread in the garden with some work, they are simply smaller, shelf-stable versions of whatever you put in the Mill to begin with\u2014there\u2019s no anaerobic decomposition process or cultivation of beneficial bacteria. What if one wanted real, usable compost for their trouble?\n\nBack in 2022, WIRED contributor Richard Baguley reviewed several machines that claim to do just that\u2014including the same version of this Reencle Prime, which was given the piece\u2019s highest rating: an 8/10. I thought the machine was worth revisiting over a longer test period and, as I had attempted with the Mill, using the compost in the course of regular gardening.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Wirecutter did something similar late last year, going so far as to have the compost output of each machine tested. (The Reencle material, for what it\u2019s worth, got the highest marks in the test for carbon dioxide respirometry, which measures the overall biological activity in the soil.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nHowever, for the planting experiment, I chose to plant seeds, which is possible but generally not advised by gardening experts due to compost's not being sterile. For that reason, I chose the only two young-adult plants I could find in late winter at my Southwestern Washington garden center that seemed similar enough in height, health, and appearance\u2014the maidenhair ferns. Using Ferry-Morse\u2019s indoor LED bamboo growhouse ($80), I placed the ferns side by side in their respective potting mixes and waited 30 days.\n\nSecond Chance\n\nBut, back to the Reencle itself, which I've now been using every day for three months. As a kitchen appliance it's remarkably unobtrusive, a 14 x 15 x 22-inch box available in black or white with an AC plug and 6-foot power cord. It arrives with a starter bag of ReencleMicrobe\u2014largely sawdust, activated carbon, and Bacillus bacteria. There are buttons on the top for Power, Dry (for contents that make the mix too wet), Purify (to neutralize smells), and to manually open the lid, though there's also a sensor.",

            "content": "Merck & Co., Inc. is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare company. It was officially founded in 1891 as the US arm of Merck Group, headquartered in Germany. Merck Group was founded in 1668 when Friedrick Jacob Merck purchased a pharmacy in Darmstadt, Germany. The company transformed from a pharmacy into a drug manufacturer in 1827 with the commercialization of morphine and the perfection of the manufacturing process. The company will later gain recognition for isolating and commercializing the manufacture of cocaine as well.\n\nMerck Group sent Theodore Weicker to New York as its representative in 1889 and he quickly began to set up operations. The original investment of $200,000 resulted in a facility in lower Manhattan and the addition of Merck family member George Merck to the project. They began operations in 1891 and were in business as the US branch of Merck Group until 1917 and the onset of World War I.\n\nWorld War I brought about the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the nationalization of Merck Group\u2019s US operations. Those operations were repurchased at a government auction only 2 years later with the help of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, but the split was done. The company retained rights to the Merck name in the US but remained independent. One of many noteworthy achievements in the post-War period is the discovery of streptomycin, which was revolutionary in treating tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1953 the company merged with Sharp& Dohme to form the then 2nd largest US drug manufacturer. The merger brought smallpox vaccines to the portfolio and opened a new avenue of research for the business. Since then, advancements in vaccine technology include treatments for mumps and chickenpox. Other notable advancements include the discovery of statins as a cholesterol inhibitor and work in veterinary medicine.\n\nToday, Merck & Co operates through 2 segments and under 2 different names with a headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ. The company operates as Merck & Co in the US and as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the US and Canada. The 2 segments are Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. Revenue topped $49 billion in 2022 and employed more than 68,000 people. The company has 8 research facilities near major university systems, including 7 in the US and 1 in the UK. As of 2022, the company had 82 pipeline products in Phase 2 trials, 30 in Phase 3 trials and 3 under review.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment researches discover and commercializes human health products in several areas of medicine. These include but are not limited to oncology, acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes. This segment has 6 blockbuster drugs as of late 2022, with each generating more than $1 billion in revenue. The leading treatments are Keytruda for treating cancer-related immune conditions, Gardisil which is a vaccine for HPV and Januvia for treating Type-II diabetes. The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary healthcare products and services. Both segments sell to healthcare facilities and distributors.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.",

Invasive pneumococcal disease can lead to serious consequences including hospitalization, organ damage and even death. We are pleased with the CHMP recommendation and look forward to the European Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nCAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to help protect adults against the serotypes that cause the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases. Based on country-level data from the following four EU countries, the serotypes covered by CAPVAXIVE are responsible for more cases of IPD in adults compared to PCV20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine):\n\nCoverage of Serotypes Responsible for IPD in Select EU Countries Country Age Year Reported CAPVAXIVE PCV20 Germany \u226560 2020 ~84% ~58% France >65 2022 ~85% ~63% Italy >65 2023 ~77% ~64% Spain >65 2020 ~82% ~62%\n\nData were included for select countries based on EU membership, population size and the most recent year reported. These values are based on country-level epidemiologic data and regional variations may exist; these values do not reflect the efficacy of the respective vaccines. There are currently no studies comparing the efficacy of CAPVAXIVE and PCV20.\n\nAmong the clinical data supporting the recommendation are results from the pivotal Phase 3 STRIDE-3 trial (NCT05425732), which evaluated CAPVAXIVE compared to PCV20 in adults 18 years of age and older who had not previously received a pneumococcal vaccine. The recommendation is also supported by results from the Phase 3 STRIDE-4 (NCT05464420), STRIDE-5 (NCT05526716), STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961), STRIDE-7 (NCT05393037) and STRIDE-10 (NCT05569954) trials, evaluating CAPVAXIVE in vaccine-na\u00efve and vaccine-experienced adults.\n\nIf approved in the EU, it would mark the fourth authorization of CAPVAXIVE for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. CAPVAXIVE was first approved in the U.S. in June 2024, in Canada in July 2024, and in Australia in January 2025. In addition, CAPVAXIVE is currently under review in Japan, and other worldwide regulatory filings are underway.",

            "content": "The use of commercial livestock dewormers has paid off in terms of animal health and productivity, but it has also resulted in resistance among parasite populations. (Stock photo., via University of Missouri Extension)\n\nSALEM, Mo. \u2013 The use of commercial livestock dewormers has paid off in terms of animal health and productivity, but it has also resulted in resistance among parasite populations.\n\n\u201cAs dewormers lose effectiveness, producers need to develop a broader strategy for managing internal parasites in their livestock,\u201d said Eric Meusch, University of Missouri Extension livestock specialist.\n\nResistance to deworming products\n\nA recent study funded by Merck Animal Health and led by Eric Bailey of the University of Missouri conducted fecal egg count reduction tests in beef herds across the state, finding resistance to macrocyclic lactone dewormers (avermectin-type dewormers). The benzimidazole class of dewormer (\u201cwhite\u201d dewormer) still showed efficacy above the threshold for effective deworming, which is 90%. The results of the Missouri study are consistent with a larger data set compiled by Merck Animal Health.\n\nThe dewormers losing efficacy are products commonly used in pour-on and injectable forms and have become popular due to cost and ease of administration.\n\n\u201cThe popularity and frequency of use of these products has likely led to resistance,\u201d said Meusch.\n\nUnderstanding the enemy\n\nTo manage parasites, it is important to understand their life cycle, said Meusch. Stomach worms must complete several life-cycle stages both inside the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and on the pasture. The cows can only be infected by consuming grass from infected pastures, and pastures can only be infected by cows carrying adult stomach worms.\n\nWorms that are resistant to a dewormer (less than 90% are killed by the treatment) survive and lay eggs that are deposited in the pasture. Over time, the percentage of resistant larvae increases in the pasture until the animals are infected with worms that can no longer be controlled with the product.\n\nManage the problem strategically\n\nBetter grazing and pasture management can limit the exposure of cows to parasites on pasture, Meusch said. Rotational grazing can allow cows to avoid times when the most larvae are emerging on the grass. Because the larvae remain lower in the grass surface layer to keep from drying out, leaving a higher residual when grazing can help avoid exposure to the larvae as well.\n\nStrategic deworming is another concept that can help avoid exposure to parasite larvae on pasture. This is basically timing deworming treatments to take advantage of when the worms on the pasture are dormant and not reinfecting animals. When temperatures drop to 28 degrees Fahrenheit a few times, typically in the late fall, it can be a good time to deworm because it isn\u2019t likely that cattle will be reinfected from the pasture after that point. This allows them to go through the winter without stomach worms, ensuring they benefit the most from supplemental feeding. It also ensures cattle aren\u2019t depositing more eggs on the pasture over the winter.\n\nThe parasites infecting pastures will become active again in the spring when temperatures regularly exceed 50 degrees. As the eggs emerge into larvae and advance to the third stage, the cows will be infected again. The next strategic time to deworm is about six weeks after the springtime temperatures exceed 50 degrees. At this time, the cows will have been reinfected but are not yet depositing eggs in the pasture. This extends the time that eggs aren\u2019t being deposited and helps reduce the parasite burden on the pasture.\n\nIt isn\u2019t always possible to visually identify which cows are carrying the heaviest worm loads, but culling cows that chronically show symptoms of a heavy parasite infection can also benefit overall herd health.\n\n\u201cBy managing grazing and strategically deworming cattle to avoid further pasture contamination, producers can keep their animals healthy and productive, as well as help ensure the long-term efficacy of deworming products,\u201d said Meusch.\n\nFor more information about deworming strategies or assessing the worm load in your cow herd, contact your local MU Extension center, or email Eric Meusch at [email protected].\n\n\u2013Eric Meusch, University of Missouri Extension",

            "content": "Robinhood has been focusing on organic growth by implementing strategies such as deposit matches and marketing initiatives, as well as investing in both its current operations and new ventures. Additionally, the company has been using mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to accelerate its business expansion.\n\nThough Robinhood experienced significant growth in its customer base during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people stayed home and invested in their government stimulus checks, years later, the platform has continued to attract even more customers, many of whom have become more knowledgeable and now expect advanced tools, which Robinhood has adapted to offer.\n\nAccording to analysts, Robinhood has significant growth potential, particularly if it can encourage customers who have opened accounts to invest larger sums of money on the platform. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley highlighted that while 10% of US adults have a funded account with Robinhood, the company currently controls less than 0.3% of the $65 trillion in retail assets in the US As of June 2024, Robinhood has facilitated over $200 million in asset transfer and retirement account contribution matches for its customers. This initiative helped the company secure over $13 billion in net deposits during the second quarter, with assets under custody reaching a record $140 billion\u2014an increase of 57% from the previous year. Additionally, retirement assets more than doubled, nearing $9 billion.\n\nAs stock prices hit historic lows, younger investors flocked to platforms like Robinhood. Founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood quickly became a fintech favorite. The app, which pioneered commission-free trading, amassed 13 million user accounts and gained significant brand recognition, surpassing legacy brokerages like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, as well as app-first competitors like Webull and Dough.\n\nThe start of 2020 marked a turning point for retail trading, driven by increased market volatility, stay-at-home orders, and commission-free trading across platforms, which led to a surge in activity and a rise in new traders. Many of these new traders, particularly in their 20s and 30s, found the stock market more accessible than ever, as high prices had previously kept them from participating. With sports events canceled, many turned to stock trading as a replacement for sports betting.\n\nWe recently published a list of Top 10 Best Dividend Stocks on Robinhood . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best dividend stocks on Robinhood.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to technological improvements, shifts in asset classes and market structure have also played a role in the emergence of new investment products. One of the most notable innovations in 2024 was the introduction of event contracts, especially those based on elections. In addition, many other brokerages, fintech firms, and financial institutions introduced a wide range of new products that reshaped how retail investors could manage their investments, all while generating profits. The shift began in January when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin (BTCUSD) exchange-traded funds. This decision enabled retail investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure through their brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to open digital wallets for direct crypto purchases.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we performed an extensive analysis of leading financial websites to identify 10 dividend stocks available on Robinhood. Our selection process was based on a consensus approach, where we considered only those stocks that consistently appeared across multiple sources during our research. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked according to hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "Medicaid funding, totaling approximately $900 billion per year and serving around 72 million participants, and the 340B program are key focus areas for potential healthcare reforms.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter, however, warns that federal Medicaid cuts could lead to stricter policies and lower drug coverage.\n\nPer Richter, the 340B program is currently facing increased scrutiny, with proposed reforms that could potentially benefit biopharma companies by limiting eligibility for drug discounts, which would enable \u201ctransfer of profits\u201d from providers back to biopharma.\n\nThis shift could positively impact major biopharma companies with high exposure to 340B drugs, such as Merck & Company, Inc. MRK, Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY.\n\nHowever, the specifics of these reforms are still uncertain, which could cause \u201cvolatility\u201d in the healthcare sector until more details are released.\n\nAt the same time, Medicaid funding and eligibility changes are under consideration as potential cost-saving measures by the new administration.\n\nAlso Read: AbbVie Jumps After Q4 Earnings Beat, Skyrizi And Rinvoq Boom Offsets Humira Decline\n\nThese changes could have negative effects on biopharma companies with significant Medicaid drug exposure, including AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Gilead Sciences, and Eli Lilly and Company LLY, whose top Medicaid drugs make up a large percentage of their US sales.\n\nOverall, for the 340B program, the analyst sees potential policy/legal outcomes that would move dynamics towards a transfer of profits from providers to biopharma companies as a positive for much of the biopharma sector.\n\nMeanwhile, potential Medicaid changes could create \u201cpotential headwinds\u201d for healthcare providers and biopharma companies, though the exact effects remain uncertain.\n\nThe healthcare industry is awaiting further clarity on these proposed policy changes and their implications.\n\nOverall, the analyst notes that exposure to Medicaid and 340B can vary widely by product and indication.\n\nThe top three highest-spend drugs for Medicaid (as of 2022) are AbbVie\u2019s Humira, Gilead\u2019s Biktarvy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Trulicity for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nFor these drugs, Medicaid and 340B spending represented ~15-30% of the drugs' FY22 and FY23 revenue.\n\nFurther, 340B impact may vary for different methods of administration within the same indication \u2013 for example, Gilead\u2019s expects lower 340B exposure for injectables for PrEP than for daily orals \u2013 and expansion of eligibility for 340B discounts may have an outsized impact on certain therapeutics over others.\n\nOverall, 340B reform would serve as a tailwind to biopharma, as the aforementioned initiatives are generally intended to limit access to the statutory discount.\n\nOn the other hand, spending cuts to Medicaid could have a negative impact to volume if they have the effect of reducing coverage, the analyst writes.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "Big Pharma Is Still Alive\n\nThe last few years have seen the healthcare sector change radically thanks to biotech innovation. The most visible part was mRNA vaccines, but the arrival of gene therapies, cheap genome sequencing, or stem cell therapies are all there to usher in a new era of medical marvels (you can follow the links for deeper coverage of these topics).\n\nMost of these innovations have been done by smaller companies, and R&D efforts by the biggest pharmaceutical companies have often been not very successful .\n\nNevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is still dominated by a few giant corporations. Such blue-chip multi-billion dollar companies are not only the historically dominant players but might as well stay on top for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is that? How is it that even radical innovation might not threaten incumbent companies?\n\nThe Big Pharma Business Model\n\nTo understand how \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can stay on top, we can look at the example of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe innovation itself was very much invented by BioNTech, which took an actually quite old scientific concept and turned it into an entire technology platform.\n\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it was the perfect time for such a \u201cprogrammable\u201d vaccine to shine. And it did. But BioNTech did not commercialize it themselves. They partnered with Pfizer to handle approval, production, and commercialization quickly. After all, rival Moderna and countless other companies were pushing for their own COVID-19 vaccine, so time was of the essence.\n\nSimply put, Pfizer brought to BioNTech needed resources in manufacturing, funding, distribution, sales network, clinical trials, handling of regulators, etc\u2026\n\nInnovation vs Acquisitions\n\nAnother way for Big Pharma to stay relevant is simply to buy out successful biotech companies.\n\nBiotechnology is a field littered with failed projects and companies. So when one turns out successful, both founder and investors might want to cash out after 10-15 years of patience, hard work, and a bit of luck.\n\nAnd who could be more qualified than Big Pharma firms, able also to take the innovative drugs and bring them forth to their network of tens of thousands of doctors at once?\n\nThey also have the needed financial firepower. For example, with $512B of market capitalization, Johnson & Johnson, the largest pharmaceutical company in 2021 by revenues , registered a net income of almost $18B and a free cash flow of $17B.\n\nMany biotech firms, astonishingly from a scientific and innovation point of view, often trade below a billion dollars. So, if you look at the yearly free cash flow of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, this is a lot of dry powder for acquisitions.\n\nTop 5 Blue Chip Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nTo qualify as a \u201cblue chip,\u201d we consider only the top 20 companies according to their 2021 revenues .\n\nThe term \u201ctop\u201d is rather subjective, as is here a mix of existing drug portfolio, historical performance, R&D pipeline, and financial position. We will highlight some of the central parts of the business and incoming important innovations instead of going deep into the entire therapeutics portfolio or the company's financial results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $ 1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences.\n\nOncology.\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe company has grown sales by 6% yearly in the last 20 years, with a 13.2% return to shareholders in the last 10 years. The stock is also one of the rare \u201cdividend aristocrats,\u201d having rising dividends every year for 60 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, Johnson & Johnson is a very safe bet on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on long-term holdings and the stock price compounding while also giving a moderate but stable and growing dividend.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nThe Danish company is highly focused on diabetes & metabolic diseases like obesity, together making 88% of the company's revenues.\n\nThe focus on obesity is rather recent, with significant growth in this segment in 2022\n\nThe company is also working on an expanding rare disease portfolio and chronic diseases like kidney or liver pathologies.\n\nThe company is well-placed to benefit from the worldwide rise of chronic metabolic diseases. This should provide very safe revenue streams and continuous growth in the short term.\n\nA key vulnerability for Novo Nordisk in the long term is the possibility of permanently curing diabetes through stem cells, gene editing, or another new therapeutic method. This is something we have discussed previously when covering Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics. This is more likely to happen soon for type-1 diabetes, with type-2, the most common, much more likely to be still treated by reducing symptoms for a longer period of time.\n\nSo Novo Nordisk provides a safe place for conservative investors, but they will want to monitor tightly the development of the diabetes market and the arrival of potential competitors. The entry of Novo Nordisk into new segments like chronic diseases and obesity might be the right option to sustain the company in the long run.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon .\n\nSo far, some of the consequently lost revenues have been compensated by the pandemic-boosted sales of the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nThe company is mostly active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nThe new start product of Merck is Keytruda, a cancer drug (monoclonal antibody), with sales growing 16%-27% over the last 3 years. It is already approved for multiple cancers and has 13 new applications under review in phase 3 of clinical trials.\n\nThe company's revenues and earnings have grown significantly in the last 3 years, especially in 2022.\n\nThis financial success should persist until 2028, when Keytruda loses its patent protection. So, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company can reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nBut Pfizer is not just mRNA vaccines, with a total of 10 products with more than $1B of sales per year.\n\nThe company is targeting new product launches: 4 in 2023 and up to 12 by 2024.\n\nIts' management is keen to insist that the growth story is not Covid-dependent, with plans to bring non-Covid sales from the current average of $50B to $84B by 2030.\n\nThey also insist that the windfall profits from the pandemic will \u201callow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation\u201d\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybean, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nBayer's valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of RounUp to cause cancer.\n\nSince then, the company's valuation has fallen to less than what it paid for acquiring Monsanto. This has been a distraction from its solid performance in the seeds, other pesticides, and healthcare segments.",

The first innovators a century ago have turned into large pharmaceutical companies regularly re-inventing themselves.\n\nThis is because life sciences and medicine have evolved equally fast in the last few generations. In addition, patent protection often expires less than 10-15 years after the commercialization of a new therapy, forcing pharmaceutical companies to invent new products constantly.\n\nThanks to this pressure to constantly innovate, even large companies kept the incentives to stay able to invent regularly life-changing medicine.\n\nIn this article, we will see some of the best healthcare innovators in all arrays of medicine, from cancer treatments to vaccines, rare diseases, neurosciences, or metabolic therapies.\n\nTop 10 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Healthcare Innovation\n\n(These stocks are organized by market capitalization at the time of writing of this article)\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B.

The new therapies are growing very quickly, having more than doubled revenues between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBMS also has more than 50 therapies in the early stage of clinical trials, of which half are in oncology.\n\nWith half of the 2020-2025 revenues expected to come from the new product portfolio, BMS has already achieved remarkable innovations and should strongly increase its operating margins.\n\nThe success is the commercialized new product portfolio is very encouraging, and BMS might be on the verge of a decade of explosive growth driven by its new product portfolio and its strong performance in all of its 4 core segments.\n\nInvestors will want to pay close attention to phase 3 of clinical trials and the continuing new product sales growth.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nNovo Nordisk's innovation has traditionally been razor-focused on diabetes, the core segment for the company. This is still true, with 10 clinical trials ongoing in the field .\n\nHowever, the major innovation of Novo Nordisk is in the obesity market, with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable medicine for weight loss initially used for diabetes.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times. The drug is proving so popular that a TikTok-induced mania even increased the shortage .\n\nThe company is also working on growth hormones and acquiring the connected medical device BIOCORP .\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes.\n\nSo, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed This market in more detail in our article \u201c Top Companies In Obesity Treatments .\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon . The company is currently most active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nAt its core, Merck is a technology company that goes beyond just pharmaceuticals. For example, it has a semiconductor offer (equally useful for many biotech equipment like DNA readers). It also controls Sigma Aldrich, a leading supplier of laboratory and testing materials and consumable s , which is part of the broader life science offering , which relies on 59 manufacturing sites and proposes 300,000 products.\n\nThe company has an ambitious R&D roadmap , with 1 new pharmaceutical launch every 1.5 years. This includes the potential of a new therapeutic method for cancer, relying on targeted DNA disruption.\n\nMerck combines steady cash flow from its industrial capacities (semiconductors and life sciences) with the potential of new blockbuster drugs in cancer and neurology.\n\nWith Merck's flagship drug, Keytruda, losing its patent protection in 2028, these innovations will be needed to keep the company's income growing.\n\nSo, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company has been able to reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nPfizer sees the pandemic windfall profits as leverage to expand with new products and to \u201c allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation . \u201d\n\nAmong these opportunities for the next 2 years are 4 vaccines, of which 3 are mRNA, one treatment for growth hormone deficiency, and two for inflammatory diseases. It also covers 7 new indications for existing drugs and 4 business development deals.\n\nIn the longer term, a lot more potential launches could also work in a large variety of applications. This includes a potential competitor on obesity to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, new vaccines, hemophilia therapies, and cancer treatments.\n\nPfizer is a company that has demonstrated with the pandemic its ability to cash in on innovation and taken a strong lead in the vaccine sector. Combined with its previously well-established lines of business in oncology and inflammatory disease, this should reassure investors of Pfizer's ability to keep bringing new therapies to the market.\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybeans, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nFar from a distraction, the agricultural segment of the company shares many R&D capacities and human resources with the pharmaceutical segment.\n\nHowever, Bayer's stock valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of the pesticide RoundUp to cause cancer.\n\nSo investors will want to assess if the pharmaceutical segment is at a deep discount due to these legal issues or if the risk is too high despite Bayer's other IPs and R&D pipeline quality.\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN +0.04% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoetin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010, among other protein and biological-based therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3 , with a strong predominance of inflammation and oncology for these most advanced clinical trials.\n\nAnother innovation is AMG 133, an obesity treatment that is hoped to be more powerful than the existing therapies. AMG 133\u2019s unique advantage would also be a long half-life, with a dosage every 4 weeks instead of the required weekly treatment of Wegovy .\n\nBecause it is only entering phase 2 of clinical trials and because the company focuses on a wide array of therapies, AMG 133 is less central to the investment thesis for Amgen. Still, a potential 5-20 billion dollar blockbuster drug could seriously boost the company's bottom line. So, with Wegovy showing the market is larger than expected, this is something investors in Amgen will want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe company also has a biosimilar department (the equivalent of generic drugs for biotech treatments), with 5 approved drugs and 3 drugs in the R&D pipeline .\n\nAmgen has historically been one of the most innovative pharmaceutical companies ever made, almost single-handedly creating the biotech sector. Its impressive R&D pipeline shows Amgen is determined to keep that reputation intact, including by venturing into new segments like the obesity market.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD -0.56% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology .\n\nAn emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases. Still, HIV represents by far the bulk of Gilead's current income.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer. Its R&D pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe R&D programs are overwhelmingly dominated by infectious diseases and oncology clinical trials, deepening Gilead's specialization, especially with 13 HIV-related clinical trials.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nThe company behind the Covid mRNA vaccine sold by Pfizer is now using the money made during the pandemic to expand its offer widely.\n\nIt is now developing mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. This makes it a leading company in the field of mRNA vaccines, with only its competitor Moderna ( MRNA ) developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech. You can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies .\u201d\n\nBioNTech is also working on various other therapeutic methods, including cell and gene therapies, antibodies, and chemical drugs.\n\nAs the great winner of true transformation innovation with the arrival of mRNA during the pandemic, BioNTech has a spotless image with investors, even if the current stock price cooled down from the pandemic highs.\n\nThe company's future will depend on expanding mRNA to replace many older vaccines and on mRNA capacity to be used for other applications, of which cancer is the most promising financially.\n\nThe other big winner of the pandemic and the mRNA vaccine technology, Moderna, is doubling down on the vaccine application of mRNA. It has no less than 32 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines, covering 14 pathogens like the RSV, Zika, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus .\n\nDespite the focus on vaccine application, Moderna also has some research programs regarding cancer application, cardiac regeneration, and rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis in partnership with the leader in this sector, Vertex.\n\nThis R&D frenzy is fueled by the revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a tripling of R&D spending in 2023 compared to 2020.\n\nModerna is also looking to use its available cash, $16.4B in Q1 2023, to acquire licenses from smaller biotech or directly acquire these companies. The focus seems to be on technology platforms, which include synthetic genome company OriCiro , metagenomics and AI gene discovery Metagenomi , and macrophage therapies Carisma Therapeutics .\n\nModerna is, for now, a mRNA company with strong prospects in infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases. In the long run, its collaboration with startups working on new biotech technologies could yield out-sized results, similar to how mRNA used to be just a theoretical concept for decades.",

            "content": "On January 30, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Niger has become the first country in the African region to officially eliminate onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, as a public health threat. This remarkable achievement places Niger alongside just four other countries globally\u2014Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico\u2014that have successfully halted the transmission of the parasitic disease. It marks a significant moment in public health, especially for sub-Saharan Africa, where onchocerciasis has long been a major concern. According to WHO, Niger\u2019s success reflects the progress made in controlling and eliminating neglected tropical diseases.\n\nWhat Is Onchocerciasis and How Does It Affect Populations?\n\nOnchocerciasis is caused by a parasitic worm and is transmitted through the bite of infected blackflies. It primarily affects rural communities living near fast-flowing rivers, where these blackflies breed. The disease can lead to severe symptoms such as intense itching, skin rashes, and in severe cases, blindness. Onchocerciasis is the second leading infectious cause of blindness in the world, affecting millions of people in areas where the disease is endemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Its long-term impacts can be devastating, leading to social and economic consequences for affected communities.\n\nHow Did Niger Achieve This Historic Milestone?\n\nNiger\u2019s battle against onchocerciasis dates back to 1976 when it joined the WHO\u2019s Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) in West Africa. This early effort focused on controlling the blackfly population through aerial insecticide spraying. Along with this, Ivermectin, a drug donated by Merck & Co., was distributed to reduce the parasitic burden on affected populations. In 1995, the strategy evolved with the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), shifting to community-directed treatment with Ivermectin. This transition involved engaging local communities in distributing medication, empowering them to actively participate in the fight against the disease. By 2014, surveys showed that the prevalence of the disease had dramatically dropped from approximately 60% to an impressive 0.02%.\n\nWhat Does This Achievement Mean for the Future of Public Health in Africa?\n\nNiger\u2019s success in eliminating onchocerciasis is a beacon of hope for other African nations still grappling with neglected tropical diseases. The elimination of onchocerciasis is not only a significant public health victory but also a testament to the effectiveness of long-term, sustained public health efforts. By showing that it is possible to eliminate such a challenging disease, Niger\u2019s achievement sets a powerful example for other countries in Africa to follow. The global recognition from WHO emphasizes Niger\u2019s leadership in the region and highlights the importance of international cooperation in achieving public health goals.\n\nSummary of the news",

            "content": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.\n\nIf confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.\n\nHow Kennedy made money from lawsuits\n\nKennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nWisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.\n\n\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"\n\nIn a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.\n\nKennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.\n\nKennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.\n\n\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"\n\nFinancial conflict of interest?\n\nKennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"\n\nFor example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.\n\nWisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.\n\nThe firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.\n\nKennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.\n\nDuring the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.\n\nKennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.\n\n\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMAHA trademark pending\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"\n\nKennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"\n\nAs part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nKennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

            "content": "RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the approval of CAPVAXIVE\u2122 (Pneumococcal 21-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. The CHMP\u2019s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission (EC) for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and a final decision is expected by the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\u201cInvasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia remain critical public health challenges worldwide,\u201d said Dr. Paula Annunziato, senior vice president, infectious diseases and vaccines, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cThis positive opinion is yet another testament to the clinical profile of CAPVAXIVE and brings us a step closer to helping protect adults in the EU against pneumococcal disease. Invasive pneumococcal disease can lead to serious consequences including hospitalization, organ damage and even death. We are pleased with the CHMP recommendation and look forward to the European Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nCAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to help protect adults against the serotypes that cause the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases. Based on country-level data from the following four EU countries, the serotypes covered by CAPVAXIVE are responsible for more cases of IPD in adults compared to PCV20 (pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine):\n\nCoverage of Serotypes Responsible for IPD in Select EU Countries Country Age Year Reported CAPVAXIVE PCV20 Germany \u226560 2020 ~84% ~58% France >65 2022 ~85% ~63% Italy >65 2023 ~77% ~64% Spain >65 2020 ~82% ~62%\n\nData were included for select countries based on EU membership, population size and the most recent year reported. These values are based on country-level epidemiologic data and regional variations may exist; these values do not reflect the efficacy of the respective vaccines. There are currently no studies comparing the efficacy of CAPVAXIVE and PCV20.\n\nAmong the clinical data supporting the recommendation are results from the pivotal Phase 3 STRIDE-3 trial (NCT05425732), which evaluated CAPVAXIVE compared to PCV20 in adults 18 years of age and older who had not previously received a pneumococcal vaccine. The recommendation is also supported by results from the Phase 3 STRIDE-4 (NCT05464420), STRIDE-5 (NCT05526716), STRIDE-6 (NCT05420961), STRIDE-7 (NCT05393037) and STRIDE-10 (NCT05569954) trials, evaluating CAPVAXIVE in vaccine-na\u00efve and vaccine-experienced adults.\n\nIf approved in the EU, it would mark the fourth authorization of CAPVAXIVE for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. CAPVAXIVE was first approved in the U.S. in June 2024, in Canada in July 2024, and in Australia in January 2025. In addition, CAPVAXIVE is currently under review in Japan, and other worldwide regulatory filings are underway.\n\nCAPVAXIVE Indication in the U.S.\n\nCAPVAXIVE is indicated in the U.S. for:\n\nActive immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20A, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F and 35B in adults individuals 18 years of age and older;\n\nserotypes 3, 6A, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20A, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F and 35B in adults individuals 18 years of age and older; Active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20A, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F and 35B in individuals 18 years of age and older.\n\nCAPVAXIVE should not be administered to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of CAPVAXIVE or to diphtheria toxoid; see additional Select Safety Information below.\n\nThe indication for the prevention of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20A, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F and 35B is approved under accelerated approval based on immune responses as measured by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nSelected Safety Information for CAPVAXIVE in the U.S.\n\nDo not administer CAPVAXIVE to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of CAPVAXIVE or to diphtheria toxoid.\n\nIndividuals with altered immunocompetence, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a reduced immune response to CAPVAXIVE.\n\nThe most commonly reported (>10%) solicited adverse reactions in individuals 18 through 49 years of age who received CAPVAXIVE were: injection-site pain (73.1%), fatigue (36.0%), headache (27.5%), myalgia (16.4%), injection-site erythema (13.8%), and injection-site swelling (13.3%).\n\nThe most commonly reported (>10%) solicited adverse reactions in individuals 50 years of age and older who received CAPVAXIVE were: injection-site pain (41.2%), fatigue (19.7%), and headache (11.0%).\n\nVaccination with CAPVAXIVE may not protect all vaccine recipients.\n\nAbout CAPVAXIVE\n\nIn the U.S., CAPVAXIVE is Merck\u2019s FDA approved 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults 18 years of age and older. CAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to help address Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes predominantly responsible for adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including eight unique serotypes, 15A, 15C, 16F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31 and 35B compared to other pneumococcal vaccines. CAPVAXIVE is administered as a single dose.\n\nAbout Pneumococcal Disease\n\nPneumococcal disease is an infection caused by a bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are about 100 different types (referred to as serotypes) of pneumococcal bacteria, which can affect adults differently than children. Pneumococcal disease can be invasive or non-invasive. Non-invasive pneumococcal illnesses include pneumonia (when pneumococcal disease is confined to the lungs), whereas invasive pneumococcal illnesses include pneumococcal bacteremia (infection in the bloodstream), bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (pneumonia with bacteremia) and pneumococcal meningitis (infection of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord). Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia, which is the most common clinical presentation of pneumococcal disease in adults.\n\nAbout Merck\n\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck KGaA (OTC:MKGAF) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks.\n\nIn August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected companies based in Europe that have been benefiting from the AI boom. An important investor note by investment bank Morgan Stanley on European AI stocks formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.75%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.28%.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company's shares have seen a decrease of 0.22% over the last month, not keeping up with the Medical sector's gain of 7.83% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Merck in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on February 4, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Merck to post earnings of $1.69 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5533.33%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $15.56 billion, showing a 6.35% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Merck. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

            "content": "RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced today the Phase 3 HYPERION study evaluating WINREVAIR (sotatercept-csrk) versus placebo (both in combination with background therapy) in recently diagnosed adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO* Group 1) functional class (FC) II or III at intermediate or high risk of disease progression will be stopped early. The decision to stop the HYPERION study prior to its scheduled completion was based on the positive results from the interim analysis of the ZENITH trial and a review of the totality of data from the WINREVAIR clinical program to date. The program\u2019s external steering committee and Merck made this decision in light of these data, which will enable all study participants to have the opportunity to access WINREVAIR. Merck discussed this decision to stop the HYPERION study early with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has informed HYPERION study investigators.\n\n\" After closely reviewing the robust efficacy data across a broad spectrum of patients evaluated in the WINREVAIR clinical development program, the steering committee has unanimously concluded that the HYPERION study, evaluating WINREVAIR versus placebo on top of background therapy, has lost clinical equipoise and should be stopped early,\u201d said Dr. Vallerie McLaughlin**, Kim A Eagle MD Endowed Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and Director, Pulmonary Hypertension Program, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201c PAH is a progressive and debilitating disease with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality, and we look forward to continuing to evaluate these patients and any potential impact to the treatment landscape as a result of these data.\u201d\n\n\u201c Based on the strong, positive interim efficacy data from the ZENITH trial, as well as the totality of available WINREVAIR data, we concluded that it would not be ethical to continue the HYPERION study,\u201d said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201c We are grateful to the dedicated community of patients who participated in these studies and are pleased to offer the option of receiving WINREVAIR through the Phase 3 SOTERIA open-label extension study.\u201d\n\nFindings from the HYPERION study will be available later this year and presented at a future medical congress.\n\nWINREVAIR is currently approved in the U.S. and 38 countries based on the results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial.\n\n*World Health Organization\n\n**Dr. McLaughlin is a member of the adult sotatercept steering committee, an investigator in the ZENITH and HYPERION trials and a paid consultant to Merck.\n\nAbout HYPERION\n\nThe HYPERION study (NCT04811092) is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate WINREVAIR when added to background PAH therapy in newly diagnosed intermediate or high-risk PAH patients. Participants enrolled in the study had a diagnosis within 12 months of study screening of symptomatic PAH (WHO Group 1, classified as FC II or III) and presentation of idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), drug- or toxin-induced PAH, post shunt correction PAH, or PAH presenting at least one year following the correction of congenital heart defects.\n\nThe study enrolled approximately 300 study participants, who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either WINREVAIR plus background PAH therapy or placebo plus background PAH therapy. The primary composite outcome measure is time to clinical worsening (TTCW) as measured by first confirmed morbidity or mortality event. Clinical worsening events are defined as all-cause death, non-planned PAH worsening-related hospitalization of \u2265 24 hours, atrial septostomy, lung transplantation, and deterioration in six-minute walk test from baseline combined with at least one of the following changes including worsening of WHO FC from baseline, signs/symptoms of increased right heart failure, addition of a background PAH therapy or change in the background PAH therapy delivery route to parenteral.\n\nSecondary outcome measures include improvement of six-minute walk distance (6MWD), improvement and maintenance or achievement of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and improvement in WHO FC or maintenance of WHO FC II as well as additional measures. Participants in the HYPERION trial will have the opportunity to receive WINREVAIR as part of the open-label, long-term extension study, SOTERIA (NCT04796337), consistent with that study\u2019s eligibility criteria.\n\nAbout ZENITH\n\nThe ZENITH study (NCT04896008) is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate WINREVAIR when added to maximum tolerated background PAH therapy on time to first event of all-cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH worsening related hospitalization of \u226524 hours, in participants with WHO FC III or IV PAH at high risk of mortality. ZENITH study inclusion criteria required Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) Lite 2.0 risk score of \u22659.\n\nThe study enrolled 172 participants, who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either WINREVAIR plus background PAH therapy or placebo plus background PAH therapy. The primary composite outcome measure is time to first confirmed morbidity or mortality event. Events are defined as all-cause death, lung transplantation, or PAH worsening-related hospitalization of \u226524 hours. Secondary outcome measures include overall survival, transplant-free survival and several additional measures. Participants who have completed the ZENITH trial have the opportunity to receive sotatercept as part of the open-label, long-term extension study, SOTERIA (NCT04796337), consistent with that study\u2019s eligibility criteria.\n\nAbout STELLAR\n\nSTELLAR (NCT04576988) is a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of WINREVAIR compared to placebo, as an add-on to background therapy for the treatment of adults with PAH (WHO Group 1). The primary endpoint was exercise capacity, as measured by 6MWD 24 weeks following initiation of treatment. Nine secondary outcome measures were assessed: proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement (consisting of improvement in 6MWD, improvement in NT-proBNP level, and either improvement in WHO FC or maintenance of WHO FC II); change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR); change from baseline in NT-proBNP levels; proportion of participants who improved in WHO FC; time to death or the first occurrence of a TTCW event; proportion of participants who maintained or achieved a low risk score using the simplified French Risk score calculator; change from baseline in the Physical Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT\u00ae; change from baseline in the Cardiopulmonary Symptoms domain score of PAH-SYMPACT; and change from baseline in the Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT.\n\nAbout SOTERIA\n\nSOTERIA (NCT04796337) is an ongoing open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of WINREVAIR when added to background therapy for the treatment of PAH in patients who have completed previous WINREVAIR studies without early discontinuation. The primary objective of SOTERIA is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability. The secondary objective is to assess the continued efficacy of WINREVAIR, as measured by 6MWD, NT-proBNP, WHO FC, pulmonary vascular resistance, overall survival, and simplified French risk score. Results from the SOTERIA study were presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in 2023.\n\nAbout WINREVAIR\u2122 (sotatercept-csrk) for injection, for subcutaneous use, 45 mg, 60 mg\n\nWINREVAIR is FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group 1) to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class (FC) and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. WINREVAIR is the first activin signaling inhibitor therapy approved to treat PAH. WINREVAIR improves the balance between pro-proliferative and anti-proliferative signaling to modulate vascular proliferation. In preclinical models, WINREVAIR induced cellular changes that were associated with thinner vessel walls, partial reversal of right ventricular remodeling, and improved hemodynamics.\n\nWINREVAIR is the subject of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nSelected Safety Information for WINREVAIR in the U.S.\n\nWINREVAIR may increase hemoglobin (Hgb). Severe erythrocytosis may increase the risk of thromboembolic events or hyperviscosity syndrome. Monitor Hgb before each dose for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter, to determine if dose adjustments are required.\n\nWINREVAIR may decrease platelet count. Severe thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding. Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in patients also receiving prostacyclin infusion. Do not initiate treatment if platelet count is <50,000/mm3. Monitor platelets before each dose for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter to determine whether dose adjustments are required.\n\nIn clinical studies, serious bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal, intracranial hemorrhage) was reported in 4% of patients taking WINREVAIR and 1% of patients taking placebo. Patients with serious bleeding were more likely to be on prostacyclin background therapy and/or antithrombotic agents, or have low platelet counts. Advise patients about signs and symptoms of blood loss. Do not administer WINREVAIR if the patient is experiencing serious bleeding.\n\nWINREVAIR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with WINREVAIR and for at least 4 months after the final dose. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential before starting WINREVAIR treatment.\n\nBased on findings in animals, WINREVAIR may impair female and male fertility. Advise patients on the potential effects on fertility.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in the phase 3 clinical trial (\u226510% for WINREVAIR and at least 5% more than placebo) were headache (24.5% vs 17.5%), epistaxis (22.1% vs 1.9%), rash (20.2% vs 8.1%), telangiectasia (16.6% vs 4.4%), diarrhea (15.3% vs 10.0%), dizziness (14.7% vs 6.2%), and erythema (13.5% vs 3.1%).\n\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with WINREVAIR, and for 4 months after the final dose.\n\nAbout PAH\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive and life-threatening blood vessel disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries and elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Approximately 40,000 people in the U.S. are living with PAH. The disease progresses rapidly for many patients. PAH results in significant strain on the heart, leading to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. The five-year mortality rate for patients with PAH is approximately 43%.\n\nAbout Merck\n\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMerck is expected to post earnings of $1.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5,533.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 points to a change of +406% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.23 indicates a change of +20.8% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.",

How does the platform differentiate itself from existing traceability and quality assurance solutions?\n\nThe M-Trust platform is a first-to-market, secure cyber-physical trust platform that enables organisations to improve product quality and authenticity across their value chains by immutably linking the physical and digital worlds.\n\nThe M-Trust Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a uniquely comprehensive approach to cyber-physical trust. Our portfolio includes software that can be easily integrated into existing workflows and processes, crypto anchors adaptable to different security needs, and corresponding hardware.\n\nAs processes become increasingly digitalised and executed entirely by machines, it is crucial to ensure reliable and secure object identification. We differentiate our solution through our extensive portfolio of over 150 patents, with 14 additional patents pending, which allow us to secure the connection between the physical and digital worlds, ensuring trust and authenticity.\n\nFor instance, to identify objects in the physical world, we utilise our \u201cCrypto-Chemicals and Crypto-Objects\u201d patents, which enable machines to create secure identities based on the characteristics of those objects. This can be achieved through secure pigments, physical unclonable functions (PUFs), or even machine learning for image recognition.\n\nTo ensure a secure connection in the digital world, we employ the \u201cHash-Entropy-Enhancement\u201d patent. This invention allows us to generate reproducible, collision-resistant hashes from the fingerprint of an anchor. To enhance robustness, ease of use, and security, key features of the physical object\u2014such as ambient information like temperature, pressure, time, and location\u2014can now be integrated into the hash input transferred to a digital twin.\n\nOur patented anchoring technology securely binds a physical object to its digital twin. This process ensures that both representations of the object\u2014the physical and the digital\u2014remain in sync and are tamper-proof. M-Trust utilises collision-resistant hash functions to derive the digital twin from the unique physical characteristics of the object.\n\n2. Can you elaborate on the role of Web 3.0 technologies in enabling the functionality of the platform?\n\nThe M-Trust technology creates a framework for machine-to-machine trust in quality control. Machines can use the platform to communicate and verify information about product quality, streamlining operations and minimising human error.\n\nThe platform is powered by Web 3.0 technology, which can be used to foster trust across supply chains by ensuring all parties have access the same, verifiable information.\n\nThe platform uses various crypto anchor technologies to link physical products to their digital identities. These anchors provide authentication and verification of products throughout the supply chain. This approach, which combines software and hardware elements, helps prevent counterfeiting and ensures the correct product is linked with the appropriate data.\n\nThe platform also enables customers to integrate product authenticity into their systems which can comprise of \u2018smart contracts\u2019, used to verify data authenticity and automate agreements within the value chain.\n\nWhilst Web 3.0 technology has yet to realise its full potential, it is still considered by many to be the future of the internet. Our M-Trust technology is future-ready, for future-focused companies. As Web 3.0 technology advances, the M-Trust portfolio will be essential for enabling machines to match human capabilities in managing and controlling quality and enabling the creation of data-driven business opportunities. We envisage that our platform will act as a crucial building block for organisations to build tomorrow\u2019s disruptive new business models, such as Pay-Per-Part or Pay-Per-Performance.\n\n3. How scalable is M-Trust for small to mid-sized businesses compared to larger enterprises?\n\nThe M-Trust portfolio is designed as a modular platform, allowing businesses of all different sizes and complexities to tailor to their specific needs. The comprehensive suite of software and hardware makes it easy for SME businesses to select the elements of the product portfolio that fit their business requirements \u2013 from use of the product Console alone, to the creation of digital twins for enhanced for enhanced product security.\n\n4. What training or support will Merck provide to help organisations transition to this platform?\n\nThe M-Trust portfolio includes a developer kit featuring software developer kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for easy integration into existing workflows. We also have a dedicated developer site where users can learn the fundamentals of cyber\u2011physical trust. The site also offers comprehensive technical documentation, such as quick start guides and tutorials designed to assist in harnessing the full potential of our patented technologies for creating and accessing cyber physically trusted digital twins. We also offer intuitive guidance within the Console\u2019s user interface.\n\nA representative from our team will also assist users with any questions they may have, at any time, ensuring a smooth implementation process.\n\n5. How does M-Trust address evolving regulatory requirements?\n\nThe M-Trust platform is designed to adapt to evolving technologies and regulatory requirements, such as the EU Digital Product Passport. Our technology not only meets current compliance standards but also empowers businesses to thrive in a rapidly changing landscape, ensuring they remain competitive and trustworthy in the eyes of consumers and regulators alike.\n\n6. How will Merck handle feedback from beta users to refine the platform before general availability?\n\nWe are launching the M-Trust platform in beta to offer users an exclusive early invite to be part of our exciting new product\u2019s journey. Customer feedback received in this phase will be used to help shape the product offering now and for the future.\n\n7. What is the timeline for transitioning from beta to full market release?\n\nUpdates on the general availability of the M-Trust platform will be provided in due course. Right now, we\u2019re focused on gathering customer feedback in the beta phase to further shape our offering.\n\n8. What does Merck hope to achieve with this launch in terms of advancing the industry as a whole?\n\nAt Merck, we have spent many years developing the M-Trust technology because we see the critical role that cyber-physical security can play in serving highly regulated industries.\n\nManufacturers now face unprecedented challenges. Increasingly unpredictable supply chains, counterfeit threats, and product quality issues all pose significant threats, particularly in highly regulated industries.\n\nAs quality control expectations grow and regulations become more stringent, companies must remain in step. Now is the time to move away from traditional manual processes to more reliable digital frameworks; cyber-physical trust enables this digitalisation.\n\nBy integrating physical and digital security, our M-Trust technology can provide users with the trust necessary to manage access to reliable data at each stage of their value chains.\n\nWe are extremely proud to be launching this first-of-its kind cyber-physical platform and, in doing so, providing a new solution to help businesses address the growing issues of product safety, traceability and counterfeiting.",

            "content": "In contrast, large-cap stocks, particularly those in the S&P 500 have a strong operating leverage. Wagner noted that the S&P 500 is projected to see earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% in the following year, driven by revenue growth of only 5%. This operating leverage, he argued, was a unique characteristic of large-cap stocks and provided a compelling reason to favor them over small-caps. He explained that operating leverage amplifies the impact of revenue growth on earnings, which can lead to more significant returns for investors.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance on December 21, David Wagner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, provided a detailed analysis of the current market dynamics and his investment strategy. One of the key points Wagner made was his preference for large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks. This stance was particularly noteworthy given his extensive experience in small-cap investing and running a small-cap strategy for over a decade. Wagner explained that while small caps were not all equal, many passive small-cap investments include a significant portion of unprofitable companies. He cited data showing that passive small-cap investors often had 40% of their assets invested in companies that lacked profitability, which could be a significant risk in a volatile market.\n\nThe term \u201cblue chip\u201d originated from poker, where blue chips were the highest denomination of chips used in the game. In the early 20th century, the term was adopted by financial analysts to describe the stocks of large, well-established companies with a proven track record of success. These companies were considered to be the best of the best. Today, blue chip stocks are typically defined as the stocks of large, well-established companies that have a large market capitalization. These companies are usually industry leaders, with a strong brand, a diverse product or service offering, and a history of consistent profitability. Blue chip stocks offer a relatively low level of risk, particularly when compared to smaller, more volatile stocks. This makes them an attractive option for conservative investors, who are looking to preserve their capital and generate steady returns.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK ) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy under $100.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWagner also highlighted the evolving nature of the S&P 500. He noted that large-cap stocks were increasingly benefiting from operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which were not as prevalent in small-cap or international markets. Small-cap stocks, he observed, were more service-oriented and often lacked the robust profit margins and revenue diversification seen in large-cap companies.\n\nWagner further emphasized that while operating leverage could work both ways, potentially leading to more pronounced negative returns in a downturn, it was currently working in favor of large-cap stocks. He forecasted that the market would see more \u201ctailed\u201d returns, meaning that the best-performing large-cap stocks would outperform more significantly, while the worst-performing ones would underperform more severely. This dynamic, he argued, made large-cap stocks an attractive investment option.\n\nBlue chip stocks continue to be a cornerstone of a well-diversified investment portfolio, offering stability, steady growth, and resilience in uncertain economic conditions. Therefore, the case for investing in these stocks remains compelling.\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) Among the Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Under $100?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best blue chip stocks to buy under $100, we used blue chip ETFs plus online rankings to compile a list of 25 companies. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holdings: 86\n\nStock Price as of January 24: $95.55\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a leading global pharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing, and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines to improve human and animal health. The company is known for its medical advancements and its capability to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing health challenges.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is advancing the development of enlicitide, an oral PCSK9 inhibitor positioned as the most potent oral LDL-lowering medicine. This drug is designed to offer a cost-effective oral solution, enlicitide targets the significant unmet need for LDL-lowering therapies. In the obesity market, the company is focusing on specific at-risk subpopulations, including those with MASH who require substantial weight loss. Additionally, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is developing efinopegdutide, an oral GLP-1 therapy currently in Phase II trials. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to address critical unmet needs with innovative and cost-effective patient solutions.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has significantly expanded its late-stage development pipeline, increasing the number of assets from 9 in 2021 to 26 in 2024. This growth focuses on oncology, cardiometabolic diseases, immunology, vaccines, and ophthalmology. The company has also invested heavily in business development, allocating nearly $40 billion over the past 3.5 years to acquire new assets. A notable example is the acquisition of EyeBio, which introduces a new mechanism of action for treating wet AMD and diabetic macular edema, which addresses a critical area of unmet need.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 4th on our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "However, major technological challenges remain \u2013 and the Electronics business sector of Merck could also play an important role in overcoming them.\n\nOn September 25, Mark Zuckerberg presented a new prototype of his Orion AR glasses at the annual Meta Connect conference for developers. Wearing such AR glasses can entirely change your life, including how you look into the refrigerator. In addition to food stored in the fridge you might see recipes you can make with these ingredients. And you could be shown information about possible intolerances to the ingredients of some foods or their minimum shelf life.\n\nLightweight AR glasses are the key to the metaverse\n\nWith Orion, Meta is demonstrating the technological possibilities of AR and setting the direction for itself, suppliers and, last but not least, the providers of AR content. Zuckerberg calls AR glasses such as Orion the \u201choly grail\u201d on the journey to a life fully assisted by AI. Rather than a completely digital virtual world as we see with e.g. the Apple Vision Pro, the focus here is on a real world constantly augmented with displayed apps, images, or videos \u2013 similar to a head-up display on the windshield of an automobile.\n\nHigh-tech glasses could one day replace smartphones\n\nOrion shows where the multi-billion-dollar journey will take Meta (formerly Facebook) like no other product. Orion squeezes cutting-edge technology into a tiny space and is one of today\u2019s most sophisticated technological projects. Most importantly, the Orion glasses show what is possible and what still needs to be improved. Some digital corporations believe that such glasses will one day replace the smartphone, giving these already omnipresent firms an even more direct, personalized and comprehensive role in our lives. As well as accompanying us wherever we go, the glasses would see everything that we see, allowing them to interact with their wearers in a more intuitive manner.\n\nVirtual and mixed reality glasses could transform our way of life\n\nMany companies are looking at creating a new generation of glasses. To date, virtual or mixed reality glasses have mainly been popular among gamers and cinema lovers or used as virtual tour guides. Due to their size, their weight and not least their high price they were not yet suitable for a broader target group. However, we think this will change and see it as a transformational technology for the future.\n\nInnovations from Electronics support further development\n\nAt Merck, we love complex technological challenges. In the past, our innovations have driven the success of new technologies such as semiconductor materials or in light management. We also see ourselves in a promising role for the development of AR glasses, both today and in the future. These glasses symbolize the major technological challenges of our time. As I have repeatedly written in this blog on topics including artificial intelligence, Merck Electronics delivers important building blocks for overcoming these challenges.\n\nBenefits of combining optics and electronics\n\nAR glasses are just one example of the synergies we see at Merck from bringing together our competencies in optics and electronics. The technological sophistication of AR glasses demands new optoelectronic materials and processes. I would like to go into more detail here and take a closer look at the technology behind the holographic display in the glasses. To ensure light weight and high energy efficiency Meta relies for its Orion on lenses with integrated waveguides made of transparent silicon carbide in the highest optical quality. We already know the high-tech material from fields including semiconductor manufacturing: It is one of the hardest ceramic materials, very light and offers good electrical conductivity.\n\nTransparent silicon carbide creates easily visible and energy-efficient images\n\nIn contrast to other types of optical glass, silicon carbide has a very high refractive index and relatively low density. When used in glasses, this enables an expanded 70-degree field of vision, which AR glasses require for communicating with multiple people or when several apps are simultaneously active in the display. A three-dimensional nanoscale structure is etched onto the silicon carbide of the lenses, transforming the light projected into the lens into a holographic image for the viewer. Thanks to the properties of silicon carbide, the display is easily visible in various ambient light conditions and blends with the real world in a way that is very pleasant for the user. Moreover, as mentioned previously, silicon carbide excels thanks to its light weight and very good energy efficiency.\n\nMore innovations needed for wider adoption\n\nWhen revealing its Vision Pro, Apple announced that it was primarily a product for early adopters. The glasses are capable of both augmented and virtual reality, but in my view the high price and lack of wearer comfort will stand in the way of major success. Similarly, for the Orion glasses I believe the cost of transparent silicon carbide is a drawback. In addition, all efforts to further reduce the overall weight will support the wearing comfort to use it all day. That\u2019s why, we at Merck believe that the further development of processes and materials for handling alternative substances which offer comparable properties at lower prices will be a key field of research \u2013 so that as many people as possible will be able to take an \u201caugmented\u201d look in the fridge.",

            "content": "With its stock down 7.0% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Merck (NYSE:MRK). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Merck's ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Merck\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:\n\n27% = US$12b \u00f7 US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.27 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMerck's Earnings Growth And 27% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Merck has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Yet, Merck has posted measly growth of 2.1% over the past five years. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or or poor allocation of capital.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Merck's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 1.2%.\n\nNYSE:MRK Past Earnings Growth January 29th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Merck fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.",

            "content": "Merck (NYSE:MRK) has had a rough three months with its share price down 5.6%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:\n\n27% = US$12b \u00f7 US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.27 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMerck's Earnings Growth And 27% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Merck has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Despite this, Merck's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 2.1%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or or poor allocation of capital.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Merck's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 1.2% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Merck fairly valued compared to other companies? These might help you decide.\n\nIs Merck Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nThe high three-year median payout ratio of 55% (that is, the company retains only 45% of its income) over the past three years for Merck suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.\n\nAdditionally, Merck has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 33% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Merck's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 35%, over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Merck's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Morningstar highlighted that the results of the US election supported the broader momentum in November. However, in December, the markets were shocked when the US Fed reduced projections for more cuts.

The normalized inflation, together with potentially lower interest rates, can support asset prices. The investment firm sees a favorable market backdrop in 2025. Notably, firm economic conditions, near-normal inflation, broadening of profit growth, healthy secular themes throughout technology, and growth-focused fiscal policies are expected to fuel the equity markets momentum, albeit with some volatility throughout the year.\n\nAmeriprise Financial expects that S&P 500 profits will grow by between 10.0% \u2013 15.0% as compared to 2024 levels, courtesy of continued strength in the broader technology space and companies/industries getting support from healthy economic activity and easier YoY comparisons. Furthermore, all 11 S&P 500 sectors are expected to see positive EPS growth in 2025.

The sNDA is based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) data from the Phase 2 LITESPARK-015 trial, which will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of May 26, 2025.\n\n\u201c Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors that form in and around the adrenal glands, and currently, there are no approved therapies available in the U.S. for patients with this rare disease,\u201d said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201c Today\u2019s U.S. filing acceptance demonstrates our commitment to advancing novel therapies, such as WELIREG, to help treat patients with certain rare oncologic diseases. We look forward to working with the FDA to potentially provide this critical option to these patients who urgently need new innovative therapies.\u201d\n\nWELIREG is the first and only HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitor therapy approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) not requiring immediate surgery, based on results from the Phase 2 LITESPARK-004 trial. WELIREG is also approved for certain adult patients with VHL disease-associated tumors in China and 16 additional countries around the world.\n\nWELIREG is also approved in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC following a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI), based on results from the Phase 3 LITESPARK-005 trial.\n\nMerck is investigating WELIREG in rare oncologic diseases, RCC and other tumor types through a broad clinical development program, including in Phase 2 and 3 trials evaluating WELIREG as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines.\n\nAbout LITESPARK-015\n\nLITESPARK-015 is an open-label, single-arm, multi-cohort Phase 2 trial (NCT04924075) evaluating the efficacy and safety of WELIREG monotherapy in patients with advanced PPGL (Cohort A1), pNETs (Cohort A2), VHL disease-associated tumors (Cohort B1), advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Cohort C), or advanced solid tumors with HIF-2\u03b1-related genetic alterations (Cohort D). The primary endpoint is ORR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints include DOR, time to response, disease control, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 322 patients who received WELIREG 120 mg orally once daily.\n\nAbout pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma\n\nPheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are rare adrenal tumors that can be caused by certain genetic syndromes or mutations. It is estimated that up to 2,000 new cases of PPGL are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and up to 52,800 new cases are diagnosed each year worldwide. Pheochromocytoma occur in the center of the adrenal gland, whereas paraganglioma occur in nerve tissue in the adrenal glands and near certain blood vessels and nerves. Up to 25% of PPGL cases are metastatic at diagnosis.\n\nAbout WELIREG\u00ae (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral use\n\nIndications in the U.S.\n\nCertain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors\n\nWELIREG (belzutifan) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.\n\nAdvanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)\n\nWELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI).\n\nSelected Safety Information for WELIREG\n\nWarning: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nExposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of WELIREG. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective non-hormonal contraception as WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective.\n\nAnemia\n\nWELIREG can cause severe anemia that can require blood transfusion. Monitor for anemia before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. Transfuse patients as clinically indicated. For patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL, withhold WELIREG until \u22658 g/dL, then resume at the same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue WELIREG, depending on the severity of anemia. For life-threatening anemia or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until hemoglobin \u22658 g/dL, then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue WELIREG.\n\nIn LITESPARK-004 (N=61), decreased hemoglobin occurred in 93% of patients with VHL disease and 7% had Grade 3 events. Median time to onset of anemia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 8.4 months).\n\nThe safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia in patients with VHL disease treated with WELIREG has not been established.\n\nIn LITESPARK-005 (n=372), decreased hemoglobin occurred in 88% of patients with advanced RCC and 29% had Grade 3 events. Median time to onset of anemia was 29 days (range: 1 day to 16.6 months). Of the patients with anemia, 22% received transfusions only, 20% received ESAs only, and 12% received both transfusion and ESAs.\n\nHypoxia\n\nWELIREG can cause severe hypoxia that may require discontinuation, supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization.\n\nMonitor oxygen saturation before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For decreased oxygen saturation with exercise (e.g., pulse oximeter <88% or PaO2 \u226455 mm Hg), consider withholding WELIREG until pulse oximetry with exercise is greater than 88%, then resume at the same or a reduced dose. For decreased oxygen saturation at rest (e.g., pulse oximeter <88% or PaO2 \u226455 mm Hg) or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until resolved and resume at a reduced dose or discontinue. For life-threatening or recurrent symptomatic hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of hypoxia immediately to a healthcare provider.\n\nIn LITESPARK-004, hypoxia occurred in 1.6% of patients.\n\nIn LITESPARK-005, hypoxia occurred in 15% of patients and 10% had Grade 3 events. Of the patients with hypoxia, 69% were treated with oxygen therapy. Median time to onset of hypoxia was 30.5 days (range: 1 day to 21.1 months).\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nBased on findings in animals, WELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\n\nAdvise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nIn LITESPARK-004, serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients, including anemia, hypoxia, anaphylaxis reaction, retinal detachment, and central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient each).\n\nWELIREG was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients for dizziness and opioid overdose (1.6% each).\n\nDosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Those which required dosage interruption in >2% of patients were fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and influenza-like illness.\n\nDose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse reaction which required dose reduction was fatigue (7%).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226525%), including laboratory abnormalities, that occurred in patients who received WELIREG were decreased hemoglobin (93%), fatigue (64%), increased creatinine (64%), headache (39%), dizziness (38%), increased glucose (34%), and nausea (31%).\n\nIn LITESPARK-005, serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were hypoxia (7%), anemia (5%), pneumonia (3.5%), hemorrhage (3%), and pleural effusion (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients who received WELIREG, including sepsis (0.5%) and hemorrhage (0.5%).\n\nWELIREG was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 6% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation (\u22650.5%) were hypoxia (1.1%) and hemorrhage (0.5%).\n\nDosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Of the patients who received WELIREG, 28% were 65 to 74 years, and 10% were 75 years and over. Dose interruptions occurred in 48% of patients \u226565 years of age and in 34% of younger patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22652% of patients were anemia (8%), hypoxia (5%), COVID-19 (4.3%), fatigue (3.2%), and hemorrhage (2.2%).\n\nDose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients \u226565 years of age and in 10% of younger patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions which required dose reduction (\u22651.0%) were hypoxia (5%) and anemia (3.2%).\n\nThe most common (\u226525%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin (88%), fatigue (43%), musculoskeletal pain (33%), increased creatinine (34%), decreased lymphocytes (34%), increased alanine aminotransferase (32%), decreased sodium (31%), increased potassium (29%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (27%).\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nCoadministration of WELIREG with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases plasma exposure of belzutifan, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Monitor for anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended.\n\nCoadministration of WELIREG with CYP3A4 substrates decreases concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates or lead to therapeutic failures. Avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information. Coadministration of WELIREG with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding.\n\nLactation\n\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.\n\nFemales and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\nWELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with WELIREG.\n\nUse of WELIREG may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.\n\nBased on findings in animals, WELIREG may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential and the reversibility of this effect is unknown.\n\nPediatric Use\n\nSafety and effectiveness of WELIREG in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\n\nMerck\u2019s focus on cancer\n\nEvery day, we follow the science as we work to discover innovations that can help patients, no matter what stage of cancer they have.

Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Good luck, today, and do keep in touch. \u2026\n\nAn article that was written by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services employees and slated for publication in a medical journal this spring was placed on hold last week, apparently as a result of the Trump administration freeze on communications from government agencies, STAT reports. The article reviewed the responsibilities of institutions that receive federal funding for research and was to have appeared in the Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics. It was co-authored by the director and deputy director of the HHS Office of Research Integrity, who had previously discussed the topic at a public symposium last October at the University of Pennsylvania, according to a journal editor. The event was focused on research misconduct, an issue of growing concern in scientific and public health circles, and included a panel in which the ORI officials discussed recently proposed regulations designed to promote scientific integrity. The editing process had begun but was interrupted when the authors and the journal received messages from an HHS communications employee saying it would need to be reviewed again by HHS \u201cirrespective of what happened before the inauguration.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nAuthorities in China are investigating reports of quality problems with some drugs eligible for distribution through the country\u2019s public hospitals, Reuters tells us. The National Healthcare Security Administration issued a notice saying it would lead a team to Shanghai to gather feedback on the country\u2019s drug bulk-buy procurement programs that focus on off-patent medicines and \u201cattached great importance\u201d to reports that some drugs purchased through bulk-procurement might have quality problems. China rolled out the bulk-buy program in 2018 in an attempt to negotiate lower prices from drug manufacturers and has since expanded it to many parts of the country. The drugs on the list include off-patent blockbusters made by Western pharmaceutical giants as well as generics produced by local players. While the scheme puts pressure on margins, many drugmakers participate in the tenders to supply public hospitals in large volumes.",

But he could profit off claim in vaccine lawsuit.\n\nIn 2020, as a pandemic raged across the globe, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took to social media to appeal to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook.\n\nThe son of the late U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Bobby Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, the younger Kennedy said he was looking for parents whose children had been vaccinated against a different virus -- human papillomavirus or HPV -- and later grew sick.\n\nPublic health researchers and doctors said there was no evidence that the vaccine, Gardasil, was linked to the health problems he cited, noting 160 favorable studies on safety. A federal court created to compensate people injured by vaccines also had already rejected a similar claim, citing \"insufficient proof\" that the vaccine was behind the plaintiff's health issues.\n\nBut in his posts, Kennedy said that he and lawyer Michael Baum \u2013 whom Kennedy calls \"one of my closest friends\" -- believed there was still a path forward. The families could sue the manufacturer Merck in civil court claiming marketing fraud \u2013 allegations Merck denies.\n\n\"If you have been injured by Gardasil, call us,\" Kennedy wrote on Facebook, posting a toll-free number invoking his famous initials \"RFK.\"\n\nAccording to financial disclosure documents released last week, Kennedy's primary source of income in the past year were large sums of referral fees from multiple law firms, including Baum's office, whose civil lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil vaccine went to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week.\n\nKennedy's leading role in building a case against Merck is now raising questions about how he might wield his power as the nation's next health secretary \u2013 a job intended as an impartial overseer in public health \u2013 while in line for potential payouts from a major pharmaceutical company.\n\n\"This disclosure shows that RFK Jr. made millions off of peddling dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracies,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is a Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee that will oversee Kennedy's nomination.\n\n\"Even worse, if he is confirmed, his finances will still be tied to the outcomes of anti-vaccine lawsuits -- even as he'd be tasked with regulating them as health secretary. These are outrageous conflicts of interest that endanger public health,\" Warren said in a statement provided to reporters.\n\nKennedy, who is expected to testify for the first time Wednesday before the Senate panel, said he has resigned his work with several law firms, including Wisner Baum, and that if confirmed he would no longer be involved in legal cases.\n\nBut in a plan greenlit by federal ethics officials, Kennedy said he plans to retain his right to 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases with Wisner Baum, so long as the cases don't involve the U.S. government. The federal government is not a party in the civil lawsuit against Merck.\n\n\"I am entitled to receive a portion of future recovery in these cases based upon the set percentage as set forth in the referral agreement,\" he wrote.\n\nKennedy disclosed another $856,559 in income from Wisner Baum referral fees, although the documents do not say which legal cases were tied to those fees. Other income included $8.8 million from his firm Kennedy & Madonna. Kennedy said he was terminating his relationship with the firm, which would no longer use his name.\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy declined to comment on the record.\n\nBaum said on Monday that Kennedy was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the Gardasil case, but has not received any compensation related to the lawsuit so far.\n\n\u201cUntil he began running for president, he was co-counsel, not just referring counsel,\" Baum wrote in an email. \"His accumulation of science articles and connections to expert scientists willing to work on the Gardasil case was instrumental to establishing a basis and path for litigating Gardasil induced injury cases.\"\n\nHe also is pushing back against suggestions that the the lawsuit is \"anti-vaccine.\u201d Baum said Merck failed to properly warn patients of potential side effects.\n\nIn a statement on the civil lawsuit, Merck said \"an overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy of our HPV vaccines. The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims.\"\n\nRobert Krakow, a New York lawyer who specializes in vaccine injury cases and has worked with Kennedy in the past, said referral fees are fairly standard when it comes to personal injury claims.\n\nKennedy has been a \"galvanizing force\" when it came to questioning vaccine safety, providing a special touch when talking to families because \"he was very sincere and listened to people,\" Krakow said. Using social media platforms to recruit clients is a natural extension of that work, he said.\n\n\"It's not often you have a celebrity do that,\" Krakow said of Kennedy's work to find clients who claim vaccine injuries. \"But there's nothing inherently wrong with recruiting people for referral fees.\"\n\nReuters was first to report Kennedy's extensive role in the Gardasil vaccine lawsuit.\n\nBecause Kennedy's financial arrangement was allowed by ethics officials, it's not clear whether the issue will be a sticking point for Republicans eager to align with Trump. According to the agreement released last week, Kennedy can keep the fees from Wisner Baum so long as the independent ethics office at the Health and Human Services Department determines the case does \"not involve the United States as a party and in which the United States does not have a direct and substantial interest.\"\n\nKennedy also has insisted in private meetings with senators that he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but only wants more study, according to one person familiar with the discussions.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) nominee of President-elect Donald Trump, arrives to the 60th presidential inauguration in the rotunda of the Capitol, Jan. 20, 2025. Kenny Holston/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe messaging aligns with what Kennedy has said publicly. Kennedy often notes he was vaccinated as a child and opted to vaccinate his own children decades ago. His work as chair and chief litigator of the Children's Heath Defense, which opposes the recommended schedule of vaccines for children, did not begin until around 2015.\n\n\"What I've said is I'm pro-science and pro-safety,\" he told a local New Hampshire television station in 2023.\n\nStill, public health experts and many senators -- several of them old enough to remember serious outbreaks of measles and polio in the 1950s -- have expressed serious concerns about his role in eroding confidence in vaccines, even if he says he won't outright block access to them.\n\n\"We potentially face a massive health hazard, maybe especially for our children,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nSanders, who had been seen as someone who might be able to find common ground with Kennedy on environmental and food policy, said the concern with the incoming administration was that \"we may revert back to those terrible days when so many children died\" before age 3.\n\nAs head of the Health and Human Services Department, Kennedy would be responsible for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the selling and marketing of vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collects data on vaccines to issue public health recommendations that are closely followed by doctors.\n\nIf confirmed, he could insist upon appointing vaccine skeptics to the independent group that reviews FDA data on vaccines.\n\nKennedy also could alter how information is used from CDC's public reporting system known as \"VAERS\" that allows anyone to flag possible adverse reactions from vaccines. The reports are unverified but used to look for potential patterns that can be investigated.\n\nHealth officials say symptoms reported in VAERS are often found to be unrelated from a person's immunization history.\n\nDorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and expert in legal issues on vaccinations, said handing over that process to someone with Kennedy's track record would be unprecedented.\n\n\"Kennedy has been a committed anti-vaccine activist for a long time. I have seen no indication that his views have changed,\" Reiss said.\n\nABC's Sony Salzman and Will McDuffie contributed to this report.",

The company transformed from a pharmacy into a drug manufacturer in 1827 with the commercialization of morphine and the perfection of the manufacturing process. The company will later gain recognition for isolating and commercializing the manufacture of cocaine as well.\n\nMerck Group sent Theodore Weicker to New York as its representative in 1889 and he quickly began to set up operations. The original investment of $200,000 resulted in a facility in lower Manhattan and the addition of Merck family member George Merck to the project. They began operations in 1891 and were in business as the US branch of Merck Group until 1917 and the onset of World War I.\n\nWorld War I brought about the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the nationalization of Merck Group\u2019s US operations. Those operations were repurchased at a government auction only 2 years later with the help of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, but the split was done. The company retained rights to the Merck name in the US but remained independent. One of many noteworthy achievements in the post-War period is the discovery of streptomycin, which was revolutionary in treating tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1953 the company merged with Sharp& Dohme to form the then 2nd largest US drug manufacturer. The merger brought smallpox vaccines to the portfolio and opened a new avenue of research for the business. Since then, advancements in vaccine technology include treatments for mumps and chickenpox. Other notable advancements include the discovery of statins as a cholesterol inhibitor and work in veterinary medicine.\n\nToday, Merck & Co operates through 2 segments and under 2 different names with a headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ. The company operates as Merck & Co in the US and as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the US and Canada. The 2 segments are Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. Revenue topped $49 billion in 2022 and employed more than 68,000 people. The company has 8 research facilities near major university systems, including 7 in the US and 1 in the UK. As of 2022, the company had 82 pipeline products in Phase 2 trials, 30 in Phase 3 trials and 3 under review.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment researches discover and commercializes human health products in several areas of medicine. These include but are not limited to oncology, acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes. This segment has 6 blockbuster drugs as of late 2022, with each generating more than $1 billion in revenue. The leading treatments are Keytruda for treating cancer-related immune conditions, Gardisil which is a vaccine for HPV and Januvia for treating Type-II diabetes. The Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets veterinary healthcare products and services. Both segments sell to healthcare facilities and distributors.",

            "content": "Our lawyers are helping victims who want to bring a Gardasil HVP vaccine lawsuit throughout the United States. Our law firm is particularly focused on ovarian failure cases that lead to infertility in women who have taken Gardasil in the last few years.\n\nGardasil is a vaccine intended to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), which can sometimes lead to cervical cancer in women. Gardasil was developed by the embattled pharmaceutical company Merck & Co.\n\nMerck obtained FDA approval for Gardasil in 2006 based on deceptive research and clinical trials that misrepresented the vaccine\u2019s efficacy while concealing its safety risks and side effects. Merck then launched an aggressive and highly misleading marketing campaign to include millions of parents vaccinating their pre-teen daughters with Gardasil.\n\nFiling a Gardasil lawsuit is not an anti-vax statement. A Gardasil vaccine lawsuit is a statement that this specific vaccine that we all assumed was safe might not be.\n\nGardasil settlement projections for different types of injuries\n\nGardasil Class Action Lawsuit Updates in 2025\n\nMarch 12, 2025 \u2013 Tough Ruling in MDL\n\nThe MDL judge in the Western District of North Carolina has ruled in favor of Merck, granting summary judgment on the grounds of implied preemption. The decision effectively blocks failure-to-warn claims brought by plaintiffs who allege that Merck should have included warnings about Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) on the Gardasil label. There are other claims, but the reality is this is a failure to warn case. So it is a crushing blow in the MDL.\n\nThe court found that under federal law, Merck could not have independently added these warnings without FDA approval. Since the FDA has never required such warnings\u2014and has consistently rejected claims that Gardasil causes POTS or POI\u2014the court determined that state law failure-to-warn claims conflict with federal regulation and are therefore preempted. The ruling is a major victory for Merck in the federal litigation, as it eliminates one of the plaintiffs\u2019 central legal claims.\n\nThe decision does not apply to state court cases. So while this ruling is significant, it does not end Gardasil litigation altogether. This decision applies only to cases consolidated in the MDL in federal court. State court lawsuits remain unaffected, and plaintiffs can still pursue claims under state law, particularly in jurisdictions where failure-to-warn claims are treated differently or where alternative legal theories\u2014such as fraud, negligence, or design defect\u2014are in play.\n\nThe contrast between state and federal litigation is already becoming apparent. A state court trial in Los Angeles, brought by a woman who alleges Gardasil caused a heart condition that left her in a wheelchair, was recently postponed due to concerns over potential jury bias. The delay stemmed from the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, a long-time critic of vaccines, referred cases to a law firm handling Gardasil litigation and was set to financially benefit from some of these lawsuits before transferring his stake to his son. His highly publicized confirmation process led to concerns that jurors might be influenced by his vaccine-related advocacy.\n\nSo despite this federal preemption ruling, the broader fight over Gardasil is not over. State courts will continue to hear cases, and the legal battle over whether Merck adequately disclosed Gardasil\u2019s risks will play out in those jurisdictions. Merck\u2019s victory in the MDL means federal plaintiffs may now focus on other claims, such as fraud or design defect, while state court litigation remains active.\n\nFebruary 19, 2025 \u2013 Trial Postponed\n\nThe first trial over the safety of Merck & Co.\u2019s Gardasil vaccine was halted and rescheduled due to concerns that media coverage of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s confirmation as U.S. Health Secretary might influence jurors. Both sides agreed to delay the Los Angeles trial to ensure a fair process, given Kennedy\u2019s long history of vaccine criticism and financial ties to vaccine litigation.\n\nThe trial, which started a few weeks ago, involved a plaintiff who alleged Gardasil caused her heart condition, leaving her in a wheelchair. Merck denies wrongdoing, stating the vaccine\u2019s risks were properly disclosed. The case will be retried in September with a new jury.\n\nKennedy\u2019s confirmation has sparked controversy, as he will oversee vaccine policies and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which has paid $5.3 billion in claims since 1988.\n\nJanuary 27, 2025 \u2013 Trial\n\nThe first jury trial over claims that Merck misrepresented the safety and efficacy of its Gardasil HPV vaccine. The lawsuit alleges that Merck overstated the vaccine\u2019s benefits, downplayed its risks, and withheld side-effect reports from regulators. The plaintiff claims she developed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and nerve damage after receiving the vaccine.\n\nMerck denies the allegations, asserting that its marketing practices complied with regulations and that Gardasil\u2019s safety is backed by extensive scientific evidence. The company points to vaccine court findings and CDC statements refuting links between Gardasil and POTS.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025 \u2013 Trial in a Week\n\nThe first Gardasil lawsuit to go to trial is next week in California.\n\nSeptember 12, 2024 \u2013 Appeals MDL Dismissal\n\nThree women involved in the Gardasil multidistrict litigation have announced plans to appeal their cases to the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals after their lawsuits were dismissed for failing to file timely petitions in the Vaccine Court.\n\nThese women argued for equitable tolling, claiming difficulties in linking their injuries to the Gardasil vaccine, an argument the MDL judge rejected. They will now appeal this decision.\n\nSeptember 3, 2024 \u2013 Only Three New Cases in MDL Last Two Months\n\nThe Gardasil class action MDL has only added three new cases over the last two months. The total number of pending cases in the MDL is now at 200.\n\nAugust 4, 2024 \u2013 Four Cases Dismissed\n\nThe MDL judge has dismissed claims from four patients in litigation concerning injuries allegedly caused by Merck\u2019s Gardasil HPV vaccine.\n\nThe dismissal was based on procedural grounds related to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which requires that any vaccine injury claim be first filed with the federal vaccine injury program, known as \u201cVaccine Court,\u201d within three years of symptom onset. Three plaintiff, filed their petitions too late and failed to appeal the Vaccine Court\u2019s dismissal of their time-barred claims before pursuing civil actions. (The fourth plaintiff did not file a petition at all and did not respond to the motion to dismiss.)\n\nJuly 18, 2024 \u2013 First Gardasil Trial in Two Months\n\nThe Gardasil litigation in state court has outpaced in MDL. The first California state trial, Robi v. Merck, is set for October 7, 2024. The plaintiff in that case alleges severe side effects, including heart problems and nerve pain, from the vaccine.\n\nJuly 1, 2024 \u2013 Case Count\n\nThis litigation is not exploding. The Gardasil Products Liability Litigation under Judge Kenneth D. Bell in North Carolina saw a minor increase in active cases from 194 in June to 197 in July 2024.\n\nJune 12, 2024 \u2013 Bellwether Trial Date To Be Set Soon\n\nLawyers for both sides in the Gardasil HPV vaccine MDL are very close to completing discovery in the initial group of test cases for bellwether trials. The date for the first Gardasil bellwether trial is expected to be set at the MDL status conference set for tomorrow. It seems likely, however, that the first Gardasil test trial will happen in California state court. The California case features a plaintiff who was allegedly left bed-ridden for life as a result of the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nJune 3, 2024 \u2013 MDL Approaches 200 Cases\n\nThere are now 184 total cases pending in the Gardasil class action MDL. Three months ago there were about 140, so this is not a high volume MDL, but it continues grow.\n\nMay 20, 2024 \u2013 Merck Seeks Dismissal\n\nLast week, Merck moved to dismiss a group of 3 Gardasil cases from the MDL on the grounds that the plaintiffs in each case failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the National Vaccine Injury Act. The Vaccine Act requires all plaintiffs in vaccine cases to first bring their claims in vaccine court before filing in civil court.\n\nApril 5, 2024 \u2013 New Case Study\n\nA new case study has highlighted a significant association between Merck\u2019s HPV vaccine, Gardasil, and the development of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), an autoimmune condition characterized by chronic lightheadedness, fainting, and rapid heartbeat episodes.\n\nResearchers in Utah documented a woman who developed POTS shortly after receiving the Gardasil vaccine in 2014. This case underscores the potential for the vaccine to initiate autoimmune or autonomic dysfunction, possibly as a result of the immune system\u2019s response to a viral component.\n\nThis is one more piece of the puzzle linking POTS and the HPV vaccine.\n\nMarch 29, 2024 \u2013 Judge Rules that Gardasil MDL Can Move Forward\n\nLast month, Merck\u2019s defense team filed a motion asking the MDL Judge to dismiss all of the Gardasil lawsuits on the grounds that the failure to warn claims asserted by the plaintiffs are legally barred under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. Last week, however, MDL Judge Kenneth Bell issued a memorandum opinion denying the motion as to failure to warn. Judge Bell found that the claims that Merck negligently failed to warn healthcare providers about the potential risks of Gardasil are not fully barred under the Vaccine Act, nor are claims that Merck fraudulently concealed these risks. This ruling is significant because it clears the way for the Gardasil litigation to move forward into the next phase, which could prompt Merck to seek a global settlement deal.\u2019\n\nMarch 1, 2024 \u2013 39 Cases Added to MDL Since Start of Year\n\nThere are now 143 total cases pending in the Gardasil class action MDL. Since the start of this year, a total of 39 new cases have been added to the MDL.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024 \u2013 Status Conference in MDL\n\nToday, Judge Conrad will meet with lawyers about the Gardasil lawsuit. The judge will check on how things are going and listen to both sides about any issues they\u2019re having with gathering information for the case. Before the meeting, both sides agreed on some topics to talk about. They\u2019ll discuss how they plan to share information, give an update from Merck and figure out how to work with similar cases happening in state court in California, and talk about where the Gardasil lawsuits are going in 2024.\n\nThey also shared a report saying they\u2019ve finished questioning people about how Merck watched for Gardasil\u2019s side effects and how they tested the drug. They plan to question more people from Merck in the next few months.\n\nThe people suing have asked for more documents from Merck, but Merck doesn\u2019t want to give three of those. They\u2019re still trying to work out this disagreement. Big companies do not like to produce documents for one of two reasons: (1) they have something to hide, or (2) they are reflexively oppositional.\n\nBoth sides have also asked to have more time to prepare these lawsuits, and this will be discussed at the meeting today.\n\nHere are some of the key deadlines coming up:\n\nEvent Deadline Written Discovery Completion February 15 General Causation Expert Discovery Completion August 30 Deadline for Motions on General Causation Expert Testimony Admissibility October 11 Hearings on General Causation (Daubert) Late January 2025 Jury Trials Scheduled Following the Hearings\n\nIf you are putting this on a calendar, circle the Daubert hearing. That is what will make or break this litigation.\n\nJanuary 1, 2024 \u2013 MDL Adds 28 New Cases\n\nThe class action MDL involving the Gardasil HPV vaccine only has 132 pending cases. That is an increase of 28 new cases over the last 30 days, which marks one of the highest monthly volumes since the start of the litigation.\n\nGardasil Class Action Lawsuit Updates in 2023\n\nDecember 1, 2023 \u2013 Case Count in MDL 3036\n\nThere are now 104 filed lawsuits in the MDL class action.\n\nOctober 2, 2023 \u2013 MDL Status Hearing\n\nLast week, a status hearing was held in the Gardasil MDL to provide the MDL Judge with updates on various issues. The topics included efforts to resolve the ongoing dispute over Merck\u2019s document production, limits on the scope of discovery, and updates on the bellwether cases.\n\nSeptember 28, 2023 \u2013 Gardasil Lawyer Meeting\n\nThere was a status conference on Tuesday in the Gardasil class action. The topics were discovery dispute and limit an update on the bellwether Gardasil lawsuits that are being prepared for trial.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023 \u2013 What Is a Lexecon Waiver?\n\nThe only Gardasil lawsuits that will be bellwether trial cases have a Lexecon waiver. What is a Lexecon waiver?\n\nA Lexecon waiver is an agreement that waives the right to challenge the venue (location) for where the suit is tried. So cases that belong in other jurisdictions can be tried in North Carolina instead of their home states so the MDL judge can preside over the trial.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 \u2013 Getting Cases Ready for Trial\n\nIn June, sixteen bellwether cases for the Gardasil class action lawsuit were chosen by both plaintiffs and defendants to undergo early test trials to help determine settlement amounts.\n\nIn a recent pretrial conference with Judge Conrad this week, Gardasil lawyers discussed the progress of the litigation. According to a new status report, 13 of the 16 plaintiffs have amended their complaints, and Merck has responded with case-specific answers.\n\nMerck intends to subpoena the parents of plaintiffs for depositions, given that many plaintiffs received the vaccine at a young age. One case in the bellwether pool was dismissed and will be replaced to maintain equal numbers.\n\nWe are getting closer to having the first trial in these lawsuits.\n\nAugust 28, 2023 \u2013 92 Cases Pending in MDL\n\nWhen the Gardasil class action MDL was first established in September 2022, it had just 20 pending cases. A few months later, in January 2023, the MDL had tripled in size with 60 pending cases. Since then, however, the growth trajectory has flattened. There are currently only 92 pending Gardasil cases in the MDL, as only 32 new cases have been added since the start of the year.\n\nAugust 2, 2023 \u2013 Joint Status Report in MDL\n\nA recent joint status report submitted to the MDL Judge in the Gardasil HPV vaccine class action offers a glimpse of the most recent developments in this ongoing litigation. This week, the plaintiffs are deposing corporate representatives for Merck under FRCP Rule 30(b)(6). These depositions will be a key part of the case against Merck. 16 cases have been selected for a bellwether discovery pool, and those cases are going through discovery now. Finally, the plaintiffs are continuing to pry out of Merck the adverse event data that was the subject of an earlier motion to compel.\n\nJuly 10, 2023 \u2013 Defendant Fact Sheets\n\nUnder a new order last month, Merck must fill out and submit something called a Defendant Fact Sheet (DFS) for each lawsuit that will provide key information about the case. This is required after each plaintiff gives their own Plaintiff Fact Sheet (PFS), which contains the basic facts of their claim.\n\nThe DFS must be submitted within 45 days of receiving the PFS, and the details given in the DFS will be treated as if they were provided in response to a formal request for documents. Any documents the defendants provide in response to the DFS are considered confidential, so they can\u2019t be shared with others without permission.\n\nJune 27, 2023 \u2013 Preparing Bellwether Cases for Trial\n\nThe U.S. District Judge supervising the federal Gardasil vaccine class action lawsuit will work with lawyers this week to peel off some of the details of how the path to the first Gardasil trial will work. There are 16 potential cases that could the \u201cthe one\u201d that is the first to go to trial. What happens in this first trial will be a big deal. If there is a large verdict, that will send like Gardasil settlement amount through the roof. If the case were dismissed, that would have a disastrous impact on projected compensation payouts.\n\nJune 1, 2023 \u2013 Bellwether Trial Plan\n\nAs long as mass tort litigation like the Gardasil class action lawsuit takes, there is a plan to get these lawsuits to trial. A bellwether trial program has been set up in the Gardasil class action MDL. In June, an initial pool of 16 cases will be selected as bellwether candidates. These cases will then go through a short fact-discovery phase to learn more about each case. After that is completed, the pool of 16 will be narrowed down to six cases which will be eligible for the opening round of bellwether trials next year. The plaintiffs will be patients who have one of the two main health complications associated with the HPV vaccine: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) or Primary Ovarian Failure (POF), also referred to as Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).\n\nMay 3, 2023 \u2013 Ruling on Experts\n\nThe court addressed last week the \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Withhold Expert Reports Filed in the Vaccine Program by Plaintiffs\u2019 Consulting Experts.\u201d Merck opposed the motion.\n\nThe court has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. It has allowed plaintiffs to withhold their expert reports filed in the Vaccine Court until they determine whether these experts will be retained as consulting or testifying experts in the MDL. This decision was made considering the fairness principles underlying Rule 26(b)(4)(D) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If plaintiffs decide not to retain any particular expert who filed a report in Vaccine Court, they must produce those experts\u2019 reports to Merck within 10 days of such a decision.\n\nHowever, the court has denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to withhold expert reports filed by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in Vaccine Court. The court found that the fairness considerations of Rule 26(b)(4)(D) do not apply to DHHS\u2019s experts since they will not be retained by the plaintiffs. Therefore, the court has ordered the plaintiffs to produce DHHS\u2019s expert reports from Vaccine Court to Merck within 10 days of the order.\n\nApril 14, 2023 \u2013 Document Discovery\n\nIn November 2022, the plaintiffs in the Gardasil class action MDL filed a motion to compel discovery, claiming that Merck had failed to produce documents and information about adverse event reports involving Gardasil. Merck strenuously opposed the motion, but the MDL Judge recently granted most of the plaintiffs\u2019 requests. Merck has now been ordered to produce all information and documents relating to its adverse event reporting system and other vital documents.\n\nMarch 1, 2023 \u2013 Delay in California Gardasil Lawsuits\n\nAside from the Gardasil vaccine lawsuits in the federal court MDL class action, there is a large group of Gardasil HPV vaccine lawsuits that have been consolidated in California state courts. The Gardasil cases in California state court are much farther along than their federal counterparts in the MDL.\n\nIn fact, a handful of those cases were scheduled to go to trial starting in September 2023. At the last MDL status conference, however, it was confirmed that these state court trial dates have been pushed back one year to September 2024. This was done to help coordinate the MDL with the California state court proceedings.\n\nThe postponement is a bit of a disappointment because it would have been very helpful to get a few test trials and verdicts to get a feel for what judges and jurors think of the science behind plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits.\n\nFebruary 9, 2023 \u2013 Motion to Dismiss Design Defect Claims\n\nEarlier this week, Merck filed a Motion in the Gardasil MDL asking the Judge to dismiss all claims that are based on a design defect liability theory. Vaccine manufacturers are immune from design defect claims under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which requires those claims to be submitted to an administrative process called \u201cvaccine court.\u201d\n\nMerck argues that the bulk of the claims asserted by the Gardasil plaintiffs are design defect claims, whether they expressly say so or not.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023 \u2013 Merck Sets Out Its Affirmative Defenses\n\nMerck filed a general denial and list of affirmative defenses last week, which outlines its planned strategy for defending the Gardasil lawsuits. As expected, one of Merck\u2019s primary defenses in the class action lawsuit will be that all Gardasil claims based on an alleged failure to warn are precluded under the National Childhood Vaccine Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-22).\n\nWith respect to the claims based on defective design, Merck will assert that the vaccine design was not defective. Merck\u2019s lawyers will also push a defense based on the learned intermediary doctrine, which essentially puts the obligation to warn about Gardasil risks on the doctors who recommended the vaccine.\n\nI don\u2019t think Merck has much chance of prevailing on these defenses in the MDL class action.\n\nJanuary 18, 2023 \u2013 Gardasil Litigation Status\n\nThe Gardasil class action MDL in the Western District of North Carolina now has 60 active Gardasil lawsuits. When the MDL was first created in September 2022, it had over 20 cases. Future Gardasil cases will probably be added in consecutive waves as previously filed claims clear the vaccine court process.\n\nJanuary 3, 2023 \u2013 Gardasil Lawsuit Continues to Advance\n\nThe Gardasil class action lawsuit is moving forward. Not at the pace many of us would like, but the ball is being advanced toward bellwether trials.\n\nLawyers for both sides in the Gardasil class action MDL in North Carolina recently submitted a proposed bellwether plan to MDL Judge Robert Conrad. Under the joint proposal, 16 bellwether candidate cases would be selected and go through fact discovery. The deadline for completing that discovery process would be February 2024.\n\nBy August 2024, six of the 16 cases would be selected for bellwether test trials. Judge Conrad will likely approve the joint plan at the next monthly status conference. So that gives you some idea of the time horizon we are looking at in this litigation.\n\nMeanwhile, the cases keep moving forward. The plaintiffs in the Gardasil MDL filed a motion to compel back in November to force Merck to provide additional documents and better responses to certain interrogatories submitted in discovery. Merck has been stalling for time since then. After being granted an extension of their response deadline, Merck now has until January 5, 2023, to either respond to the motion to compel or provide supplemental discovery responses.\n\nGardasil Class Action Lawsuit \u2013 December 2022 Update\n\nLast month, Judge Robert Conrad of the Western District of North Carolina will hold the first status conference in the new Gardasil class action MDL litigation. Judge Conrad will likely announce his selections for lawyers to serve on the plaintiffs\u2019 leadership committee, the body of lawyers who collectively make decisions on behalf of all the other plaintiffs in the MDL.\n\nGardasil Class Action Lawsuit \u2013 October 2022 Update\n\nThe judge in the newly formed Gardasil class action lawsuit will hold his first initial conference with lawyers for all parties on October 11, 2022.\n\nThe primary focus of this initial conference will be the appointment of lawyers to serve on the plaintiffs\u2019 leadership committee (also known as a \u201csteering committee\u201d).\n\nThe committee will make important decisions on behalf of all the plaintiffs in the MDL class action. Other topics that will be discussed at the conference will include a proposed discovery plan and the creation of master pleading forms.\n\nGardasil Lawsuit \u2013 August 2022 Update\n\nWe now have a Gardasil class action lawsuit. The panel that oversees federal multidistrict litigation agreed to form a new class action MDL for consolidated handling of all Gardasil HPV product liability lawsuits in federal courts.\n\nThe Western District of North Carolina was selected as the venue for the new MDL (In re: Gardasil Prod. Liab. Lit., MDL No. 3036). The panel agreed to the MDL consolidation despite strong objections by defendant Merck who argued that the MDL would conflict with federal vaccine laws and promote vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe case has been assigned to Judge Robert Conrad Jr. Parenthetically, Judge Conrad played point guard for Clemson over 40 years ago.\n\nGardasil Lawsuit \u2013 July 2022 Update\n\nLawyers for a large group of plaintiffs filed a motion asking the JPML to create a new MDL Gardasil HPV vaccine class action lawsuit, seeking consolidation of all current and future HPV lawsuits alleging health complications from Merck\u2019s Gardasil HPV vaccine.\n\nA total of 34 pending Gardasil lawsuits in 25 different federal districts were identified in the motion. The volume of Gardasil product liability cases is expected to grow very rapidly over the next year. The plaintiffs are claiming that the Gardasil HPV vaccine caused them to develop auto-immune and/or neurologic disorders because Merck failed to properly research it before pushing it on the market.\n\nNew Gardasil HPV Research Leading to a Lawsuit\n\nNew research has shown that Gardasil can induce and increase the risk of auto-immune diseases, and a host of other serious health complications including Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Neuropathy, and Fibromyalgia. Gardasil has also been linked to premature ovarian failure and infertility. (Our lawyers are getting a lot of Gardasil infertility lawsuit inquiries.) What is even more unsettling, however, is that there is also evidence to suggest that rather than preventing cervical cancer, the Gardasil HPV vaccine may increase the risk of cervical cancer.\n\nOur firm is currently seeking new Gardasil HPV vaccine lawsuit cases. If you had the Gardasil HPV vaccine and subsequently developed serious side effects, call us today at 800-553-8082 or get a free consultation online.\n\nGardasil HPV Vaccine\n\nHPV is a common virus that is easily passed through skin contact. HPV is the most common STD, and it is estimated that 2/3 of the adult population will have an HPV infection during their lifetime. Most HPV cases are harmless. But a very small percentage of HPV cases in women can potentially contribute to the development of cervical cancer. So a safe drug that can fight HPV and cervical cancer would be meaningful.\n\nMerck fast-tracked approval for Gardasil from the FDA in 2006. Gardasil\u2019s approval came right on the heels of Merck\u2019s Vioxx disaster which cost the company billions in losses. Gardasil was viewed as Merck\u2019s next big blockbuster drug that was going to pull the company out of its financial hole. Unfortunately, however, Merck learned very little from the Vioxx disaster because they repeated many of the same mistakes.\n\nAbout Human Papillomavirus (HPV)\n\nHPV stands for human papillomavirus. HPV is an exceedingly common type of virus that lives in the skin. Over 200 different strains of the HPV virus have been medically identified. About 2/3 of these strains of HPV are benign and have zero symptoms.\n\nA handful of HPV strains are known to cause growth in the skin or mucous membrane. These growths are commonly called \u201cwarts.\u201d HPV is highly transmissible via skin-to-skin contact, including sexual or other types of intimate contact such as kissing. Around 40 of the known HPV strains are transmitted primarily through sexual contact.\n\nGenital HPV is so ubiquitous that experts estimate that over 75% of the sexually active adult population will have genital HPV at some point in their life. Most people with genital HPV never have any physical symptoms at all and the infection simply goes away on its own without the individual even realizing they were infected. 2 of the 40 genital HPV strains are known to cause genital warts.\n\nMost HPV infections occur unnoticed and resolve on their own without any long-term consequences. However, there are a few strains of HPV that do not clear up on their own and can eventually lead to abnormal growths that could develop into cancer. These strains of HPV are called \u201chigh-risk\u201d HPV. Out of the 40 types of genital HPV, only 12 strains are classified as high-risk and potentially can lead to cancer. Two of these 12 high-risk HPV types account for over 80% of all cancer cases.\n\nHigh-risk HPV is primarily a concern for women because it can develop into cervical cancer. These types of HPV can gradually cause the formation of abnormal growths in the cervical tissue. If these growths are not promptly removed they will often develop into cervical cancer.\n\nPap smear examinations are intended to identify these abnormal growths and remove them before they lead to cervical cancer. Although cervical cancer is the most common, HPV can also lead to other types of cancer including anal and penis.\n\nMerck Brings Gardasil to Market with Fraudulent Marketing Campaign\n\nLeading up to and after the 2006 approval of Gardasil, Merck launched a massive marketing campaign to manufacture demand for its HPV vaccine. Before Gardasil, there was little or no demand for an HPV vaccine, and HPV was never viewed as a pressing public health emergency. To ensure the financial success of its new vaccine, Merk preceded the release of Gardasil with expensive HPV \u201cdisease awareness\u201d marketing. This marketing campaign greatly exaggerated the health risks of HPV.\n\nMerck launched a years-long disease awareness campaign to make people fear HPV and cervical cancer, despite the lack of a public health emergency in high-resource countries like the United States. Prior to FDA approval, Merck used its marketing campaign to create a market for its vaccine out of thin air, while simultaneously engaging in a cringe-worthy propaganda campaign aimed at frightening and guilting parents who failed to inoculate their children with Gardasil.\n\nMerck aggressively marketed Gardasil as a miracle vaccine, falsely proclaiming it a \u201ccervical cancer vaccine\u201d that could protect against cervical cancer. Merck\u2019s message was that cervical cancer is a real-life killer of young women, notwithstanding the fact that the average age for the development of cervical cancer is 50 years old, and the cancer is virtually nonexistent in women under 20.\n\nMerck also attempted to make the Gardasil vaccine mandatory for all school children by using scare tactics and providing financial incentives to legislatures. Merck mobilized dozens of \u201cpay to play\u201d lobby groups, like the National Association of County and City Health Officials and Women in Government, to push for HPV vaccine mandates. Merck made large contributions to political campaigns and legislative organizations to push its agenda, and several states passed laws allowing preteen children as young as age 12 to \u201cconsent\u201d to vaccination with an HPV vaccine without parental consent or knowledge.\n\nImplications of Merck\u2019s Obsession to Milk Gardasil Profits\n\nIt is no secret that the world we live in is driven by profit. Merck is the game to make money and that is to be expected, right? But there are varying degrees of profit-driven motives among pharmaceutical companies. Some prioritize profits over all else, including safety and patient well-being. Others place a greater emphasis on ethical considerations and the greater good, while still maintaining a healthy bottom line.\n\nMerck has shown us time and again they are on the high end of the food chain (to put it charitably) in passion to obtain massive profits. When a company is so clearly profit-driven, it can be hard to trust its scientific credibility or feel comfortable that they are telling you everything you need to know. This is because the profit motive can sometimes cloud judgment and result in biased reporting of scientific data. Everyone agrees that pharmaceutical companies are sometimes prone to present only positive results from a clinical trial of their product, while downplaying or ignoring negative results.\n\nMerck likely accuses plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers of believing Gardasil causes every infirmity that has ever affected the human race. I get that. I\u2019m about to put out a list of possible harm that Gardasil may cause. Many of these may be proven wrong (or at least never proven right). But the point is Merck holds most of the cards on the harms Gardasil could cause and it is reasonable not to trust them to conduct studies and interpret data as fairly as they would if it was not so driven by profit\n\nGardasil Can Induce or Increase the Risk of Auto-Immune Diseases\n\nTo get Gardasil approved by the FDA, Merck allegedly manipulated its clinical trials to conceal risks and falsely enhance the safety profile of the vaccine. Now we are begging to realize why Merck did this. In the years since Gardasil was released, medical research revealed that Gardasil could induce autoimmune disorders in a certain percentage of patients.\n\nVarious scientific studies have linked Gardasil to the following autoimmune diseases:\n\nGuillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome Orthostatic Intolerance Small Fiber Neuropathy Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Multiple Sclerosis Autoimmune Pancreatitis Autoimmune Hepatitis\n\nGardasil has also been connected to a host of other health conditions that are closely linked to autoimmune conditions. These include fibromyalgia, dysautonomia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic regional pain syndrome, encephalitis syndrome, autonomic dysfunction, and joint pain.\n\nGardasil Linked to Premature Ovarian Failure\n\nPremature Ovarian Failure (POF), also known as premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause, is one of the most serious autoimmune disorders that can be caused by the Gardasil HPV vaccine. Premature ovarian failure is also known as primary ovarian insufficiency. This condition occurs when an abnormal autoimmune response causes a woman\u2019s immune system to target the egg-producing tissue in her ovaries. This causes the ovaries to stop releasing viable eggs.\n\nWith Premature Ovarian Failure, a woman\u2019s ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40, which can lead to infertility. POF can occur due to a variety of reasons such as genetics, autoimmune disorders, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and infections. However, some studies suggest a possible link between POF and certain vaccines, including the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Several studies have identified premature ovary failure as an autoimmune condition associated with adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine.\n\n2014 Article\n\nAn article titled \u201cAdolescent Premature Ovarian Insufficiency Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: A Case Series Seen in General Practice\u201d in the Journal of Investigative Medicine High Impact Case Reports, describes three cases of premature ovarian insufficiency in young women aged 16 to 18 years who had received the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The authors note that the long-term effects of vaccination on ovarian function and durability have not been studied in preclinical, clinical, or post-licensure studies. Of course, this was just three girls and it could have been a coincidence. But for some, that was the first time people learned that this much-ballyhooed vaccine had never been tested for its impact on human fertility.\n\n2020 and 2022 Studies\n\nA study published in 2020 was the first to find an association between premature ovarian failure and the Gardasil vaccine based on a disproportionate number of adverse vaccine event reports. This finding was subsequently confirmed in another study published in March 2022 in Drugs Real World Outcomes.\n\nWhat is the mechanism of injury that could lead to the HPV vaccine causing the premature ovarian failure? No one knows for sure. But it could cause of premature ovarian failure due to the aluminum content that can destroy the maturation process of the eggs in the ovaries.\n\nFertility Rates\n\nThe introduction of the Gardasil vaccine in 2006 coincided with a significant decrease in fertility among American women. This is particularly evident in teen pregnancy statistics which have reduced by more than 50% since 2007. The total fertility rate for the United States in 2017 has also dropped below what is required for the population to replace itself, according to a report by the National Center of Health Statistics. The rate for women between the ages of 15 and 44 has also declined by 2% between 2017 and 2018.\n\nCould there be other causes? Sure.\n\nGardasil Lawsuit\n\nThe emerging scientific evidence establishing the connection between Gardasil HPV vaccines and autoimmune health conditions has led to a growing wave of Gardasil HPV lawsuits against Merck. The first few Gardasil lawsuits started getting filed in the second half of 2020.\n\nThe volume of Gardasil cases increased slowly but steadily throughout 2021. But more victims are filing a Gardasil vaccine lawsuit as awareness of the issues with Gardasil emerges from both victims and Gardasil HPV vaccine lawyers are starting to see the potential size of these claims.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the Gardasil lawsuits are women (and some men) who received Gardasil vaccinations and subsequently developed autoimmune diseases and other serious health conditions linked to Gardasil such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (\u201cPOTS\u201d).\n\nThe HPV Gardasil vaccine side effects lawsuits allege that Merck fraudulently concealed evidence about the health risks of the vaccine while at the same time misrepresenting that Gardasil could prevent cervical cancer. The tort claims being asserted against Merck in the Gardasil lawsuits include traditional product liability tort claims such as failure to warn, manufacturing defect, and negligence. They also include fraud claims that are not commonly seen in product liability cases.\n\nGardasil Lawsuit and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\n\nA Gardasil lawsuit in the District of Nevada was recently dismissed \u2013 mostly without prejudice, which means it can be refiled. The judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were \u201cpartially\u201d preempted under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n\nThe Vaccine Act is a law that says vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued for certain types of claims, including design defect claims and some failure to warn claims. The purpose of the Act is to make it hard to sue vaccine manufacturers even when they screw up to keep vaccine prices stable and to encourage manufacturers to make vaccines. Negligence claims are allowed.\n\nIn Flores v. Merck & Co., a Nevada schoolteacher filed a Gardasil lawsuit alleging she has never been the same since taking the HPV vaccine at age 14. Specifically, she believes she developed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (\u201cPOTS\u201d), as a result of receiving Merck\u2019s HPV vaccine. POTS is an injury that is a definite focus of this litigation.\n\nMerck filed a motion to dismiss. The judge found that the plaintiff did not plead in her lawsuit a viable negligence claim. The court ruled her Gardasil lawsuit was just a design defect claim that was barred under the Vaccine Act. So the plaintiff\u2019s failure to warn claim, as worded in her Gardasil vaccine lawsuit, was also held to be barred under the Vaccine Act.\n\nDespite the dismissal of all the plaintiff\u2019s claims, this Gardasil lawsuit is not over. The plaintiff\u2019s primary claims were dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d meaning that the plaintiff and her lawyers get a chance to \u201ctry again\u201d by filing an amended complaint restating the claims.\n\nThe amended complaint will need to reshape the negligence claim to make it clear that it is not based on any alleged defect design of the Gardasil vaccine. The failure to warn claim also needs to be reshaped to clarify the allegations that Merck failed to warn the plaintiff\u2019s medical providers about specific risks associated with the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s Gardasil lawyer has already filed a new lawsuit. Merck has filed an 18-page motion to dismiss the claim. The motion argues, among other things, that the Vaccine Act \u201cexplicitly protects vaccine manufacturers from liability \u2018for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury that is \u2018associated with the administration of a vaccine due to the \u2018drugmaker\u2019s failure to provide direct warnings\u2026.'\u201d\n\nThe point of all this is that Gardasil lawyers have some work to do to get these cases past the Vaccine Act. But with the new Gardasil vaccine side effects class action lawsuit becoming an MDL, these concerns have been alleviated to some degree. Still, it will take refinement of how these Gardasil lawsuits are pled to avoid preemption under the Vaccine Act. This case will be closely watched as the Gardasil side effects litigation progresses.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"",

While the trial did show an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), the results add to a growing body of clinical data suggesting that Keytruda is reaching the limits of its widespread use.\n\nKeytruda was first approved by the FDA in September 2014 for advanced melanoma. Since then, the PD-1 inhibitor broke open the immuno-oncology space, racking up some four dozen approvals for a suite of cancer types, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and many more, often as part of combo therapies and often paired with cancer drugs from other companies.\n\nBut recently Merck\u2019s Keytruda luck has turned. The company halted a Phase III trial of Keytruda plus anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in August 2024 after data showed it would not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. In the fall, an FDA committee recommended limiting the use of Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb rival med Opdivo in stomach and esophageal cancers based on PD-L1 expression levels.\n\nIn the latest study to readout, Keytruda was paired with Eisai\u2019s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Lenvima in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The late-stage trial, called LEAP-015, showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS at the interim analysis as compared to placebo, the companies said in a Friday release . This was one of the study\u2019s two primary endpoints. It also showed improvement in objective response rate (ORR), which was a secondary endpoint.\n\nBut the combo did not meet the other primary endpoint of overall survival, which is a measure of how long a patient survives after starting treatment. Specific survival data were not disclosed.\n\nMerck\u2019s Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president of global clinical development at the pharma\u2019s research branch, chalked up the results to the challenges of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and said in the release that the results add to the companies\u2019 understandings of this combination. Eisai\u2019s Corina Dutcus, senior VP and oncology global clinical development lead, similarly noted that these cancers present challenges \u201cdue to their heterogeneity and generally poor prognoses.\u201d\n\nThe companies will conduct a full analysis of the data and report results at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nKeytruda and Lenvima are approved together for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and certain types of endometrial carcinoma. The companies are also studying the combo in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal cancer in the broader LEAP clinical program.",

            "content": "RAHWAY, N.J. & NUTLEY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced results from the Phase 3 LEAP-015 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab), Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA\u00ae (lenvatinib), the orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discovered by Eisai, in combination with chemotherapy (KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based regimen), for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. At an interim analysis, the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), one of the study\u2019s dual primary endpoints, and objective response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint, compared to standard of care chemotherapy. The study continued, and at the final analysis, it did not meet its other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The safety profile of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based regimen was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies evaluating the combination. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing, and Merck and Eisai will present these results at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\n\u201c Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma remains a challenging disease to treat and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201c These study results add to our understanding of this combination and will inform our future research as we strive to improve outcomes for more patients with cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201c Gastric and gastroesophageal cancers continue to present challenges due to their heterogeneity and generally poor prognoses,\u201d said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai Inc. \u201c While the LEAP-015 trial did not show a statistically significant increase in overall survival, we were pleased to observe an improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate for patients treated with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination with chemotherapy. These results contribute to the scientific community\u2019s collective understanding of these complex diseases and add to the body of knowledge in oncology research. We are deeply grateful to the patients, caregivers and investigators who participated in this study.\u201d\n\nKEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials.\n\nIn gastric cancer, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma based on OS and other data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial. KEYTRUDA is also approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u22651) as determined by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-811 trial. Continued approval of this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.\n\nIn esophageal cancer, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or GEJ (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the GEJ) carcinoma that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. This approval is based on OS and other data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-590 trial.\n\nResults from the LEAP-015 trial do not affect the current approved indications for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA or other ongoing trials from the LEAP clinical program.\n\nAbout LEAP-015\n\nLEAP-015 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04662710) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. There are two parts of the study: a safety run-in (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). In Part 2, the primary endpoints are OS and PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u22651) and in all patients. Secondary endpoints are ORR and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in both patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) as well as in all patients, and safety. In Part 2, up to 880 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive:\n\nKEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA plus chemotherapy: Induction Phase: approximately 12 weeks KEYTRUDA 400 mg intravenously (IV) every six weeks (Q6W) x 2 cycles plus oral LENVIMA 8 mg every day (QD) plus chemotherapy (CAPOX or mFOLFOX6) CAPOX: oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 twice daily (BID) for 14 days plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 IV, every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4 cycles\n\nor mFOLFOX6: bolus IV 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m 2 , plus 5-FU 2400 mg/m 2 continuous IV plus leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 IV or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 IV plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 IV, every 2 weeks (Q2W) x 6 cycles Consolidation Phase: KEYTRUDA 400 mg IV Q6W, for less than or equal to 16 doses, plus oral LENVIMA 20 mg QD; or\n\nChemotherapy (either CAPOX regimen or mFOLFOX6 regimen, dosed as above; maximum cycles per local standards).\n\nAbout gastric cancer\n\nGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90% to 95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 969,000 patients diagnosed and 660,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2022. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,890 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 10,880 deaths from the disease in 2024. The five-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at a distant stage is 7% in the U.S.\n\nAbout esophageal cancer\n\nEsophageal cancer is the 11th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the seventh leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. It is estimated there were 511,000 new cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed and about 445,000 deaths resulting from the disease worldwide in 2022. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 22,370 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer and 16,130 deaths from the disease in 2024. The five-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer is 6% in the U.S. Cancers that start in gland cells (cells that make mucus) are called adenocarcinomas and are often found in the lower third of the esophagus (lower thoracic esophagus). Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of esophageal cancer in the U.S. and its incidence is rapidly increasing in other parts of the world.\n\nAbout KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg\n\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\n\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\n\nSelected KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.\n\nGastric Cancer\n\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) as determined by an FDA-approved test.\n\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval of this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.\n\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.\n\nEsophageal Cancer\n\nKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) (tumors with epicenter 1 to 5 centimeters above the GEJ) carcinoma that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation either:\n\nin combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, or\n\nas a single agent after one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for patients with tumors of squamous cell histology that express PD-L1 (CPS \u226510) as determined by an FDA-approved test.\n\nSee additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.\n\nSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA\n\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\n\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.\n\nPneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.\n\nPneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\n\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.\n\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\n\nKEYTRUDA as a Single Agent\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.\n\nKEYTRUDA With Axitinib\n\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\n\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\nAdrenal Insufficiency\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n\nHypophysitis\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n\nThyroid Disorders\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients.\n\nHyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.\n\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n\nImmune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.\n\nImmune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti\u2013 PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.\n\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\n\nInfusion-Related Reactions\n\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.\n\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)\n\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n\nIncreased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma\n\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\n\nEmbryofetal Toxicity\n\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).\n\nIn KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (\u22651%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%). In KEYNOTE-716, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma, adverse reactions occurring in patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-189, when KEYTRUDA was administered with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of 405 patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA were nausea (56%), fatigue (56%), constipation (35%), diarrhea (31%), decreased appetite (28%), rash (25%), vomiting (24%), cough (21%), dyspnea (21%), and pyrexia (20%).\n\nIn KEYNOTE-407, when KEYTRUDA was administered with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound in metastatic squamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of 101 patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection.

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.\n\nLENVIMA\u00ae (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S.\n\nFor the treatment of adult patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)\n\nIn combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)\n\nIn combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy\n\nFor the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)\n\nIn combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation\n\nSelected Safety Information for LENVIMA\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nHypertension. In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mmHg. In unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC.\n\nSerious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.\n\nCardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\n\nArterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials.\n\nAmong patients receiving LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%).\n\nPermanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.\n\nHepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1,327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.\n\nMonitor liver function prior to initiation, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\n\nRenal Failure or Impairment.

Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\n\nFistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.\n\nQT Interval Prolongation.

In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.\n\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.\n\nHemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.\n\nConsider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\n\nImpairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level \u22640.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients in RCC.\n\nMonitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.\n\nImpaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.\n\nOsteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.\n\nPerform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.\n\nAvoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.\n\nWithhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.\n\nEmbryo\u2010Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (\u226530%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

(NYSE:MRK) stands against Prem Watsa's other long-term stock picks.\n\nPrem Watsa is a Canadian billionaire, entrepreneur, and investor often referred to as the Canadian Warren Buffett for his value-based investment approach and long-term focus. As the founder, chairman, and CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, Watsa has built a reputation for transforming his company into one of the leading insurance and investment firms in the world. His ability to identify undervalued opportunities and navigate financial crises has cemented his place as one of the most respected figures in global finance. Watsa was born in India in 1950 to a middle-class family. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, one of India\u2019s premier institutions. In 1972, Watsa immigrated to Canada to pursue an MBA at the University of Western Ontario\u2019s Richard Ivey School of Business.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAfter completing his MBA, Watsa began his career in the insurance industry, where he gained valuable experience that would later shape his business philosophy and success. In 1985, Watsa acquired control of Markel Financial, a struggling Canadian insurance company. He renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings, short for Fair and Friendly Acquisitions, and set out to implement his vision of combining insurance underwriting with value-oriented investing. Fairfax operates as a holding company, similar to Berkshire Hathaway, with investments spanning insurance, reinsurance, and other businesses. Under Watsa's leadership, Fairfax has grown exponentially.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Fairfax manages over $1 billion in 13F securities. The company has delivered a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15% in book value per share since its founding. Prem Watsa is a staunch proponent of value investing, inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His strategy involves identifying undervalued assets, particularly during times of market distress, and holding them for the long term. Watsa has been a strong advocate of investing in India, acquiring stakes in companies like Thomas Cook India and launching the Fairfax India fund to capitalize on the country\u2019s growth. Watsa famously anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, using derivatives to protect Fairfax\u2019s portfolio and earning over $2 billion in profits during the crash.",

            "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump\u2018s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, is facing scrutiny over his decision to retain financial interests in ongoing litigation against Merck & Co. Inc. MRK concerning its Gardasil vaccine, just ahead of his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Jan. 29.\n\nThe arrangement, disclosed in an ethics agreement and court documents, has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest as Kennedy seeks to lead federal agencies that regulate drugmakers.\n\nCiting the ethics filing, the New York Times writes that Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, will continue receiving fees from cases referred to Wisner Baum, a law firm suing Merck over its Gardasil vaccine. Gardasil is widely administered to adolescents to prevent cervical and other cancers. Over the past two years, Kennedy earned over $2.5 million from these referrals, a sum far exceeding the health secretary's annual salary of approximately $200,000.\n\nMerck reported a decline of 11% in sales of Gardasil to $2.31 billion due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher sales in the U.S., driven by public-sector buying patterns, higher pricing and demand, and higher demand in most international regions.\n\nAlso Read: Trump\u2019s Second Term Sparks Market Jitters With Trade, Regulation, Expansion Plans\n\nKennedy clarified that he is not an attorney in these cases but is entitled to a 10% share of contingency fees.\n\nHe has pledged to divest interests in cases involving federal government programs, such as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, but will retain stakes in other lawsuits if cleared by the HHS ethics office.\n\nThe NY Times adds that critics argue Kennedy's financial ties pose significant ethical concerns. Ethics experts, including Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, and Virginia Canter from State Democracy Defenders Action, noted that Kennedy's role overseeing agencies like the FDA could create a perception of bias, particularly given Merck's presence in the vaccine and pharmaceutical markets. Painter characterized Kennedy's position as potentially \u201cextortionate,\u201d while Canter questioned his ability to act impartially.\n\nLawmakers have expressed mixed reactions. While Senate committees have scheduled confirmation hearings, influential figures, such as Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), voiced reservations about Kennedy's vaccine stance. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized the financial arrangement as a conflict of interest that endangers public health, accusing Kennedy of profiting from promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies, according to The Times.\n\nKennedy has long criticized government and pharmaceutical industry ties, calling for an end to \"regulatory capture.\" However, his history of vaccine opposition, including calls to revoke COVID-19 vaccine approvals and promotion of lawsuits alleging harm from Gardasil, has amplified scrutiny. Merck maintains that Gardasil is safe, citing extensive scientific evidence supporting its efficacy, according to The New York Times.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

After all, it\u2019s our stories, our culture\u2014our connection to each other\u2014that we\u2019ve not only earned over the last half century, but that will keep us here well into and beyond the next.\n\nEven if it\u2019s only for a few seconds, find a little way to connect to each other today, through the shared love of our club. To say, Happy 50th Birthday, Portland Timbers.\n\nPhoto on right: Vic Crowe at Civic Stadium, 1975\n\nJanuary is not just the birth month of the club, but also the first manager to lead us onto the pitch at Civic Stadium (Vic Crowe, January 31) and the one who will do so in our 50th Anniversary Season at Providence Park (Phil Neville, January 21) .\n\nVic Crowe (who managed the Timbers at both ends of our NASL existence, 1975-76; 1980-82) came here to build the game, to connect the new team to the community. And to win soccer games. He arrived just 6 weeks before the team\u2019s first match, to a club with no players signed. When he eventually got a roster, they found quick success. And they shared it with those who supported them on that journey. Crowe once had the players leave a 1975 training session at Civic Stadium to run around the stadium and applaud the fans lined up to buy playoff tickets. By the end of the season, he helped give Portland the game, each other through it, and, of course, \u201cAbsolute Pandemonium.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Craig Mitchelldyer / Portland Timbers\n\nOur current gaffer gets it, too. Take his pre-match speech to the team in the last regular-season match of our 49th year, away up north:\n\n\u201cCourage to play. Courage to fight. Courage to be disciplined. Courage to stick to the plot,\u201d he told the team they\u2019d need to compete on the road in the match that would decide the 2024 Cascadia Cup.\n\n\u201cCourage to show belief in each other,\u201d he continued\u2014advice that applies to us all. \u201cWe win tonight, we build momentum. We have belief.\u201d And then he hit exactly on what that badge means and has meant since 1975:\n\n\u201cAnd we go home with the Cascadia Cup. That\u2019s the most important thing. We\u2019re playing for the fans in the corner [of Lumen Field]\u2014who have come, who have paid, who have sacrificed, who have fought all week to come and support the Portland Timbers. That\u2019s who we play for.\u201d\n\nLook, we nearly weren\u2019t here at all. At the end of the 1974 NASL season, when the league was looking to expand, Oregon Soccer, Inc. saw deadline after deadline to secure franchise confirmation pass. They even missed the 1975 NASL draft.\n\nThe league expanded by 5 franchises for the 1975 season, and the other 4 (Chicago Sting, San Antonio Thunder, Tampa Bay Rowdies, and Hartford Bicentennials) followed a somewhat conventional timeline for preparing an expansion entry, with Portland\u2019s potential omission leaving the league lopsided at 19 teams across 4 divisions.\n\nFor a little added context, this was our only shot with the growing, about-to-get-ridiculous NASL. Pel\u00e9 signed with Cosmos in 1975, and in the following years the league\u2019s new-franchise fee would go up massively. The NASL also stated they would only consider expansion in major television markets moving forward. As each day passed without an announcement, our already-small window for what we have now closed a little more.\n\n[To learn more about this and our first year as a franchise, please read Michael Orr\u2019s The 1975 Portland Timbers: The Birth of Soccer City, USA.]\n\nAnd then it happened:\n\nOn January 23, 1975, from the league offices in New York City, NASL Commissioner Phil Woosnam announced Portland as the 20th league franchise.\n\nThe next day, Don Paul and some others from Oregon Soccer, Inc. addressed the gathered press at the Multnomah Athletic Club to share the good news. He announced \u201cthe new game in town,\u201d stressed the team\u2019s desire to involve the community, and did us a solid by dreaming big: \u201cHopefully, we are here forever,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019re 50 today, and that\u2019s no small thing for a soccer team in North America. I\u2019m looking forward to the coming season, to celebrate this. To celebrate us. I love that who we are today is who we\u2019ve been from Day 1\u2014and that we take that seriously.\n\nWe have to.\n\nWe\u2019re all temporary, and therefore only temporary caretakers of the club and the badge. Yet when we share our stories and keep connecting with each other through this team, through how it\u2019s brought us together, we continue the culture of Soccer City, USA.\n\nAnd we will be here forever.\n\nHappy 50th Birthday, Portland Timbers.\n\n#RCTID",

Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as the next Health and Human Services secretary, he still plans to collect fees from Wisner Baum, a law firm suing Merck over claims that the pharmaceutical company failed to properly warn consumers about risks from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, according to new filings with the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nKennedy will only collect the fees if Wisner Baum wins, and only for cases that aren't against the United States or in which the United States isn't a party and doesn't have \"a direct or substantial interest,\" according to the filings.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Pursuant to the referral agreement, I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy wrote in his signed ethics agreement. \"I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary.\"\n\nThe filings, submitted to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics as part of the confirmation process, detail Kennedy's many financial holdings and interests. If he becomes HHS secretary and continues to collect fees, he would be in a position to potentially profit from vaccine litigation while also regulating drugmakers and exercising authority over federal vaccine policy.\n\n\"RFK Jr's ethics agreement is inadequate because it doesn't address the bias created by his continuing financial interest in the litigation against Merck,\" Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in government ethics wrote to NPR.\n\nNeither a spokeswoman for Kennedy nor the Trump transition team immediately returned repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe documents and their link to the Gardasil vaccine lawsuit were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday, Jan. 29, to consider Kennedy's nomination to run HHS.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn Kennedy's profile page on Wisner Baum's website, he is first identified as \"co-counsel with Wisner Baum in the Gardasil litigation,\" and he has used his platforms on social media and through his nonprofit to promote the suit and his concerns with the vaccine against the human papillomavirus.\n\nHPV is a very common sexually transmitted virus that can cause cancers later in life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends two doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11 to 12 and says it provides safe, effective and lasting protection against HPV infections.\n\nAccording to Kennedy's personal financial disclosure report, he made $856,559 in referral fees from the law firm. That's in addition to $326,056 in salary and benefits he earned from the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, an organization Kennedy chaired and that has been influential in the anti-vaccine movement. The nonprofit has filed nearly 30 federal and state lawsuits since 2020, including some that target the federal agencies he would oversee at HHS. Many of the legal actions taken by CHD challenged vaccines and public health mandates.\n\nThe filing says Kennedy took an unpaid leave of absence from the organization in April 2023, when he declared his run for the presidency, and that he resigned from CHD effective December 2024.\n\nThe filing also shows Kennedy declared a $8,848,402 share of partnership profits from the law firm Kennedy and Madonna, LLP, which has been renamed Madonna and Madonna, LLP. The filing says he received his \"final partnership payout in May 2024.\" He also made money from another law firm, publishing and various other fees for speaking and endorsements.\n\nEdited by Scott Hensley and Jane Greenhalgh",

That sum is far higher than about $200,000, the latest salary figure for the health and human services secretary, according to a former agency spokesman.\n\n\u201cI am entitled to receive 10 percent of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said in the ethics filing. He wrote that he is not a lawyer in any of the cases.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other large-cap value stocks.\n\nWhy is this Portfolio Manager Cautiously Optimistic?\n\nThe market outlook is as uncertain as it gets. On January 18, Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, appeared in an interview on Wealth at Yahoo Finance to share his market outlook, which happens to be rather optimistic or \"cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nPavlik shared that as the new administration takes over he is optimistic about how the market will play out in the near future. He added that the new government is expected to do some deregulation and cut corporate taxes, which are supposedly going to boost earnings despite inflation being a concern. He also explained why he was cautious earlier. He stated that the easing cycle was more uncertain and the new government was emphasizing tariffs earlier, however, as time has passed, Pavlik has grown to become more optimistic about the market.\n\nHe also expects the economy to grow, suggesting that the US is nowhere near a recession. In addition to that, Pavlik is confident that valuations are expected to ease, tariffs seem to be a \"bargaining chip,\" and mass deportations are \"not going to happen.\" In addition to that, he believes new energy policies to lower the price of oil and gas, resulting in lower costs incurred by firms across nearly every industry.\n\nBy the middle of 2025, Pavlik expects the Fed to be back issuing multiple rate cuts. Overall, he expects 2025 to be a solid year for equities, with expectations of the S&P 500 reaching 6,750, representing a 13-14% growth from January 18, 2025. While he agrees that in the near term, especially in the first 100 days of the new government, there are reasons to be slightly cautious, he remains confident that the new policies will work out as the market goes forward.\n\nSpeaking of inflation, Pavlik reiterated that the new energy policies will definitely push oil companies to produce more oil as a result of cost reductions. These cost reductions are expected to have a multiplier effect on grocery companies which will ultimately cater to inflationary pressures, added the portfolio manager. This coupled with his expectation of the Fed returning to its planned easing cycle will likely fuel shared investor sentiment and consumer confidence.\n\nWhile the first 100 days of the new administration may be uncertain and volatile, there are some stocks known to have been stable through rough or smooth market conditions. That said, let's take a look at the 15 best large-cap value stocks to buy in 2025.",

Kennedy Jr. would retain legal fees earned from litigation against drugmaker Merck if he is confirmed as President Donald Trump's secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a federal ethics disclosure made public on Wednesday.\n\nKennedy, who ended his own presidential campaign last year to endorse Trump, is set for a U.S. Senate hearing on his nomination next week. As HHS secretary, Kennedy would wield enormous influence over the pharma industry, and the nomination is opposed by several health and consumer organizations over Kennedy's role in sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n\nReuters reported last week that Kennedy played an instrumental role in organizing mass litigation against Merck over its human papillomavirus shot Gardasil. One of the main lawyers suing Merck, Michael Baum, told Reuters that Kennedy \"taught us\" how to pursue Gardasil claims outside a special government-run vaccine compensation program that limits pharma company liability.\n\nKennedy has an arrangement to earn 10 percent of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to Baum's firm WisnerBaum, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics official released on Wednesday. If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.\n\nKennedy and Baum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Merck declined to comment.\n\nHigh-level U.S. government officials routinely disclose financial interests and potential conflicts during the nomination process.\n\nKennedy wrote that he is \"not an attorney of record\" for his WisnerBaum cases. However, Kennedy filed official court appearances in several Gardasil cases, including one set for trial in Los Angeles this week, court dockets show. As of Wednesday, Kennedy had not appeared to have withdrawn from them.\n\nIn a separate ethics disclosure, Kennedy reported at least $857,000 from WisnerBaum, and did not specify which cases generated that income. Kennedy has collaborated with WisnerBaum on litigation over Monsanto's weed killer Roundup.\n\nThe Gardasil lawsuits allege Merck had fraudulently advertised the vaccine as safe, overstating its benefits while concealing knowledge of dangerous side effects. Merck says the cases have no merit and that research supports the safety of its HPV vaccines.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Mike Spector in New York)",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won\u2019t rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar\u2019s director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that\u2019s partially because of the relative underperformance that they\u2019ve had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they\u2019re becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\u201d\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management\u2019s confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 26.6%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American pharmaceutical company that offers innovative health solutions to its consumers. The company is making notable progress in diversifying its pipeline. Initially, it anticipated $35 billion in additional revenue from its new drug portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but that estimate has now risen to $50 billion. This increase is largely fueled by a substantial expansion in its clinical trials, with 26 phase III trials currently underway, up from nine in 2021. Some of these trials could yield blockbuster drugs, particularly in the area of HIV treatments. Merck has also collaborated with Gilead Sciences on a combination therapy that holds the potential to transform HIV treatment.\n\nIn addition, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has solidified its reputation as a frontrunner in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its flagship cancer drug, Keytruda, transforming treatment approaches and significantly boosting revenue. The company\u2019s strong market position ensures substantial cash flow, which is used to deliver returns to shareholders. In the latest quarter, Keytruda\u2019s sales grew by 17% year-over-year, reaching $7.4 billion.\n\nThis performance was also highlighted in GreensKeeper Asset Management\u2019s Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm shared:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the best stocks with steady dividends as the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 14 years. Its quarterly dividend currently sits at $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.36%, as of January 20.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was included in 86 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these funds are worth over $7.1 billion in total. With over 14.6 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Merck stock (NYSE: MRK) lost about 10% in 2024, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which gained 23% for the year. Despite strong performances from other pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly stock (up 31%) and AbbVie stock (up 15%), Merck\u2019s stock performance has been muted. This is attributed to declining sales of its blockbuster HPV vaccine \u2013 Gardasil \u2013 and an increased competition for some of its drugs, including Januvia.\n\nIn this note, while we briefly touch upon Merck\u2019s performance in 2024, we focus on the impact on MRK stock and how 2025 could turn out. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nHow Did 2024 Turn Out For Merck?\n\nThree trends were clearly visible for Merck in 2024. Firstly, the cash cow \u2013 Keytruda \u2013 continued to gain market share with approval in more indications. Keytruda\u2019s last twelve-month sales now stand at a whopping $28 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2023. Secondly, the next best-selling product \u2013 Gardasil \u2013 faced headwinds in China, resulting in its sales falling in the recent quarters. The last-twelve month period sales of $9 billion align with the figure reported in 2023. This comes after a stellar 31.5% annual average growth rate Gardasil posted in the last three years. A crackdown on the healthcare industry in China has impacted on the overall vaccination rate in China. Lastly, it saw an improvement in gross margins, thanks to lower royalty rates for Keytruda and Gardasil.\n\n2024 was also the year where Merck looked at inorganic growth to expand its pharmaceuticals and animal health business. It acquired Elanco\u2019s aqua business for $1.3 billion, Harpoon Therapeutics for $680 million, LaNova Medicines for $588 million, Curon for $750 million, and EyeBio for $1.3 billion, among others. Merck may continue to eye inorganic growth to combat with the fall in sales, when Keytruda sees biosimilar competition (likely in 2029). It will be a massive gap to bridge, given that Keytruda is one of the top-selling drugs globally.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For MRK Stock?\n\nMRK stock declined gradually from levels of $110 in early January last year to $99 by the end of 2024. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in MRK stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 2% in 2021, 49% in 2022, 1% in 2023, and -6% in 2024.\n\nThe Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Merck\u2019s Valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 30% upside from its current market price of $100. At its current levels, MRK stock is trading at 4x trailing revenues, compared to the stock\u2019s average P/S ratio of 4.5x over the last three years.\n\nWhat\u2019s In Store For Merck In 2025?\n\n2025 is likely going to be better for Merck. Keytruda is expected to continue to lead the growth, with its approval for more indications lately. However, Gardasil\u2019s decline in China may continue to weigh on the company\u2019s vaccine sales in 2025. Merck\u2019s diabetes drugs \u2013 Januvia and Janumet \u2013 are likely to see increased competition. The company\u2019s animal health business is likely to benefit from increased pet ownership in the U.S. We expect the company to maintain its higher gross margins on the back of better product mix.\n\nMerck may also secure the regulatory approval for clesrovimab \u2013 an antibody for RSV treatment in infants. If approved, clesrovimab has the potential to garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. The U.S. FDA has set a deadline of June 10 to make a decision on approval of clesrovimab.\n\nOverall, MRK stock looks like it will have more positives to aid it in 2025. With its stock trading at 4x trailing revenues, we think the potential headwinds for Gardasil are largely priced in.\n\nWhile MRK stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Merck\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Merck Group was founded in 1668 when Friedrick Jacob Merck purchased a pharmacy in Darmstadt, Germany. The company transformed from a pharmacy into a drug manufacturer in 1827 with the commercialization of morphine and the perfection of the manufacturing process. The company will later gain recognition for isolating and commercializing the manufacture of cocaine as well.\n\nMerck Group sent Theodore Weicker to New York as its representative in 1889 and he quickly began to set up operations. The original investment of $200,000 resulted in a facility in lower Manhattan and the addition of Merck family member George Merck to the project. They began operations in 1891 and were in business as the US branch of Merck Group until 1917 and the onset of World War I.\n\nWorld War I brought about the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the nationalization of Merck Group\u2019s US operations. Those operations were repurchased at a government auction only 2 years later with the help of Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, but the split was done. The company retained rights to the Merck name in the US but remained independent. One of many noteworthy achievements in the post-War period is the discovery of streptomycin, which was revolutionary in treating tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1953 the company merged with Sharp& Dohme to form the then 2nd largest US drug manufacturer. The merger brought smallpox vaccines to the portfolio and opened a new avenue of research for the business. Since then, advancements in vaccine technology include treatments for mumps and chickenpox. Other notable advancements include the discovery of statins as a cholesterol inhibitor and work in veterinary medicine.\n\nToday, Merck & Co operates through 2 segments and under 2 different names with a headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ. The company operates as Merck & Co in the US and as Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the US and Canada. The 2 segments are Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. Revenue topped $49 billion in 2022 and employed more than 68,000 people. The company has 8 research facilities near major university systems, including 7 in the US and 1 in the UK. As of 2022, the company had 82 pipeline products in Phase 2 trials, 30 in Phase 3 trials and 3 under review.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical segment researches discover and commercializes human health products in several areas of medicine. These include but are not limited to oncology, acute care, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular, and diabetes. This segment has 6 blockbuster drugs as of late 2022, with each generating more than $1 billion in revenue. The leading treatments are Keytruda for treating cancer-related immune conditions, Gardisil which is a vaccine for HPV and Januvia for treating Type-II diabetes.

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Serum-free Media Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Solution, By Product, By Application, By End-use, By Type, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global serum-free media market size is expected to reach USD 4.05 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 13.7% from 2025 to 2030. The rising prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases, coupled with the growing focus on cell-based therapeutics, is increasing the market's growth prospects. In addition, growing funding for the cell-based research is the key factor driving the serum-free media market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of serum-free media has increased considerably during the past 15 years. This is mainly true in industrial applications, wherein the use of serum during the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals poses a risk to safety and a source of unwanted contamination. Moreover, Serum-free cell culture media improves the experimental constancy by reducing the number of unknown culture components and the effects of unknown growth factors, hormones, and vitamins.\n\n\n\nIn addition, serum-free media has numerous advantages, such as reducing the cost and inconvenience of batch testing sera, eliminating the uncertainty about global supply fluctuations, and simplifying downstream processing and purification, another major factor driving the market growth.\n\n\n\nAlthough CAR T-cell therapies have made breakthroughs in treating hematological malignancies, their accessibility to patients is constrained by the complexity and expense of their manufacturing. Beyond the effectiveness of your CAR-T product, one difficulty in CAR T-cell production is achieving constant growth of T cells made available following gene transfer. Therefore, optimizing the media to stimulate T-cell proliferation is one of the most important factors.\n\n\n\nYet, creating media that permits constant growth while meeting regulatory quality criteria has proven challenging. However, new developments in cell culture techniques have enhanced output and functionality in CAR T-cell workflows utilizing serum-free media, enabling the construction of large-scale regulatory-compliant processes capable of producing billions of T cells quickly.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the Vero cell line, which was derived from the kidney of an African green monkey, has been widely applied to the production of viral vaccines. Moreover, it has been utilized to manufacture several SARS-CoV variants. For instance, Lonza Bioscience's ProVeroTM1 Serum-free Medium is a protein-free non-animal origin medium intended to support the development of Vero cells and MDCK. In addition, HEKin1, manufactured by HiMedia Labs, was used to manufacture COVISHIELD, a COVID-19 vaccine containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. This vaccine has been manufactured using genetically modified HEK293 cells.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the slow growth rate of SFM as compared to the serum media, and the requirement of different cell types to prepare specific media formulations and cell clumping when passaging can be the restraining factors.\n\n\n\nSerum-free Media Market Report Highlights\n\nBased on product, CHO media dominated the market and accounted for a share of 30.9% in 2024, driven by their essential role in biopharmaceutical production.\n\nBased on application, biopharmaceutical production led the market with a revenue share of 73.7% in 2024, owing to the need for efficient, consistent cell culture systems in drug development.\n\nBased on end-use, pharmaceutical & biotechnology companies held the largest revenue share of 57.9% in 2024. These companies need serum-free media to maintain a controlled, defined environment for cell culture, thereby enhancing product quality and consistency.\n\nBased on type, liquid media dominated the market with a revenue share of 63.1% in 2024, attributed to their significant advantages in cell culture applications.\n\nNorth America serum-free media market dominated the global market with a revenue share of 38.6% in 2024. North America features a robust healthcare infrastructure, substantial biopharmaceutical investments, and a concentration of industry leaders.\n\nAsia Pacific serum-free media market is expected to register the fastest CAGR of 16.9% over the forecast period. Countries in the region prioritize developing innovative therapies and vaccines to tackle escalating healthcare challenges, including chronic diseases.\n\nThis report addresses:\n\nMarket intelligence to enable effective decision-making\n\nMarket estimates and forecasts from 2018 to 2030\n\nGrowth opportunities and trend analyses\n\nSegment and regional revenue forecasts for market assessment\n\nCompetition strategy and market share analysis\n\nProduct innovation listing for you to stay ahead of the curve\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 100 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.9 billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $4.05 billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 13.7% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corporation (c), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), as well as two micro-cap stocks CSP Inc. (CSPI) and AMCON Distributing Company (DIT). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nGlobal Weeky Ahead\n\nDiscusses the key market moving developments this week. A New U.S. Presidency Begins: Global Week Ahead\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhile no earnings releases are scheduled for today on account of the MLK Day holiday, the rest of this week will see more than 100 companies report Q4 results, including 36 S&P 500 members. With results from 42 S&P 500 as of Friday, January 17th, we will have seen results from roughly 15% of the index's membership by the end of this week.\n\nTotal earnings for the 42 index members that have reported results already are up +21.8% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues, with 81% beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThis is a notably better showing from this group of 42 index members relative to what we have seen from this same group in other recent periods, particularly on the growth front.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 42 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.5% on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nFeatured Analyst Reports\n\nChevron shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past six months (+8.1% vs. +0.8%). The company is a fully integrated energy firm, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\n\n\n\nFurther, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil price fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\n\n\n\nAnother concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-17.2% vs. -3.4%). The company is facing generic competition for several drugs, rising competitive pressure on diabetes franchise and declining Gardasil sales in China may hurt the top line. There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity in 2028.\n\n\n\nEstimates have declined ahead of Q4 results. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarter. Nevertheless, Blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving Merck\u2019s sales.\n\n\n\nWith continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline and is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\n\n\nQUALCOMM shares have gained +13.2% over the past year against the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry\u2019s gain of +28.3%. The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge. With the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile.\n\n\n\nQualcomm received a favorable verdict in a legal dispute against Arm Holdings, allowing the company to continue developing high-performing, best-in-class products based on Oryon ARM-compliant custom CPUs.\n\n\n\nHowever, it faces stiff competition in the mobile phone chipset market. The majority of its customers include Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential, owing to strained bilateral trade relationships with the United States. The high debt burden is a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of CSP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+45.1% vs. +2.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $160.59 million have ended fiscal 2024 with $30.6 million in cash, up from $25.2 million, enabling growth investments like AZT PROTECT and high-margin services while maintaining a debt-free balance sheet.\n\n\n\nRecurring revenue rose to 17% of sales, driven by managed services and cloud solutions. AZT PROTECT gains traction via Rockwell partnerships and major contracts, enhancing cybersecurity market positioning. Niche expansions in cruise and freightliner markets diversify revenue. Strategic shifts to high-margin offerings improve profitability, supported by partnerships and industry awards.\n\n\n\nHowever, CSP posted a $1.9 million operating loss, with rising SG&A costs and dependence on key customers adding revenue volatility. HPP segment revenue fell 40%, hurt by legacy product phase-outs. Scaling new products demands heavy investment, pressuring near-term results.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)\n\n\n\nAMCON Distributing\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (-39.5% vs. +68.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $81.41 million have reliance on declining cigarette sales, rising costs, regulatory risks and competitive pressures pose challenges. With $121.3 million in debt and increasing interest expenses, AMCON must navigate cost pressures to sustain growth.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, AMCON's strategic acquisitions, including Arrowrock Supply, have expanded its distribution network to 14 centers across 34 states, enhancing reach to 8,000 retail locations and driving economies of scale, operational synergies, and revenue diversification.\n\n\n\nFiscal 2024 wholesale revenue rose $171.6 million, driven by acquisitions and growth in alternative tobacco, confectionery, and foodservice categories. Its health and wellness retail segment benefits from rising demand for natural products, achieving a gross margin of 36.7% in fiscal 2024. Investments in logistics, including new facilities in Colorado and Missouri, bolster operational efficiency.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on AMCON Distributing here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Deere & Company (DE), Synopsys, Inc.

The initiative combines educational modules with small-group discussions, allowing participants to learn and exchange ideas with peers, enhancing their sense of community and belonging, which can be scarce in the isolating equine field. Unlike traditional programs that focus solely on technical skills, LegUp emphasises personal development, covering topics like practice culture, communication, and personal finance. This holistic approach equips staff with tools to elevate their roles in practice operations and personal life, promoting well-rounded growth.\n\nMerck Animal Health\u2019s LegUp Program offers a fresh take on empowering equine veterinary support staff, combining skill-building with personal development. By prioritising community and addressing real-world challenges, it prepares participants to thrive in their careers and personal pursuits, setting a new standard in the industry. As the program garners positive feedback, it underscores Merck\u2019s commitment to nurturing the backbone of equine practices and fostering a brighter future for veterinary teams.\n\nFor the latest updates and in-depth insights into the world of Animal Health, including breakthrough treatments, industry trends, and regulatory news, contact Poppy Hodge today!",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently emphasized the importance of long-term investing, urging investors to focus on the growth prospects of certain pharmaceutical stocks while also answering callers\u2019 questions about certain stocks. Cramer acknowledged that stocks often experience cyclical trends, with some sectors falling out of favor temporarily.\n\n\u201cLook, stocks go in and out of style in the Wall Street fashion show. Whole sectors wallow at times. Right now, healthcare\u2019s in some sort of doghouse the likes of which I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks\n\nDespite the industry\u2019s struggles, Cramer reflected on his observations at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, where he saw many pharmaceutical companies that he believes are not being properly valued by Wall Street. While the present outlook for these companies may not be particularly stellar, he highlighted the strong and lucrative long-term potential they offer.\n\n\u201cWhy am I so willing to focus on the so-called out years? Because the long-term possibilities for these companies, frankly, they're incredible and by the way, incredibly lucrative too, even as the present is good, but not great.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the ongoing progress in the healthcare sector, particularly with GLP-1 drugs, which have the potential to treat more conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss. Additionally, companies are working on developing oral versions of these treatments, which could offer patients more convenient options. Beyond GLP-1 drugs, healthcare companies are expanding their portfolios with new cancer therapies, treatments for eye care and asthma, and experimental drugs for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: Ask yourself what happens if things get better, please. What if the future is brighter than the past? If that\u2019s the case, and I think it is, then you\u2019ll have a lot of winners with these drug and medical device plays.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Top Wall Street Analyst Says Dump The Magnificent 7 And Go All In On These Three Big Pharma Dividend Stocks\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\n2024 was a great year for investors whose portfolios included Magnificent Seven stocks. Big Tech's runaway growth created gains, but headwinds are forming and some observers doubt the Mag Seven can sustain its momentum in 2025. With that in mind, Miramar Capital analysts believe it might be time to replace the big-tech-heavy Magnificent Seven with these three biotech shares that have growth potential and pay dividends.\n\nMuch of the momentum Big Tech generated in 2024 was AI-related. Almost all the Magnificent Seven companies are heavily invested in their own AI projects and developing AI's capabilities even further. The drive to create the best AI pushed Nvidia's shares and market cap so high that it became a Magnificent Seven member in 2024. However, Big Tech's continued growth depends heavily on continued access to chips and other components made in China.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe incoming Trump Administration has made no secret of its plans to levy a heavy tariff on Chinese-made chips and tech products. That means expenses will likely rise sharply for any Magnificent Seven company that's invested in developing AI, which is all of them. Those higher expenses will likely mean higher consumer prices and lower profits for the Magnificent Seven, which explains why analysts see a potential slowdown on the horizon.\n\nBiotech stocks, by contrast, had a more challenging 2024, but they may be set to bounce back and win for investors this year. Here are Miramar Capital\u2019s favorites:\n\nMerck (NYSE MRK)\n\nMerck is one of the world's best-known suppliers of vaccines, medical treatments and veterinary products. The company's stock seesawed for much of last year and hit a high of $134.64 in June before tumbling to $94.48 in November. Analysts attributed the drop to the company lowering its full-year earnings per share estimates by $0.24 to pay for partnerships with Curon Biopharmaceutical and Daiichi Sankyo.\n\nThey also noted that sales of one of Merck's top products, Gardasil, declined in the lucrative Chinese market. However, the $0.24 write-down was a one-time charge and sales of other Merck products like Keytruda, Winrevair and Capvaxie remain brisk. This is why analysts believe Merck has a real upside in 2025 and it could be a value at the current $99.85 share price.",

            "content": "Waller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK ) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen asked about the exact timing of potential rate cuts, Waller indicated that much depends on the continued improvement in inflation data. He stressed that the Fed is not in a rush to act, as Chair Jerome Powell has stated, and that they need to see more progress on inflation before making any decisions. Waller mentioned that while March is not entirely ruled out, any significant economic disruptions could push the timeline back. Regarding the number of rate cuts that might be expected this year, Waller reiterated that the data will drive the Fed\u2019s decisions. He noted that the extent of progress on inflation and the perception of the neutral rate among policymakers will influence the number of cuts.\n\nThe latest consumer price data has sparked optimism among investors, as easing inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts create a more favorable environment for businesses and markets.\n\nIs Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Cheap Stock to Buy for 2025?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 best cheap stocks to buy for 2025, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 15 as of January 15. We then used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank 15 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of January 15: 10.33\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 86\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a leading global pharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing, and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines to improve human and animal health. The company has consistently been at the forefront of medical advancements, addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing health challenges.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is developing an oral PCSK9 inhibitor, enlicitide, which is positioned as the most potent oral LDL-lowering medicine. This medicine aims to become a cost-effective oral solution to address the significant unmet need for LDL-lowering therapies. In the obesity market, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is focusing on specific subpopulations at risk of MASH and requiring significant weight loss. The company is also developing an oral GLP-1, efinopegdutide, which is expected to read out in Phase II. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to address significant unmet needs in these markets and to bring novel, cost-effective solutions to patients.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has made significant strides in expanding its late-stage development pipeline, nearly tripling the number of assets from 9 in 2021 to 26 in 2024. This growth is not only in quantity but also in diversity, with a focus on oncology, cardiometabolic diseases, immunology, vaccines, and ophthalmology. The company has also made substantial investments through business development, spending nearly $40 billion over the last 3.5 years to bring in new assets. A notable example is the recent acquisition of EyeBio, which brings a new mechanism of action for treating wet AMD and diabetic macular edema, a condition with significant unmet need.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 6th on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Merck (MRK) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMerck is expected to post earnings of $1.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5,766.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.70 points to a change of +409.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.44 indicates a change of +22.6% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.",

The market growth is fueled by a broad range of applications in molecular diagnostic techniques and their associated enzymes for IVD. Proteinase K can be utilized as a supplement in PCR and NGS. Increasing applications of NGS in personalized medicine along with various clinically developed therapies are likely to favor the market for proteinase K. Gene expression profiling and targeted panels via qPCR remain the two most frequent uses for NGS sequences in a pathology lab. In addition, a decline in the price of NGS sequencing has expanded the use of NSC technologies. Therefore, the growing demand for NGS diagnostic techniques is expected to boost the market growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the rising adoption of cell separation procedures is one of the major factors contributing to the market growth. Companies have initiated building sustainable technologies to gain a competitive edge in the market. For instance, in April 2022, Levitas Bio introduced the next generation of its existing platform for cell separation. The new version is expected to assist researchers in scaling their experiments up to 16X and process around 40 million cells per run.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the usage of POC-based diagnostics is increasing significantly globally. Public awareness campaigns aimed at identifying the symptoms of infectious diseases and ways to prevent them play an important role in controlling disease transmission. Thus, increased patient attention has led to a rise in demand for POC. For instance, in May 2020, a study on POC testing for COVID-19 through Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) diagnostics was published. The researchers used QuickExtract by Lucigen, which contains Proteinase K. Thus, the growing demand for POC diagnostics and the utility of proteinase K in POC diagnostic tests are expected to fuel market growth.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, growing applications of proteinase K in molecular biology and other fields are expected to create lucrative opportunities in the near future. Proteinase K is used in the food and beverage industry to maintain quality standards. Food manufacturers work to maintain the quality of raw materials used for manufacturing. In addition, proteinase K is used for cell lysis during DNA extraction from processed foods. The enzyme also finds application in a wide range of molecular biology assays. Hence, such applications of proteinase K are anticipated to drive the market during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nProteinase K Market Report Highlights\n\nBy form, the powder segment accounted for a dominant share in 2024. Advantages of powder form include long shelf-life, inexpensive shipment, and high stability. Thus, such advantages are expected to increase the adoption of powder\n\nBy therapeutic area, the infectious diseases segment captured the largest share in 2024. Presence of proteinase K in the rapid molecule testing along with increasing incidence of infectious diseases in low- to mid-income countries is anticipated to encourage players to develop products that are easy to operate in a low-resource setting. This is, in turn, accelerating the market growth\n\nBy application, the isolation and purification of genomic DNA and RNA segment held the largest share in 2024. With the emerging need for personalized treatment in cancer and rare diseases, the demand for DNA or RNA isolation is anticipated to witness upward trends and similar trends will be reflected in the market\n\nBy end-use, biotechnology companies held a leading revenue share in 2024. This is due to an increase in the application of In Situ Hybridization (ISH) techniques to support clinical and preclinical studies for biotechnology companies\n\nAsia Pacific is projected to grow considerably in the future owing to increasing applications of sequencing technology, coupled with various government initiatives to promote genomics research.\n\nThis report addresses:\n\nMarket intelligence to enable effective decision-making\n\nMarket estimates and forecasts from 2018 to 2030\n\nGrowth opportunities and trend analyses\n\nSegment and regional revenue forecasts for market assessment\n\nCompetition strategy and market share analysis\n\nProduct innovation listing for you to stay ahead of the curve\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 150 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $4.78 billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $7.84 billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.5% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

            "content": "The Intelligent Age will change how people live and work, as well as how products are developed and made, making digital skills training essential.\n\nWhile people shouldn\u2019t be afraid of new technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) they should be concerned about being left behind when it comes to upskilling for digital transformation.\n\nBusiness leaders can take four steps to create a future-ready workforce and build a reputation for trustworthiness when wielding new technology like AI.\n\nThe recent arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) and our growing ability to harness the power of data and digital technology has propelled our world from the Industrial Age into a new Intelligent Age.\n\nThis new epoch will be unlike any other in history. By bringing together our physical, biological and digital realities, the Intelligent Age will fundamentally alter how people live and work, and how products are developed and made. It will affect the skillsets employees in many professions require, while redefining how private and public organizations collaborate.\n\nIt would be a mistake to think that this Intelligent Age is only about changes sparked by AI, however. AI will only ever be as good as the data foundation and technologies that feed it and the skills of the people who wield it. The Intelligent Age will instead be defined by the convergence of human, artificial and other fields of intelligence to solve complex problems and create value with unprecedented speed and efficiency.\n\nTo successfully operate at these unique convergence points, future leaders must combine a broad mix of knowledge, technologies and partners from across multiple markets, regions or scientific disciplines. In particular, for industries focused on the development, manufacture and supply of complex products such as medicines, biotechnologies and semiconductors, the leaders will be those standing at the crossroads between three fields of intelligence:\n\nHuman intelligence , which enables original thinking and ethical decision-making in complex scenarios.\n\nArtificial intelligence , which provides unparalleled data processing capabilities and predictive analytics.\n\nMaterials intelligence, which ensures that innovations are practical, scalable and sustainable.\n\nThis convergence of human creativity, computational power and advanced materials science will help foster innovation and promote sustainable development in an increasingly interconnected world.\n\nMultidisciplinary collaboration on AI development\n\nConsider the future evolution of AI itself. A new generation of semiconductors that are much faster, more compact and more energy-efficient will be required to power AI over the coming decades. These semiconductors for AI will be dependent upon many significant breakthroughs in materials science. Under long-term collaborations between semiconductor manufacturers and preferred material suppliers, multidisciplinary teams of trusted experts are already collaborating to build and execute the technology roadmaps that will underpin the future of AI.\n\nThe same multidisciplinary approach will be required to make the global healthcare industry more predictive, personalized and precise. Across many disease areas, we are now witnessing an increasing convergence of AI for data analysis and prediction, human intelligence for clinical insights and patient empathy and materials intelligence to bring novel drug modalities and delivery technologies to market.\n\nTrust-based leadership in the Intelligent Age\n\nTo build resilience in the Intelligent Age, organizations must become masters of diversity, bringing together the right mix of industry and regional expertise, partners and people. But perhaps most of all, they must be able to earn the trust of the customers, patients and communities they serve.\n\nOur world is becoming more fragmented with change, complexity and uncertainty surrounding us all. People are increasingly motivated to make their purchasing or voting decisions based upon who feel they can trust the most. However, levels of public trust in political and media institutions are declining while scientists and CEOs are now among the most trusted members of society.\n\nAI and data ecosystems will not gain widespread acceptance unless consumers can trust they are being responsibly developed and deployed. To earn this trust, organizations and their leaders must be guided by a clear moral compass and operate with transparency and accountability.\n\nTo develop trust-based leadership and thrive in this new world, business leaders should consider four key actions when creating and deploying AI tools:\n\n1. Diversification across industries\n\nMerck has established global positions across three markets \u2013 life sciences, healthcare and electronics \u2013 which we believe hold significant potential to be positively transformed by AI and data. By developing a multi-industry business model and broad materials intelligence, it\u2019s possible to innovate both within and across markets. This can pioneer new growth fields.\n\n2. Diversification across regions\n\nMerck is also well-established across all key regions where AI and data-driven innovations are happening today, including the US, Asia-Pacific and Europe. By investing heavily in local talent development and supply chain security across each region, business leaders can help to reduce operating risk and fuel growth, while increasing local proximity and responsiveness to their customers.\n\n3. Diversification across partners\n\nThe growing multidisciplinary nature of science means companies like Merck must operate within a global network of industry peers and entrepreneurs under an \u201copen innovation\u201d model. We also collaborate with a broad mix of multilateral partners to create space at the local, regional and global levels for investment and to stimulate fair competition. The ability to align various stakeholders behind shared values and common goals will be increasingly vital for success in the Intelligent Age.\n\n4. Diversification of (data-literate) teams\n\nBusiness leaders must create a robust data culture within organizations so global teams feel empowered \u2013 rather than threatened \u2013 by AI. While people should have nothing to fear from AI, they should be concerned about others learning to harness the power of AI better than themselves.\n\nSkills-powered organizations in the Intelligent Age must give employees access to data and AI ecosystems, Generative AI tools and upskilling platforms. This will not only help them to develop themselves, but also to collaborate to find real-world solutions to real-world problems.\n\nTrust-based leadership on AI is crucial. As a science and business leader that has been family-owned for 13 generations, Merck has been fortunate to accumulate a level of trust over the centuries that is priceless. By sparking discoveries to elevate humanity, we\u2019re choosing to invest this earned trust wisely.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMerck faces headwinds like declining sales of the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, and diabetes drug, Januvia.\n\nMerck faces broader industry pressure as vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. possibly next HHS secretary.\n\nMerck's shares have lost 15.3% in the past year compared with a decline of 3.9% for the industry.\n\nMerck MRK stock has declined 8.8% in the past three months. Merck faces its share of headwinds like declining sales of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil, and diabetes drug, Januvia, and the upcoming loss of exclusivity blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda. However, a lot of this price decline is due to the poor performance of the overall drug and biotech sector in the past couple of months after Trump picked Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to be the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the FDA.\n\nThis, coupled with disappointing third-quarter sales and profits, guidance cuts and pipeline setbacks, affected the overall performance of the drug and biotech industry.\n\nThe decline in Merck\u2019s stock price and the drug/biotech sector\u2019s downturn have left investors confused about whether to buy, hold or sell MRK stock. Let\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play Merck\u2019s stock.\n\nKeytruda: Merck\u2019s Biggest Strength\n\nMerck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor Keytruda being the key top-line driver. Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounts for around 50% of the company\u2019s pharmaceutical sales. The drug has played an instrumental role in driving Merck\u2019s steady revenue growth in the past few years.\n\nKeytruda\u2019s sales are gaining from rapid uptake across earlier-stage indications, mainly early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Continued strong momentum in metastatic indications is also boosting sales growth. The company expects continued growth from Keytruda, particularly in early lung cancer.\n\nMerck is working on different strategies to drive Keytruda's long-term growth. These include innovative immuno-oncology combinations, including Keytruda with TIGIT, LAG3 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. In partnership with Moderna MRNA, Merck is developing a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine (V940/mRNA-4157), in combination with Keytruda, for treating adjuvant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Merck is also developing a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda that can extend its patent life.\n\nMRK\u2019s Keytruda Faces Patent Expiration in 2028\n\nMerck is heavily reliant on Keytruda. Though Keytruda may be Merck\u2019s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that the company is excessively dependent on the drug and should look for ways to diversify its product lineup.\n\nThere are rising concerns about the firm\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of the upcoming loss of exclusivity of Keytruda in 2028.\n\nAlso, competitive pressure might increase for Keytruda in the near future. In 2024, Summit Therapeutics SMMT reported positive data from a phase III study (conducted in China by partner Akeso) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, in which its lead pipeline candidate, ivonescimab, a dual PD-1 and VEGF inhibitor, outperformed Keytruda. Summit believes iivonescimab has the potential to replace Keytruda as the next standard of care across multiple NSCLC settings.\n\nMRK\u2019s Pipeline Progress & Strategic M&A Deals\n\nMerck made meaningful regulatory and clinical progress in 2024 across areas like oncology (mainly Keytruda), vaccines and infectious diseases while executing strategic business moves like the acquisitions of Eyebiotech Limited, Harpoon Therapeutics and Elanco\u2019s aqua business. It also expanded its existing cancer deal with Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo and signed a collaboration with Exelixis EXEL to advance the development of the latter\u2019s cancer candidate, zanzalintinib.\n\nMerck's phase III pipeline has almost tripled over the past three years, positioning it to launch several new vaccines and drugs over the next five years, with many having blockbuster potential. Merck\u2019s new 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Capvaxive, and pulmonary arterial hypertension drug, Winrevair, have the potential to generate significant revenues for Merck over the long term. Both products are witnessing a strong launch.\n\nMerck has other promising candidates in its late-stage pipeline, such as MK-0616, an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, tulisokibart, a TL1A inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Daiichi-Sankyo-partnered antibody drug conjugates.\n\nDeclining Sales of Gardasil in China\n\nSales of Merck\u2019s second-largest product, its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, are declining in China due to a significant step down in shipments to Merck\u2019s distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei. Merck expects a decline in China shipments in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025. Though the company is working to increase promotional resources and patient education efforts to increase demand, it will take time. However, Gardasil sales remain strong in almost every major region outside China, including the United States. Merck is also seeing weakness in the diabetes franchise and the generic erosion of some drugs.\n\nMRK Stock Price, Valuation & Estimates\n\nMerck\u2019s shares have lost 15.3% in the past year compared witha decline of 3.9% for the industry. The stock has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 Index, as seen in the chart below. The stock is also trading below its 200-day moving average.\n\nMerck Stock Underperforms Industry, Sector & S&P 500\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Merck appears attractive relative to the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company\u2019s shares currently trade at 10.56 forward earnings, lower than 15.47 for the industry as well as its 5-year mean of 13.30.\n\nMRK Stock Valuation\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $9.57 to $9.44 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nMRK Estimate Movement\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLong-Term Investors May Stay Invested in MRK Stock\n\nThough Merck\u2019s problems are many, the company has one of the world\u2019s best-selling drugs in its portfolio, generating billions of dollars in revenues. Though Keytruda will lose patent exclusivity in 2028, its sales are expected to remain strong until then. Though Merck does not have any new product or pipeline candidate that can replace Keytruda\u2019s sales when it loses patent protection, it has $14.6 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which it can use to buy companies with promising R&D programs.\n\nIn 2025, Merck expects to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth, almost the same as its expectations for 2024. It expects top-line growth in 2025 to be driven by Keytruda, especially in early-stage cancers, new products Welireg, Winrevair and Capvaxive, and the Animal Health segment, partially offset by declining sales of Gardasil in China.\n\nWe believe investors with a long-term horizon should stay invested in MRK stock, while short-term investors should consider selling the same as the company may take some time to show strong earnings growth.\n\nMerck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "The potential elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation\u2019s largest health agency could be detrimental to the government\u2019s goal of preventing cervical cancer through vaccination.\n\nThat\u2019s because Kennedy has a long history of making misleading claims about and being involved in legal challenges to the human papillomavirus vaccine, which experts credit with saving hundreds of thousands of lives by preventing HPV infections that can cause cervical, head and neck cancer.\n\nDuring his time as a vaccine injury attorney, Kennedy launched complaints and lawsuits against Merck, the maker of Gardasil, which was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006.\n\nAnd in his role as chairman and chief legal counsel of an anti-vaccine group, he used his platform to spread misinformation on social media, claiming Gardasil is \u201cdangerous and defective\u201d and could actually increase the risk of cervical cancer in vaccinated age groups.\n\nIf confirmed as Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy, whose confirmation hearings have not yet been announced, would have a megaphone to spread those claims to the broader public \u2014 even as the federal government works to increase HPV vaccination rates among teens.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous man. He puts people in this country at unnecessary risk,\u201d said Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a virulent anti-vaccine activist that puts out one piece of misinformation after another with the clear goal of reducing vaccine uptake,\u201d Offit said.\n\nKennedy\u2019s statements run counter to the government\u2019s own goal of getting 80 percent of adolescents vaccinated against HPV by 2030. As of 2023, only about 61 percent are up to date on the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends the HPV vaccination for everyone through age 26.\n\nThat\u2019s an initiative Kennedy would likely be in charge of if confirmed.\n\n\u201cLives could be on the line because of this. And I think that\u2019s pretty nerve-wracking for people who are in public health and really want to save lives,\u201d said Nathan Boonstra, a pediatrician in Iowa who has tried to combat false claims about vaccines. He said Kennedy cherry-picks data points that fit his narrative to sow distrust in vaccines.\n\nScientific evidence\n\nStudies have shown the vaccine is safe and effective and reduces the incidence of HPV-related cancers in both women and men. One study predicts increasing HPV vaccination in girls globally will avert more deaths per person vaccinated than any other immunization.\n\nAnd a study released last year in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found no cases of cervical cancer detected in women born between 1988 and 1996 in Scotland who were fully vaccinated against HPV between the ages of 12 and 13.\n\nBut Kennedy has seized on anecdotes from individuals who claimed they became sick after receiving the vaccine.\n\nWhile vaccine injuries do happen, they are rare, experts say. Kennedy uses those cases to cast wider doubt about the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThat one-person narrative is so much more powerful than data from a million people,\u201d said Tara Smith, a professor at the College of Public Health at Kent State University, where she has studied health misinformation. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just one of the unfortunate issues with epidemiology, is we want to look at large populations, but that doesn\u2019t resonate with the average person like one story from an individual does.\u201d\n\nShe said there has not been a high-quality study that has found links between chronic health conditions and the HPV vaccine.\n\nIn a book Kennedy authored in 2021, \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci,\u201d he dedicated an entire chapter to the HPV vaccine, writing that Gardasil\u2019s data shows it could \u201cdramatically raise risks of cancer and autoimmunity in some girls.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been involved with several cases representing people who claim to have been injured by Gardasil, arguing Merck \u201coveremphasized\u201d the health risks of HPV and fast-tracked the vaccine\u2019s approval despite limited evidence of efficacy \u201cto scare the public into agreeing to mass vaccinations of the Gardasil vaccine.\u201d\n\nAs of April 2024, Kennedy said he was representing \u201chundreds of young women and men\u201d impacted by the vaccine.\n\nA Kennedy spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether he was still involved in those cases.\n\nThat includes his work through Children\u2019s Health Defense, which he has stepped down from, and personal injury law firms, which financial disclosures show he has consulted with.\n\nOne of those firms, Wisner Baum, dubs itself the \u201ctop Gardasil lawyers in America.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s amended financial disclosures from his presidential run, filed in 2024 and posted by the Washington Examiner, show he received $326,000 from Children\u2019s Health Defense, where he did much of his vaccine work. As a consultant with Wisner Baum, the forms showed he received nearly $743,000 in \u201cpayment of referral fees on contingency fee cases,\u201d though he also appeared to work on other types of cases. Filings from 2023, posted by Politico, showed $1.6 million from Wisner Baum.\n\nAccording to the 2023 report, he also received $62,500 from another firm, Morgan & Morgan, also involved in Gardasil lawsuits \u2014 for \u201creferral fees for firm development and obtaining clients and cases.\u201d\n\nKennedy is still listed as a co-counsel in cases that are part of multidistrict litigation filed against Merck.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a weaponization of the courts against vaccines,\u201d said Richard Hughes, a health lawyer at Epstein Becker Green, who advocates for vaccines and has worked at drug companies including Merck.\n\nKennedy has used lawsuits he is involved in to bolster his social media claims that the vaccine is unsafe, of \u201cdoubtful efficacy and dangerous.\u201d He often takes these claims to social media like Facebook and Instagram, where his group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, was suspended in 2022 for promoting disinformation.\n\nIn lawsuits and social media posts, Kennedy has sought to downplay the risk of cervical cancer. He argues in most cases it can be prevented through regular pap smears and points out that less than 1 percent of women will get that cancer, which is highly treatable.\n\nHowever, public health experts say it\u2019s best to just prevent cancer head on.\n\n\u201cThe procedures to get rid of precancerous lesions or cancer after it\u2019s detected through a pap smear are not easy, and have their own costs associated with them,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith said she is part of the generation before the vaccine was available, and while she got regular pap smears, her OB-GYN found precancerous lesions that had to be removed.\n\nThe procedure can pose pregnancy complications, which added stress during her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cSo it is so much better just to prevent it in the first place with vaccination.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense also had an impact on HPV vaccines outside of the courts, lobbying against state efforts to include it as one of the vaccines kids must get before going to school.\n\nOnly three states \u2014 Hawaii, Rhode Island and Virginia \u2014 and the District of Columbia have those requirements, in part because of those efforts, according to KFF, a health think tank.\n\nInfluence\n\nAs HHS secretary, Kennedy could do more than amplify his views about the HPV vaccine. He could influence the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the vaccine, though that would likely be met with legal challenges.\n\nKennedy would also be responsible for making nominations to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations to the CDC about what vaccines states and insurers should cover and what vaccines kids should get. Those recommendations must receive approval from the CDC director. Trump\u2019s choice for CDC director is also a vaccine skeptic.\n\nChanging what vaccines ACIP recommends could also impact insurance coverage, which could in turn erode vaccine uptake.\n\n\u201cIf his desire is to disrupt vaccines, he has a lot of tools at his disposal,\u201d though many actions will likely face lawsuits, Hughes said.\n\nThis report has been corrected to accurately reflect that HPV vaccines have been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related cancers in men and women.",

            "content": "The Chinese drug services giant built an Irish factory to produce vaccines for Merck, but has now opted to sell the plant to the U.S.-based multinational for $500 million\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nWuXi Biologics estimated that it stood to make just $55 million in profit from the vaccines site, far short of the expected return\n\nDespite concern over a pending U.S. biosecurity law, the Chinese firm recently clinched two big deals with U.S. drug companies\n\nBy Molly Wen\n\nChina\u2019s WuXi Group is streamlining its international operations as it braces for U.S. legislative curbs on the biotech business.\n\nLate last year, drug research firm WuXi AppTec (2359.HK; 603259.SH) announced it was selling its overseas-based cell and gene therapy business. Then on Jan. 6, WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc. (2269.HK) said it had agreed to sell one of its European vaccine production centers to its multinational partner Merck (MRK.US).\n\nWuXi and other Chinese biotechs are the target of a proposed U.S. law that seeks to restrict their access to drug contracts, citing concerns over national security and the handling of sensitive genetic or health data.\n\nThe bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in September and must gain consent from the Senate before being entered onto the statute books. Although the threat has not yet materialized, the prospect of being frozen out of U.S. partnerships has worried investors and spurred a boardroom rethink about overseas assets.\n\nThe vaccine subsidiary of WuXi Biologics built the Irish facility to serve a sole client, Merck, which is now buying the plant for $500 million (3.66 billion yuan). The unaudited net book value of assets held by the vaccine plant amounted to around $487 million, as of the end of November 2024.\n\nThe project was launched in February 2020 as part of a 20-year deal, worth up to $3 billion, to make innovative vaccines for Merck, a multinational headquartered in the United States. At the time, WuXi\u2019s vaccines unit planned to spend $240 million to build the production and laboratory base, which was due to go into operation in 2022.\n\nHowever, the vaccine market has shrunk since the Covid pandemic subsided, taking a toll on contract manufacturers serving the global pharmaceutical industry. In a conference call, WuXi Biologics said construction costs for the vaccine base had risen to nearly $500 million during the pandelic and operating costs were high, limiting future profits to about $55 million. On that basis, a sale was the best way to maximize its resources, WuXi Biologics said.\n\nWuXi Vaccines began as a joint venture between WuXi Biologics and Shanghai Hile Bio-Technology (603718.SH), with a mission to become a leading provider of integrated vaccine services for the pharma sector. However, the results at WuXi Vaccines have not lived up to expectations in recent years.\n\nThe company posted revenues of 1.27 billion yuan in 2021, 1.05 billion yuan the following year and 983 million yuan in 2023. Over the same period, profits amounted to 36.10 million yuan, 32.11 million yuan and 38.30 million yuan. In the first three months of 2024, WuXi Vaccines even made a net loss of 20.94 million yuan.\n\nJoint venture partner Hile Bio-Technology sold its entire 30% stake to WuXi Biologics last August for $108.5 million. On that basis, WuXi Vaccines as a whole was valued at just $361 million. By comparison the $500 million price tag for the Irish production center looks to be a good deal for WuXi Biologics.\n\nThe divestment will have a limited impact on the finances of WuXi Biologics, according to a research report from investment bank CICC. But WuXi Vaccines will be able to concentrate on providing services for more customers from its base in Suzhou, and cash could now be spent on expanding production capacity or buying back shares.\n\nHedging against US actions\n\nWuXi Biologics played down the connection with the U.S. Biosecure Act, saying it was seeking to optimize the allocation of resources, but some analysts interpret the latest move as a defense against a commercial rift with the United States.\n\nLaunched in early 2024, the biosecurity act aims to restrict cooperation between federally funded pharma companies and any biotech suppliers suspected of links to China\u2019s security services. WuXi Biologics was explicity named as a target when an amendment was passed in September 2024. The legislation enjoys bipartisan support and, if it clears the Senate and is signed into law, poses a risk to the overseas business that makes up more than 80% of revenue at WuXi Biologics.\n\nDespite concern about the pending law, WuXi Biologics won three big orders over the past month, including two partnerships with U.S. drug companies. On Jan. 7 the company announced a research tie-up with drug company Candid Therapeutics that grants the U.S. firm global rights to a trispecific antibody in preclinical development. The deal will earn WuXi Biologics up to $925 million in down payments, milestone fees and commissions once the product is launched. A few weeks earlier, the company entered into another two collaborations, with U.S. pharmaceutical company Aadi Bioscience and China\u2019s Sino Biopharm.\n\nShares in WuXi Biologics took a dive after the sale of the Irish vaccine base was announced, and did not immediately perk up when the Candid deal was made public. The stock pared its losses to close down 2.53% that day, recovering 1.85% in the following trading session.\n\nWuXi Biologics has a number of production bases, research facilities and service centers in Europe, the United States and Singapore. The base in Ireland was only one of many overseas factories, representing a relatively small slice of revenue. As such, the sale in itself does not signal a significant shift in the firm\u2019s overseas strategy.\n\nThe biotech sector as a whole has struggled under the shadow of the U.S. legislation. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of WuXi Biologics has fallen back to 23 times but still beats the 15 times for its sister company WuXi AppTec. Although its profits fell in 2023 and the first half of 2024, WuXi Biologics enjoys an industry-leading stature that still attracts orders and provides some protection from industry pressures.\n\nTo subscribe to Bamboo Works free weekly newsletter, click here",

            "content": "The iconic Park Gstaad Hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, a hallmark of luxury and alpine heritage since 1910, is poised for a transformative chapter under the management of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. Following a comprehensive renovation, the property is set to reopen as \u201cThe Park Gstaad, A Four Seasons Hotel\u201d in May 2026, solidifying Gstaad\u2019s status as a premier destination for discerning global travelers.\n\nThis ambitious overhaul is spearheaded by Squircle Capital in collaboration with acclaimed interior designer Joseph Dirand, known for his modern aesthetic that harmonizes with historical contexts. The project is expected to cost approximately CHF 100 million ($110 million) and will blend contemporary sophistication with the hotel\u2019s storied legacy. Dona Bertarelli, owner of the property, expressed her enthusiasm for the collaboration. \u201cThe Park Gstaad has been a part of my personal journey and holds a special place in the region\u2019s heritage. Its transformation into a Four Seasons experience will unite its legacy with modern elegance, creating a destination for both residents and visitors to cherish,\u201d she stated. Bertarelli is a billionaire philanthropist and sister of Alinghi sailor and billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli. The Swiss-Italian siblings inherited the pharmaceutical company Serono from their father which they pivoted towards biotechnology and later sold for $ 13.3 billion to Germany\u2019s Merck to form Merck-Serono.\n\nUpon reopening, The Park Gstaad will feature 71 rooms, 4 suites, and 5 luxury penthouse residences. These Penthouse residences will be available for purchase but will be managed by Four Seasons, and will offer potential buyers unparalleled access to the brand\u2019s renowned property management services. Enhanced amenities include state-of-the-art dining options, a destination spa, and extensive wellness facilities featuring indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, and a winter ice rink. A strong focus on sustainability and employee well-being is reflected in upgraded accommodations for staff, ensuring the hotel\u2019s legacy is as much about people as it is about place. For corporate travelers, six newly designed meeting rooms will provide an optimal blend of functionality and style, accommodating high-quality seminars, team-building activities, and incentive events. Whether for work or leisure, the property\u2019s attention to detail promises an extraordinary experience, bolstered by the scenic charm of Gstaad.\n\nNestled in the Bernese Oberland, Gstaad has long been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity. The village offers year-round attractions, from 220 kilometers (136 miles) of ski slopes in winter to hiking, mountain biking, and golf during warmer months. At an altitude of up to 3,000 meters (9,842 feet), the destination caters to outdoor enthusiasts while also serving as a cultural hub with gourmet dining and boutique shopping. Easily accessible from major cities, Gstaad is a two-hour drive from Geneva and a short distance from Bern Airport. The hotel itself is centrally located, offering proximity to the village promenade while maintaining a tranquil alpine setting.\n\nThe Park Gstaad has long been a coveted venue for weddings and private events, and its transformation under Four Seasons will elevate these offerings. From outdoor ceremonies against the majestic backdrop of the Alps to intimate indoor celebrations, the hotel will provide personalized planning to ensure every detail is perfect. Guests can even reserve the entire property for the ultimate in privacy and exclusivity.\n\nMartin Rhomberg, Regional Vice President of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and a veteran with over two decades of experience, underscores the significance of this project. \u201cThe transformation of The Park Gstaad reflects Four Seasons\u2019 commitment to delivering exceptional experiences in the world\u2019s most coveted locations. This venture combines the timeless appeal of Gstaad with our unparalleled service and attention to detail,\u201d he remarked in an interview with Swiss magazine Hotel Inside.\n\nAs Four Seasons expands its portfolio of alpine properties, including locations in Meg\u00e8ve, Whistler, and Jackson Hole, the addition of The Park Gstaad signifies a milestone in its European presence. With its reopening, The Park Gstaad, A Four Seasons Hotel, will undoubtedly set a new benchmark for luxury in the Swiss Alps.",

            "content": "After an explosive opening marked by a suite of multi-billion-dollar deals, the 2025 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference frenzy has calmed down\u2014but only slightly. The second day of the conference saw several big pharma players plot their strategic roadmaps, looking back and learning from their stumbles in 2024 and scoping out avenues of growth for the year ahead.\n\nMerck Looks to Diversify Pipeline as it Braces for Keytruda Cliff\n\nWith more than 40 approved indications, Keytruda\u2014a blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor that has now become a cornerstone in cancer therapy\u2014is Merck\u2019s top-selling asset. In the first nine months of 2024, the asset brought in more than $21.6 billion for the pharma. But with key patent protections set to expire starting in 2028, Merck is now working to beef up its pipeline to absorb an expected drop in Keytruda sales as biosimilar competitors enter the market, according to reporting from PharmaVoice.\n\nIn an investor note, BMO Capital Markets analysts said that Merck\u2019s long-term guidance\u2014$25 billion for cancer and more than $5 billion each for its immunology and HIV portfolios by the mid-2030s\u2014\u201csuggests greater expansion of oncology business\u201d and reflects the company\u2019s optimism around its other units. Merck is also working on a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda, which \u201ccould help lengthen the tail\u201d of its erosion, according to the BMO note.\n\nRoche Eyes Judicious Use of $10B M&A Budget\n\nEvery year, Roche sets aside around $10 billion for potential M&A deals, but CEO Teresa Graham revealed at JPM25 that the pharma is selective in how and whether it spends this money, Fierce Biotech reported on Tuesday.\n\nThis fiscal control was in full display last year, Richard Vosser, analyst at J.P. Morgan, pointed out during the Q&A session of Roche\u2019s presentation, according to Fierce. Some of the pharma\u2019s recent deals include its $900 million partnership with COUR Pharmaceuticals last month and potential $1.8 billion contract with Flare Therapeutics in November 2024. Most prominent is Roche\u2019s $1.5 billion acquisition of Poseida Therapeutics, also in November.\n\nStill, Graham maintained that the pharma has the capacity\u2014and willingness\u2014to make big-ticket acquisitions \u201cif and when we find transformative assets that are either complementary to our portfolio\u201d or \u201cchange the game in important diseases.\u201d\n\nAmgen Doubles Down on MariTide Despite Flat Phase II Data\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Amgen officials defended the Phase II readout for its closely watched obesity asset MariTide.\n\n\u201cI think MariTide will differentiate itself not only on the profile\u2014that we are a different product than the weeklies, which seem to be more similar to each other than not\u2014but also in the investment that we\u2019re putting behind it,\u201d Susan Sweeney, head of obesity and related conditions, said, according to BioPharma Dive.\n\nThe company in September 2024 announced that it will push through with a late-stage program for MariTide, testing the bispecific GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist not only in obesity, but also in heart, kidney and liver diseases.\n\nA few months later, however, MariTide\u2019s Phase II data largely disappointed investors, sending the pharma\u2019s shares dropping 11% in the aftermath. The mid-stage results showed that MariTide elicited an average weight loss of up to 20% at 52 weeks, which was on the lower end of the range that stockholders were expecting.\n\nAt JPM25, Sweeney reiterated the pharma\u2019s commitment to MariTide, confirming that it will initiate a broad Phase III program for the candidate in obesity and related conditions, with an eye toward securing insurance coverage, BioPharma Dive reported.\n\nBiogen Hits Lowest Stock Price Since 2013 as Leqembi Uptake Lags\n\nBiogen CEO Chris Viehbacher at JPM25 said that the pharma remains fully committed to the Alzheimer\u2019s disease space and its therapeutic antibody Leqembi (lecanemab), according to a BMO Capital Markets note on Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s despite what the BMO analyst called \u201cstruggles\u201d with the Alzheimer\u2019s market, including barriers to reimbursement and the need to educate providers about appropriate treatment. Leqembi\u2019s roll-out has been slow, with Eisai\u2014Biogen\u2019s development and commercialization partner\u2014in November 2024 lowering its full fiscal year guidance.\n\nBiogen stock was trading at $142.42 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2013, according to SeekingAlpha.\n\n\u201cBusiness development continues to be needed,\u201d the BMO analysts noted. In its own investor note, Jefferies agreed, while pointing out that Biogen appears to have slowed down this development. \u201cThey will do deals and are looking at many things - but relative urgency has actually declined slightly versus 6+ [months] ago,\u201d the Jefferies analyst wrote.\n\nLilly Crashes on Zepound, Mounjaro Q4 Miss\n\nLike Biogen, Eli Lilly saw negative stock movement on Tuesday, in its case after reporting a disappointing sales preview for its blockbuster weight-loss therapy tirzepatide.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, indicated for chronic weight management, brought in $1.9 billion, while its sister brand Mounjaro, approved for type 2 diabetes, earned $3.5 billion. Overall, Lilly recorded $13.5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, falling slightly below the analyst consensus of $13.9 billion.\n\nIn a statement, CEO David Ricks pointed to its \u201clower-than-expected channel inventory at year-end\u201d as the reason for its Q4 miss, alongside its previous guidance that had overestimated the acceleration of the U.S. incretin market. In a Tuesday note, BMO Capital Markets analysts remained optimistic about Lilly\u2019s prospects in the coming year, noting that while the tirzepatide roll-out remains \u201cconstrained,\u201d demand remains \u201crobust\u201d in the U.S.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"",

In between everything else on the to-do list, it can feel hard to make your health and annual appointments a priority. However, it\u2019s important to take control of your health and talk to your doctor about what cancer screenings might be recommended for you.\n\nWhy timing matters in cancer screening\n\nTime is important with a cancer diagnosis so that treatment can be started early, before cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Cancer screenings can increase the chance of finding disease before a person has symptoms or when cancer is still in earlier stages.\n\nThere are screening guidelines for many types of cancer, such as breast, colorectal and lung cancer, as well as melanoma. Screening recommendations often take into consideration a few factors, such as age, family history and lifestyle. Your doctor can help you identify which screenings might be right for you.\n\nAs a leader in oncology, we\u2019re committed to addressing the global impact of cancer.\n\n\u201cThrough our work to increase access to screening and our other initiatives and programs, we appreciate the importance of finding disease early, before it has spread to help enable early treatment, because we believe people with cancer deserve more,\u201d said Linda Kollmar, associate vice president, medical affairs, value and implementation.\n\nSo, make time now to talk to your doctor and to find out if you\u2019re eligible for cancer screening.\n\nWe\u2019re working to help address other barriers to cancer screening\n\nRaising awareness about cancer screening is just one way our company works to help improve lives. We also strive to help address barriers to screening and treatment, which is why we work with partners around the globe to support public health initiatives that support recommended screening and create access to high quality cancer care for all patients.\n\nOur support of the American Cancer Society\u2019s Get Screened initiative makes it possible for community members to be screened for breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer who might not have access otherwise. And working with City Cancer Challenge, we support the Patient Navigation Program in Kigali, Rwanda to train nurses as patient navigators who can help people understand health information more easily and gain access to health care options more quickly.\n\nFind out more about how we collaborate with partners around the world to help make cancer care more accessible.",

Johnson & Johnson does not generate as much revenue from its pharmaceuticals, but the company's market cap of $348.5 billion as of Jan. 14, 2025, and its 2023 revenue of $85.1 billion makes it undeniably a rival.\n\nHow Is Pfizer Different From Other Companies? Pfizer is behind many pharmaceutical innovations that are copied or mimicked in generic versions. Pfizer continues to monitor their generics and assume responsibility for them even after the patent expires.\n\nWhat Is Pfizer's Competitive Advantage? Pfizer's intellectual property and continuous development of new medicines are its competitive advantages.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPfizer began manufacturing chemicals in 1849, eventually pivoting to pharmaceutical research in the 1950s. Since then, it has become one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, with only a few companies reaching the status of peers.\n\nPfizer has 30 active pharmaceutical patents. It also has 108 products, as of Oct. 29, 2024, in its development pipeline.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For any hopes the dealmaking that started the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference would give the overall biotechnology sector a running start to 2025, Eli Lilly deflated them Tuesday.\n\nThe company, which rose to new heights on the success of its medicines for weight loss and diabetes, revealed revenue numbers that for the second time in a row fell short of investor expectations. Lilly shares fell 7% and dragged with them the stocks of several other obesity drug developers. A biotech stock index slid by almost 3%.\n\nAmgen is one of those would-be competitors and, at the JPM meeting, executives defended recent trial results for the company\u2019s rival weight loss drug. Read on for details on that and other highlights from the conference:\n\nAmgen\u2019s MariTide defense\n\nAmgen\u2019s market value rose and fell by billions of dollars last year on the promise of an obesity drug called MariTide. The drug, which is meant to act quicker and be dosed less frequently than existing medicines, dominated earnings call discussions.\n\nBut summary results from a Phase 2 trial failed to convince Wall Street that MariTide is clearly better than other drugs, leading analysts to question not only MariTide\u2019s potential, but the optimistic picture Amgen leaders had painted before disclosing data.\n\nAt a discussion with reporters Tuesday, a group of Amgen executives defended MariTide\u2019s profile as well as the way in which the company presented results. \u201cWe don\u2019t hype data. This is a differentiated medicine,\u201d said Peter Griffith, Amgen\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nGriffith attributed some of the especially large share price decline that hit Amgen afterwards to trading behavior amplifying the stock\u2019s initial drop. He also pointed to data suggesting MariTide resulted in comparable weight loss to existing medicines at an earlier time point, and may be able to be administered once per month or less.\n\n\u201cHow many of our peers in this industry have been searching for something once a month in Type 2 diabetes?\u201d Griffith said.\n\nWhile investors may stay skeptical, Amgen is advancing. It\u2019s initiating late-stage studies in obesity, heart failure, sleep disorders and kidney disease, aiming to better negotiate with insurers, said Susan Sweeney, Amgen\u2019s head for obesity and related conditions.\n\n\u201cI think MariTide will differentiate itself not only on the profile \u2014 that we are a different product than the weeklies, which seem to be more similar to each other than not \u2014 but also in the investment that we're putting behind it,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nA lot of eyes will be on the full Phase 2 study results coming this year. Executives confirmed they\u2019ll be presented at a medical meeting \u2014 they didn\u2019t say which \u2014 and will include findings from a different dose escalation scheme it\u2019s working on as well. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nMerck\u2019s patent \u201chill\u201d\n\nKeytruda likely earned Merck & Co. something close to $29 billion last year. The dominant cancer immunotherapy, which accounts for a little less than half of Merck\u2019s sales, is patent protected in the U.S. until 2028.\n\nBut to hear Merck CEO Rob Davis tell it, the looming expiration of Keytruda\u2019s patent protection will be more of \u201ca hill, not a cliff.\u201d\n\nIn a presentation Monday afternoon, Davis said Merck was planning to offset Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity by moving up plans to file for approval and launch a subcutaneous version of Keytruda by the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cWe expect to be able to see adoption of about 30% to 40% of all Keytruda [patients] into subcutaneous pembrolizumab,\u201d Davis said. He expects many of these conversions will come from people taking Keytruda on its own, or in combination with oral drugs.\n\n\"We're going to price to drive the adoption, so you should assume that and the price will evolve over time,\u201d Davis said.\n\nExecutives at Bristol Myers Squibb, which is pursuing a similar subcutaneous strategy for its competing immunotherapy Opdivo, expect a similar rate of conversion to their subcutaneous product, which won U.S. approval last month.\n\nMerck also hopes to close the future gap from loss of Keytruda sales with its pipeline of antibody-drug conjugates, sales of its Gardasil vaccine in China and the possible introduction of an oral weight loss therapy.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident that we have derisked that outcome,\u201d Davis said. \u2014 Gwendolyn Wu\n\nDual-track dealmaking\n\nGSK\u2019s buyout of IDRx and Eli Lilly\u2019s deal for Scorpion Therapeutics \u2014 both announced Monday \u2014 fit what\u2019s been a trend the past year: privately held companies opting for a deal over an initial public offering.\n\nAccording to Alexis Borisy, a venture capitalist at Curie.Bio, founder of IDRx and a board observer at Scorpion Therapeutics, both companies had confidentially filed paperwork outlining plans to go public. Neither got to the point of sharing those plans more widely, as both were running a \u201cdual M&A/IPO process,\u201d he said, and ultimately chose to sell.\n\nTo Borisy, these deals highlight the tough decisions facing IPO-ready startups. IDRx could\u2019ve gone public, since it has a promising drug in early testing for gastrointestinal cancer, he said. But it likely would not have gotten much higher of a valuation than it received in an August funding round. The company would\u2019ve had to sell about one-third of its shares to raise a couple hundred million dollars in an IPO, and risk its market value eroding after, he said.\n\nInstead, GSK offered $1 billion upfront for the whole company \u2014 compelling enough for investors to earn returns, as well as for IDRx founders and employees to do well. IDRx\u2019s drug will now move forward with a company that can easily fund future development. (Scorpion\u2019s lead drug, meanwhile, was acquired by Eli Lilly for a slightly larger upfront sum.)\n\nThose calculations are \u201ca direct factor of the market at the moment,\u201d Borisy said. \u201cBoth IDRx and Scorpion are companies that, if [this were] a booming public market, maybe would become public.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in a \u2018meh,\u2019 market,\u201d he added, \u201cif somebody puts an attractive bid in, investors hit that bid.\u201d \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nViking looks long term\n\nViking Therapeutics, a developer of drugs for obesity, aims to compete in a market now dominated by big pharma. As such, analysts have thought it likely the company may look to license its drug or sell entirely.\n\nCompany CEO Brian Lian isn\u2019t about to say who he\u2019s talking with, but in a presentation Monday he did outline what characteristics would make for an ideal partner.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the obesity market, you would want a partner that has some experience in these large metabolic indications, you know, like a lipid background, or experience with diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would prefer a global partnership. That would be probably the best.\u201d\n\nOn-market competitors like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have struggled to deliver enough of their obesity drugs to meet demand. On Monday, Lian sought to assure investors Viking is planning ahead on manufacturing. He said the company has enough supply of the subcutaneous formulation of its lead product, VK2735, to complete Phase 3 testing, and enough of the oral formulation to get through Phase 2.\n\n\u201cWe've been working really hard to reach a long-term supply agreement that hopefully would include fill and finish for [subcutaneous] and tablet [formulations],\u201d he said. \u201cWe're making a lot of progress. It's too early to make any announcements, but I think we should be in a position in the reasonably near term to update what our supply picture looks like.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Gardner",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nMerck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda is the world\u2019s best-selling drug and has been a cancer juggernaut for more than a decade, scoring its 40th indication in June and adding yet another in late September.\n\nAs such, Keytruda accounted for about 42% of the company\u2019s sales in 2023, which is a lot of weight to bear for a tentpole drug teetering on the edge of a patent cliff. That\u2019s why the pharma giant is boosting the rest of its portfolio to ready itself for a world in which Keytruda will start facing biosimilar competition as early as 2028.\n\n\u201cOur pipeline is broadening. I think that is an important part of thinking about the future of Merck beyond 2028,\u201d said Dr. Joerg Koglin, Merck\u2019s senior vice president and head of general medicine and global clinical development. \u201cGeneral and specialty medicine will play an important role in that.\u201d\n\nHe called 2024 \u201ca year with momentum\u201d and categorized 2025 as a year \u201cwhere we have a number of major deliverables\u201d such as study readouts and additional filings \u201cthat all seem to be on track.\u201d\n\nCardiometabolic pipeline\n\nFront and center is Merck\u2019s cardiometabolic pipeline, which the company anticipates will yield seven potential approvals by 2030, leading to peak revenue potential of more than $15 billion by the mid-2030s, the company told PharmaVoice.\n\nMerck already scored an FDA nod in March with the breakthrough biologic Winrevair, a first-in-class treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Importantly, the approval doesn\u2019t restrict access to Winrevair based on functional class, which means physicians can prescribe it to patients outside phase 3 study criteria, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cIt is a very broad label, which just indicates for us that the regulators agree with \u2026 our perception of how meaningful the data is,\u201d Koglin said.\n\nKoglin calls that approval \u201cchapter one\u201d for Winrevair. Now, the company is trying to expand the label further. For instance, he pointed to a second phase 3 study that was so successful it was stopped early. The study was investigating whether Winrevair could reduce the risk of death, lung transplantation or hospitalization in patients with advanced PAH.\n\n\u201cIt was the first PAH clinical study that was ever stopped for overwhelming efficacy,\u201d he said.\n\nMerck is also exploring Winrevair\u2019s use in just-diagnosed PAH patients and is \u201cadvancing nicely,\u201d while another trial is looking at its use in heart failure patients who develop pulmonary hypertension \u2014 the data should read out before year end, he said.\n\n\u201cMerck is investing a lot into general and specialty medicine, and many of those assets have development timelines that could lead to approvals that fall somewhere into this space before initial Keytruda patent expiry.\" Dr. Joerg Koglin SVP, head, general medicine and global clinical development, Merck & Co.\n\nBeyond Winrevair, Koglin said Merck will also read out its first pivotal study of its oral PCSK9 inhibitor to lower cholesterol in 2025. Currently, the class of drugs is only available in higher-priced injectables.\n\nThe daily pill, called MK-0616, is \u201can oral solution that might have a risk-benefit profile comparable to injectables, that come, obviously, with a promise that you can reach a much broader population,\u201d Koglin said.\n\nOther emerging areas\n\nWhile Merck\u2019s late-stage pipeline leans overwhelmingly toward cancer, the company is dipping its toe in other emerging clinical areas as well. Koglin points to pipeline momentum and business development through acquisitions over the last few years in areas like immunology, neuroscience and ophthalmology.\n\n\u201cMerck is investing a lot into general and specialty medicine, and many of those assets have development timelines that could lead to approvals that fall somewhere into this space before initial Keytruda patent expiry,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pharma giant has been busy on the M&A front.\n\nHe pointed to Merck\u2019s March acquisition of the ophthalmology company EyeBio and the advancement of a phase 2b/3 trial of a potentially first-in-class treatment for diabetic macular edema. He also noted Merck\u2019s April 2023 acquisition of immunology company Prometheus Biosciences and its lead inflammatory bowel disease asset. In addition, Merck acquired the neurodegenerative disease company Caraway Therapeutics in November 2023.\n\nThe company also took steps into the GLP-1 space last month by entering into a global license deal with Hansoh Pharma for a preclinical, oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see that GLP-1 will move from injectable to oral therapies,\u201d Koglin said. \u201cWe have a smart discovery group, and we are using business development to figure out, as the chapters evolve from injectables, where Merck\u2019s opportunity is to be part of something that\u2019s really well differentiated.\u201d\n\nMerck\u2019s focus on cancer will continue, including advancing a subcutaneous version of Keytruda, but Koglin said the company is \u201cexcited\u201d about its broadening pipeline.\n\n\u201cLots seem to be on track,\u201d he said.",

He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show,\" he stated. Cramer added \"Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower.\" He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being \"worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell\" the world's leading GPU designer.\n\nAs a result, Cramer shared \"I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains.\" Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants \"fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum.\"\n\nCramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the \"QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers.\" Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented \"But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher.\"\n\nIn a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, \"The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow.\"\n\nWe recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that \"He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared:\n\n\"When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it.

And it can go a hundred yards.\"\n\nAs for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him \"A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired last Wednesday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 86\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Over the past couple of years, the firm has managed to set itself apart from others primarily through its cancer vaccine KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA is one of the most widely sold and popular cancer vaccines in the world. 2025 has also been a good year so far for Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) after the firm's shares soared by 2.3% after the firm bought an Irish vaccine facility owned by a Chinese firm. Cramer, however, commented on Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s slow share performance:\n\n\"Merck is getting pummeled. Pummeled. Look at Merck!\n\nOverall MRK ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Dividends hold particular significance, especially as the broader market has experienced consecutive gains of over 20%, a scenario not seen since the late 1990s. Moreover, the low payout ratio, currently at 29% compared to the historical average of 50%, suggests there is considerable potential for companies to increase their dividend payouts. Kwon pointed out that another key factor supporting dividend investing is the growing number of retired baby boomers seeking income. With cash products yielding around 4%, there is a strong demand for dividends, as investors are looking for immediate cash returns and are pressuring companies to increase their dividend distributions.\n\nDividends historically accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total return from 1936 to 2012 but have contributed only 16% over the past ten years, according to a research note from BofA Securities released late last year. Looking forward, Kwon anticipates that dividends will have a more significant impact on total returns compared to the previous decade.\n\nAnalysts note that, from a broad perspective, earnings growth has traditionally been the primary driver of dividends. Last year saw strong earnings growth, and they anticipate an even better performance in 2025. Goldman predicts an 11% increase in earnings per share for this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024. This is expected to result in a 7% rise in dividends, compared to a 6% increase last year. Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 12% boost in dividends this year, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nThe year 2024 proved favorable for dividends, even though the Dividend Aristocrats Index lagged behind the broader market. Throughout the year, US companies consistently increased or upheld their dividend payouts. In addition, several major tech firms began offering dividends, signaling to investors that it's possible for a company to focus on both growth and shareholder returns. By September 30, 2024, approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P index were distributing dividends, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past decade. Notably, nearly 24% of these dividend-paying firms were in the technology sector, a significant increase from 13% ten years ago. Sectors such as healthcare and industrials also experienced notable growth in the number of companies offering dividends. This broader distribution of dividends has expanded the range of investment opportunities, giving equity-income investors more access to high-growth, dynamic, and innovative companies. Given these developments, analysts remain optimistic about their performance heading into 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis optimism about dividend stocks is largely rooted in their historical performance, as they have been instrumental in reducing overall portfolio volatility and can help cushion losses when stock prices decline. Research indicates that dividend-paying stocks often outperform their non-dividend-paying counterparts during bear markets, such as during the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. This may be because companies that pay dividends are typically larger, more established, and more profitable, making them more resilient than the broader market.\n\nFrom October 2019 to September 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in the market\u2019s total performance, equity income funds demonstrated lower volatility and reduced downside risk compared to the broader market. Given this, we will discuss the most reliable dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to identify companies with a history of dividend growth spanning over 10 years. From this group, we selected companies offering dividend yields of at least 1% as of January 12. From that selection, we identified the ten stocks that hedge funds favored the most during the third quarter of 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nCramer on Merck (MRK): Trading Like a Value Trap Despite Strong Fundamentals\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American pharmaceutical company that mainly provides innovative health solutions to its consumers. The company has become a leader in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with its flagship cancer drug, Keytruda, transforming treatment protocols and contributing significantly to revenue growth. Its strong market position results in substantial cash flows, which are used to fund returns to shareholders.\n\nKeytruda has been approved for a variety of uses. Recently, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that a Phase 3 trial for Keytruda in a specific type of ovarian cancer achieved its primary goal of improving progression-free survival, although it did not meet the secondary goal of extending overall survival. Currently, Keytruda is approved for 40 oncology indications in the US, and Merck is working to secure similar approvals in major international markets like the European Union and Japan, where these indications have yet to be authorized.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Keytruda's sales increased by 17% compared to the previous year, reaching $7.4 billion.\n\nThis performance was also highlighted in GreensKeeper Asset Management\u2019s Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm shared:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was our second-largest detractor this quarter, declining -8.3%. MRK\u2019s leading HPV vaccine, GARDASIL 9, faced challenges internationally due to inventory buildup within its Chinese distributor, which is expected to reduce shipments for the remainder of 2024. Despite this short-term impact, the long-term outlook for GARDASIL 9 remains promising. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s $27 billion Keytruda cancer juggernaut continues to grow at a healthy clip, powering earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) declared a 5.2% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 14 years, which makes MRK one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of January 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.26%.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 86 hedge funds held stakes in Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), compared with 96 in the preceding quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $7.1 billion. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was one of the company's leading stakeholders in Q3.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "In the last decade, cancer treatment has pivoted to a precision medicine approach, with immunotherapies providing the backbone for many regimens. With this shift, patient biomarker data has become a crucial aspect of clinical trials, and recently, the FDA has been reassessing labels based on maturing datasets after approval.\n\nOften, therapies for diseases with high mortality rates such as cancer are greenlit under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway before all the data are evident. This has been the case for PD-1 inhibitors, including Merck\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, both of which are approved for treating several types of cancer.\n\n\u201cWhen [PD-1 inhibitors] first came out, we were like \u2018everyone gets pembro,\u2019 no matter the PD-L1 expression level because there was literally nothing else,\u201d Harpreet Singh, former FDA division director of oncology and current chief medical officer at Precision for Medicine, told BioSpace.\n\nNow, treatment options have expanded, and the FDA is setting limits on when certain inhibitors should be used. In September 2024, the FDA\u2019s Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 10-2 against the use of Keytruda and Opdivo as first-line treatments for advanced HER2-negative stomach cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression scores less than 1, and 11-1 against the use of Keytruda and Opdivo in first-line unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with low or no PD-L1 expression. The therapies are currently approved for use in all patients regardless of PD-L1 expression.\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly negative ODAC votes in September, the FDA has yet to release a verdict, and Singh said \u201cit\u2019s not clear whether they will.\u201d But there is precedent.\n\nIn 2022, the FDA limited the use of PARP inhibitors from Clovis Oncology and GSK to ovarian cancer patient populations with certain BRCA mutations. Prior to that, in 2018 the agency incorporated PD-L1 status into the labels of Keytruda and Tecentriq for existing frontline approvals for patients with urothelial cancers. The change came after a study revealed that patients with PD-L1 low status had decreased overall survival in the single-agent immunotherapy arms compared to chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cFDA is a data-driven scientific agency,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAs the data grows and evolves, they\u2019re adjusting their behavior to go where the data takes them.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Data\n\nAt the crux of the September ODAC votes was the risk-benefit profile of the PD-1 inhibitors in patients with low levels of the biomarker. Ultimately, the panelists concluded that if the PD-1 inhibitors do not appear to have substantial benefit for patients with PD-L1 scores lower than 1, their use is more likely to harm than to help.\n\nPD-L1 is a measure of how involved the immune system is in a cancer, explained Elad Sharon, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. If an immune response is evident by the presence of PD-L1 on the cell surfaces, then PD-1 inhibition has a chance to work and benefit the patient, he told BioSpace. But if the immune system doesn\u2019t interact with the tumor microenvironment to begin with, this type of inhibition is unlikely to provide any benefit.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not providing benefit to a patient, then you probably are only providing harm,\u201d Sharon said, noting that immuno-oncology agents thwart a normal regulatory pathway of the immune system. \u201cYou essentially take that tool out of the toolbox for the immune system, and that\u2019s how you end up with these toxicities like inflammation or other areas of concern.\u201d\n\nThese instances of regulatory reassessment follow the collection of further evidence, Singh said. The initial approval of Keytruda in 2014 was based on single-arm trials, which showed sufficient evidence of benefit to warrant approval, she explained. However, as a broader range of treatments became available, more biomarker data began to emerge. As these data matured for gastric and esophageal tumors, the hazard ratio uncovered wasn\u2019t so favorable for patients without PD-L1 expression.\n\nThe FDA is the only regulatory body in the world that receives a company\u2019s raw data, Singh explained. In the case of Keytruda and Opdivo in stomach and esophageal cancer, the agency utilized the subject-level datasets from each company to aggregate and interrogate the massive amounts of data, including biomarker status.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for trends across therapeutic classes . . . to see critical patterns that companies can\u2019t identify alone because they don\u2019t have each other\u2019s subject level data,\u201d Singh said.\n\nThe question comes down to the FDA\u2019s role in these situations, she continued. Should the agency aggregate and publish the data to inform providers or take it a step further and restrict the label? A Merck spokesperson told BioSpace that the company \u201ccannot speculate on the future actions of the FDA\u201d and is \u201ccommitted to continuing discussions\u201d with the agency.\n\nIt\u2019s a balance between leading with the data and patient access, Singh said, indicating her preference to publish the data and allow practitioners to ultimately make the call for their patients. However, if the label is restricted, she clarified that very few patients will be affected as gastroesophageal junction tumors are rarely negative for this biomarker.\n\nBiomarker-Driven Drug Development\n\nPerhaps the biggest lesson to be learned from the increased biomarker scrutiny after approval is for drug developers, Sharon said. He recommended the FDA require pre-specified analyses of relevant biomarkers in early-stage clinical trials.\n\n\u201cIdentifying appropriate patient populations and developing statistically valid conclusions from clinical trials is an essential role that sponsors have to play,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly-stage trials are crucial for determining if a drug works the way it\u2019s expected to. Often, therapeutics have a compensatory mechanism or accessory pathway that can be affected, making it unwise to begin a trial with the assumption that a drug will be ineffective for a particular population, Sharon explained. Ideally, companies should track biomarkers but not exclude patients. These data can then be used to target the drug to the population expected to see the greatest benefit as well as develop an accompanying biomarker test for selection purposes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really separate the two,\u201d Sharon said. Selectivity is only as good as the tests available, he explained, and \u201cevery time you end up with a new diagnostic technology, you have the ability to retest your assumptions and see if you can more precisely treat patients according to their specific needs.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the responsibility of both the FDA and the sponsors to determine which patients will actually benefit from a treatment, Sharon concluded\u2014and what is really needed is more rigorous data.\n\n\u201cWe have the technology to lead us to the right patient with the right therapy at the right time more now than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to make sure that when we\u2019re developing new agents, we rigorously test and co-develop these biomarkers so that we can achieve that significant level of precision and benefit for our patients.\u201d",

            "content": "The fact that multiple Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Merck\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Merck\n\nThe Executive VP & General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$127 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$99.25. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nInsiders in Merck didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNYSE:MRK Insider Trading Volume January 12th 2025\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nDoes Merck Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Merck insiders own 0.04% of the company, currently worth about US$101m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Merck Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Merck insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Merck, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Merck you should know about.",

(NYSE:MRK) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: \u201cI think that\u2019s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d",

            "content": "A Phase 1 clinical trial that is investigating a new vaccine against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a well-established risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS), in healthy volunteers has dosed its first participant.\n\nThe vaccine, called MDX2201, is being developed by Modex Therapeutics, an Opko Health company, in collaboration with Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada).\n\nThe study (NCT06655324) seeks to enroll 200 participants, ages 18-30, at several sites in the U.S. to determine the safety and tolerability of its vaccine, administered via three injections into the muscle over six months. The vaccine\u2019s ability to generate an immune response against EBV will also be assessed over about 1.5 years.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the participants and physicians who are actively engaged with Merck in our joint efforts to explore the potential of MDX2201 as a novel vaccine against EBV,\u201d Elias Zerhouni, MD, president and vice chairman of Opko, said in a company press release.\n\nUnder the collaboration, Modex and Merck worked together to gain clearance for clinical trials of MDX2201, and Merck is now responsible for leading this and future trials. It will also be in charge of all regulatory activities and for marketing MDX2201, if it is approved in the future. Modex will receive an undisclosed payment for the start of the current trial, and is also eligible for other milestone payments and royalties on global sales.\n\nRecommended Reading Long-term Tecfidera slows MS disability progression in large trial\n\nEpstein-Barr is common virus found in people\n\nEBV is one of the most common human viruses, infecting most people at some point in their lives. The virus is best known for causing mononucleosis, also known as the \u201ckissing disease,\u201d but it has been linked to a range of autoimmune conditions and cancers.\n\nIn MS, EBV is a strong risk factor for developing the condition, increasing its likelihood by about 32 times. It\u2019s been shown that some EBV proteins are very similar in structure to certain proteins in the brain, so when the body mounts an immune response to fight the virus, it may inadvertently cause damage to healthy parts of the nervous system.\n\nWhile EBV infection alone is not sufficient to cause MS, it may work together with other environmental and genetic risk factors to trigger the disease. Thus, a vaccine that prevents EBV infection in people at higher risk for MS is thought to help prevent the disease from developing.\n\nMDX2201 is a nanoparticle that carries at its surface pieces of four EBV proteins (gp350, gH, gL, and gp42) that mediate EBV\u2019s entry into human cells. It is designed to help the body recognize these proteins as harmful, so that an efficient immune response is mounted if the body ever comes into contact with EBV.\n\nBy targeting four different viral proteins, the approach is expected to be more effective than previous vaccines focusing on gp350 alone, according to the press release.\n\n\u201cOur Merck collaboration combines their discovery and clinical development expertise with our innovative and unique technology platform against this latent virus where an approved vaccine could have significant implications for the majority of people around the world,\u201d Zerhouni said.",

            "content": "TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mirror Biologics, Inc., specializing in development and manufacturing of immunotherapy products where the active ingredient is living, non-genetically altered, allogeneic (\u201coff-the-shelf\u201d) immune cells, announces that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The parties will collaborate to conduct a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the combination of an experimental immunotherapy drug, AlloStim\u00ae from Mirror, and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), avelumab (BAVENCIO\u00ae) from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in fourth-line metastatic colorectal cancer: NCT06557278.\n\n\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In 2023, approximately 153,020 individuals were diagnosed with CRC and 52,550 died from the disease in the United States. There were more than 1.9 million new CRC cases and 0.9 million deaths reported worldwide in 2020. CRC incidence is increasing, and it is estimated that the number of CRC patients worldwide could reach 2.5 million by 2035. There is a high unmet medical need to provide additional treatment options that could potentially extend life with quality for advanced metastatic CRC patients.\n\nICI drugs have revolutionized the treatment and prognosis for several solid tumor types. The tumor types most susceptible to ICI are tumors characterized as immunologically \u2018hot,\u2019 meaning those that have high numbers of infiltrating anti-tumor immune cells. However, most solid tumors and almost all CRC tumors are immunologically \u2018cold,\u2019 having no infiltrating immune cells, making them refractory to ICI immunotherapy. This collaboration intends to use experimental AlloStim\u00ae to attempt to convert ICI-unresponsive CRC tumors into ICI-responsive tumors. If successful, this could provide a new treatment option for these patients.\n\nThe combination of experimental AlloStim\u00ae and ICI has previously resulted in a rare objective tumor response in a patient with metastatic CRC, which has provided the rationale for further exploration of this combination in this indication: see: Objective response after immune checkpoint inhibitors in a chemotherapy-refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic rectal cancer patient primed with experimental AlloStim\u00ae immunotherapy.\n\nDr. Michael Har-Noy, Founder and Chief Medical Officer of Mirror Biologics stated: \u201cWe are pleased to enter into this clinical collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, evaluating the potential of investigational AlloStim\u00ae in combination with avelumab in patients who are suffering from advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. These patients have limited treatment options and are refractory to immunotherapy. The investigation of combination therapies may uncover additional possibilities for these patients. We look forward to working with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany to explore how we can bring the potential of immunotherapy to more patients.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Mirror Biologics will be the sponsor of the clinical study, and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will supply avelumab for the study. The Phase II open-label study is expected to accrue up to 50 patients with metastatic CRC who are both chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-refractory and who have failed at least one third-line, non-chemotherapy treatment (e.g., regorafenib, TAS-102 with or without bevacizumab or fruquintinib). The clinical study will be conducted at approximately 10 sites in the USA.\n\nAbout Avelumab (BAVENCIO\u00ae)\n\nAvelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking PD-L1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response. Avelumab has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. Avelumab in combination with axitinib is approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Avelumab has also been granted approval as monotherapy for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older) with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\nAbout Mirror Biologics\n\nMirror Biologics, Inc. is a private Delaware corporation with headquarters, blood donor center, drug depo storage, distribution, clinical research, as well as immunological and bioengineering development operations in Tampa, Florida. Mirror also has GMP manufacturing operations in Jerusalem, Israel and additional clinical operations in Thailand and Malaysia. The lead product candidate, AlloStim\u00ae is an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d non-genetically manipulated, living, immune cell immunotherapy protected by over 200 issued patents worldwide and derived from precursors purified from the blood of healthy donors. AlloStim\u00ae is a platform drug, that is broadly applicable to cancer and infectious disease indications. AlloStim\u00ae is being evaluated in a Phase IIb open-label clinical study in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer at 4 sites in USA, and in a Phase II/III randomized, controlled clinical study in advanced/metastatic liver cancer at 5 sites in Thailand and 3 sites in Malaysia. In addition, AlloStim\u00ae is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial in 40 healthy adults over 65yo in the USA as a means to reverse immunosenescence and restore broad universal respiratory viral protection in seniors against both known viruses (such as influenza A and B, RSV and coronavirus) and currently unknown viral pathogens, including emerging viruses with pandemic potential.\n\nContact:\n\nSandya von der Weid\n\nLifeSci Advisors\n\nEmail: svonderweid@lifesciadvisors.com\n\nAn image accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c8103b03-e221-4b34-9673-f70799172525",

The findings will likely pave the way for new treatment guidelines, he said, a viewpoint echoed by the scientists who carried out the Imfinzi trial and a separate article in the Lancet.\n\nThe Keytruda study found that patients lived 14.6 months on average without the cancer progressing when they got the Merck drug, Eisai Co.\u2019s Lenvima and a local therapy known transarterial chemoembolisation. The period was 10 months for the control group.\n\nChemoembolisation is a procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy drugs and an embolic agent into the tumor to cut off its blood supply.\n\nIn the other study, patients who got the same procedure and took Astra\u2019s Imfinzi as well as the Roche Holding AG drug Avastin took 15 months before their cancer got worse. That compares with 10 months for patients taking Imfinzi alone and 8.2 months for those who got a placebo.\n\nRoughly a quarter of patients with liver cancer can\u2019t be treated with surgery or other therapies that would completely remove the tumor, said Mount Sinai\u2019s Llovet.\n\nThe last major advance for those patients was in the early 2000s when several trials, including one that Llovet was involved in, showed that chemoembolisation helped patients.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

We believe the new indications will continue to protect more eligible men,\" said Tian.\"Merck fully understands the urgency of promoting HPV prevention for both men and women and will strengthen cooperation with the government to improve public awareness of HPV-related diseases, significantly improve the accessibility and affordability of the HPV vaccine, and contribute to the implementation of the Healthy China 2030 strategy,\" Tian added.According to the National Health Commission (NHC), HPV is classified into high-risk and low-risk types. High-risk types mainly affect women and are linked to cervical cancer, while low-risk types primarily affect men, leading to warts in the external genital area, such as genital warts. Sexual activity is the primary mode of transmission for HPV.Li Tongzeng, the chief physician of the infection department at Beijing You'an Hospital, told the Global Times on Thursday that men are the main transmitters of HPV, yet their infection rates often go unrecognized. \"The symptoms in men are often less noticeable, leading to a neglect of its infectious nature. Vaccinating men not only helps protect them but also reduces the risk of transmission to women, thereby more effectively controlling the spread of HPV.\"In China, the target population for the HPV vaccine is primarily women. While vaccination of women provides some cross-protection for men, relying only on this is insufficient, according to the NHC.Li said, compared to women, men are less inclined to receive the HPV vaccine, primarily due to lower awareness of its role in preventing anal cancer, protecting women from infection, and preventing genital warts.\"Certain high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, may have a greater awareness of safety and willingness to be vaccinated. It is important to target such key populations, as well as university students and adolescents, with awareness-raising and education efforts,\" said Li.",

Its portfolio of small molecule programs targets biological pathways associated with alleviating hunger. Aardvark\u2019s lead product candidate, ARD-101, targets Bitter Taste Receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed in the gut lumen, inducing secretion of engogenous singaling molecules, including the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which in turn activates gut-brain signals to suppress the sensation of hunger. This potential first-in-class oral investigational drug demonstrated favorable clinical activity and was well-tolerated in Phase 2 trials and has entered Phase 3 development for hyperphagia associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome, for which Aardvark has been granted an Orphan Drug Designation. Additionally, Aardvark intends to advance ARD-101 into Phase 2 development for hyperphagia associated with hypothalamic obesity, with a goal of addressing significant unmet needs across both these rare disease indications. Aardvark is also developing ARD-201, which will be a fixed-dose combination of ARD-101 with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, with a goal of addressing some of the limitations of currently marketed GLP-1 therapies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related conditions.

That has led to an oversold market entering 2025, surprising given the outstanding yearly performance in 2024. It will be a \u201cshow me\u201d economy and equity market in 2025. Any tailwinds of valuation expansion have died off. Stock prices will respond to more factor-based stimuli, likely earnings surprises, positive revisions, and quality characteristics. We expect the broadening of the market that began mid 2024 to continue in 2025, and as a result have modestly trimmed our exposure to the Magnificent Seven. One area that has led, namely momentum names, should be avoided and will inflict huge financial pain when they crack. This is not a year to add risk, rather it\u2019s time to lower expectations and watch the economic backdrop and individual sectors carefully.\n\nSign up for the Market Call Top Picks newsletter at bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe\n\nListen to the Market Call podcast on iHeart, or wherever you get your podcasts\n\nTOP PICKS:\n\nGordon Reid's Top Picks: Goldman Sachs, PulteGroup and Merck Gordon Reid, president of Goodreid Investment Counsel, discusses his top picks: Goldman Sachs, PulteGroup and Merck.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS NYSE)\n\nLatest Purchase January 2025 at $592\n\nGoldman ticks all the boxes for 2025.

Secondly, capital markets are primed to do well in a regulatory-light environment. Finally, valuations are undemanding.\n\nPulteGroup (PHM NYSE)\n\nLatest Purchase October 2024 at $129\n\nHomebuilders have been slammed in the last 30 days, as the market has been surprised that interest rate cuts will be more tepid than thought. Even more surprising, as the short-term U.S. Federal Reserve funds rate has fallen, the 30-year mortgage rate has risen. While a headwind for homebuilders there is too much pressure to create housing solutions for this to be a long-term issue.

            "content": "TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mirror Biologics, Inc., specializing in development and manufacturing of immunotherapy products where the active ingredient is living, non-genetically altered, allogeneic (\u201coff-the-shelf\u201d) immune cells, announces that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The parties will collaborate to conduct a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the combination of an experimental immunotherapy drug, AlloStim\u00ae from Mirror, and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), avelumab (BAVENCIO\u00ae) from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in fourth-line metastatic colorectal cancer: NCT06557278.\n\n\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In 2023, approximately 153,020 individuals were diagnosed with CRC and 52,550 died from the disease in the United States. There were more than 1.9 million new CRC cases and 0.9 million deaths reported worldwide in 2020. CRC incidence is increasing, and it is estimated that the number of CRC patients worldwide could reach 2.5 million by 2035. There is a high unmet medical need to provide additional treatment options that could potentially extend life with quality for advanced metastatic CRC patients.\n\nICI drugs have revolutionized the treatment and prognosis for several solid tumor types. The tumor types most susceptible to ICI are tumors characterized as immunologically \u2018hot,\u2019 meaning those that have high numbers of infiltrating anti-tumor immune cells. However, most solid tumors and almost all CRC tumors are immunologically \u2018cold,\u2019 having no infiltrating immune cells, making them refractory to ICI immunotherapy. This collaboration intends to use experimental AlloStim\u00ae to attempt to convert ICI-unresponsive CRC tumors into ICI-responsive tumors. If successful, this could provide a new treatment option for these patients.\n\nThe combination of experimental AlloStim\u00ae and ICI has previously resulted in a rare objective tumor response in a patient with metastatic CRC, which has provided the rationale for further exploration of this combination in this indication: see: Objective response after immune checkpoint inhibitors in a chemotherapy-refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic rectal cancer patient primed with experimental AlloStim\u00ae immunotherapy.\n\nDr. Michael Har-Noy, Founder and Chief Medical Officer of Mirror Biologics stated: \u201cWe are pleased to enter into this clinical collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, evaluating the potential of investigational AlloStim\u00ae in combination with avelumab in patients who are suffering from advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. These patients have limited treatment options and are refractory to immunotherapy. The investigation of combination therapies may uncover additional possibilities for these patients. We look forward to working with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany to explore how we can bring the potential of immunotherapy to more patients.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Mirror Biologics will be the sponsor of the clinical study, and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will supply avelumab for the study. The Phase II open-label study is expected to accrue up to 50 patients with metastatic CRC who are both chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-refractory and who have failed at least one third-line, non-chemotherapy treatment (e.g., regorafenib, TAS-102 with or without bevacizumab or fruquintinib). The clinical study will be conducted at approximately 10 sites in the USA.\n\nAbout Avelumab (BAVENCIO\u00ae)\n\nAvelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Avelumab has been shown in preclinical models to engage both the adaptive and innate immune functions. By blocking PD-L1 receptors, avelumab has been shown to release the suppression of the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response. Avelumab has also been shown to induce NK cell-mediated direct tumor cell lysis via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. Avelumab in combination with axitinib is approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Avelumab has also been granted approval as monotherapy for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older) with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\nAbout Mirror Biologics\n\nMirror Biologics, Inc. is a private Delaware corporation with headquarters, blood donor center, drug depo storage, distribution, clinical research, as well as immunological and bioengineering development operations in Tampa, Florida. Mirror also has GMP manufacturing operations in Jerusalem, Israel and additional clinical operations in Thailand and Malaysia. The lead product candidate, AlloStim\u00ae is an \"off-the-shelf\" non-genetically manipulated, living, immune cell immunotherapy protected by over 200 issued patents worldwide and derived from precursors purified from the blood of healthy donors. AlloStim\u00ae is a platform drug, that is broadly applicable to cancer and infectious disease indications. AlloStim\u00ae is being evaluated in a Phase IIb open-label clinical study in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer at 4 sites in USA, and in a Phase II/III randomized, controlled clinical study in advanced/metastatic liver cancer at 5 sites in Thailand and 3 sites in Malaysia. In addition, AlloStim\u00ae is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial in 40 healthy adults over 65yo in the USA as a means to reverse immunosenescence and restore broad universal respiratory viral protection in seniors against both known viruses (such as influenza A and B, RSV and coronavirus) and currently unknown viral pathogens, including emerging viruses with pandemic potential.\n\nContact:\n\nSandya von der Weid\n\nLifeSci Advisors\n\nEmail: svonderweid@lifesciadvisors.com\n\nAn image accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c8103b03-e221-4b34-9673-f70799172525",

The approval makes GARDASIL the first HPV vaccine approved for use in males in China. GARDASIL is now indicated in China to prevent anal cancers caused by HPV Types 16 and 18, genital warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by HPV Types 6 and 11, and the following precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18: grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).\n\n\u201c The approval of GARDASIL for use in males 9-26 years old in China is a significant step forward in advancing public health,\u201d said Joseph Romanelli, president, Human Health International, Merck. \u201c Since first approval, our HPV vaccines have helped protect over 50 million females in China from certain HPV-related cancers and diseases. With this expanded approval, we look forward to helping protect this new population of Chinese males from certain HPV-related cancers and diseases.\u201d\n\nIndications for GARDASIL1\n\nGARDASIL is a vaccine indicated in females 9 through 45 years of age. GARDASIL is indicated for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by HPV Types 16 and 18, precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18, and for the prevention of genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.\n\nGARDASIL is indicated in males 9 through 26 years of age. GARDASIL is indicated for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV Types 16 and 18, and precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18, and for the prevention of genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.\n\nGARDASIL does not eliminate the necessity for vaccine recipients to undergo screening for cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers as recommended by a health care provider.\n\nGARDASIL has not been demonstrated to provide protection against diseases caused by:\n\n- HPV types not covered by the vaccine\n\n- HPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activity\n\nNot all vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nGARDASIL is not a treatment for external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN), or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).\n\nVaccination with GARDASIL may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.\n\nSelect Safety Information for GARDASIL\n\nGARDASIL is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL.\n\nBecause vaccinees may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following HPV vaccination. When syncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion. Safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL have not been established in pregnant women. The most common (\u22651.0%) adverse reactions were headache, fever, nausea, dizziness; and injection-site pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising. The duration of immunity of GARDASIL has not been established.\n\nDosage and Administration\n\nGARDASIL should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or anterolateral area of the thigh.\n\nFor GARDASIL, a complete vaccination regimen for individuals 9 through 26 years of age consists of 3 doses at the following schedule: 0, 2 months, 6 months.\n\nAbout Merck\n\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. For more than 130 years, we have brought hope to humanity through the development of important medicines and vaccines. We aspire to be the premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company in the world \u2013 and today, we are at the forefront of research to deliver innovative health solutions that advance the prevention and treatment of diseases in people and animals. We foster a diverse and inclusive global workforce and operate responsibly every day to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for all people and communities. For more information, visit www.merck.com and connect with us on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn.\n\nAbout Merck\u2019s global commitment to supply and access of HPV vaccines\n\nMerck is committed to working to ensure adequate global supply and supporting broader, equitable access to our HPV vaccines to help protect against certain HPV-related cancers and diseases.\n\nTo realize this commitment, Merck has made significant capital investments, including more than $2 billion to help increase capacity through additional manufacturing facilities that allowed for a nearly doubling of supply of our HPV vaccines from 2017-2020 and then, supply was doubled again between 2020-2024 to address increasing global demand. As a result, we expect to supply sufficient quantities of our HPV vaccines to meet anticipated demand and will continue to expand supply capacity in the future.\n\nGlobal equitable access to our HPV vaccines is a key part of our efforts and key partnerships help us achieve these goals. In 2024, Merck reaffirmed its commitment to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, through an agreement with UNICEF, to supply low- and middle-income countries with over 115 million doses of HPV vaccine by 2025, to appropriately support local immunization programs. Merck has consistently increased our supply commitment to Gavi from 1.7 million doses in 2017 to more than 30 million doses in 2024.\n\nAdditionally, we are working to ensure continued supply in countries with existing HPV vaccination programs and currently supply approximately 150 National Immunization Programs globally.\n\nForward-Looking Statement of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J., USA\n\nThis news release of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J., USA (the \u201ccompany\u201d) includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage.

However, it also had US$14.6b in cash, and so its net debt is US$23.5b.\n\nNYSE:MRK Debt to Equity History January 8th 2025\n\nHow Strong Is Merck's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Merck had liabilities of US$29.6b due within a year, and liabilities of US$43.4b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$14.6b in cash and US$12.5b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$45.8b.\n\nOf course, Merck has a titanic market capitalization of US$252.3b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nMerck has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.0. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 20.7 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Merck saw its EBIT drop by 9.8% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Merck can strengthen its balance sheet over time.

            "content": "BIOSECURE Act\n\nHaving had 12 months of political insecurity courtesy of the US BIOSECURE Act, 2025 has seen the beginning of upheaval in China\u2019s contract manufacturing space.\n\nThe Act, introduced in January 2024, aimed to block \u201cforeign adversary biotech companies of US national security concern,\u201d naming such big players as BGI Group, MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics. The bill achieved broad bipartisan support and passed with a 306 to 81 vote in the US House of Representatives back in September, triggering rumors that non-China based assets run by these companies could be divested.\n\nAnd such rumors have come to pass\u2026 to an extent. WuXi AppTec has announced a deal to sell its Advanced Therapies Unit (ATU) to Altaris for an undisclosed fee. The US-based investment firm will pick up a late phase/commercial viral manufacturing facility, a testing laboratory, a non-viral cell therapy plant, and a process development/early phase clinical manufacturing site, all in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It will also add capabilities in Oxford, UK inherited from WuXI AppTec\u2019s $135 million acquisition of Oxgene in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, WuXi Biologics is set to sell an Ireland vaccines manufacturing plant run by its joint venture WuXi Vaccines to its sole client, Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside of North America), who inked a 20-year $3 billion deal with the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) back in 2019.\n\nHowever, Jefferies analyst Cui Cui said in a note this sale is less to do with BIOSECURE and more because the facility \u201cno longer meets Wuxi Bio's ROI [return on investment] standards.\u201d In fact, Cui questions whether BIOSECURE \u2013 which was excluded from the US defense spending bill in December, causing WuXi Apptec and WuXi Biologics shares to spike \u2013 will actually come to fruition under the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cSenator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky), a key opponent of the BIOSECURE Act, is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee under the Trump presidency, whereas key supporter Brad Wenstrup is retiring,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMoreover, many believe Trump\u2019s government will likely be more business-oriented and that usage of Chinese CDMOs could help US pharma cut costs by 30-60%. Given lowering drug prices in the US is supported by both parties, allowing US pharma companies the flexibility to operate efficiently and maintain an optimal cost structure is essential.\u201d\n\nMerck and Hansoh\n\nOver to dealmaking, and the aforementioned Merck & Co. has entered into an exclusive global license agreement with China\u2019s Hansoh Pharma for preclinical candidate HS-10535.\n\nMerck will pay Hansoh $112 million upfront, though the Chinese firm, which retains the rights to the candidate in China, could receive up to $1.9 billion in milestone payments and royalties.\n\n\u201cThrough this agreement, we aim to build on our experience targeting incretin biology to evaluate HS-10535 and its potential to provide additional cardiometabolic benefits beyond weight reduction,\u201d Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories said.\n\nHS-10535 is an oral version of a small molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1s represent the current wave in blockbusters, specifically for diabetes and weight loss (though other indications are being investigated).\n\nThe modality has been driving the toplines for pioneers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, though other Big Pharma firms are looking to join the party through licensing deals. For Merck, the Hansoh deal brings a second GLP-1 into its pipeline, having forged a partnership with Korea\u2019s Hanmi Pharma in 2020 to codevelop efinopegdutide for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nHansoh itself has a history of collaborating with Western pharma firms, with the firm inking with two billion-dollar-plus antibody drug conjugate deals with GSK in 2023.\n\nRoche and Innovent\n\nAnd talking of ADCs, fellow Big Pharma firm Roche has also been busy partnering in China, entering a collaboration with Suzhou-headquartered Innovent Biologics to develop DLL3-targeted candidate IBI3009.\n\nRoche, which is no stranger to ADC development with two products \u2013 Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) and Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) \u2013 on the market, will pay $80 million upfront though Innovent could receive up to $1 billion depending on development success.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to enter this partnership with the Innovent team to further develop this promising investigational treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Boris Za\u00eftra, head of Corporate Business Development at Roche, said. \u201cThis partnership builds on Roche's long history of innovation in the area of ADCs, to address the unmet needs of patients with solid tumors with transformational medicines.\"\n\nHaving shown encouraging anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor-bearing mouse models, IBI3009 entered into a Phase I study for small cell lung cancer began in December.\n\nSamsung Life Science Fund\n\nOver to Korea, and the Samsung Life Science Fund \u2013 a venture investment fund jointly established by Samsung C&T Corporation and its subsidiaries Samsung Biologics and Samsung Bioepis \u2013 has pledged to invest KRW 240 billion ($165 million) in Generate Biomedicines, a US-based biotech venture aimed at developing new technologies and businesses in life sciences.\n\nSpecifically, Generate Biomedicines focuses on protein design technologies using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The venture is also developing large-scale data accumulation capabilities to improve AI model performance and boost the success rate of novel drug development.\n\n\u201cWe have recognized Generate Biomedicine\u2019s potential to develop groundbreaking treatments,\u201d John Rim, CEO of Samsung Biologics, told Korean outlet The Bio. \u201cWe look forward to leveraging their expertise in AI and machine learning to build a collaborative ecosystem in development, manufacturing, and R&D, advancing the next-generation pharmaceuticals that our customers need.\u201d\n\nGenerate Biomedicine plans to launch three to six clinical programs over the next 18 months.",

It is the latest boost for Merck\u2019s Ireland production network, which the spokesperson said has seen investments of over $3 billion over the past three years. This includes expansions at Merck\u2019s biologics facilities in Carlow and Dunboyne, County Meath.\n\nMerck should be familiar with the facility as it was commissioned in 2019 by contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) WuXi Vaccines specifically to service a 20-year contract valued at $3 billion with the then undisclosed pharma giant.\n\n\u201cAs part of MSD\u2019s continuous assessment of its operations and evolving business needs, the company believes that the WuXi Vaccines facility aligns well with our business objectives,\u201d we were told.\n\nAccording to one Reddit post, rumors the WuXi Vaccines site might be offloaded to Merck were circling as early as August\n\nBIO(not so)SECURE?\n\nThe sale comes amid political pressure on WuXi Vaccines\u2019 parent company WuXi Biologics, which was named in the BIOSECURE Act. If it becomes law, the Act will restrict US firms from working with WuXi Biologics along with a number of other Chinese service providers.\n\nThe US House of Representatives approved the bill in September, triggering speculation that WuXi Biologics and fellow CDMO WuXi Apptec could put some of their operations up for sale. Rumors have already turned into reality, with the latter\u2019s Advanced Therapies Unit (ATU) recently snapped up by US healthcare-focused investment firm Altaris.\n\nHowever, unlike WuXi ATU, which is mostly operated from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the BIOSECURE Act may not have played as big a part in the decision to sell the Ireland site.\n\nThe facility \u201cno longer meets Wuxi Bio's ROI [return on investment] standards,\u201d Jefferies analyst Cui Cui wrote in a note. \u201cPer management, this transaction would help Wuxi Bio to optimize capacity resources and is unaffected by the BIOSECURE Act.\u201d In fact, a separate biologics facility in Ireland will continue to be operated by WuXi Biologics.\n\nMoreover, Cui suggests the Trump administration may not reinitiate BIOSECURE when it takes power later this month. \u201cSenator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky), a key opponent of the BIOSECURE Act, is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee under the Trump presidency, whereas key supporter Brad Wenstrup is retiring.\n\n\u201cMoreover, many believe Trump\u2019s government will likely be more business-oriented and that usage of Chinese CDMOs could help US pharma cut costs by 30-60%.

This news comes shortly after its parent company, WuXi AppTec, revealed plans to reduce its operational footprint.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close within the first half of 2025. Proceeds from the sale will be used for share buybacks, according to Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics.\n\nThe Dundalk site, which has been operating since 2021 and was initially built with an investment of US$240 million under a partnership with Merck, was nearly fully booked for 2025, with a robust client pipeline. It houses drug product and substance manufacturing, as well as a quality control lab. The site employs approximately 800 people. Merck\u2019s acquisition expands its Irish presence to eight sites, further strengthening its global vaccine manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe sale follows broader strategic efforts by both WuXi Biologics and its sister company, WuXi AppTec, to divest assets in light of potential regulatory shifts, particularly related to the Biosecure Act. This Act, if passed, would prohibit US pharmaceutical companies from engaging with Chinese manufacturers, including WuXi, which relies heavily on US customers.\n\n\u201cThe world-class facility is designed and built to support MSD\u2019s business growth strategy, and this transaction highlights our capability of building and operating the state-of-the-art complex vaccine manufacturing facilities meeting stringent standards of global vaccine leaders,\u201d stated Dr. Chris Chen, Chairman of WuXi Vaccines. He added that the transaction allows MSD to integrate vaccine production more effectively into its global manufacturing network and enables WuXi to enhance asset efficiency, focus on CDMO services in Suzhou, China, and utilise proceeds to strengthen its global operations and CDMO services.\n\nWuXi Vaccines continues to operate a manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, and is constructing a new plant in Singapore to focus on its CDMO services and enhance efficiency.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday, was devoted to global health in the decades following his time in office, particularly through his nongovernmental organization The Carter Center. Along the way, Carter collaborated with some of the biggest pharma companies in the world to deliver innovations that addressed daunting global challenges.\n\nLaunched a few years after his re-election loss in 1980, The Carter Center pulled together a range of major partners including multiple governments, official health organizations, large philanthropic foundations and pharma companies. Carter set his sights on infectious diseases like Guinea worm, meeting with African heads of state to bring interventions to affected countries. That got the ball rolling for the former president and his organization to branch out to other infectious diseases, invoking the help of the pharmaceutical sector for needed treatments.\n\n\u201cAs a tireless advocate for health and social justice, President Carter was a compassionate and committed voice for impoverished communities worldwide,\u201d the World Health Organization wrote in tribute. \u201cHis unwavering dedication to combating neglected tropical diseases leaves an unparalleled legacy in global health, saving millions from debilitating illnesses.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the pharma companies that joined Carter in his efforts to leverage the powerful public platform for good.\n\nMerck & Co.\n\nMerck teamed up with The Carter Center in the 1980s to work toward eradicating river blindness, an infectious disease that primarily affects African countries. What started as a large donation of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin \u2014 which was branded as Mectizan and also a part of Merck\u2019s veterinary portfolio \u2014 became a promise to donate \u201cas much as needed, for as long as needed\u201d to treat patients with river blindness, according to a Merck tribute. The drug has been free for that purpose since 1987.\n\nCarter and then-Merck CEO Dr. Roy Vagelos visited Chad together in 1994, where they distributed Mectizan for a small village in which nearly everyone was afflicted with the disease, according to a release at the time.\n\n\"The Mectizan donation story is a powerful reminder that it is possible to help people change their lives,\" Carter said. \"This partnership among private, public and nonprofit organizations has significantly improved the health of millions of Africans who are at risk for river blindness.\"\n\nMuch later, when Carter was diagnosed with melanoma in 2015, the former president received Merck\u2019s leading cancer drug Keytruda as a treatment.\n\nGSK\n\nIn 1998, an executive from the company called SmithKline Beecham spoke with Carter and offered to become part of a drug donation program. The former president immediately took the executive up on the offer, according to a report this week in the New York Times.\n\nThe U.K. drugmaker, now GSK, has worked with The Carter Center since that time to donate and distribute the medicine albendazole \u2014 along with Merck\u2019s Mectizan \u2014 to treat lymphatic filariasis, a mosquito-borne disease also known as elephantiasis. The disfiguring disease affects millions in Nigeria and nearby African countries.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nJ&J has collaborated with The Carter Center since the early 2000s to provide medical supplies and consumer products like Tylenol and Neosporin to countries impacted by Guinea worm. The supplies have helped communities in Africa mitigate infections, according to The Carter Center.\n\n\"With less than [3%] of the original caseload left to tackle, this significant new corporate commitment from Johnson & Johnson provides critical momentum for total eradication,\" President Carter said in a 2001 release when J&J donated supplies.\n\nThe company has continued to provide support to treat neglected tropical diseases.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer and The Carter Center have worked together since 1998 to bring hundreds of millions of doses of the antibiotic Zithromax to sub-Saharan Africa in the fight against the infectious eye disease blinding trachoma. Along with the International Trachoma Initiative, the company has now donated 1 billion doses to more than 40 countries.\n\n\u201cThe Pfizer donation of Zithromax was momentous in trachoma control, and The Carter Center was pleased to go to scale in trachoma endemic countries to get the medicine into the villages and demonstrate the world could end blinding trachoma,\u201d Carter said in 2013, celebrating 15 years of collaboration.\n\nAmgen\n\nCarter visited Amgen\u2019s headquarters in 1991 to thank the company for donating 398,000 vials of the anemia treatment Epogen to China through The Carter Center. The company commemorated the moment in a post on LinkedIn early last year.",

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced in a press release published on January 10, that it will examine application for marketing authorization for the antiviral pill developed by Pfizer. Both Pfizer and Merck antiviral drugs have been hailed as potentially revolutionary in the fight against Covid-19, as studies show they reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in patients at increased risk of developing a severe form of the disease. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Merck & Co.\u2019s Covid-19 antivirals are getting a new lease of life in post-pandemic China, as cat owners seize on them as antidotes to a life-threatening disease caused by a coronavirus that infects their feline companions.\n\nPeople are feeding their furry friends Merck\u2019s Lagevrio to treat Feline Infectious Peritonitis, a fatal disease that until recently had no readily available treatment, local media outlet Jiemian reported this week.\n\nThe move has been a hot topic on social media, with tens of thousands of cat lovers taking to Xiaohongshu, China\u2019s version of Instagram, to discuss how the drugs saved their pets, along with money on expensive veterinary bills.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 drugs for humans saved my cat\u2019s life,\u201d one user wrote on Xiaohongshu. \u201cI share the notes here to teach more people to save their furry babies and reduce the pain suffered by cats.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the foreign antivirals, some pet owners also have opted for similar but cheaper Covid medicines developed by homegrown companies including Henan Genuine Biotech Co., Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co.\n\nA spokesperson for Merck said in an emailed response to Bloomberg News that the company hasn\u2019t tested the drug on cats and has no plans to do so.\n\nChinese pet owner\u2019s use of human Covid drugs on animals is in stark contrast to the early days of the pandemic, when the use by people of ivermectin in the US \u2014 a drug to treat parasitic worms in animals \u2014 prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to post the words of caution: \u201cYou are not a horse. You are not a cow. Stop it.\u201d\n\nFeline Infectious Peritonitis is a viral disease caused by the so-called feline coronavirus that infects white blood cells before spreading throughout a cat\u2019s body, causing inflammatory reactions. The disease is fatal without treatment. FIP is unique to cats, and not contagious to people, dogs, or other animals.\n\nNo specific treatment was available until recently. Some antiviral drugs have proved to be effective, but they aren\u2019t widely accessible. The most popular, GS-441524, developed by Gilead Sciences, hasn\u2019t been approved by the FDA, and cat owners often seek the drug through black market sources.\n\nChinese cat owners have to rely on informal networks to purchase GS-441524, which often cost tens of thousands of yuan. On Chinese social media, many people complain the drug is too expensive and that many black market sellers gave them a fake version.\n\nHuman Covid antivirals are much more affordable, they said. A 40-pill bottle of Lagevrio, for example, costs about 1,725 yuan ($236) online, and is enough to treat more than one cats. In addition to the drugs, Chinese cat owners also feed their pets nutritional supplements developed for humans, because they are cheaper than veterinary drugs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why medicines for pets are so expensive,\u201d wrote one Xiaohongshu user. \u201cYou just need to adjust the dosage of human medicines if you are going to use them on cats.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Kari Lindberg.\n\n(Updates with company response in paragraph six)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Of 150 C-suite executives from pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies surveyed by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, 75% said they believe 2025 will indeed be a happy new year for their companies and the broader industry. They based that optimism on a combination of factors that include expectations for strong growth (68% anticipated revenue increases) and the pace of science and technology innovation.\n\nThose conditions can be expected to revive both the number and value of life sciences merger and acquisition (M&A) deals following a down year in 2024, according to analysis by PwC. That activity should be visible across biotech, pharmaceutical, and medtech (a category that includes diagnostics as well as health information systems and medical devices), according to the firm.\n\nSome of these predictions are among the seven biopharma-related trends that GEN has uncovered in its interviews with experts and other industry stakeholders, and in its reviews of reports and public statements. These trends are detailed below:\n\nAI: Growth beyond discovery algorithms\n\nHaving ensconced itself in drug discovery and development, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised for even further growth. Nearly 60% of biopharma executives surveyed by Deloitte said they plan to increase generative AI investments across their value chains.\n\n\u201cWe are moving from the experimentation and hype stage to the \u2018How am I using it to improve my business?\u2019 stage. That shift happened over the course of this year, and I think we\u2019ll see it even more next year,\u201d Pete Lyons, a vice chair with Deloitte and the firm\u2019s U.S. Life Sciences Sector Leader, told GEN Edge.\n\nExecutives plan to expand AI use beyond drug discovery algorithms, to greater use of gen AI at scale across business operations, Lyons said: \u201cI think it will change jobs, not necessarily cost jobs. And this isn\u2019t the first technology that we\u2019ve seen over the last many decades that has come through to make folks more efficient.\n\nMore AI in biopharma is expected to spur more growth for leading AI-based drug developers. Recursion combined with Exscientia for a reported $688 million in November, nine months after firing its founder, CEO, and principal executive officer Andrew Hopkins, PhD, for what its board termed \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationships with two employees. Insilico Medicine published peer-reviewed details of its inflammatory bowel disease program and has grown its pipeline to 31 programs, 10 of them progressing to clinical phases\u2014led by ISM001-055, an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis candidate the company plans to advance into a potentially pivotal trial.\n\nWhile some drug developers will continue building out their own AI platforms, others will simply partner with other companies: \u201cpeople have largely migrated to in-licensing to get those AI technologies, as promising as they may be, deployed in their own internal development programs,\u201d Roel Van den Akker, a partner with PwC US and the firm\u2019s Pharmaceutical and & Life Science Deals Leader, told GEN Edge.\n\nA growing presence in biopharma AI helped propel Silicon Valley-based microprocessing giant Nvidia to a market capitalization\u2014the product of the share price and the number of outstanding shares\u2014surpassing $3 trillion in 2024, and a 10-for-1 stock split that took effect in June. Heading into 2025, those new Nvidia shares have all but plateaued, finishing December down 0.55%.\n\nYet at least one Wall Street watcher predicted December 28 that the company\u2019s stock \u201ccould double in 2025\u201d based on expectations of solid demand for its next-generation NVIDIA Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture, announced last March, and Taiwanese media reports that Nvidia is one of four global tech giants for which Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) plans to ramp up production of 4 nm wafers at its $12 billion semiconductor fabrication plant in Phoenix, set to begin phased operations this year.\n\nCANCER VACCINES: Gathering late-stage data\n\nThe quest to develop a cancer vaccine will see continued late-stage data gathering in 2025. Among leading developers, Moderna and Merck in October launched their third Phase III trial (NCT06623422) for their individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) that Moderna calls mRNA-4157 and Merck, V940. INTerpath-009 is evaluating the combination of adjuvant INT plus Merck\u2019s Keytruda\u00ae (pembrolizumab) for some types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following Keytruda and chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cWe do continue to discuss with our partner, Merck additional Phase III programs. We will start new ones in the coming year that we haven\u2019t yet announced,\u201d Moderna\u2019s President Stephen Hoge told analysts November 7 on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call.\n\nModerna and Merck are using Personalis\u2019 ImmunoID NeXT\u00ae comprehensive tumor tissue profiling platform. Last month, Personalis said Moderna will continue using ImmunoID NeXT through a multi-year extension of undisclosed value\u2014while Merck agreed to buy $50 million of Personalis stock in a private placement at the December 18 closing price of $3.56 per share. The deal gave Merck a roughly 16.5% ownership stake in Personalis (14+ million shares).\n\nBioNTech plans to report data this year from a Phase II trial (BNT111-01; NCT04526899) of BNT111 plus Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\u2019 marketed drug Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab-rwlc) in patients with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory/relapsed, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. BioNTech is partnering with Regeneron to conduct the trial. BNT111 is based on BioNTech\u2019s wholly owned, off-the-shelf FixVac platform, and encodes shared melanoma associated antigens.\n\nLater this year or in 2026, BioNTech plans to disclose interim data from its Phase II trial (NCT04486378) of autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457) in stage II high-risk and III circulating tumor DNA+ (ctDNA) adjuvant CRC. BioNTech is developing autogene cevumeran in collaboration with Genentech, a Member of the Roche Group. BioNTech also has a third cancer vaccine under development\u2014BNT113, which is also FixVac-based but encodes Human Papilloma Virus 16 (HPV16) antigens.\n\nWhile BioNTech and Moderna-Merck have shown success in adjuvant settings, OSE Immunotherapeutics has also reported positive results for its T-cell epitope (neoepitope)-based cancer vaccine Tedopi\u00ae (OSE2101), an off-the-shelf immunotherapy targeting five tumor-associated antigens.\n\nDuring the first half of 2025, OSE expects to complete full activation of sites for its global randomized Phase III ARTEMIA registrational trial (NCT06472245) assessing Tedopi. Launched in September, ARTEMIA will compare the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment with Tedopi vs. standard of care (docetaxel) in HLA-A2 positive patients with metastatic NSCLC with secondary resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor. The primary endpoint is overall survival.\n\n\u201cFor cancer vaccines, there were decades of failure, but now we have seen new really intriguing data from Moderna and BioNTech in non-randomized trials, really promising. Others have generated really interesting data. And we are generating survival data in our randomized trial,\u201d Poirier said.\n\n\u201cWe need more and more data, more success to create confidence in this technology,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure in the end, all of these different technologies will find their place in the therapeutic arsenal for the needs of patients.\u201d\n\nFINANCE: VC deals, IPOs bouncing back\n\nBiopharma startups are likelier to see larger venture capital (VC) financings and more of them in 2025 if encouraging figures seen in the third quarter of 2024 continue their positive direction.\n\nWhile full-year 2024 figures were not yet available at deadline, third quarter numbers released by J.P. Morgan based on data from DealForma showed $20.8 billion in 319 VC financings during the first three quarters of the year just ended, trending toward an estimated $27.7 billion in 425 financings for the full year.\n\nIf full-year numbers meet or surpass that estimate, it would reverse two straight years of declines in financing dollars, though not in the number of financings, as larger investments have gone to fewer companies. The VC market has fallen from post-COVID highs of $44 billion in 756 deals in 2021, skidding to $27.9 billion in 543 deals the following year, then further tumbling to $23.5 billion in 464 deals in 2023.\n\nFor 2024, however, JPM and DealForma cited \u201csustained bullish signals\u201d that included the 0.5% cut in the prime interest rate by the Federal Reserve in September: \u201cRates have correlated with deal activity in the past, so we may see biopharma deal and funding activity increase through Q4 2024.\u201d\n\nXaira Therapeutics enjoyed 2024\u2019s largest VC financing, launching with more than $1 billion in a round led by ARCH Venture Partners and Foresite Capital. Xaira was one of 77 biopharmas that raised venture rounds of $100 million or more through Q3 2024, already surpassing the 73 such rounds in all of 2023.\n\nThe initial public offering (IPO) market is expected to bounce back further during 2025 after showing signs of recovery over the past year. Biopharma IPOs peaked in 2021 as the scramble to develop COVID-19 drugs and vaccines sparked investor interest in developers of treatments and jabs in a variety of other therapeutic areas.\n\n\u201cIt will not go back to 2021 levels, but it will definitely bounce back from what we saw in \u201924,\u201d PwC\u2019s Van den Akker predicted. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of companies in the green room based on confidential filings, and there\u2019s a little bit of timing aspect to IPOs that\u2019s very impactful.\u201d\n\nSixteen companies went public on U.S. exchanges during January-September 2024, raising a combined $3 billion\u2014already surpassing the $2.7 billion raised by 13 IPOs in all of 2023. The largest biopharma IPOs of 2024 was the $437 million gross IPO of cancer drug developer CG Oncology, which began with an initial $380 million offering, followed by the $410.7 million gross IPO of AI-based precision medicine company Tempus, which generated $382 million in net proceeds.\n\nGENE EDITING: Revenue, reform, and history\n\n2024 saw Vertex Pharmaceuticals generate its first commercial revenue from the first patient dosed with the first FDA-approved CRISPR therapy, Casgevy\u00ae (\u201cexa-cel\u201d or exagamglogene autotemcel), which it co-developed with CRISPR Therapeutics\u2014$2 million during the third quarter, included within the $2.772 billion in product revenue that Vertex reported for Q3.\n\nFar more in revenue could be potentially generated from CRISPR therapies\u2014and far more such treatments could reach the patients who need them, Fyodor Urnov, PhD, director, technology & translation at the Innovative Genomics Institute and professor of molecular and cell biology at University of California, Berkeley, asserted in a 6,000-word guest editorial in the October 2024 issue of The CRISPR Journal (a sister journal of GEN, published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.)\n\nUrnov urged drug developers to move beyond clinical programs that study just a single mutation in a given disease gene, and called for regulators to reform their reviews so that multiple guide RNAs could be considered within a single Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and for academic and industry researchers to create \u201cCRISPR Cures Centers\u201d where academic and industry researchers partnered on therapy design, manufacturing, animal studies, and clinical care through tertiary hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn the name of all the patients currently living with clinically editable genetic disease, and those who will be born to live with it\u2014we have to give Cas a chance,\u201d Urnov wrote. \u201cThe time for the reform advocated for the above is now.\u201d\n\nGene editing technologies beyond CRISPR also advanced during 2024 and stand poised to progress further. During 2025, Prime Medicine expects to report initial clinical data from the first human trial of a prime editing therapy, a Phase I/II study (NCT06559176) of PM359, an ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) product designed to treat chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients with a mutation in p47phox. Prime gained FDA clearance for the first human trials of a prime editing therapy last April.\n\nAlso in the new year, Wave Life Sciences anticipates sharing multi-dose data from its Phase Ib/IIa RestorAATion-2 trial (NCT06405633) assessing its alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) candidate WVE-006. Wave made clinical history in October when it announced that WVE-006 succeeded in the first-ever clinical demonstration of RNA editing in humans by achieving positive proof-of-mechanism in RestorAATion-2.\n\nM&A: Patent cliff to drive mid-range deals\n\nThe improving VC and IPO markets are giving market watchers hope for a rebound in the merger and acquisition (M&A) activity long cherished by investors as the most lucrative avenues for cashing in on their investments.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s Lyons said larger biopharmas are eager to replenish pipelines that will shrivel in coming years through \u201cpatent cliff\u201d loss of exclusivity on numerous blockbuster drugs\u2014such as Johnson & Johnson/Bayer\u2019s blood thinner Xarelto\u00ae (rivaroxaban), Boehringer Ingelheim/Eli Lilly\u2019s Jardiance\u00ae (empagliflozin), and AstraZeneca\u2019s top-selling drug Farxiga\u00ae (dapagliflozin). Jardiance and Farxiga are both sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors indicated for type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure.\n\nAs a result, M&A is expected to bounce back from a year-over-year decrease in the dollar volume and number of transactions during the first three quarters of 2024. J.P. Morgan and DealForma reported 71 M&A deals totaling $43.2 billion between January\u2013September 2024, compared with 75 deals totaling $61.1 billion in Q1\u2013Q3 2023.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. One is just the general economy, with companies wanting to understand, where are we going with interest rates, and are we getting to a level of stability on that? I also think that the election and the geopolitical environment played into that as well,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThe economy has stabilized, in terms of a better view of where interest rates are going. And I also think now with the understanding of who\u2019s in the administration, we will see more M&A activity.\u201d\n\nDuring 2023, 106 M&A deals valued at a total $117.9 billion took place, a figure skewed by Pfizer\u2019s $43 billion acquisition of Seagen.\n\nIn 2025, PwC\u2019s Van den Akker said, his firm expects sustained M&A activity for mid-range transactions ranging in value from $5 billion and $15 billion\u2014deals priced below the values of blockbuster combos like Pfizer-Seagen, but above \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions of under $5 billion.\n\nAt the high end of that bolt-on range is 2024\u2019s priciest acquisition\u2014Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 $4.9 billion buyout of Alpine Immune Sciences, announced in April 2024 and completed the following month. The deal expanded Vertex\u2019s specialty drug pipeline with Alpine\u2019s IgA nephropathy (IgAN) candidate povetacicept, for which the Phase III RAINIER trial (NCT06564142) launched in October.\n\n\u201cThe right deals will get done if the strategic and industrial logic is there. And we still have fantastic strides that are being made in innovation across all the therapeutic areas that we all, as watchers that are passionate about this industry, are tracking,\u201d Van den Akker said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have that gap around the revenue that needs to be addressed. And corporate balance sheets are still good from a cash perspective. I think that is a very healthy setup for M&A activity levels into 2025.\u201d\n\nOMICS: Expansion and consolidation\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) tools developers will further grow their footprints into multiomics tools and tech following expansion efforts during 2024. NGS leader Illumina catapulted into multiomics in July when it acquired Fluent BioSciences, a single-cell technology developer, for an undisclosed price.\n\nLast February, Element Biosciences announced a partnership allowing customers to stream data from its AVITI\u2122 System directly to users of DNAnexus\u2019 multiomic analysis platform\u2014while Singular Genomics Systems added high-throughput multiomics and novel in situ direct sequencing of RNA (Direct-Seq\u2122) targeted transcriptomics to its portfolio by unveiling its G4X\u2122 Spatial Sequencer, the first of which was shipped to an early access customer in the third quarter. Singular found a buyer in December when it agreed to be acquired by Deerfield Management Company, for $20 per share.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of innovation coming out now that is pushing us from being a genomics company to a multiomics company,\u201d Illumina CEO Jacob Thaysen, PhD, told GEN in an interview about his first year at the company\u2019s helm.\n\nSpatial biology will see fewer but larger tools developers among leading companies following consolidations during 2024. In October the two largest private companies in the field combined as Vizgen and Ultivue merged into a single provider of single-cell spatial genomics and multiplex proteomic profiling technologies.\n\nAs for public companies, Bruker acquired NanoString Technologies for $392.6 million cash plus assumption of liabilities in May after winning a competitive auction. Three months earlier, NanoString filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, blaming a $31 million jury award assessed against it in a patent infringement case filed by rival 10x Genomics. 10x defended its strategy of aggressively litigating potential infringement of its patents, after several academic researchers, many of them customers, echoed criticisms of the company made by some of its competitors in a commentary published in GEN.\n\nDuring 2024, Bruker rolled out new technology for its CellScape\u2122 Precise Spatial Proteomics platform for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF). 10x brought to market several new features for its Xenium In Situ single-cell spatial imaging platform and a new-and-improved HD version of its Visium Spatial Gene Expression platform. 10x also launched two new products from its Chromium single-cell analysis line aimed at expanding its customer base by emphasizing reduced costs as well as top-tier performance for both larger- and smaller-scale projects.\n\nTRUMP 2.0: Going \u201cwild\u201d on biopharma, health\n\nBiopharma and public health are bracing themselves for convulsive changes in regulatory policy and policymaking approaches they expect as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House later this month.\n\nTrump signaled his intent to disrupt both days after his election win by announcing he wanted Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to \u201cgo wild on health\u201d by nominating him for Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Kennedy will head a subgroup of Trump appointees committed to his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda, along with Marty Makary, MD, as FDA commissioner, and Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, as NIH director. All three have severely criticized measures promulgated to limit the spread of COVID-19, with Kennedy also taking aim at the safety of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and Makary at vaccination schedules.\n\nOne area of medicine that Kennedy has pledged to encourage at HHS is psychedelic drugs. Several public companies in the space saw their stocks rise soon after Kennedy emerged as Trump\u2019s choice for HHS, on the expectation that he would catalyze psych drug development.\n\n\u201cHe is a free thinker and slightly unpredictable, I would say, but to me it feels as if he is interested in radically reforming the way medications are being approved. So, he may be a catalyst. But I think it all boils down to the data,\u201d said Hans Eriksson, MD, PhD, chief medical officer (CMO) of HMNC Brain Health, a developer of precision psychiatry therapies focused treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nThe psych drug field suffered a setback in August when the FDA issued a complete response letter rejecting Lykos Therapeutics\u2019 new drug application (NDA) for midomafetamine capsules to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. The FDA requested Lykos conduct an additional Phase III trial\u2014something the company\u2019s new interim CEO and CMO agreed to in October.\n\n\u201c2024 was a bit marred by the disappointing outcome of the Lykos application with the rejection by the FDA. But I still think that there is much value in the psychedelic approach,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cThere are so many different players out there which all have their different small angle on how to achieve good efficacy with acceptable tolerability for patients with depression, PTSD, anxiety, and other disorders. So, I\u2019m really hoping for some sort of a catch-up effect that things will start to come off in 2025.\u201d\n\nWith its $100 million Series A financing in January 2024, Lykos was among psych drug companies winning large investor fundings over the past year. Reunion Neuroscience raised $103 million in Series A financing in May, while Seaport Therapeutics completed a $225 million Series B in October.\n\n\u201cAmong the things brought up in the debate over the past year have been, yes, it\u2019s very difficult to completely blind patients if they are getting a psychedelic with profound experiences. But would that really be a reason for us to reject that treatment option if it has many other advantages? I think investors have come to an understanding of that,\u201d Eriksson added.",

            "content": "It's been an excellent year for Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), a mid-cap biotech company. Thanks to impressive mid-stage clinical results, its stock skyrocketed in February. And although it's down from the all-time highs it hit earlier this year, it remains one of the better performers in the industry over the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, Viking's shares recently dropped massively -- by more than 10% -- in one day. And the stock is down 24% in the past month. What exactly caused this recent decline? Should investors take the opportunity to initiate a position? Let's find out.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nPotential competition from a leading drugmaker\n\nViking Therapeutics' leading candidate, VK2735, is a potential GLP-1 weight loss medicine. It reported excellent results in a phase 2 study. The company also has an oral formulation of VK2735, which is still in phase 1 clinical trials. Viking's oral version of its promising weight loss medicine could be particularly attractive since current GLP-1 options are administered via injection. So far, so good.\n\nBut on Dec. 18, pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE: MRK) announced its intentions to dip its toes into the fast-growing anti-obesity field. It penned an agreement with Hansoh Pharma, a China-based pharmaceutical company, to develop HS-10535, a pre-clinical oral GLP-1 weight loss candidate. Merck will obtain the exclusive license to develop this medicine and make a $112 million upfront payment to Hansoh Pharma; the latter will also be eligible for milestone payments and royalties, depending on the candidate's performance.\n\nThe news of a drugmaker as prominent as Merck entering the weight loss market was apparently too much for some of Viking's shareholders, leading to the massive correction in the stock.\n\nIs Viking Therapeutics stock still attractive?\n\nMerck's HS-10535 is still in pre-clinical testing -- not mid-stage, or even in early clinical studies. It will be years before it gets anywhere close to commercialization.\n\nMeanwhile, VK2735 and another of Viking's candidates -- VK2809, a potential medicine for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis -- are on the verge of kicking off phase 3 (late-stage) studies. Both delivered strong results in mid-stage trials. That doesn't guarantee success in phase 3 studies, but neither do encouraging pre-clinical results.\n\nPerhaps investors think HS-10535 is a potential competitor for Viking's oral formulation of VK2735, which is undergoing phase 1 studies. But even there, the mid-cap biotech is ahead of the game. A more apt comparison would be between HS-10535 and Viking's own (still unnamed) pre-clinical weight loss program -- a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels, while calcitonin regulates calcium levels.\n\nWe're now familiar with the power of dual agonists to treat weight loss. VK2735 is a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, as is Eli Lilly's famous drug Zepbound. Viking's pre-clinical dual amylin/calcitonin program showed promise in rats and mice. We don't know how well HS-10535 has performed yet, but it seems unlikely that Merck would dish out $112 million without a good reason.\n\nHaving to deal with one more fierce competitor in the weight loss arena will be a bit of a challenge for Viking Therapeutics. That said, very few drugmakers of any size have shown the kind of progress in developing weight loss medicines that Viking has. In my view, these recent developments do little to change the company's prospects.\n\nIt's true that Viking will remain somewhat risky as long as it doesn't have a single product on the market. That comes with the territory when investing in clinical-stage biotech stocks. Still, for those who already were willing to handle this level of risk, not much has changed because of Merck's announcement. Viking Therapeutics is still one of the better biotech companies of its stature to invest in, so the recent dip does represent an opportunity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Merck\u2019s high-priced acquisition finally got the nod in the UK for a rare lung condition, and the FDA greenlit an injectable version of BMS\u2019 blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved Winrevair (sotatercept) for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare disease that causes high blood pressure in the lungs and can eventually lead to organ failure. Merck scored FDA approval for Winrevair in March 2024 and in the E.U. in August.\n\nThe drug was believed to be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for a disease with a very high mortality rate, Jeremy Feldman, director of the pulmonary hypertension program and medical director for high-risk care at Summit Heath, told BioSpace at the time. The new therapeutic class targets an underlying cause of PAH, improving the balance between pro- and anti-proliferative signaling.\n\nIn 2021, Merck paid $11.5 billion to acquire Acceleron Pharma, with sotatercept, a first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH, as the lead asset. The drug is expected to be a potential blockbuster for Merck, with the PAH market projected to reach a value of $12.2 billion by 2032. As of Merck\u2019s third quarter earnings report, the drug had already posted sales of $219 million since its March launch and is expected to top $1.5 billion in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the pond, BMS scored a late December win when the FDA approved its bestselling cancer drug Opdivo in an injectable version on Monday. The anti-PD-1 therapy is approved in a number of oncological indications including melanomas, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancers and more. It was first approved as a 30-minute intravenous infusion given every two or four weeks.\n\nDubbed Opdivo Qvantig, BMS worked with Halozyme Therapeutics to bring the intravenous infusion to subcutaneous formulation. The new injectable version is expected to enhance patient convenience and may help protect BMS sales erosion as the IV formulation approaches the dreaded patent cliff in 2028. It\u2019s approved for most previously approved adult, solid tumor indications as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Opdivo brought in $6.8 billion in sales as BMS\u2019 top-selling cancer product. This year, BMS is undergoing a \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d that is expected to generate around $1.5 billion in cost savings for the pharma giant.\n\nCorrection (Jan. 7): This story has been updated to correctly state that Opdivo Qvantig is approved for most, not all, previously approved adult, solid tumor indications.",

This blocks the blood flow through the lungs, which raises blood pressure and results in a significant strain on the heart.\n\nThe disease progresses rapidly for many patients and leads to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy.\n\nWinrevair, which has a recommended dosing schedule of one injection every three weeks via self-administration, acts on the causes of PAH responsible for the narrowing of the arteries in the lungs and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood to the lungs.\n\nThe MHRA\u2019s decision on the drug was supported by positive results from the phase 3 STELLAR trial, in which Winrevair taken alongside background standard of care therapies led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the study\u2019s primary endpoint of six-minute walk distance of 40.8 metres compared to placebo plus standard of care.\n\nThe Winrevair combination was also shown to significantly improve multiple important secondary outcome measures, including reducing the risk of death or clinical worsening.\n\nJulian Beach, MHRA interim executive director, healthcare quality and access, said: \u201cWe\u2019re assured that the appropriate regulatory standards for the approval of this medicine have been met. As with all products, we will keep its safety under close review.\u201d\n\nThe approval comes just over a month after Merck shared positive top-line results from the phase 3 ZENITH study, which has been evaluating Winrevair against placebo, both on top of background PAH therapy, in adults with World Health Organization functional classes three or four at high risk of mortality.\n\nThe study met its primary endpoint, with Winrevair demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of morbidity or mortality events compared to placebo, leading an independent data monitoring committee to recommended that the trial be stopped early and all patients be offered the opportunity to receive Winrevair in an open-label extension study.",

(Credit: Merck & Co., Inc.)\n\nThe UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved Merck\u2019s sotatercept to treat adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\n\nSotatercept is intended for use alongside other medications to treat PAH in adults with moderate to severe physical activity limitations. It is designed to help improve exercise capacity.\n\nMerck, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, gained access to the drug via the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma for $11.5bn in late 2021.\n\nThe drug works by targeting the activin protein, which plays a key role in narrowing lung arteries. This mechanism helps make it easier for the heart to pump blood to the lungs, thereby enhancing the ability to be physically active.\n\nThe recommended dosing schedule for sotatercept is one self-administered injection every three weeks.\n\nSotatercept, sold as Winrevair, was approved in the US in March 2024. It is also approved in the European Union and 30 other markets.\n\nMHRA Healthcare Quality and Access interim executive director Julian Beach said: \u201cKeeping patients safe and enabling their access to high quality, safe and effective medical products are key priorities for us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re assured that the appropriate regulatory standards for the approval of this medicine have been met. As with all products, we will keep its safety under close review.\u201d\n\nThe approval is based on data from a key study involving 323 patients with PAH. The results demonstrated that Winrevair is more effective than a placebo at improving exercise ability in adults with PAH.\n\nThe primary measure of effectiveness was the difference in the distance patients could walk in six minutes before and after treatment.\n\nAfter 24 weeks of treatment, Winrevair, when used alongside other PAH medications, improved walking distance by approximately 34m, compared to just 1m in the placebo group.\n\nThe median treatment difference between the sotatercept and placebo groups was 40.8m.\n\nThe MHRA said that it will continue to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of sotatercept.\n\nIn November last year, Merck announced that Winrevair had met the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 ZENITH study in adults with PAH.",

            "content": "The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, police announced Tuesday.\n\nThe woman, Debrina Kawam, had worked at the pharmaceutical giant Merck in from 2000 until 2002, but her life at some point took a rocky turn. She had briefly been in a New York homeless shelter after moving to the city recently, the Department of Social Services said. It did not say when.\n\nPolice had an address for Kawam in Toms River, a community on the Jersey Shore, and authorities said they notified her family about her Dec. 22 death. The Associated Press left messages Tuesday for possible relatives.\n\n\u201cHearts go out to the family \u2014 a horrific incident to have to live through,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said at an unrelated news briefing.\n\nIt came hours before another harrowing act of violence on the nation\u2019s busiest subway system.\n\nA 45-year-old man was pushed onto the tracks ahead of an oncoming train at a station under Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood about 1:30 p.m., police said. The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and police said they had a person of interest in custody.\n\nPersonal safety in the subways is generally comparable to safety in the city as a whole. But life-threatening crimes such as stabbings and shoves spread alarm about the trains that have carried more than 1 billion riders over the course of this year.\n\nPolice figures show major crimes on subways were down this year through November, compared with the same period last year, but killings rose from five to nine.\n\nIn Karam\u2019s case, prosecutors have said she was asleep on a subway train that was stopped at a station in Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island when her clothes were set ablaze by a stranger, Sebastian Zapeta.\n\nZapeta, 33, allegedly fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned.\n\nIdentifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday that they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her.\n\nZapeta has been been indicted on murder and arson charges. He has not entered a plea, and his lawyer has declined to comment outside court.\n\nFederal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support.\n\nZapeta was arrested after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students.\n\nProsecutors have said Zapeta subsequently told police that he was the man in surveillance photos and videos of the fire being ignited, but that he drinks a lot of liquor and does not know what happened.\n\nHe is currently jailed, and his next court date is Jan. 7.\n\nWhile it is not clear why Kawam was asleep in a subway car, New York\u2019s subways often unofficially function as a refuge for homeless people. In theory, legal settlements give homeless individuals a broad right to shelter in the city, but some turn to the trains if they are unable to stay in shelters or fearful about safety in them.\n\nOn the morning of the fire, temperatures were around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6.5 Celsius) and had been below freezing for 24 hours, according to data from nearby Brooklyn weather stations.\n\n\u201cNo matter where she lived, that should not have happened,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nThe social services department said it would amplify its efforts to reach and help homeless people on streets and subways and encourage them to use shelters.\n\n___\n\nThis story has corrected Kawam\u2019s age based on updated information from the police. She was 57, not 61.",

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRK options chain for the new February 14th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $97.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.36. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $97.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $95.64 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $99.90/share today.\n\nBecause the $97.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.40% return on the cash commitment, or 11.90% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Merck & Co Inc, and highlighting in green where the $97.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $102.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.36. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRK stock at the current price level of $99.90/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $102.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.46% if the stock gets called away at the February 14th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Merck & Co Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $102.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $102.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.36% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.05% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $99.90) to be 21%.

The median price increase of the drugs being hiked Jan. 1 is 4.5%, which is in line with the median for all price increases last year.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe increases are to list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.\n\nLarger drug price increases were once far more common in the U.S. but in recent years drugmakers have scaled them back after price hikes drew sharp criticism in the middle of the last decade.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers don\u2019t have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\u201d 3 Axis President Antonio Ciaccia said.\n\nA Reuters analysis of prices for new drugs found that pharmaceutical companies launched new U.S. drugs in 2023 at prices 35% higher than in 2022.\n\nThe over 250 drug hikes represent an increase from Dec. 29 last year when drugmakers unveiled plans to raise prices on more than 140 brands of drugs.\n\nDrug companies are also reducing some prices on Jan. 1. Merck &Co plans to cut the list price of its heavily discounted diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet \u201cto align the list price more closely to the net price.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. pays more for prescription medicines than any other country, and incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to lower drug costs by focusing on middlemen in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nMore drug price increases are likely to be announced by other drugmakers over the course of January \u2013 historically the biggest month for drugmakers to raise prices.\n\nPfizer raised prices of the most drugs on the latest list \u2013 more than 60 drugs.

The proposal would end tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that the company\u2019s baby powder and other talc products caused cancer.\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Buy 1 Year and Get 1 Year FREE on TheStreet Pro. Act now before it's gone \u23f0\n\nThe company said in October that its third-quarter results were affected by the updated talc litigation settlement proposal and acquired in-process research and development expenses associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody.\n\nIn July, J&J completed its acquisition of Yellow Jersey, a de-merged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics, to secure the global rights to NM26. The transaction was valued at $1.25 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, Citi lowered its price target on Johnson & Johnson to $175 from $185 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares as part of a 2025 outlook for the U.S. medical-technology sector.\n\nThe stocks that outperformed in 2024 followed the traditional medtech path, and Citi said it expected the same in 2025: launching differentiated products that can be leveraged to the bottom line, with management teams providing consistent delivery.\n\nMerck: Gardasil vaccine sales in China an issue (Down 9%)\n\nBiopharma Merck & Co. (MRK) was next on the list, with its shares down 8.75% for the year.\n\nBMO Capital recently downgraded Merck to market perform from outperform with a price target of $105, down from $136.\n\nThe firm cited Merck's commercial overhangs, namely the Gardasil franchise in China, a reference to a group of vaccines developed by the company to prevent human papillomavirus infections.\n\nIn October, Merck said the franchise\u2019s sales slid 11% in the third quarter from a year earlier to $2.3 billion.\n\nMerck attributed the decline to lower demand in China, which offset double-digit growth across \u201calmost every other region,\u201d according to Chief Executive Robert Davis.\n\nRelated: UnitedHealthcare spotlight reveals pivotal AI failure\n\nBMO Capital also pointed to a need for additional clarity on how the company plans to fill the gap caused by its cancer treatment Keytruda, which will see its patent expire in 2028, enabling other biosimilars to enter the market.\n\nThe firm also noted the impact of Inflation Reduction Act negotiations, which enabled Medicare to reduce drug prices.\n\nLast year, Merck sued the Department of Health and Human Services over Medicare\u2019s new powers to reduce drug prices under the IRA.\n\nGiven \"mounting skepticism across pharma,\" BMO sees Merck shares \"potentially stuck in limbo\" over the next 12 months with more attractive options available elsewhere.\n\nAmgen: Pressure from expiring patents (Down 10%)\n\nAmgen (AMGN) is the third-worst Dow performer. The biotech's shares are off 9.51% for the year.\n\nBank of America analyst Tim Anderson recently reinstated its coverage of Amgen with an underperform rating and a $256 price target.\n\nMore stocks\u2019 performance in 2024\n\nA number of patents expiring over the next 10 years will \"put pressure on the base,\" the firm contended.\n\nThe obesity premium is coming out of the stock, but B of A says, \"there might be more room to go.\"\n\nAmgen said last month that in a Phase 2 trial, its MariTide weight-loss drug helped people with obesity lose as much as 20% of their body weight over a year.\n\nHowever, the rate of trial participants discontinuing MariTide appeared higher than that of rival medications.\n\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs analysts removed Amgen from the firm's U.S. Conviction List as part of its monthly update.\n\nNike: China consumers pull back (Down 30%)\n\nNike (NKE) was the Dow's second-worst performer, with shares of the athletic apparel and equipment company sliding 30.3%.\n\nThe company has been contending with a pullback in consumer spending in China, a key growth market, intense competition from European rival Adidas (ADDYY) and missteps tied to a focus on its direct-to-consumer business over traditional retailers and wholesalers.\n\nIn September, Nike said CEO John Donahoe, who took the top job in January 2020, would retire as of Oct. 13. Donahue's successor is Elliot Hill, who had started at Nike at age 18 and worked for the company for 32 years until retiring in 2020.\n\nMore Wall Street Analysts:\n\nStifel lowered its price target on Nike to $75 from $79 while affirming a hold rating on the shares.\n\nHill shared his vision for Nike to return to a sport-obsessed, athlete-driven, and premium brand and organization, the firm said. But the quarter's upside was \"overshadowed\" by significant pressure on revenue expected in the fiscal second half.\n\nCrucial marketplace cleanup measures will continue into fiscal 2026, and the turnaround will cut \"across many quarters,\" Stifel said.\n\nBoeing: South Korea crash adds to difficult year (Down 32%)\n\nAnd finally, the Dow's worst performer was Boeing (BA) , as the aerospace giant's stock tumbled 32.1% for the year.\n\nThe latest blow to the company came on Dec. 29 when a Boeing 737-800 crashed in South Korea, killing 179 people.\n\nIt was the deadliest aviation disaster to hit South Korea since 1997, when a Korean Airlines Boeing 747 crashed in the Guam jungle, leaving 228 people dead.\n\nRelated: Boeing thought it had a plea deal until a judge said otherwise\n\nBoeing's year got off to a rough start in January when a door plug blew off a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight.\n\nIn July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max.\n\nThe 737 Max, Boeing's best-selling aircraft, was involved in two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn addition, 3,000 Boeing machinists went on a seven-week strike in September, crippling the production of the 737 Max jetliner, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane.\n\nJP Morgan said in a research note about the South Korea crash that the 737NG family, which includes the 737-800, was first delivered in 1997, has a strong safety record, and has been one of the most prevalent aircraft in the global fleet.\n\nWolfe Research said the tragic crash of Jeju Air flight 2216 should have no read-through to Boeing's stock and the company's \"current struggles to ramp up its production\" of the 737 Max.\n\nThe accident's root cause could be among several factors, but workmanship and design \"aren't likely in the mix,\" the firm said.\n\nHowever, Wolfe, which has an outperform rating on Boeing, added that commercial aerospace's infrequent, but sometimes catastrophic, accidents are a reminder of the unique headline risk to aircraft makers.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager delivers alarming S&P 500 forecast",

She had briefly been in a New York homeless shelter after moving to the city recently, the Department of Social Services said. It did not say when.\n\nPolice had an address for Kawam in Toms River, a community on the Jersey Shore, and authorities said they notified her family about her Dec. 22 death. The Associated Press left messages Tuesday for possible relatives.\n\n\u201cHearts go out to the family \u2014 a horrific incident to have to live through,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said at an unrelated news briefing.\n\nIt came hours before another harrowing act of violence on the nation\u2019s busiest subway system.\n\nA 45-year-old man was pushed onto the tracks ahead of an oncoming train at a station under Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood about 1:30 p.m., police said. The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and police said they had a person of interest in custody.\n\nPersonal safety in the subways is generally comparable to safety in the city as a whole. But life-threatening crimes such as stabbings and shoves spread alarm about the trains that have carried more than 1 billion riders over the course of this year.\n\nPolice figures show major crimes on subways were down this year through November, compared with the same period last year, but killings rose from five to nine.\n\nIn Kawam\u2019s case, prosecutors have said she was asleep on a subway train that was stopped at a station in Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island when her clothes were set ablaze by a stranger, Sebastian Zapeta.\n\nZapeta, 33, allegedly fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned.\n\nIdentifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday that they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her.\n\nZapeta has been indicted on murder and arson charges. He has not entered a plea, and his lawyer has declined to comment outside court.\n\nFederal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the US illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support.\n\nZapeta was arrested after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students.\n\nProsecutors have said Zapeta subsequently told police that he was the man in surveillance photos and videos of the fire being ignited, but that he drinks a lot of liquor and does not know what happened.\n\nHe is currently jailed, and his next court date is Jan. 7.\n\nWhile it is not clear why Kawam was asleep in a subway car, New York\u2019s subways often unofficially function as a refuge for homeless people. In theory, legal settlements give homeless individuals a broad right to shelter in the city, but some turn to the trains if they are unable to stay in shelters or fearful about safety in them.\n\nOn the morning of the fire, temperatures were around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6.5 Celsius) and had been below freezing for 24 hours, according to data from nearby Brooklyn weather stations.\n\n\u201cNo matter where she lived, that should not have happened,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nThe social services department said it would amplify its efforts to reach and help homeless people on streets and subways and encourage them to use shelters.",

They had witnessed a growth of 12.5 per cent in revenues from the US market in H1 FY2025.\n\nHowever, high incidences of warning letters and import alerts by the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) remain a key credit risk. These not only lead to delays in product launches, but also failure in supplying penalties and the incurring of additional costs towards remedial measures, thus impacting revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nPharma companies have taken several measures to combat various US market-related risks. These include optimisation of product portfolio, cost saving measures and increased focus on complex molecules including injectables, inhalations, specialty products and biosimilars.",

The X account \u2018Deplorable Greenie\u2019 shared a post on December 31, 2024, mentioning that Kawan was a student of an NJ high school. The post, which also contained her photo from what appears like a yearbook, read:\n\n\u201cDebrina Kawam when she graduated in 1985 from a NJ High School. Went go work for Merck in marketing in 92.\u201d\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nMayor Eric Adams mentioned during a briefing on December 31, 2024, that Debrina Kawam had spent a short period in the city's shelter system. Her previous address was Waterbury Court in Toms River. According to BBC, her body was burnt to an extent that left no room for recognition.\n\nThe alleged suspect behind the incident, Sebastian Zapeta, was taken into custody. Zapeta is reportedly an illegal immigrant from Guatemala.\n\nDebrina Kawan was asleep on an F train when Zapeta reportedly ignited the fire using a shirt and then observed the flames spread while sitting on a bench outside the train. She died in the scene. The incident happened at the Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn before 7:30 a.m.\n\nPolice officers present at that time smelled smoke and went to investigate what happened only to find the person\u2019s burning body. The city medical examiner's office confirmed Debrina Kawam's identity through fingerprint analysis, according to reports.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAuthorities indicated that Debrina Kawam and Sebastian Zapeta were unlikely to have been acquainted before the incident\n\nOfficials said they don\u2019t think Debrina Kawam and the suspect knew each other from before. However, they have been trying to contact Kawam\u2019s next of kin. Additionally, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez previously stated that investigators were employing advanced fingerprinting techniques and DNA evidence to determine her identity due to the extent of the burns on her body.\n\nSebastian Zapeta was reportedly under the influence of intoxicants during the incident. Authorities said he was so intoxicated he didn\u2019t remember what happened. He was arrested hours later after being recognized in Manhattan after police circulated his photos.\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nZapeta was indicted on multiple charges, including first-degree murder, three counts of second-degree murder, and arson. Addressing a press conference, Eric Adams said:\n\nTrending\n\n\u201cOur hearts goes out to the family, horrific incident to have to live through and I you know just watching that tape just really I couldn\u2019t even it all the way through. It was just a bad incident and it impacts on how New Yorkers feel but it really reinforced what I have been saying. People should not be living on the subway system.\u201d\n\nAdams emphasized the need for proper care and support, stating that such incidents should not occur regardless of where someone lives. He highlighted the plight of individuals living on the subway system and streets, stressing that this situation cannot be ignored or accepted.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

(NYSE:MRK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 79% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Merck's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:MRK Earnings and Revenue Growth December 31st 2024\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Merck is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Oncology Pharmaceuticals Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for oncology pharmaceuticals was valued at $196.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7% to reach $401.4 billion by the end of 2029.\n\nThis report seeks to deliver an in-depth analysis of the worldwide oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer medications) market. It includes a thorough overview of various types of oncology drugs, such as targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and an examination of current and historical market revenues.\n\nSeveral factors make the oncology pharmaceutical industry a prime candidate for growth. The oncology pharmaceuticals market is a dynamic and quickly changing sector within the global pharmaceuticals industry. The main priorities of this market are the development, manufacture, and marketing of medications used to treat cancer. It is anticipated to keep expanding due to continuous scientific and technological breakthroughs. Novel immunotherapies and CAR-T cell therapy are emerging treatments that can completely transform how cancer is treated. However, to ensure that new therapies help a wide range of patients, it will be imperative to address issues about drug affordability and accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry's pipeline and portfolio in oncology is among the most diverse due to its strong emphasis on research. Over time, improved methods of screening, diagnosis, surgery, and radiation therapy, along with rapidly growing options for systemic treatment, have improved the prognosis for many cancers.\n\n\n\nGlobal funding for cancer research has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, and the rate at which new drugs are being developed has not slowed. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapeutics between 2017 and 2022 for various solid tumor malignancies and indications. The arsenal of cancer treatments is growing at a very rapid pace, which has led to a significant increase in treatment and regulatory complexity. Cancer treatment is now far more expensive for patients and healthcare systems due to the high cost of many new medications. These difficulties and expenses go beyond solid adult cancers to the pediatric and hematology/oncology fields.\n\n\n\nTargeted therapy holds a significant market share regarding medication class, and new precision medicine techniques are emerging from an improved molecular understanding of cancer. As the incidence of breast cancer rises worldwide, pharmaceutical companies are focusing more and more on early diagnosis and treatment options.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\n\n\nThe oncology pharmaceuticals market is further categorized by indication, including lung cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer. Additionally, the report presents the market revenue for each geographic region, including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World (RoW).\n\n\n\nIn order to provide an in-depth understanding of the market, this report also includes profiles of market participants, the competitive landscape, key competitors, and respective market share/ranking. This report includes an oncology pharmaceuticals pipeline analysis, patent analysis, and a detailed discussion of key marketed products. This report outlines the driving and restraining factors of the oncology pharmaceuticals market.\n\n\n\nBy geography, the market in this report is segmented into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of the World (RoW). For market estimates, data has been provided for 2023 as the base year, with forecasts for 2024 through 2029.\n\n\n\nThe report includes:\n\n70 data tables and 50 additional tables\n\nAnalysis of the global market for oncology pharmaceuticals (cancer drugs)\n\nAnalyses of global market trends, with market revenue data from 2022 to 2023, estimates for 2024, forecast for 2025, and projected CAGRs through 2029\n\nAn assessment of the different oncology pharmaceutical types (targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy) and their current and historical market revenues\n\nEstimate of the current market size and revenue prospects, along with a market share analysis by drug type, disease indication (application type), and region\n\nFacts and figures pertaining to the market dynamics, technological advances, regulations, and the macroeconomic factors that influence the industry\n\nA Porter's Five Forces model, and global supply chain and PESTLE analyses\n\nAn analysis of the key products on the market and promising new pipeline molecules or drugs under development\n\nA look at the recent patent grants\n\nOverview of sustainability trends and ESG developments, with emphasis on consumer attitudes, ESG score analysis, and the ESG practices of leading companies\n\nAnalysis of the industry structure, including companies' market shares, strategic alliances, M&A activity and a venture funding outlook\n\nCompany profiles of major players within the industry, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Best Low Volatility Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOptimism for High Growth Despite High Rates and Debt\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump\u2019s policies take effect.\n\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed\u2019s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\n\nFed\u2019s Shifting Rate Path Sparks Concerns in the Market\n\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed\u2019s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn\u2019t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn\u2019t ruling out anything.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\n\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed\u2019s path forward.",

And he found these diseases and then really wanted to do something about them, and used his voice, his influence, his passion, to continue to push forward where others were really not interested.\"\n\nNear-eradication of Guinea worm disease\n\nFollowing his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, Carter founded the Carter Center in 1982, a non-profit organization that \"seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health,\" according to the Center's website.\n\nAmong the organization's many efforts, the Carter Center helped spearhead a successful international campaign with the goal of eradicating dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease, a parasitic infection caused by consuming contaminated drinking water.\n\nWater from ponds or other stagnant bodies of water can contain tiny crustaceans commonly known as water fleas, which in turn can be infected with Guinea worm larvae, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter attends an interview with Reuters in Cairo, Egypt, Jan. 12, 2012. Amr Dalsh/Reuters\n\nAbout one year after infecting a human host, the Guinea worm creates a blister on the skin and emerges from it, which can cause burning pain, fever and swelling, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization.\n\n\"Nobody else wanted to take it on,\" Jimmy Carter told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos during a 2015 interview on \"Good Morning America\". \"So, I decided to take it on.\"\n\nIn 1986, Guinea worm disease afflicted 3.5 million people every year in 21 African and Asian countries. Disease incidence has since been reduced by 99.99%, to just 14 \"provisional\" human cases in 2023, according to the Carter Center.\n\nJacobson said that success is even more remarkable because there are no vaccines available to prevent Guinea worm disease and no drugs to treat it. Tracking Guinea worm disease, according to Jacobson, involves following possible cases for a year to determine if they are infected, checking to see if infected humans have any infected water sources near them, and monitoring the community as a whole.\n\n\"To think that you could eradicate a disease without any tools is really still just a crazy idea, but he did it with perseverance and working with people in the grassroots within communities and putting together teams of people to go and work with people in those communities and empower the communities,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe Carter Center says if efforts are successful, Guinea worm disease could become the second human disease in history to be completely eradicated, after smallpox, and the first to be done without the use of a vaccine or medicine.\n\nCarter told ABC News during the 2015 interview that eradicating the disease entirely was his goal: \"I think this is going to be a great achievement for, not for me, but for the people that have been afflicted and for the entire world to see diseases like this eradicated.\"\n\nMass drug distribution for river blindness\n\nThe Carter Center also works to fight other preventable diseases, including the parasitic infections schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis \u2013 more commonly known as snail fever and elephantiasis, respectively \u2013 as well as trachoma, which is one of the world's leading causes of preventable blindness. It's also working with the governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to eliminate lymphatic filariasis and malaria from the island of Hispaniola, which both countries share and which is \"the last reservoir in the Caribbean for both diseases,\" according to the Carter Center.\n\nCarter and his organization also played a part in organizing a major drug-donation program to help eliminate onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is transmitted to human through repeated bites of infected blackflies, according to the CDC.\n\nPharmaceutical company Merck & Co. had been implementing field studies in Africa which showed that the drug ivermectin was effective at treating river blindness in humans. The Carter Center partnered with Merck to mass-distribute ivermectin, brand name Mectizan, \"as much as needed for as long as needed\" in Africa and Latin America. To date, the Carter Center has assisted in distributing more than 500 million treatments of Mectizan, according to Merck.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter gets a hug from his wife, Rosalynn, after the third presidential debate on Oct. 22, 1976, Williamsburg, Va. AP\n\nIn 1995, Carter negotiated a two-month cease-fire in Sudan to allow health care workers there to more safely help eradicate Guinea worm disease, prevent river blindness, and vaccinate children against polio.\n\n\"When we have known solutions, it is ethical to make sure they're available to the people who need it most,\" Dr. Usha Ramakrishnan, chair of the Department of Global Health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"And that's where we were with river blindness. There was a treatment, but improving access to medications, making it affordable, reaching the people they need was very much along the lines of the work [the Carter Center] was doing.\"\n\nAddressing mental health\n\nCarter was also committed to tackling mental health issues. During his presidency, he created the Presidential Commission on Mental Health, which recommended a national plan to care for people with chronic mental illness.\n\nAlthough it was never adopted as policy by the Reagan administration, the plan's recommended strategies were adopted by some mental health advocacy groups to \"make gains in the 1980s,\" according to one study.\n\nCarter also signed into law the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which provided funding to community mental health centers.\n\nAfter his presidency, Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter continued working to improve access to mental health.\n\nRamakrishnan said the Carters' work helped to reduce some of the stigma associated with mental health.\n\n\"There continues to be a lot of stigma, but they truly got it out [in] the conversation and mainstreaming mental health as an important aspect of health and well-being,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"There's still a lot of challenges, and there are many capable people that they have mentored and trained who are carrying that mantle forward.\"",

            "content": "Just as 2023 was a tough year for the biopharma industry, so was 2024. Scores of pharmas and biotechs downsized and restructured their workforces to stay afloat, including large companies such as Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. Some of those businesses cut thousands of employees.\n\nBioSpace tracked the layoffs below. Keep reading for details on these cuts.\n\nDecember Layoffs: Javara, Ring, Outlook and More\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nNational Resilience\n\nDec. 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nAmplifyBio\n\nDec. 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nAgenus\n\nDec. 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nAlligator Bioscience\n\nDec. 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nIdorsia Pharmaceuticals\n\nDec. 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember Layoffs: Kronos, Novartis, Recursion and More\n\nKronos Bio\n\nNov. 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovartis\n\nNov. 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nRecursion Therapeutics\n\nNov. 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nMedigene\n\nNov. 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nAlector\n\nNov. 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nBMS\n\nNov. 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nSonata Therapeutics\n\nNov. 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nJ&J and Merck\n\nNov. 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nGilead Sciences\n\nNov. 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nAdaptimmune\n\nNov. 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nGilead Sciences and Kite Pharma\n\nNov. 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.

The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment.

Affected employees were notified Aug. 28, and layoffs should be mostly complete by end of this year.\n\nBioMarin also laid off employees in May. Those cuts affected about 170 employees globally and were expected to be mostly complete by the end of July, according to a May SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs are connected to BioMarin\u2019s reorganization, according to the most recent filing, as well as to its updated strategy for hemophilia gene therapy Roctavian and the discontinued development of BMN 293, a preclinical gene therapy for a subtype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nFor more details, visit the article.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nAug. 29\n\nRepare Therapeutics is laying off about 25% of its overall workforce, with most cuts coming from its preclinical group, the company announced Aug. 28. Repare stated the workforce reduction is tied to a strategic reprioritization of its R&D activities to focus on advancing its portfolio of clinical-stage oncology programs.\n\nThe company expects total nonrecurring cash payments of approximately $1.5 million to $2 million in the third quarter associated with the workforce reduction, according to the announcement. It noted it expects to generate annual savings of approximately $15 million that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026.\n\nGenentech\n\nAug. 29\n\nBiotech firm Genentech will lay off 93 employees at its South San Francisco headquarters, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice and SFGATE. SFGATE reported that scientist roles will be the hardest hit, although engineers, managers, analysts and one vice president are also being let go. The layoffs are effective Oct. 8, according to the WARN notice.\n\nThis is the second round of layoffs at Genentech in 2024. In April, a company representative confirmed to BioSpace it would reduce its workforce by about 3% across multiple departments, with more than 400 jobs estimated to be affected.\n\nThe latest layoffs follow news earlier this month that Genentech was closing its cancer immunology group as the company reprioritized investments in cancer research.\n\nFor more details, visit the article.\n\nBayer\n\nAug. 27\n\nBayer is laying off more employees, this time cutting about 150 jobs at its consumer health international headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, Fierce Pharma reported, citing Swiss newspaper NZZ\u2019s article. The layoffs within Bayer\u2019s 1,000-person Basel workforce will mostly affect the consumer health division and the administrative functions that support it and should take effect by 2025, according to Fierce.\n\nEarlier this month, the company released its second-quarter earnings results, where CEO Bill Anderson said the consumer health division had \u201creturned to growth,\u201d with sales increasing 5.3% to $1.59 billion.\n\nThe Basel cuts are the latest in Bayer\u2019s 2024 workforce reductions, which include two notable layoffs in the first six months of the year. In March, the company eliminated nearly half of its executive leadership team, going from 14 to eight members. Then in May, it cut 1,500 jobs, mostly management positions.\n\nFor more details, visit the article.\n\nTome Biosciences\n\nAug. 27\n\nGene editing startup Tome Biosciences is letting go of 131 employees, nearly all of its headcount, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act notice filed on Friday in Massachusetts.

An SEC filing earlier this month noted that as of June 30, Aadi had 70 full-time employees, including 48 in R&D. It is unclear at this time whether Aadi has already experienced workforce reductions since June, or if the company plans additional layoffs beyond the 22 noted in last week\u2019s filing, to bring the newly announced layoffs to 80% of current R&D staff.\n\nIn its announcement, Aadi shared that it\u2019s halting its PRECISION1 trial of nab-sirolimus in patients with solid tumors harboring TSC1- or TSC2-inactivating alterations, as the trial is unlikely to meet the efficacy threshold needed to support an accelerated approval. It will also pause new enrollment in two ongoing Phase 2 trials of nab-sirolimus for advanced or recurrent endometrioid-type endometrial cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nFor more details, visit the article.\n\nLykos Therapeutics\n\nAug. 19\n\nLess than one week after failing to win approval for its MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, Lykos Therapeutics announced it will lay off around 75% of its staff as part of a reorganization. Prior to the cuts, Lykos had about 100 employees, according to STAT News.\n\nOn Aug. 9, the FDA issued a complete response letter for midomafetamine (MDMA) capsules, saying Lykos\u2019 new drug application (NDA) could not be approved based on the data submitted to date. The decision followed a June advisory committee meeting in which the FDA\u2019s Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 10-1 against recommending the treatment, saying that its benefits did not outweigh its risks.\n\nThe reorganization is intended to streamline the organization around clinical development and regulatory engagement as it prepares to resubmit its NDA for MDMA capsules, according to the Aug. 15 announcement.\n\nEvotec\n\nAug. 16\n\nGerman biotech Evotec will potentially cut 400 roles globally, the company announced Aug. 14. According to an SEC filing, there are more than 5,000 employees at Evotec, which offers pipeline co-creation partnerships and contract research organization/contract development and manufacturing services for drug discovery and development. If the company cuts 400 roles, that would amount to around 8% of its workforce, which includes employees at Evotec\u2019s U.S. headquarters in Princeton, N.J.\n\nIn its Wednesday announcement, Evotec reported that total shared R&D revenue for the first six months of 2024 was down 7% year over year. It dropped from 324.8 million euros ($357.6 million) for the first half of 2023 to 302.4 million euros ($332.9 million) for the same period this year.\n\nGalera Therapeutics\n\nAug. 15\n\nGalera Therapeutics will reduce its workforce to three employees on Aug. 31 as it moves toward a planned closure, the company announced Wednesday.

Now, it will prepare for a stockholder vote on its dissolution plan, expected on or around Oct. 17.\n\nAccording to Galera\u2019s announcement, as of June 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.7 million, which it expects will fund operating expenses, including dissolution-related costs, for at least the next 12 months.\n\nGrail\n\nAug. 15\n\nLess than two months after Illumina spun off Grail, the company is laying off about 350 employees, it announced on Tuesday. The reduction represents about 25% of its workforce as of June 30, according to an SEC filing.\n\nGrail, which focuses on cancer diagnostics, is also pulling back on planned 2024 hires, according to the filing.\n\nA Grail spokesperson told STAT via email that about 150 open roles were eliminated.\n\nThe force reduction is part of a restructuring plan designed to reprioritize resources to focus on the company\u2019s core multicancer early detection business and reduce overall spend as Grail works toward completing registrational studies and its premarket approval application submission for galleri, according to the SEC filing. As a result of its overall cost reductions, Grail expects to extend its existing cash runway from the second half of 2026 into 2028, according to the announcement.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nAug. 14\n\nViracta Therapeutics is laying off 23% of its employees, the company announced Wednesday in a press release.

The company noted it received positive feedback from a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, giving clarity on a potential regulatory path to initial registration of nana-val in patients with relapsed or refractory EBV+ peripheral T cell lymphoma.\n\nOvid Therapeutics\n\nAug. 14\n\nOvid Therapeutics has laid off 17 employees, representing 43% of its workforce, according to an Aug. 13 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The biopharma company noted that it initiated the forced reduction as part of an organizational restructuring that will help it extend its cash runway.\n\nIn an Aug. 13 press release, Ovid, which focuses on rare epilepsies and brain conditions, stated it expects that cash runway to support operations and clinical development well into the first half of 2026.\n\nAccording to the SEC filing, the layoff followed Takeda\u2019s report of Phase 3 topline study results for soticlestat, which Takeda licenses from Ovid. Soticlestat failed to hit the primary efficacy endpoints in the SKYLINE study in Dravet syndrome and the SKYWAY trial in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\n\nLexicon Pharmaceuticals\n\nAug. 14\n\nLexicon Pharmaceuticals will lay off about half of its field force\u2014more than 75 people\u2014by the end of the third quarter, the company announced Aug. 13.\n\nThe biopharma business noted that after strategically reviewing its commercial and pipeline programs, it will refocus resources across its portfolio. Lexicon will optimize promotional efforts for sotagliflozin in heart failure and reallocate resources to support the drug\u2019s potential commercial launch for adults with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Moving forward, the business will primarily focus on its lonigutamab clinical program in thyroid eye disease.\n\nBoundless Bio\n\nAug. 14\n\nBoundless Bio announced \u201ca modest reduction in workforce\u201d in an Aug. 12 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The clinical-stage oncology company did not state how many employees were let go. However, a May 13 SEC filing stated the company had 72 full-time employees as of May 6.\n\nBoundless Bio develops novel drugs targeting extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). In its more recent filing, the company announced its intention to scale back early discovery efforts, including by reducing its workforce, to extend its operating runway. Boundless noted that based on current operating plans, it believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $179.3 million as of June 30 are sufficient to fund the company into the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nThe forced reduction comes about five months after Boundless announced plans to go public. According to the Aug. 12 filing, the initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $87.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses.\n\nFibroGen\n\nAug. 13\n\nAs part of its previously announced elimination of 75% of its U.S.-based workforce, FibroGen will lay off 127 people at its San Francisco location, according to an Aug. 7 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The biopharmaceutical company, which focuses on novel drugs for cancer, notified employees on Aug. 2.\n\nAccording to the SEC filing, FibroGen expects to complete most headcount reductions by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The company is estimating it will incur nonrecurring charges of $16 million to $18 million in connection with its overall plan to reduce operating expenses, primarily in the form of severance payments, notice pay, accrued vacation, payroll tax and employee benefits contributions.\n\nThe force reduction is a result of two late-stage trials failing to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival, according to FibroGen\u2019s July 31 announcement: a Phase II/III trial investigating the company\u2019s experimental drug pamrevlumab in combination with gemcitabine in the first and second line in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients and a separate Phase III trial that assessed pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine or folfirinox to treat pancreatic cancer. The announcement also noted the company is implementing an \u201cimmediate and significant\u201d cost reduction plan to terminate the pamrevlumab program and halt any obligations to the drug.\n\nAjinomoto Bio-Pharma Services\n\nAug. 12\n\nAjinomoto Bio-Pharma Services, a contract development and manufacturing organization, will lay off 71 employees effective Sept. 30, according to an Aug. 1 WARN notice.

Eckburg will provide consulting services to the company for up to one year after that date.\n\nAccording to the SEC filing, the force reduction is connected to AN2\u2019s planned focus shift following discontinuation of its EBO-301 study, which evaluated epetraborole in treatment-refractory MAC lung disease. The layoff is also intended to further extend the company\u2019s operating capital. An Aug. 8 press release stated AN2 plans to accelerate its R&D efforts on its boron chemistry platform.\n\nEntero Therapeutics\n\nAug. 8\n\nEntero Therapeutics, a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, will lay off all nonessential employees and terminate the employment of CEO James Sapirstein and President Jack Syage, although Sapirstein will stay on as a consultant, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Precigen had approximately 190 employees as of the end of 2022.\n\nSumitomo Pharma America\n\nAug. 6\n\nSumitomo Pharma America is laying off 53 people in Marlborough, Mass., according to an August 1 WARN notice.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The woman who died after being set on fire in a New York subway train earlier this month was a 57-year-old from New Jersey, New York City police announced Tuesday.\n\nThe woman, Debrina Kawam, had worked at the pharmaceutical giant Merck from 2000 until 2002, but her life at some point took a rocky turn. She had briefly been in a New York homeless shelter after moving to the city recently, the Department of Social Services said. It did not say when.\n\nPolice had an address for Kawam in Toms River, a community on the Jersey Shore, and authorities said they notified her family about her Dec. 22 death. The Associated Press left messages Tuesday for possible relatives.\n\n\u201cHearts go out to the family \u2014 a horrific incident to have to live through,\u201d Mayor Eric Adams said at an unrelated news briefing.\n\nIt came hours before another harrowing act of violence on the nation\u2019s busiest subway system.\n\nA 45-year-old man was pushed onto the tracks ahead of an oncoming train at a station under Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood about 1:30 p.m., police said. The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and police said they had a person of interest in custody.\n\nPersonal safety in the subways is generally comparable to safety in the city as a whole. But life-threatening crimes such as stabbings and shoves spread alarm about the trains that have carried more than 1 billion riders over the course of this year.\n\nPolice figures show major crimes on subways were down this year through November, compared with the same period last year, but killings rose from five to nine.\n\nIn Karam\u2019s case, prosecutors have said she was asleep on a subway train that was stopped at a station in Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island when her clothes were set ablaze by a stranger, Sebastian Zapeta.\n\nZapeta, 33, allegedly fanned the flames with a shirt, engulfing her in the blaze, before sitting on a platform bench and watching as she burned.\n\nIdentifying the victim proved to be a challenge, and authorities said Friday that they were still using forensics and video surveillance to trace her.\n\nZapeta has been been indicted on murder and arson charges. He has not entered a plea, and his lawyer has declined to comment outside court.\n\nFederal immigration officials say Zapeta is from Guatemala and entered the U.S. illegally. An address for him given by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support.\n\nZapeta was arrested after police circulated images of a suspect and received a tip from a group of high school students.\n\nProsecutors have said Zapeta subsequently told police that he was the man in surveillance photos and videos of the fire being ignited, but that he drinks a lot of liquor and does not know what happened.\n\nHe is currently jailed, and his next court date is Jan. 7.\n\nWhile it is not clear why Kawam was asleep in a subway car, New York\u2019s subways often unofficially function as a refuge for homeless people. In theory, legal settlements give homeless individuals a broad right to shelter in the city, but some turn to the trains if they are unable to stay in shelters or fearful about safety in them.\n\nOn the morning of the fire, temperatures were around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6.5 Celsius) and had been below freezing for 24 hours, according to data from nearby Brooklyn weather stations.\n\n\u201cNo matter where she lived, that should not have happened,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nThe social services department said it would amplify its efforts to reach and help homeless people on streets and subways and encourage them to use shelters.",

            "content": "The healthcare sector has long been a sanctuary for income investors seeking stability and growth. Within this realm, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY -2.16%) and Merck & Co. (MRK -0.17%) stand out for their combination of above-average dividend yields and proven business models. These industry titans have consistently rewarded shareholders through market cycles while maintaining robust drug-development pipelines.\n\nRecent market volatility has created an attractive entry point for both stocks heading into 2025. Their dividend yields now sit well above the S&P 500 average, while their valuations scan as compelling relative to historical norms. As a result, these pharmaceutical leaders warrant serious consideration for investors seeking defensive positioning and reliable income streams.\n\nLet's examine the key factors that make these two high-yield dividend stocks screen as top buys early in the new year.\n\nA healthy prescription for income\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb has built its success on groundbreaking cancer treatments and strategic acquisitions. The company's oncology portfolio includes breakthrough immunotherapy drugs that have transformed patient care. This strong market position generates substantial cash flows that support shareholder returns.\n\nTurning to the specifics, the pharmaceutical giant offers investors a 4.3% dividend yield backed by a reasonable 59.8% payout ratio. Management has demonstrated its commitment to shareholders through consistent dividend growth, averaging 7.91% annually over the past five years. The recent acquisitions of Mirati, RayzeBio, and Karuna have strengthened its pipeline significantly this year, creating a bridge to the company's future.\n\nThat said, a significant challenge looms on the horizon. The company faces major patent expirations by 2028, including its blockbuster drugs Opdivo and Eliquis. Moreover, the substantial debt from its $74 billion Celgene acquisition in 2019 adds some unwelcome financial pressure during this transition period. The drugmaker's stock performance reflects these concerns, having lost 11.4% of its value over the past five years.\n\nBMY Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nTrading at 8.12 times forward earnings, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock offers considerable value given its strong oncology franchise, acquisition strategy, and generous shareholder rewards. While the 2028 patent cliff poses a significant challenge, the company's stellar dividend growth and focus on rebuilding its pipeline through strategic deals make it attractive for income investors seeking a combination of yield and value.\n\nMarket pressures weigh on returns\n\nMerck has established itself as a leader in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology. The company's flagship cancer drug Keytruda has revolutionized treatment protocols and drives significant revenue growth. This dominant market position generates substantial cash flows to fund shareholder returns.\n\nOn the dividend front, the pharmaceutical giant delivers a 3.25% yield supported by a healthy 64.4% payout ratio. The company's track record shows consistent dividend increases, with 7.68% annual growth over the past five years. A strategic focus on high-margin specialty drugs and unmet medical needs has strengthened its competitive position.\n\nYet investors must weigh several risks. The looming patent expiration for Keytruda in 2028 threatens a key revenue stream. The company's pipeline beyond immuno-oncology requires bolstering to counter this future patent cliff. Competition in cancer treatment continues to intensify, potentially challenging Merck's market leadership.\n\nAt 10.2 times forward earnings, Merck stock trades at a valuation that reflects both its current oncology leadership and future patent risks. However, with specialty drugs driving strong cash flows and an elite dividend program in place, Merck stands out as an appealing option for income investors.\n\nTwo high-yield stocks worth buying\n\nFor income investors, these pharmaceutical giants offer two distinct paths forward. Bristol-Myers Squibb provides a higher 4.3% yield and an acquisition-driven strategy to counter its 2028 patent cliff. Merck offers a lower but still attractive 3.25% yield, with its specialty drug focus supporting consistent payout growth. Both stocks trade at compelling valuations under 11 times forward earnings, making early 2025 an attractive entry point for investors seeking healthcare exposure and growing dividend income.",

            "content": "By Michael Erman\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers plan to raise U.S. prices on at least 250 branded medications including Pfizer COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer cell therapies and vaccines from France's Sanofi at the start of 2025, according to data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nNearly all of the drug price increases are below 10% - most well below. The median price increase of the drugs being hiked Jan. 1 is 4.5%, which is in line with the median for all price increases last year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increases are to list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.\n\nLarger drug price increases were once far more common in the U.S. but in recent years drugmakers have scaled them back after price hikes drew sharp criticism in the middle of the last decade.\n\n\"Drugmakers don't have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\" 3 Axis President Antonio Ciaccia said.\n\nA Reuters analysis of prices for new drugs found that pharmaceutical companies launched new U.S. drugs in 2023 at prices 35% higher than in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe over 250 drug hikes represent an increase from Dec. 29 last year when drugmakers unveiled plans to raise prices on more than 140 brands of drugs.\n\nDrug companies are also reducing some prices on Jan. 1. Merck & Co plans to cut the list price of its heavily discounted diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet \"to align the list price more closely to the net price.\"\n\nU.S. PAYS MOST\n\nThe U.S. pays more for prescription medicines than any other country, and incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to lower drug costs by focusing on middlemen in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nMore drug price increases are likely to be announced by other drugmakers over the course of January - historically the biggest month for drugmakers to raise prices.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPfizer raised prices of the most drugs on the latest list - more than 60 drugs. As well as a 3% hike on Paxlovid, the company raised prices on medicines including migraine treatment Nurtec and cancer drugs Adcetris, Ibrance and Xeljanz between 3% and 5%.\n\n\"Pfizer has adjusted the average list prices of our medicines and vaccines for 2025 below the overall rate of inflation \u2013 approximately 2.4% \u2013 across many products in our diverse product portfolio,\" Pfizer spokesperson Amy Rose said in an email. She said the increases help support investments in drug development and offset costs.\n\nBristol Myers raised the price of its expensive cancer cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi by 6% and 9%, respectively. The personalized blood cancer treatments can already cost close to half a million dollars.\n\nA BMS spokesperson said in an email that the company is \"committed to achieving unfettered patient access\" to its medicines. She said the price of Breyanzi in particular \"is reflective of the potentially transformative, individualized treatment in a one-time infusion.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanofi raised prices on around a dozen of its vaccines between 2.9% and 9%.\n\nThe largest brand price increases according to the 3 Axis analysis were from Leadiant Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Italy's Essetifin. The company raised prices around 15% on its Hodgkin's disease treatment Matulane and about 20% on Cystaran, eye drops to help patients with symptoms from a rare condition called cystinosis.\n\nSpokespeople from Leadiant and Sanofi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by David Gregorio)",

            "content": "Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nIs Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK) Cheap NYSE Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nDividend Yield as of December 28: 3.30%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating through two segments \u2013 Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment offers a range of human health products, including treatments for oncology, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetes, under well-known brands like Keytruda, Januvia, and Bridion. It also provides vaccines for various age groups under brands such as Gardasil and Pneumovax.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has recently partnered with the Chinese biopharma company Hansoh to develop an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for treating metabolic conditions and obesity, entering a market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite strong performances in oncology and vaccines, Merck\u2019s stock has fallen 20% over the past six months. The licensing deal with Hansoh includes a $112 million upfront payment and up to $1.9 billion in royalties and milestones.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $16.7 billion in total revenues, a 4% increase, or 7% excluding foreign exchange effects. The human health business grew 8%, driven by oncology, while the Animal Health business saw an 11% sales increase. Key oncology product KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion, fueled by expanded use in both early and metastatic cancers. Lynparza revenue grew 13%, while sales of WELIREG more than doubled. GARDASIL sales decreased 10%, primarily due to a decline in China, though global sales increased in other regions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\u2019s full-year earnings guidance has been adjusted to $7.72 to $7.77 per share, factoring in foreign exchange and business developments. The company remains focused on innovation, dividend growth, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.\n\nOn November 19, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, a 5.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is distributable on January 8, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 16.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s Q3 database shows that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was held by 86 hedge funds, compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $800 million.\n\nOverall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "I once had a sweet pit bull named Thembi. While walking, I\u2019d feel the leash go taut and know she\u2019d sniffed out something tantalizing, like a squirrel or rabbit. She\u2019d snuffle along, muzzle to the ground, tracing her quarry\u2019s path up, down and around the dirt road. I once saw a rabbit scurry away just inches from Thembi\u2019s face. Our clever dog had missed the rabbit because she was so intent on its scent.\n\nI share this story because I fear this is what we\u2019re doing with climate. We\u2019re so focused on carbon dioxide that we overlook the extent to which ecosystems regulate climate. We\u2019re not only missing opportunities to minimize climate disruption. We\u2019re also missing the plot.\n\nThe truth is our planet has developed an exquisitely fine-tuned system to stabilize climate primarily via the water cycle \u2014 the phase changes of water from solid to liquid to gas \u2014 and back.\n\nThese processes are driven by life \u2014 by flora, fauna and fungi, and the interactions among them.\n\nWe often think of nature as passive. But as a colleague says, \u201cNature doesn\u2019t just sit there and look pretty. It does work.\u201d\n\nNature\u2019s work is to create and maintain the conditions for life to thrive. Our climate is only as healthy as the state of our ecosystems.\n\nNot that CO2 is irrelevant. Rather, carbon in the atmosphere can be seen as a lever, part of a climate-regulation regime governed by natural systems like healthy forests.\n\nThe good news is nature\u2019s tendency to self-heal.\n\nThe trouble is ecosystem health is barely considered. We\u2019re too busy watching CO2 numbers, just as Thembi had her snout to the ground while the rabbit skittered away.\n\nUnfortunately, landscapes are under threat from development, including, ironically, renewable energy. All over New England, forested hillsides are being stripped for solar.\n\nBecause climate change is framed as an energy problem, we\u2019ve been blind to nature\u2019s hand in regulating climate. We\u2019re sacrificing the very thing that could stabilize it.\n\nTruly addressing climate change means not just decarbonizing, but also preserving and restoring ecosystems.\n\nOtherwise we\u2019re like my dog Thembi, chasing phantom rabbits.\n\nJudith D.

Romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, uniquely stimulates bone formation and decreases resorption simultaneously, offering dual benefits not seen in traditional therapies. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, remain the backbone of treatment, but new-generation compounds focus on longer half-lives to reduce dosing frequency. Anabolic agents like teriparatide and abaloparatide selectively stimulate osteoblast activity but are now joined by drugs targeting specific pathways like the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, provides tailored options for patients with renal concerns due to its non-renal excretion. Additionally, personalized medicine is gaining traction, integrating genetic markers to predict response and minimize adverse effects.Here, we've just put out a new study report on the Osteoporosis Drugs Market Demand 2024-2032 that gives a thorough and organised look at the size of the market.
