His paper \"Twin Momentum\" looked at combining traditional price momentum with improving fundamentals to generate market outperformance. In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward. When he combined that measure with price momentum, he was able to double its outperformance.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\n\nTop Technology Stocks\n\nMagnificent Seven Stocks\n\nHigh Momentum Stocks\n\nTop AI Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

            "content": "On March 11, the book Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook executive from 2011 to 2017, was released in English in the U.S. The book immediately reached the Top 10 on Amazon. The following day, Meta obtained an interim injunction from an arbitrator preventing Wynn-Williams from promoting her book and from making \u201cdisparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments\u201d about Meta, due to a non-disparagement agreement that Meta says she signed upon leaving the company. The book is still available for purchase and as of Thursday it was number 2 on Amazon\u2019s U.S. non-fiction list, with a 4.8-star rating; on the New York Times list it jumped directly to the top spot in its first week.\n\nWhat is it that worries Meta about this book? It\u2019s a memoir by Wynn-Williams, a 45-year-old former New Zealand diplomat who served as Director of Global Public Policy during the company\u2019s years of global growth. The book recounts with honesty and humor Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s and then-COO Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s reactions to dealing with governments, especially their subservience to China and their treatment of employees. The author accuses policy chief Joel Kaplan (he allegedly called her \u201csultry\u201d) of inappropriate behavior. The company claims it investigated Kaplan and found nothing serious.\n\nIn addition to the arbitration injunction, Meta has issued a particularly harsh statement and published a document reviewing several of Wynn-Williams\u2019 revelations, which it calls \u201cold news.\u201d While most of the anecdotes were already public knowledge, it\u2019s especially shocking to read a detailed account from someone who experienced it firsthand.\n\nBut for Meta, everything is susceptible to being false, according to its statement. \u201c[The book] is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said. Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired \u201cfor poor performance and toxic behavior,\u201d according to Meta, which holds that since then she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists, and that this book is simply a continuation of that. When asked by EL PA\u00cdS, the company did not reveal the identities of the activists who are allegedly paying Wynn-Williams.\n\nLet in the light\n\nWynn-Williams continues to work in the tech industry, but in an interview prior to the arbitration order, she denied taking money from anyone to publish the book. In an interview with The Times of London, where she lives with her husband, a journalist for The Financial Times, Wynn-Williams said she was not a disgruntled former employee, but rather wanted to shed light on the company\u2019s inner workings: \u201cI had to ask myself: who was my silence benefiting? I wouldn\u2019t put myself through this if it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nEL PA\u00cdS sought to speak with Wynn-Williams and received a response from a legal representative for the author: \u201cDue to an injunction initiated by Meta, Wynn-Williams is prevented from commenting at this time.\u201d The arbitrator issued the temporary injunction because the author violated a non-disparagement agreement. Wynn-Williams did not testify in the brief arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe publisher and the author kept the book secret until days before publication. \u201cWe are horrified by Meta\u2019s tactics to silence our author,\u201d the publisher said. In the few interviews she has given, Wynn-Williams has said that the main reason she waited so many years to publish this memoir is China and its newfound power with AI: \u201cWe are on the verge of a new technological era. We are entering the age of AI, and I don\u2019t want the mistakes made during the era of social media to be repeated. Since leaving [Meta], I have worked on the dialogue between the U.S. and China on the use of AI in weaponry. China is a huge player in AI. There is a growing strategic rivalry, and [Meta] has been doing things behind the scenes with the Chinese Communist Party for a long time.\u201d\n\nWynn-Williams cited in two interviews the potential influence of the $18 billion Meta claims to receive each year from China, which is more than 10% of its revenue, but is money that comes from Chinese companies that place ads on Meta\u2019s networks for its global audience.\n\nFreedom of expression?\n\nThe great irony of this case is why Meta, which considers itself a staunch defender of freedom of expression on its platforms, decided to go all out against that right when the target is its own founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Even more so, given that the news is already public knowledge. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone expressed outrage that Wynn-Williams has not undergone a fact-checking process, after Meta announced it will eliminate fact-checking in the U.S. in favor of community notes. EL PA\u00cdS asked Meta about this paradox but did not receive a response. Wynn-Williams said in a podcast that these actions are \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d for a company that prides itself on freedom of expression and that has made many public statements about people speaking out.\n\nA handful of Wynn-Williams\u2019 former colleagues have said her memoir was exaggerating or lying, remarks that Stone is compiling on his X account. Katie Harbath, a former Facebook elections manager, wrote: \u201cI respect Sarah\u2019s right to tell her story. While her book contains kernels of truth, it is riddled with factual inaccuracies, exaggerations, and omissions, including things she writes about myself and my team\u2019s work on elections (though we are never directly named).\u201d\n\nZuckerberg emerges from the book as a guy in love with his engineers, a supreme boss out of touch with the real world, tired of politicians and willing to do anything to help Meta grow, such as asking Chinese President Xi Jinping to choose his daughter\u2019s name (which the latter declined to do). Wynn-Williams shares new details about already familiar facets of Silicon Valley: unmanageable work demands, crazy schedules where some people sleep from 1 to 5 a.m., and where she herself ended up answering emails from the bed where she was waiting for her own child to be born.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

That's not too bad for our best VR headset of 2025.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is the manufacturer's latest flagship VR headset and the successor to the Meta Quest 2. We awarded it a full five out of five stars in our Meta Quest 3 review for its big jump in graphical quality over the previous version.\n\nIt offers an improved mixed-reality experience and new software that makes VR more inviting and approachable. It also includes Meta's best LCD screen yet with 4K resolution per eye.\n\nIf you're just getting into VR or think the Meta Quest 3 is out of your price range, consider the Meta Quest 3S instead. It still offers plenty of value at its price (about $200 cheaper) and shares the same processor as the Meta Quest 3. Just keep in mind that it's not as powerful and doesn't offer as much storage as its pricier counterpart.\n\nYou can compare the two with our Meta Quest 3 vs Meta Quest 3S article.",

AVGO said on its Q1 earnings call on March 6 that it expects these \u201cthree hyperscale customers will generate a Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Broadcom works directly with tech giants like Meta to design their application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Custom AI chips are gaining steam since they can perform AI workloads similar to Nvidia\u2019s industry-leading offerings.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s semiconductor solutions are critical components in telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers, enterprise networking, and beyond. AVGO also provides enterprise software, including cybersecurity and hybrid cloud infrastructure, serving a wide-ranging customer base.\n\nNow looks like a great time to buy Broadcom, down nearly 25% from its peaks, as it finds support near key technical levels. AVGO offers massive AI upside and long-term exposure to growth across industrials, smartphones, and other areas.\n\nThe stock has cooled off after skyrocketing too far, too fast following its blockbuster earnings release in early December.\n\nBroadcom stock has more than quadrupled the tech sector over the past decade (+1,300%), including a 200% run in the last two years. Broadcom briefly surpassed the $1 trillion market cap threshold, joining Nvidia, Apple, and other tech titans.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is a semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions company riding huge growth from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AVGO works directly with multiple AI hyperscalers and posted 77% AI sales growth in its recently reported Q1 FY25.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Impressive Growth Outlook\n\nBroadcom grew its AI sales by 77% in Q1 FY25 (reported on March 6), boosting total revenue by 25% and lifting EPS by 45%.\n\nAVGO\u2019s AI growth offset slowing sales in its non-AI semiconductor segments, such as industrials, wireless, and enterprise networking, which are facing cyclical downturns.\n\nAVGO\u2019s beat-and-raise first quarter of 2025 lifted its earnings outlook once again, earning it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and extending its wave of upward revisions. Broadcom is expected to expand adjusted EPS by 35% this year and 18% in 2026, after 15% growth last year.\n\nCEO Hock Tan said in prepared remarks that AVGO sees continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 as \u201chyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.\u201d\n\nBroadcom is projected to grow its revenue by 20% in FY25 and 15% in FY26, following 44% expansion in 2024.\n\nTime to Buy This Beaten-Down AI Stock on the Dip?\n\nBroadcom shares have soared over 9,000% in the past 15 years, blowing away tech\u2019s 500% and crushing five of the Magnificent Seven stocks\u2014lagging only Nvidia and Tesla. AVGO stock more than quadrupled the tech sector over the past decade (+1,300%), including a 200% run in the last two years.\n\nAVGO\u2019s two-year charge helped it outpace all of the Mag 7 except Nvidia. The AI chip stock outclimbed the entire group over the last year, briefly hitting a $1 trillion market cap in December.\n\nInvestors can buy Broadcom down nearly 25% from its early December peaks. The stock was due for a selloff after skyrocketing following its Q4 release in December. AVGO\u2019s quick fall came alongside the broader AI trade and most of the stock market, washing away nearly all its post-Q4 gains.\n\nThe stock has tumbled from some of its most overheated RSI levels (a widely tracked momentum indicator) in recent years to some of its lowest. On a longer timeframe, Broadcom is at some of its lowest RSI levels in the past decade.\n\nAVGO is finding support above its 50-week, right at its 200-day moving average, and near the top end of its pre-December breakout range.\n\nBroadcom still trades at a premium to the tech sector in terms of forward earnings, which makes sense given its performance and growth outlook. Yet, it\u2019s nearly even with tech on the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio front.\n\nOn top of that, Broadcom pays a dividend, and 30 of the 34 brokerage recommendations tracked by Zacks are \u201cStrong Buys.\u201d\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "The current meta-analysis, utilizing AES-SDM and based on VBM studies with relatively large sample sizes, revealed GM volume alterations in pediatric OCD patients. It was found that, compared to controls, pediatric OCD patients demonstrated GM volume increase in the left insula and left SFG (orbital part), and GM volume decreased in the right STG, left IPG, left MOG and left IFG. Second, the GM increase in SFG (orbital part) volume and GM decrease in IPG volume were observed in those without psychiatric comorbidities and in the treatment-naive subgroup. Meta-regression analysis indicated that GM volume in the IFG decreased with higher mean age, GM volume in the SFG (orbital part) was positively associated with symptom severity and onset age, GM volume in the MOG was negatively associated with percentages of males, OCD duration was associated with reduced GM volume in the IPG. To our knowledge, this is one of the few meta-analyses exclusively focused on pediatric OCD using voxel-based methods. While ENIGMA-OCD consortium studies [42, 43] included pediatric subsamples, their primary focus on combined adult-pediatric cohorts limits developmental specificity.\n\nThe results revealed a significantly increased GM volume in the insula in pediatric OCD patients compared to controls, which aligns with previously published studies and reviews [10, 15, 44]. The insula, a region of the brain located deep within the lateral sulcus, is part of the inhibitory network in both children and adults [45, 46]. It is a key component of habit learning, motivation, emotional regulation, interoceptive awareness, and salience-events detection, contributing to activation of target brain regions in generating appropriate behavioural responses to salient stimuli [47]. Those stimuli are regulated by dopaminergic activity, and increased striatal synaptic dopamine has been found in OCD, which may be related to enhanced volumes observed [48,49,50,51]. Consequently, dopamine antagonists are effective as augmentation medications in OCD [52]. Another contributing factor may be the consistent evidence for abnormal salience-processing networks in OCD [53]. The enlarged GM in the insula in paediatrics OCD may be a neuroplastic consequence of increased insula activation during symptom provocation [54], which may mediate habitual compulsions, goal-directed action control, and misattributions of behavioural and emotional salience to symptom-provoking stimuli [54]. Enhanced bottom-up detection by the insula in pediatric OCD may increase automatic or habitual responding and heightened interoceptive processing at the cost of goal-driven behaviour, such as inhibitory control [48]. The insula\u2019s GM enlargement may reflect altered salience processing, consistent with its role in OCD pathophysiology [55]. Furthermore, enlarged insula volume has also been found in adult OCD in the previous study [56]. Given that the increase in insula persists from childhood to adulthood, we therefore hypothesize that the larger insula in OCD could be the consequence of illness chronicity.\n\nThe SFG is a component of the frontostriatal circuitry, which plays a crucial role in regulating behaviour and cognitive processes [57, 58]. Dysregulation in this circuitry can impair executive functioning in OCD, making it difficult for patients to control obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions effectively [59]. Increased SFG in pediatric OCD also aligns with evidence of GM overgrowth that appears to stabilize later in life [60]. The SFG, involved in higher cognitive functions like decision-making, planning, and self-control, has been identified as a potential region in the pathophysiology of pediatric OCD [15, 57], and is also thought to relate to inhibitory control processes [61]. The increased volume of SFG may reflect the excessive excitation of this circuit, leading to the failure of the control of compulsive behavior [5]. Furthermore, we also identified that positive association between GM in the SFG (orbital part) and the severity of OCD symptoms in pediatric patients. The meta-analysis by Norman et al. [44] indicated that prefrontal structural abnormalities were specifically associated with OCD symptom dimensions such as compulsive behaviors. Possible mechanisms were that severe OCD symptoms might drive excessive activation of SFG, and long-term increased neural activity may lead to increased GM volume through synaptic remodelling or gliosis [20]. The present study found that SFG (orbital part) volume was greater in pediatric OCD patients with a later age of onset. This result supports the hypothesis of neurodevelopmental heterogeneity in OCD [62]. Early-onset OCD and late-onset OCD may have different neural mechanisms. Early-onset OCD is often associated with a stronger genetic burden and family history [1], and its SFG may not fully develop due to abnormal synaptic pruning or delayed myelination, resulting in a smaller SFG [13]. Increased SFG volume in late-onset patients may reflect adaptive changes in neuroplasticity during adolescence, such as compensatory responses to stress or environmental factors [15]. In addition, hormonal changes during puberty (such as dopaminergic system maturation) may affect the developmental trajectory of SFG [17]. Subgroup analysis showed a more significant increase in SFG (orbital part) volume without other psychiatry comorbidities and untreated patients, whereas this difference was attenuated after treatment [16]. For example, Huyser et al. [20] found that CBT reversed orbitofrontal GM abnormalities in adolescents with OCD, suggesting that SFG volume changes may be treatment-sensitive. This plasticity may achieve symptom improvement by regulating the overactivity of the CSTC circuit [63]. The absence of other psychiatric comorbidities can sometimes simplify the clinical presentation. Therefore, SFG volume may be used as a potential biomarker for treatment response. Notably, this pattern was not observed in other regions (e.g., insula, IFG, MOG), which may reflect distinct neuroplastic mechanisms in the SFG. The GM increase in SFG (orbital part) among treatment-na\u00efve and non-comorbid subgroups suggests its potential role in early neurodevelopmental abnormalities, as observed in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD [64] and ADHD [65]). However, whether this reflects compensatory mechanisms or pathological overgrowth requires longitudinal investigation.\n\nOur results also reported the consistent GM volume difference in IPG, which also found in the treatment-na\u00efve and non-comorbid pediatric OCD subgroup. Given that the duration of illness in OCD can significantly affect symptom severity and treatment response [66], our meta-regression linked longer illness duration to reduced IPG volume, aligning with evidence that chronic OCD may accelerate structural decline in regions supporting sensory integration [67]. Patients with a longer duration of OCD may show different responses to treatment compared to those with a shorter duration [66]. Chronic course of illness might require more intensive or prolonged interventions to achieve symptom relief [68]. Comorbidities (e.g., ADHD, tic disorders) are often accompanied by extensive brain structural changes [44], and the reduced IPG in the group without comorbidities is more likely to be specifically associated with sensory integration deficits in OCD. The ENIGMA study by Boedhoe et al. [42] found that parietal abnormalities exist independently of comorbidities in pediatric OCD, which is consistent with the results of this study. Compared to treatment group, we found GM reduction in the IPG disappeared. Thus, we highlight the importance of early intervention and comprehensive treatment approaches to mitigate long-term neural and functional impacts.\n\nIn addition, the occipital cortex is believed to be associated with visuospatial function, playing a crucial role in visual-spatial processing and information reception [69]. Alterations in this brain region may affect how pediatric patients with OCD perceive and respond to visual cues [70]. In pediatric OCD, the reduction of GM volume in MOG may reflect abnormalities in the visual processing network, closely related to the patient\u2019s excessive attention to detail (such as obsessive checking of contamination or symmetry) [71]. Olatunji et al. [72] found that patients with OCD have enhanced activation in the occipital cortex when exposed to pollution-related stimuli, and structural abnormalities may impair their adaptive filtering of visual information and exacerbate obsessive anxiety. In addition, visual processing deficits may further sustain compulsive behavior by affecting cognitive flexibility, such as difficulty in moving from local details to global context [69]. Furthermore, our findings found that GM volume in the MOG was negatively correlated with the proportion of males in the sample, suggesting that male patients with OCD may be more prone to structural abnormalities in the brain regions related to visual processing. The male brain undergoes more significant GM pruning during adolescence [29], and the early onset of OCD (with a male predominance) may be associated with an acceleration or disruption of this process. Studies have found that male OCD patients have more significant abnormalities in the prefrontal-striatal circuit [73], and the structural abnormalities of the MOG, as the hub of the visual-prefrontal connection, may exacerbate the symptoms of male patients. Our results also revealed that the GM volume differences in MOG were observed in pediatric OCD in the treatment-na\u00efve groups but not in adult OCD samples in previous studies [9]. Pharmacological treatment (such as SSRIs) or CBT may improve MOG function by modulating visual-prefrontal connectivity, thereby partially reversing structural abnormalities [20]. For example, Lazaro et al. [16] found an increase in occipital GM volume in children with OCD after drug treatment, suggesting that treatment may repaire visual processing networks through neuroplasticity. The reduction in MOG volume in the untreated group may represents pathological progression without intervention, and reflects the abnormality of visual processing network in pediatric OCD, which is different from that in adults, and the structural differences in male patients and untreated subgroups may mark the core pathological mechanism of the disease.\n\nFinally, we found that the IFG volume was significantly negatively associated with the mean age of the samples. Younger patients exhibited greater GM volume in the IFG, a region implicated in cognitive control circuits, potentially reflecting delayed maturation of cognitive control circuits. While prior work links IFG structure to cognitive flexibility [35], our study did not assess this behavior, thus, this association remains speculative. This finding further implies that neurodevelopmental differences during childhood and adolescence can influence the IFG\u2019s role in OCD, potentially leading to variations in symptomatology and brain function across different age groups [62].\n\nAbove all, GM in the IFG and insula were similarly observed in the previous meta-analysis studies [9, 14, 56], which included across samples of adults and youths, suggesting these regions are stable neural markers of OCD. Our study reported the GM difference in the MOG, while the analysis by Norman et al. [44] did not cover the vision-related regions. This discrepancy may stem from the latter\u2019s focus on the frontostriatal-mediated inhibitory control circuit, whereas our whole-brain analysis has unveiled more extensive brain structural abnormalities. Meanwhile, the adult OCD study by Radua et al. [5] did not report GM differences in MOG, SFG and IPG. The possible explanation posits that the pediatric brain is in a dynamic process of maturation, with the prefrontal cortex (e.g., SFG) and visual networks (e.g., MOG) potentially undergoing critical remodelling during adolescence, leading to abnormal patterns that differ from those observed in adults. The current study focused on investigating the GM alterations in pediatric OCD, confirming abnormalities consistent across age groups (e.g., IFG and insula) while uncovering pediatric-specific brain regions (e.g., MOG, SFG and IPG). These findings underscore the importance of dissecting the neural mechanisms of OCD within a developmental framework and provide novel targets for future pediatric research. Finally, our findings in the IPG align with ENIGMA-OCD reports of abnormalities [43]. This cross-method convergence (VBM vs. cortical thickness) strengthens confidence in these regions as transdiagnostic OCD markers. Unlike ENIGMA\u2019s report of enlarged thalamus volumes in unmedicated youth [42], we observed SFG/IPG abnormalities. The possible reason is that our VBM approach vs. ENIGMA\u2019s region-of-interest focus may prioritize distinct spatial patterns. Furthermore, the predominance of left-hemisphere abnormalities (insula, SFG, IFG, IPG, MOG) aligns with pediatric OCD\u2019s association with language-mediated obsessions (e.g., taboo thoughts) and left-lateralized executive networks [62]. The left insula and IFG are hubs for language processing and cognitive control [45], which are developmentally prioritized in early adolescence. Aberrant left-hemisphere growth patterns may reflect disrupted maturation of these circuits, predisposing to compulsive verbal rituals and impaired inhibition [35]. Notably, adult OCD studies report more bilateral changes [5], suggesting pediatric leftward anomalies may spread with ageing.",

However, the Quest 3 boasts significantly upgraded optics while the Quest 3S mostly carries over the same optics from the Quest 2 That's more significant than it reads on paper. How much enjoyment you get from VR headset is largely determined by the visual quality of the display. If the image that you see is blurry, or distorted, it takes you out of the immersion. For newcomers to VR gaming who are unsure of whether or not they'll enjoy the experience, the Quest 3S is the safer purchase. However for VR veterans, the improved immersion offered up by the Quest 3 is a worthwhile investment.\n\nQuest 3 Review by Eric Song \"The Quest 3 continues Meta\u2019s legacy of offering a cost-effective headset that doesn\u2019t require an expensive gaming PC, but can still benefit from one if you have it. That\u2019s a unique feature that sets it apart from almost every other VR headset out there, other than its own predecessors. The sheer amount of upgrades are well worth the $200 generational price increase. For everyone else is willing to make the splurge, the Quest 3 sets the new standard for VR and mixed reality gaming.\"\n\nPlay\n\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

            "content": "After a series of delays in order to ensure compliance with EU\u2019s more complex data usage rules, Meta has now announced the initial launch of its Meta AI chatbot to EU users.\n\nThough it will be a lesser form of the AI tools that are available to users outside the region.\n\nAs per Meta:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken longer than we would have liked to get our AI technology into the hands of people in Europe as we continue to navigate its complex regulatory system \u2013 but we\u2019re glad we\u2019re finally here. Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll take the first step in making Meta AI\u2019s chat function available in six European languages, with a view to finding parity with the US and expanding our offering over time.\u201d\n\nEuropean users of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp will see the Meta AI icon appearing in their search options, while users will also be able to call on @MetaAI in their chats for easy access. Meta\u2019s also launching the same to U.K. users.\n\nThe main variance, however, is that Meta\u2019s AI tools are not being trained on EU user data, in compliance with the currently under review EU regulations.\n\nBut even with this proviso, it\u2019s a significant step.\n\nMeta\u2019s been battling EU regulators over the rollout of its AI tools, amid complaints from data protection groups and privacy campaigners.\n\nLast year, Meta was forced to shelve its European AI rollout plans after advocacy group NOYB called for further assessment of the privacy implications of Meta\u2019s AI tools, and the construction of its large language models.\n\nMeta\u2019s also facing various legal challenges over the use of copyright-protected material within its LLM development (including in France), and European authorities were urged to get ahead of this before it became a problem, by assessing Meta\u2019s plans before a full launch was approved.\n\nWhich Meta says is impeding AI development.\n\nLast September, Meta was one of several signatories to an open letter which criticized Europe\u2019s data regulations, claiming that they are strangling innovation, and leaving EU users behind the rest of the developed world.\n\nAs per the letter:\n\n\u201cIn recent times, regulatory decision-making has become fragmented and unpredictable, while interventions by the European Data Protection Authorities have created huge uncertainty about what kinds of data can be used to train AI models. This means that the next generation of open-source AI models, and products and services that we build on them, won\u2019t understand or reflect European knowledge, culture or languages.\u201d\n\nThis is just one of the reasons why Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been looking to appeal to U.S. President Donald Trump, in the hope that Trump will back Meta in its ongoing battle against EU authorities over their increasingly stringent regulations.\n\nAnd that looks to be yielding results already. The Trump Administration has signaled to EU authorities that it will counter what it sees as over-reaching regulations with trade penalties, while Vice President JD Vance told a Paris summit on AI last month that the White House will fight against excessive regulation.\n\nThat could be part of what\u2018s enabled this first AI push from Meta, which will bring its popular chatbot to millions more users.\n\n\u201cHaving a reliable and intelligent assistant is already proving to be one of the real values that this generation of AI creates \u2013 giving everyone an opportunity to have an assistant that people can engage with throughout their daily lives to enhance social experiences and unlock new possibilities.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Meta says that over 700 million people now engage with its AI chatbot every month, making it the most used AI assistant.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how accurate that is, as sometimes, Meta AI answers questions in your search queries, without you intending to ask it. But Zuck and Co. are determined to dominate the AI race. And in order to do that, Europe is another key market.\n\nMeta still has a way to go in fully enabling its AI push in the region, but this is a key first step, which could also spark more calls for wider access from EU users.",

Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, It expects a low double-digit growth rate.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+20.1% vs. +3.8%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\n\n\n\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.35 billion people daily. Meta\u2019s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.\n\n\n\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\n\n\n\nChevron\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past six months (+13.5% vs. +6.9%). The company being a fully integrated energy firm is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\n\n\n\nFurther, the planned acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\n\n\n\nAnother concern is the weak margins on refined products that forced its downstream segment to its first quarterly loss in 4 years. Considering these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Taylor Devices have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the past year (-24.8% vs. -6.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $99.73 million has seen U.S. sales, which account for 82% of revenues, declined 7%, reflecting softness in domestic demand. Total revenues for the first half of fiscal 2025 was $20.17M, a slight decline from the prior year, while net income and operating income each fell 3%. SG&A expenses increased 7% year over year.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Taylor Devices is positioned for growth, supported by increasing global demand for seismic protection, industrial dampers and defense applications. The company\u2019s backlog expanded to $34.5 million, providing strong revenue visibility into fiscal 2025-26. International sales rose 37%, particularly in Asia.\n\n\n\nIndustrial segment sales climbed 43%, reflecting the broader adoption of vibration control systems in automation and heavy industry. Gross margin improved to 47% from 45%, highlighting pricing power and operational efficiency. A strong balance sheet ensures financial flexibility for expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Taylor Devices here >>>)\n\n\n\nGSI Technology\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry over the past year (-34.5% vs. -32.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $68.36 million is facing challenges which includes an $8.4 million net loss in the first nine months of FY2025, an 11.9% YoY revenue decline, and margin compression to 46.7%. SRAM sales weakness, customer concentration risks and cash burn raise sustainability concerns.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, GSI Technology is expanding its defense AI presence with key U.S. government contracts, including a $0.3 million Army SBIR contract and ongoing Phase 2 projects with the Air Force and Space Development Agency, validating its AI accelerators for military applications.\n\n\n\nThe company operates in the growing HPC and AI markets, with its Gemini-II and Plato chips designed for low-power, high-speed AI workloads. Rising SRAM demand from AI hardware supports revenues, with a major AI customer expected to lead sales in FY2025. Strategic asset sales have strengthened liquidity, providing $15.1 million in cash with no debt.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on GSI Technology here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pfizer Inc.

The company operates through multiple key segments:\n\nFamily of Apps (FoA): Includes core businesses such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.\n\nReality Labs: Focuses on virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and the development of the metaverse.\n\nAdvertising & Commerce: Generates the majority of revenue through digital advertising across its platforms.\n\nMeta continues to expand its AI-driven advertising, content recommendation systems, and virtual/augmented reality ecosystem to drive engagement and monetization.\n\nRecent Performance\n\nOver the past twelve months, Meta\u2019s share price has increased by 23.97%, reflecting strong growth in digital advertising, AI adoption, and strategic investments in the metaverse and reality labs.\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\nDCF Valuation Inputs\n\nDiscount Rate: 9.5%\n\nTerminal Growth Rate: 4%\n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 9.5%\n\nForecasted Free Cash Flows (FCFs) in Billions\n\nYear FCF ($B) Present Value ($B) 2025 50 45.7 2026 58 48.3 2027 67 50.5 2028 77.5 52.5 2029 89 54.3\n\nTotal Present Value of FCFs = $251.3 billion\n\nTerminal Value Calculation\n\nUsing the perpetuity growth model:\n\nTerminal Value = (FCF in 2029 \u00d7 (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)) \u00f7 (Discount Rate \u2013 Terminal Growth Rate)\n\n= (89 \u00d7 1.04) \u00f7 (0.095 \u2013 0.04)\n\n= 92.56 \u00f7 0.055\n\n= $1,682.91 billion\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value\n\nPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value \u00f7 (1 + WACC)^5\n\n= 1,682.91 \u00f7 (1.095)^5\n\n= 1,682.91 \u00f7 1.5703\n\n= $1,071.5 billion\n\nEnterprise Value Calculation\n\nEnterprise Value = Total Present Value of FCFs + PV of Terminal Value\n\n= 251.3 + 1,071.5\n\n= $1,322.8 billion\n\nNet Debt Calculation\n\nAs of December 31, 2024:\n\nTotal Debt: $49.06 billion\n\nTotal Cash: $77.81 billion\n\nNet Debt = Total Debt \u2013 Total Cash\n\n= 49.06 \u2013 77.81\n\n= \u2013 $28.75 billion (Net Cash Position)\n\nEquity Value Calculation\n\nEquity Value = Enterprise Value + Net Cash\n\n= 1,322.8 + 28.75\n\n= $1,351.55 billion\n\nPer-Share DCF Value\n\nShares Outstanding: 2.534 billion\n\nPer-Share DCF Value = Equity Value \u00f7 Shares Outstanding\n\n= 1,351.55 \u00f7 2.534\n\n= $533.36\n\nConclusion\n\nDCF Value Current Price Margin of Safety $533.36 $505.12 5.59%\n\nBased on this DCF valuation, Meta appears slightly undervalued. The estimated intrinsic value of $533.36 per share is higher than the current market price of $505.12, providing a 5.59% margin of safety.

Starting this week, Meta AI will roll out across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger in 41 European countries and 21 overseas territories \u2014 but it will be limited to text-based chat features for now.\n\nMeta AI launched in the US in 2023. While the company intended to bring the assistant to Europe, Meta had to pause the rollout in the region after Ireland\u2019s privacy watchdog asked it to delay training on content posted by Facebook and Instagram users. It also halted the launch of its multimodal Llama AI model in the European Union due to regulatory concerns.\n\nFor now, Meta says its AI assistant will only function as a chatbot for users in Europe, helping to brainstorm ideas, plan a trip, or answer specific questions using information from the web. European users will also be able to use Meta AI to surface certain kinds of content on their Instagram feed. However, they can\u2019t use the tool to do things like generate or edit images, as well as ask questions about a photo. The model isn\u2019t trained on EU user data, either.\n\n\u201cThis launch follows almost a year of intensive engagement with various European regulators and for now, we are only offering a text-only model in the region which wasn\u2019t trained on first-party data from users in the EU,\u201d Meta spokesperson Ellie Heatrick tells The Verge. \u201cWe will continue to work collaboratively with regulators so that people in Europe have access to and are properly served by Meta\u2019s AI innovations that are already available to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nLast November, Meta started bringing some of its AI features to its Ray-Bans smart glasses in the EU, but the glasses currently don\u2019t support multimodal features that let users ask Meta AI about what they can see. It doesn\u2019t seem like Meta is giving up on plans to bring more features to the European version of Meta AI, as the company says it will work to \u201cfind parity with the US and expand our offering over time.\u201d",

Its plan to continue expansion in Europe was halted last summer due to \u201cregulatory unpredictability\u201d.\n\nThe company paused the launch of its AI assistant in Europe after the Irish Data Protection Commission told Meta to postpone its plan to use data of adult users of Facebook and Instagram to train large language models (LLMs).\n\nMeta now says that over the coming weeks it will \u201ctake the first step in making Meta AI\u2019s chat function available in six European languages - English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and German - with a view to find parity with the US and expand our offering over time.\u201d\n\nMetaAI will be available within Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger.

As of March 19, 2025, Meta stock is sinking today, trading at $581.83 per share, reflecting a decline of about 18.8% over the past month and erasing its year-to-date gains.\n\nInvestors and analysts alike are questioning why Meta stock is down today, especially as it becomes the last of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks to tumble into negative territory for the year.\n\nThis article dives into the reasons behind Meta Platforms stock\u2019s decline, explores current price targets, and offers a Meta stock prediction for its future amid a volatile Nasdaq and broader market trends.\n\nMeta Stock Price Today Hits November 2024 Lows\n\nAs reported by real-time financial data, Meta Platforms stock opened at $581.484 on March 19, 2025, in pre-market trading, with a daily high of $582.933 and a low of $581.45.\n\nThis marks a drop from its previous session close of $582.36 on Tuesday and a significant retreat from its 52-week high of $740.91. The company\u2019s market cap stands at $1.475 trillion, but its share price has been under pressure, reflecting broader tech sector woes.\n\nCompared to its February 18 peak, Meta\u2019s share price has shed 22% in value, signaling a sell-off that has investors reevaluating their portfolios.\n\nWhat is Meta stock price today?

Volatility is an important statistical indicator used by financial traders to assist them in developing trading systems. Trad Read this Term, contributing to Meta\u2019s decline. Inflation, rising interest rates, and recession fears have created a challenging environment for growth stocks like Meta Platforms.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Meta\u2019s AI investments and its massive user base of nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its apps offer hope for a recovery\u2014but not without hurdles.\n\nWhy META Is Sinking Today? Meta Platforms Stock and Earnings:\n\nOne major factor driving the question \u201cwhy Meta stock is down\u201d is its recent earnings performance\u2014or lack thereof. While Meta reported strong Q4 2024 profits, its outlook for Q1 2025 has disappointed investors.\n\nAnalysts cite a weak turnover prediction, with advertising revenue\u2014a cornerstone of Meta\u2019s business\u2014showing signs of slowing amid economic uncertainty. Bloomberg notes that Meta Platforms Inc. tumbled into negative territory on March 18, losing 3.7% in a single day and wiping out its 26% gain from earlier in 2025.\n\nThe company reported robust year-over-year growth in prior quarters, but the latest guidance suggests monetization challenges. Earnings per share (EPS) for the last quarter hit $8.02, beating the estimate of $6.76, yet the forward-looking EPS for Q1 2025 is pegged at $5.25, raising concerns about sustainability. Investors believe Meta\u2019s heavy capital expenditures\u2014projected at $60-$65 billion in 2025 for AI infrastructure\u2014could strain cash flow if revenue growth falters.\n\nAI Integration and Meta\u2019s AI Investments: A Double-Edged Sword\n\nMeta\u2019s AI push, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has been a focal point for both optimism and skepticism. The company\u2019s open-source Llama models and Meta AI chatbot have surpassed 1 billion downloads, a milestone celebrated in early March 2025. Zuckerberg aims for Meta AI to serve over 1 billion users by year-end, backed by plans to deploy 1.3 million GPUs. However, as Investors.com reports, this AI milestone hasn\u2019t stemmed the stock\u2019s decline, with shares approaching a 3-month low of $581.616.\n\nAnalysts argue that Meta\u2019s AI investments, while innovative, are increasing fixed costs at a time when flexibility is crucial. KeyBanc Capital Markets downgraded its price target on Meta from $750 to $710, citing \u201cgreater macro uncertainty\u201d and competitive pressures from rivals like Microsoft and new AI chatbot entrants such as Manus. The experiment with artificial intelligence is a long-term bet, but short-term returns remain elusive, contributing to the current sell-off.\n\nMetaverse Costs: A Persistent Drag on Meta Platforms Stock\n\nThe Metaverse, once hailed as Meta\u2019s future, continues to weigh on its financial health. Reality Labs, the division behind virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) efforts like Oculus, has racked up significant losses\u2014$13.7 billion in 2022 alone\u2014with no clear end in sight.\n\nDespite Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of a virtual world enhancing user engagement, investor sentiment has soured on these costly experiments. The Globe and Mail highlights that Meta\u2019s share price struggles partly stem from this unprofitable venture, as the company balances its social media dominance with unproven bets.\n\nNasdaq and Tech Tumble: Broader Market Pressures in 2025\n\nMeta Platforms stock isn\u2019t sinking in isolation; it\u2019s part of a broader tech tumble. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have faced corrections, with the latter down 7.3% year-to-date and over 12% from its peak.\n\nInflation and Federal Reserve policies on interest rates have hit growth stocks hard, and Meta, as one of the last of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks (alongside Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Alphabet), has not been immune. Bloomberg reports that the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index is down 16% in 2025, with Meta becoming the final member to turn negative.\n\nThis broader market decline amplifies Meta\u2019s challenges, as investors take profits amid recession fears and shifting sentiment. The company\u2019s high price-to-earnings ratio, while attractive during bullish periods, now signals overvaluation to some, prompting a reevaluation of its investment upside.\n\nMeta Stock Technical Analysis: Will Meta Stock Go Up?\n\nBased on my technical analysis, the recent 20% correction in META stock price represents a \u201chealthy\u201d movement after a very long uptrend period.\n\nThe market is currently returning to the 200 EMA, the moving average that separates bull and bear trends, allowing for a reset of recent overvaluation. The current confluence of support around the $582 level may be a potential buying point.\n\nWill Meta stock go up? Technical analysis of META stock price chart. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nHowever, if META drops below and breaks the trend line\u2014which has been drawn and maintained since 2022\u2014then bulls may have a problem. In such a case, I wouldn't rule out a decline to around $500, which represents the current six-month lows.\n\nResistance levels identified at:\n\n$600: maximums that formed important resistance at the end of 2024\n\n$635: peaks from December and early January 2025\n\n$741: ATH (All-Time High) reached in mid-February 2025\n\nSupport levels visible at:\n\n$582: current 200 EMA path, local bottoms and December minimums, and the long-term trend line drawn from 2022 lows\n\n$580\u2013550: broader zone defined by November lows, the upward line from September, and July and August maximums from last year\n\n$500: round psychological level, coinciding with September minimums\n\nAlso, check my previous technology giants stock analysis: Why is Tesla Stock Up Today?

Additionally, an upcoming FTC trial on April 14, 2025, could force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, spooking investors further. Regulatory scrutiny, including antitrust lawsuits and privacy concerns tied to past scandals like Cambridge Analytica, adds to the pressure. These external threats erode Meta\u2019s market share and complicate its growth narrative.\n\nYou may also like: Google Makes Record $32B Bet on Cybersecurity With Wiz Acquisition\n\nMeta Stock Prediction: Can It Recover in 2025?\n\nSo, should you buy Meta stock amid this sell-off? The prediction hinges on several factors. On the bullish side, Meta\u2019s dominance in social media platforms, its 3.98 billion monthly active users, and AI-driven engagement (e.g., Instagram\u2019s 6% time increase in 2024) provide a solid foundation. The company\u2019s profile as a tech leader, bolstered by Zuckerberg and his sister Randi Zuckerberg\u2019s influence, supports long-term optimism.\n\nHowever, challenges like Metaverse losses, AI costs, and a potential recession could extend the decline. Analysts recommend Meta Platforms for its upside potential, but caution that near-term volatility may persist.\n\nMeta Stock Forecast and Prediction Table for 2025\n\nDate/Period Predicted Price Upside/Downside from Current ($581.616) Key Factors Influencing Prediction Source/Analyst Consensus March 31, 2025 $586.00 +0.76% Stabilization at $580\u2013$586 support level; potential rebound from AI milestone (1B downloads).

Source: Tradingview.com\n\nWhile its current price of $581.616 is well below analyst price targets, the road to recovery depends on Zuckerberg\u2019s ability to balance innovation with profitability. For investors, the question remains: Is this a dip to buy, or a trend signaling deeper trouble? Monitoring Meta\u2019s next earnings, AI integration progress, and broader market conditions will be key to answering that in 2025.\n\nFAQ: Understanding Meta Stock in 2025\n\nWhy Was Meta Stock Down Today?\n\nAs of March 19, 2025, Meta stock closed at $581.616, down slightly from its previous close of $582.36, continuing a broader decline of 18.8% over the past month from $715.9699. Several factors contributed to this drop. Bloomberg reported a 3.7% tumble on March 18, erasing Meta\u2019s 26% year-to-date gain, driven by investor unease after Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest sold over $7 million in shares\u2014the first such sell-off in nearly a year.\n\nIs It Good to Buy Meta Stock Now?\n\nYes. At its current price of $581.616, Meta is trading well below its 52-week high of $740.91 and the analyst consensus price target of $763.7. This suggests a potential upside of 31.31%, making it attractive for long-term investors. Analysts maintain a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation, with 44 of 48 rating it positively. citing Meta\u2019s dominance in social media (3.98 billion users) and AI growth potential.\n\nWill Meta Continue to Rise?\n\nAnalysts from Zacks ($738.08 target) and MarketBeat ($719.26 average price target) predict growth, driven by ad revenue ($187.46B estimated for 2025, Exla Resources) and AI innovations like Llama and Meta AI, which aims for 1 billion users by year-end.\n\nIs It Too Late to Buy Meta?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not necessarily too late to buy Meta stock. At $581.616, the average price over the past month has dropped significantly from its February peak, offering an entry point below analyst targets like Evercore ISI\u2019s $725 or TipRanks\u2019 $763.71. Meta also benefits from its massive user base across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, plus AI-driven engagement gains.\n\nWill META Stock Reach $1000?\n\nReaching $1,000 by the end of 2025 is ambitious but not impossible, according to some analyst outlooks. TipRanks and MarketBeat\u2019s highest estimate is $935, implying a 60.76% upside from $581.616. LiteFinance\u2019s upper range of $1,022 supports this possibility, driven by a bullish scenario: AI success (e.g., Llama 4, multimodal models), metaverse monetization, and a strong broader market recovery on the NYSE.",

            "content": "In this article META Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nMeta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk Manuel Orbegozo | Chip Somodevilla | Reuters\n\nAfter news broke on the last day of January that Meta might follow Elon Musk's lead in exiting Delaware to incorporate in another state, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer sprung into action. Delaware has long been the dominant state for U.S. companies to incorporate due to its flexible corporate code and expert judiciary. More than 20% of the state's tax revenue, amounting to more than $1 billion a year, has historically come from corporate franchise fees, so state lawmakers can ill afford to preside over a mass exodus, or what's been dubbed a \"DExit.\" On Saturday, Feb. 1, a day after The Wall Street Journal published its story on Meta considering a Delaware departure, Meyer, who was brand new to the job, convened an online meeting with attorneys from law firms that have represented Meta, Musk, Tesla and others in shareholder disputes in the state, according to public records obtained by CNBC. Other attendees included members of the Delaware legislature. The purpose of the meeting was to have a \"Discussion re: Corporate Franchise,\" one memo said. The following day, records show, Meyer invited a second group to meet with him and new Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez. That invitation went to Kate Kelly, Meta's corporate secretary, and to Dan Sachs, the company's senior national director of state and local policy. The invite also went to James Honaker, an attorney with Morris Nichols, a firm that's represented Meta in federal court in Delaware, and to William Chandler, former chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, who is now part of Wilson Sonsini's Delaware litigation practice. Roughly two weeks later, Delaware lawmakers were being asked to vote on a bill, known as SB 21, that, if enacted, would overhaul the state's corporate law in a manner that could favor Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and other controlling shareholders of large companies.\n\nAmong other things, SB 21 would alter how companies can use independent directors to ensure the deals they've made will not be subject to court scrutiny, and would limit the records that shareholders can obtain from companies when investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty. Late last week, the state Senate voted to pass an amended version of SB 21. If Delaware's House of Representatives follows suit, in a vote expected as soon as Thursday, the bill would head to the governor's desk to be signed into law. That could remove a major overhang for Zuckerberg and Meta. Meta has been the subject of \"books and records\" investigations in Delaware in recent months, according to two people directly involved in the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss nonpublic investigations. Under current law, shareholders behind those probes could file cases alleging that Zuckerberg or other Meta directors caused billions of dollars in damages, according to the people and Delaware records viewed by CNBC.\n\nwatch now\n\nIf SB 21 passes, any claims filed after Feb. 17, the day the bill was brought to the assembly, would be considered under the new law. That means shareholders wouldn't have the benefit of the current law, and investor protections that come with it, when their new claims are considered in Delaware court. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment. Mila Myles, a spokeswoman for Meyer, said in a statement that the governor has spent his first few weeks on the job meeting with \"plaintiffs attorneys, Delaware corporate attorneys and countless Delaware incorporated companies,\" adding that he is not \"doing the bidding of any billionaire.\"\n\nCozying up to Trump\n\nMusk drew national attention to Delaware's corporate law in 2024 after a judge there ruled that his $56 billion Tesla pay package from 2018 was illegally granted and should be rescinded. He wrote on X, \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" and subsequently moved Tesla to Texas while accusing the judge behind the ruling of \"absolute corruption.\" Musk also became a top donor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and is now a lead advisor to his White House, running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Zuckerberg, who had a notably rocky relationship with Trump during the president's first term, has been publicly currying favor this go-round. He's taken measures like ending Meta's diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, getting rid of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a \"Community Notes\" model used by Musk's X platform, and adding Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a longtime friend of Trump, to his company's board weeks before the new administration began. Meta also agreed in January to pay $25 million to settle a 4-year-old lawsuit over the company's decision to suspend Trump's accounts after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. News that Zuckerberg was considering a move out of Delaware landed a little over a week after Trump's inauguration, which the Meta CEO attended along with other tech leaders.\n\nMark Zuckerberg arrives before the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States takes place inside the Capitol Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. Kenny Holston | Via Reuters\n\nMeta hasn't publicly commented on whether it plans to reincorporate outside of the state. As CNBC previously reported, authors of SB 21 included Richards, Layton & Finger, a corporate defense firm that counts Musk and Tesla as clients. It was co-written by Delaware Law School professor Lawrence Hamermesh, as well as Chandler, the ex-chancellor, and former Delaware Supreme Court Justice Leo Strine. Strine works for Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, which is representing Zuckerberg in a separate matter tied to the company's involvement in the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. In 2019, Meta agreed to pay a $5 billion fine to settle related charges with the Federal Trade Commission. SB 21 was introduced to Delaware's General Assembly in mid-February, by Senate Majority Leader Bryan Townsend, who had attended the first of the two meetings held by Meyer. The process of drafting the bill didn't follow Delaware's traditional practice of changing corporate law, which typically involves writing and review by the state's bar association, and a committee within it called the Corporation Law Council. Reforms outlined in SB 21 have been supported by corporate defense firms and attorneys, including those who helped draft the bill. They've been vociferously opposed by shareholders' attorneys and investment groups, including CalPERS and ICGN, who say they want to ensure that controlling shareholders don't make self-interested deals or decisions that go against the wishes and rights of the broader investor base. On Feb. 2, Myles from the governor's communications office shared a memo with legislators and attorneys who had attended the weekend meetings. It included a list of talking points in defense of SB 21.

            "content": "Considering that Meta has been so definitive in its stance that Community Notes is an all-round better approach to content moderation within social apps, it\u2019s interesting to read its latest overview of how it's preparing for the upcoming Australian election, and how it\u2019s planning to combat misinfo in a nation not governed by Donald Trump.\n\nUnder local electoral rules, the Australian Government has to call an election before May 17th, which means that an official announcement on a date is coming very soon.\n\nAnd getting ahead of this, Meta\u2019s head of public policy in Australia, Cheryl Seeto, has provided an overview of its plans to address potential misinformation during the campaign.\n\nWhich, as 404 Media has highlighted, is very reliant on utilizing third party fact-checking and approved information sources.\n\nAs per Seeto:\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with AFP and the AAP to independently review content through Meta Australia\u2019s third party fact-checking program. When content is debunked by these fact-checkers, we attach warning labels to the content and reduce its distribution in Feed and Explore so it is less likely to be seen.\u201d\n\nMeta has launched the first stage of its Community Notes pilot to selected users in the U.S., and it plans to expand that roll-out to more regions over time. But for now, the Australian team will continue to rely on third-party fact checks.\n\nWhich Meta Australia\u2019s promoting as a good thing, despite Meta\u2019s main account saying that fact-checking, in the U.S. in particular, has \u201cgone too far\u201d resulting in \u201ctoo many mistakes\u201d.\n\nThe fact that the Australian arm of the company is seemingly highlighting a counter approach outside of the U.S. could reinforce the suggestion that Meta\u2019s only making these changes to appease Trump, though Meta says that it is committed to gradually shifting to Community Notes, which it maintains is a better approach, in all regions.\n\nYet, that\u2019s not how it sounds in Seeto\u2019s overview:\n\n\u201cWe are also partnering with AAP on a new media literacy campaign to help Australians critically assess the content they view online, which will run in the lead-up to the election.\u201d\n\nSo, Meta\u2019s noting that this is a positive, that relying on support from the same providers that power its third-party fact checks is a valuable way to reduce misinformation around elections.\n\nYet, it\u2019s also eliminating the same, in the U.S. at least.\n\nSo which is better? Is third-party fact-checking, as Meta Australia\u2019s promoting, the best way to ensure a more accurate flow of information in Meta\u2019s apps, or is Community Notes a better system?\n\nAgain, the argument could be made that Meta\u2019s only making the switch at the behest of Trump, because in this case at least, it seems that Meta Australia believes that third-party confirmation is a valuable enhancement of its safety tools.\n\nIn response to 404 Media\u2019s article on this, Meta has noted that while it is planning to expand its Community Notes approach to all regions, that isn\u2019t happening just yet, and Meta will refine and improve its Community Notes system as it expands.\n\nAs such, its current processes remain the best defense against election info in other regions. Though it\u2019ll be interesting to see just how long it takes Meta to expand its crowd-sourced fact-checking process, and whether it does indeed matter as much to the company outside of Trump\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nBecause as many have noted, it seems very much like Mark Zuckerberg had a meeting with Trump, and asked how Meta could work with the Trump Administration over the next four years. And Trump then gave Meta a list of demands, which it\u2019s seemingly now met, in the hopes that Trump will assist the company in battling regulatory restrictions on various fronts.\n\nIt seems, then, like switching to Community Notes may not actually be what\u2019s best for users, even if it is what\u2019s best for the company.\n\nAs such, maybe it\u2019ll end up taking Meta a really long time to expand its Community Notes process outside of America. Like, four years long.",

            "content": "Meta claims that opening the store and heavily pushing Horizon Worlds did not meaningfully affect store spending, and revealed that monthly headset usage increased 30% in 2024.\n\nMeta's Director of Games, Chris Pruett, gave a talk at GDC 2025 today in which he revealed the new figure and responded to the concerns of some VR developers about Meta's strategic priorities.\n\nThe revelation of headset usage per month increasing by 30% in 2024 follows Pruett's announcement at last year's GDC that Quest 3 has higher retention than previous Meta headsets.\n\n\u201cThe number of people who own and are actively using a headset is larger than it has ever been\u201d, Pruett told the audience today.\n\nHe also reiterated that over $2 billion has been spent on Quest content to date.\n\nWhile total platform spending increased 12% in 2024, a figure Meta previously gave in response to developer concerns, the type of spending and type of content bringing in revenue significantly changed.\n\nLast month Meta revealed that free-to-play apps now account for 70% of time spent on Quest, with Pruett acknowledging that this has come with a reduction in spending for some paid titles. However, he notes that the majority of revenue still comes from paid titles.\n\nWhile some of the shift is specific to VR/MR, Pruett noted that it mirrors wider trends across the games industry, where \"spending is flat, investment has dried up, the only games that seem to be doing very well are big live service titles and indie darlings\".\n\nAs for Quest specifically, Pruett said that the launch of Quest 3S \"signaled a larger audience shift than we expected\". Quest 3S buyers are younger on average, he explained, with not as much disposable income as previous Quest headset buyers. While teenager buyers have been growing with every headset release, with Quest 3S they now represent the majority of both buyers and active users, he revealed.\n\nThese teenage Quest users, he explains, \"want to play the same sorts of games they\u2019re playing elsewhere\", primarily free-to-play titles with a strong focus on social interaction such as Gorilla Tag and paid \"meme games\" such as I Am Cat.\n\nFurther, a new audience of mainstream adult Quest buyers have emerged that aren't as interested in immersive VR or mixed reality apps at all, seeing their headset \"as an extension of their TV\u2014a device primarily for media consumption\".\n\n\"They like sports, action movies, concerts\u2014all kinds of stuff. They also play games on their phones or consoles, but it\u2019s a secondary pastime.\"\n\nAccording to Pruett it is this shift, and not the opening of the store or focus on Horizon Worlds, that is responsible for the vast majority of the reduction of revenue that some developers who had been targeting VR enthusiast buyers have been reporting.\n\nHe said that as Meta opened the store, it tested the change by exposing different users \u201cto the old view and the new view\u201d, and after months of tracking the results found a less than 1% difference in spending. He says Meta ran the same experiment for its heavy promotion of Horizon Worlds in the phone app and found it decreased spending \"by 3% at most\". Overall, neither of these changes lead to a reduction in overall spending, with it in fact rising by 12% in 2024.\n\nMost VR enthusiasts come to the store already knowing what they want to buy anyways, Pruett claimed, and thus these changes didn't much affect them.\n\n\"We realize that 2024 had a lot of change all at once. We spent a long time unpacking and untangling the impact of these changes because it\u2019s easy to conflate correlation with causation. The research isn\u2019t done yet\u2014we\u2019re still learning and fine-tuning. For example, our store ranking algorithm has changed significantly several times over the last 12 months. It\u2019s an ongoing project, and we don\u2019t always get it right. Luckily, the data tells us pretty clearly when we\u2019ve made mistakes so we can course correct.\"",

What sets the Quest apart from most other VR headsets is that it can be played completely untethered. That means you can play games like Beat Saber or Pistol Whip without having to own a gaming PC or a PlayStation 5 console. If you do happen to own a powerful gaming PC, you have the option to connect to it and harness your PC's superior hardware, even wirelessly.\n\nHow Is the Quest 3 Different from the Quest 3S?\n\nQuest 3S vs. Quest 3 Similarities\n\nSnapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor\n\nTouch Plus controllers\n\n120Hz refresh rate\n\nMixed reality passthrough (same cameras, different layout)\n\nQuest 3S vs. Quest 3 Differences\n\nLower per-eye resolution (1832x1920 vs 2064\u00d72208)\n\nFresnel lens vs. pancake lens\n\nLower FOV (96\u00b0/90\u00b0 vs 104\u00b0/96\u00b0)\n\nSmaller storage capacity (128GB vs 512GB)\n\nLonger battery life (2.5hrs vs 2.2hrs)\n\nThe Quest 3 isn't the most affordable standalone VR headset; that title goes to the Quest 3S. The Quest 3S has the same processor, features, ergonomics, and controllers for $200 less. However, the Quest 3 boasts significantly upgraded optics while the Quest 3S mostly carries over the same optics from the Quest 2 That's more significant than it reads on paper. How much enjoyment you get from VR headset is largely determined by the visual quality of the display. If the image that you see is blurry, or distorted, it takes you out of the immersion. For newcomers to VR gaming who are unsure of whether or not they'll enjoy the experience, the Quest 3S is the safer purchase. However for VR veterans, the improved immersion offered up by the Quest 3 is a worthwhile investment.\n\nQuest 3 Review by Eric Song \"The Quest 3 continues Meta\u2019s legacy of offering a cost-effective headset that doesn\u2019t require an expensive gaming PC, but can still benefit from one if you have it. That\u2019s a unique feature that sets it apart from almost every other VR headset out there, other than its own predecessors. The sheer amount of upgrades are well worth the $200 generational price increase. For everyone else is willing to make the splurge, the Quest 3 sets the new standard for VR and mixed reality gaming.\"\n\nPlay\n\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

From top tech companies to universities, people and organizations all over the world are using Llama to innovate, drive scientific advances, and unlock new economic opportunities. And what we\u2019ve consistently heard from developers is that the transparency, customizability and security of open source models like Llama help reach new levels of creativity and innovation.\n\nTo celebrate this achievement, we\u2019re sharing just a few of the incredible Llama applications we\u2019ve seen since launch, from industry leader Spotify, startup Fynopsis, and enterprising developer Srimoyee Mukhopadhyay.\n\nPersonalizing Music Recommendations\n\nStreaming service Spotify has used Llama to help deliver customized, contextualized recommendations for new songs, artists, podcasts or audiobooks. Combining Llama\u2019s broad world knowledge and versatility with Spotify\u2019s deep expertise in audio content, these explanations aim to enrich the listening experience and help drive discovery of artists and creators. Spotify also uses Llama to enrich real-time personalized commentary from their AI DJs, helping fans connect more deeply with the artists\u2019 songs they\u2019re hearing.\n\nUnveiling Austin\u2019s Hidden Gems\n\nSrimoyee Mukhopadhyay, along with Minho Park and Taegang Kim, winners of the Austin Llama Impact hackathon, used Llama to build Unveil, an application that helps people discover Austin\u2019s hidden cultural gems and local businesses. Their app uses Llama for image analysis and conversational AI, processing captured or uploaded images to identify landmarks, murals, sculptures or street art, then providing descriptive insights about their historical or cultural significance. And because this app redirects foot traffic to areas that aren\u2019t typically recommended as tourist attractions, local businesses can reap the benefits.\n\nHelping Small Businesses Make M&A Deals\n\nFynopsis, a US-based startup, aims to help smaller and lower-middle market businesses get ahead by facilitating more efficient mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals. They do this by providing an AI-based VDR (virtual data room) in which companies can store and share confidential documents as they conduct due diligence. They\u2019ve used Llama 3.2\u2019s multilingual and vision capabilities to analyze user data and auto-fill government documents, helping streamline the M&A workflow and close language gaps that can impede translingual M&A deals.\n\nThese applications illustrate the immense power of open source AI, and we\u2019re excited to see what new applications emerge in the near future.

            "content": "Credit: Primakov/Shutterstock\n\nIt's no surprise that companies continue to experiment with new AI features. Artificial intelligence has been the center of emerging tech for nearly three years now, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon. But whether you love generative AI or you find it useless, I think we can all agree that using AI to write Instagram comments is pretty stupid.\n\nAnd yet, Meta appears to be testing exactly that. As reported by SocialMediaToday, some Instagram accounts are now seeing a new icon to the left of the text field after choosing to leave a comment on a post. When you tap this icon (a pencil with a star), you pull up a new Meta AI menu, which presents a series of comment choices, presumably based on whatever content you happen to be looking at. In one example, the bot offers three choices: \"Cute living room setup,\" \"Love the cozy atmosphere,\" or \"Great photo shoot location.\" Could there be anything lazier than this?\n\nI'll admit: This news took me a bit off guard. I know Meta is comfortable shoving its AI experiments down our throats\u2014often with no way to turn them off. But even as it becomes more difficult to avoid AI-generated content on Meta's platforms, I didn't think the company would offload the \"effort\" of having to write comments to the bots.\n\nI can't imagine many (or perhaps any) Instagram users are so busy or exhausted that they'd rather scroll through an AI's idea of what to say rather than say something themselves. The human-generated comments on Instagram pages are already low-effort as it is; not to mention, there are too many comments from bots on social media platforms. Do we really want more bots in the comments, only this time sent to us by real people?\n\nWe need to stop letting AI make the decisions\n\nThis is just an experiment, and likely a limited one at that. For what it's worth, I do not have the option on my Instagram account, so I guess I'm forced to think up my own comments for now. (Or at least open another app to ask a different AI to generate a comment for me.) But this experiment speaks to the current state of AI in tech: offering solutions to problems that don't exist. Writing comments isn't hard, and yet, someone at Meta thought there was a usefulness\u2014a market\u2014for AI-generated comments. They probably want more training data for their AI machine, which tracks, considering companies are running out of internet for models to learn from. But that doesn't mean we should be okay with outsourcing all human tasks to AI.\n\nThat's what bugs me most: ceding so many of our cognitive tasks and decisions to the machines. If you're on Instagram, you're already letting the algorithm choose the content you see. Please don't hand over even more decisions to the machines, as low-effort as those decisions may be. If you do see the experiment on your end, I encourage you not to use it; both for your own sake, as well as depriving Meta of any more training data generated by its user base for free.",

The drop outpaces the broader market decline, as the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.07%) fell 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.71%) lost 1.9%.\n\nThe company behind social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads faced pressure after an analyst lowered its price target amid a wider tech sell-off.\n\nAnalyst downgrades Meta amid a sell-off\n\nKeyCorp reduced its price target on Meta from $750 to $710 in a report released Tuesday, maintaining its \"overweight\" rating. While the new target still represents a decent upside from Meta's current price, the drop was significant.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is down more than 12% this month as trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and key partners in many tech companies' supply chains. Moreover, persistent inflation, declining consumer sentiment, and recession fears have led many to move capital out of tech and into safer investments.\n\nA questionable AI integration\n\nIt was also reported today the Meta was experimenting with giving users on Instagram the ability to have artificial intelligence (AI) write their comments. In my view, this is a feature that few would be genuinely interested in, and if it became pervasive, would significantly degrade the experience.\n\nThis is another attempt to leverage AI to enhance Meta Platforms' offerings in ways users don't appear to want. Earlier this year, the company faced pushback after introducing AI-generated profiles that could interact with real users, posting, liking, and commenting just as a human would.\n\nStill, these missteps are small potatoes in the long run. I think that Meta remains one of the better investments in tech and is priced well at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25.3.",

            "content": "A new memoir by a former Meta executive says the company was ready to put its technology at the service of China's Communist government. The revelation is raising questions about Mark Zuckerberg's recent (and very public) commitment to free speech \u2014 as are Meta's efforts to keep the executive's book from reaching the American public.\n\nMeta was willing to \"censor content and shut down political dissent\" in order to enter the China market with Facebook, said The Washington Post . The allegation was made in a whistleblower complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the new memoir \"Careless People\" by former Meta executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, who served as the company's director of global public policy. The book, published March 11, reveals Facebook wanted \"so desperately\" to get a foothold in China that it was ready to let Beijing \"oversee all social media content appearing in the country and quash dissenting opinions,\" said the Post. Zuckerberg also agreed to \"crack down\" on account of a Chinese dissident living in the U.S. A Meta spokesperson said the company's former interest in China was \"widely reported\" a decade ago.\n\nWynn-Williams has been \"temporarily prohibited from promoting\" the book, said TechCrunch . That's because she signed a non-disparagement clause during her employment at Facebook from 2011 to 2017. But the order does not apply to Macmillan, the publisher of \"Careless People,\" and the book \"may in fact be benefiting from the 'Streisand effect,'\" as readers seek the revelations Meta does not want them to read.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThe China revelations are among \"several anecdotes\" in Wynn-Williams' memoir demonstrating \"how hollow Facebook's commitment to free expression \" really is, said Michelle Goldberg at The New York Times . Meta's ability to silence her \"isn't based on any legal finding about the truth\" of her allegations, but instead relies on the nondisclosure agreement \"corporate employees are routinely required to sign.\" It is a startling act of \"egregious hypocrisy\" just months after Zuckerberg abandoned \"professional fact-checking efforts and hate-speech policies under the guise of defending free speech,\" said PEN America's Viktorya Vilk to the Times.\n\nMeta's attempt to suppress \"Careless People\" is \"totally unnecessary,\" said Steven Levy at Wired . The company has had \"every nasty charge\" leveled at it over the last decade, yet it \"keeps getting bigger and more profitable.\" There might have been a time when truth was determined by an \"empirically driven point/counterpoint process\" in which the \"best facts won.\" Facebook, though, helped create a world where false narratives stick \"even after they are thoroughly debunked.\" That makes the company's latest efforts seem \"defensive and out of step.\"\n\nWhat next?",

I mean, absolutely do not zoom in on the faces of the people lining the street on which the llamas here roam, but other than that...\n\nAs noted, a growing number of AI projects are now using Meta\u2019s Llama models to power their processes. That may not necessarily benefit Meta directly, in that these projects work independently of the company, but by playing a part in more AI projects, Meta is also embedding it\u2019s systems at the foundational level of a broad range of initiatives.\n\nAs per Meta:\n\n\u201cSince we first launched Llama in 2023, enterprises, startups, non-profits, creators, scientists, public institutions and more have used our models and tools to explore the incredible capabilities of AI. From top tech companies to universities, people and organizations all over the world are using Llama to innovate, drive scientific advances, and unlock new economic opportunities. And what we\u2019ve consistently heard from developers is that the transparency, customizability and security of open source models like Llama help reach new levels of creativity and innovation.\u201d\n\nThis is all part of Meta\u2019s open source approach to AI development, which it sees as the best path forward for broad-reaching AI development. According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, open sourcing AI development will enable greater access to the benefits of AI tools, while it\u2019ll also ensure that Meta is intrinsically linked to a wider set of AI projects, making it a more critical partner in the evolution of such systems.\n\nZuckerberg has also criticized Apple\u2019s approach to its app ecosystem, and the controls it implements over app development, and he sees this open source approach as being a counter to Apple\u2019s restrictive approach.\n\nNot sure how true that is, but basically, Zuckerberg really doesn\u2019t like Apple, and he noted that in his initial open source AI manifesto.\n\nThough the real motivation, as noted, is to establish Meta as the key AI leader. And with the company also investing more than $65 billion into AI development this year, and gathering up more computing resources than its competitors, it is indeed on track to become the dominant player in the space.\n\nOpen sourcing its models will only add to this, embedding Meta\u2019s informational datasets as the frameworks of many more AI developments.\n\nIndeed, Meta has also shared an overview of some of the ways in which its Llama model is already being used in different projects:\n\nSpotify has used Llama to help deliver customized, contextualized recommendations for new songs, artists, podcasts or audiobooks\n\nFynopsis uses Llama to provide multilingual and vision capabilities to analyze user data and auto-fill government documents\n\nAn innovative AI project has used Llama to power landmark assessment, and deliver insights about their historical or cultural significance.\n\nAt the same time, Meta\u2019s Llama models are also subject to legal challenges from various artists and publishers, who claim that Meta used their copyright-protected material without permission.\n\nIf any of these cases are upheld, that could add to Meta\u2019s AI development costs, in a significant way, though Meta is also working with the Trump Administration to ensure greater protections for such use, which could negate these legal claims in favor of innovation.\n\nAnd with so many extended projects also now reliant on Llama models, that could also strengthen its case, in pushing for such lawsuits to be dropped in favor of these developments.\n\nOn balance, right now, I would say that Meta is indeed leading the AI race, with broader adoption of its models, and more compute power, helping to boost its status.\n\nMore adoption of its core models can only help, while also making it increasingly difficult to reel back all that Llama data, if that were to be required based on legal challenges.",

Wynn-Williams, who worked at the company for seven years from 2011 to 2018, aims some scathing misconduct accusations at Meta, and particularly its chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWynn-Williams says she faced retaliation from the company after reporting sexual harassment by her boss, the company\u2019s current chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan, who got promoted to the role in January 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also accuses the tech giant of providing incomplete statements to Congress about Facebook\u2019s relationship with China. Earlier this month, Wynn-Williams filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission over this issue, saying that Meta was willing to let China censor content or completely shut down the site during times of social unrest, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta has denied the accusations, and on Wednesday successfully obtained an emergency ruling from the International Centre for Dispute Resolution, blocking Wynn-Williams from temporarily promoting the book, on the basis that the tech giant would likely succeed in its case against the former director for breach of the non-disparagement agreement she signed when leaving the company.\n\nThe ruling and Meta\u2019s overall attempts at censoring Wynn-Williams\u2019 claims may have done more damage for the tech giant though, as the media frenzy drew further attention to the book, creating the infamous Streisand effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2003, singer and actress Barbra Streisand sued a photographer for violation for privacy over an aerial photo of her house. The photograph had been dowloaded only six times before the lawsuit was filed, twice of which were by the actress\u2019 lawyers. A month after the filing, it was viewed more than 400 thousand times and remains widely published to this day.",

The Quest 3S has the same processor, features, ergonomics, and controllers for $200 less. However, the Quest 3 boasts significantly upgraded optics while the Quest 3S mostly carries over the same optics from the Quest 2 That's more significant than it reads on paper. How much enjoyment you get from VR headset is largely determined by the visual quality of the display. If the image that you see is blurry, or distorted, it takes you out of the immersion. For newcomers to VR gaming who are unsure of whether or not they'll enjoy the experience, the Quest 3S is the safer purchase. However for VR veterans, the improved immersion offered up by the Quest 3 is a worthwhile investment.\n\nQuest 3 Review by Eric Song \"The Quest 3 continues Meta\u2019s legacy of offering a cost-effective headset that doesn\u2019t require an expensive gaming PC, but can still benefit from one if you have it. That\u2019s a unique feature that sets it apart from almost every other VR headset out there, other than its own predecessors. The sheer amount of upgrades are well worth the $200 generational price increase. For everyone else is willing to make the splurge, the Quest 3 sets the new standard for VR and mixed reality gaming.\"\n\nPlay\n\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

(META): Among Top Stocks to Buy From Arrowstreet Capital's Portfolio\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 262\n\nArrowstreet Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $5.21 Billion\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has solidified its leadership in digital advertising through rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), driving substantial financial growth despite shifting industry policies. In its Q4 2024 earnings report, Meta reported exceptional performance, with revenue rising 21% year-over-year to $48.4 billion, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations of $47 billion and reinforcing its competitive edge. Earnings per share (EPS) surged 50% to $8.02, exceeding projections of $6.76 and contributing to a nearly 9% increase in Meta\u2019s stock price. The company\u2019s digital advertising segment remains its primary revenue source, leveraging AI to enhance ad targeting and content recommendations, which has strengthened its market dominance and attracted higher ad spending.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has seen a 22% increase over the past year, though its stock remains 15% below its 52-week high. Despite this, investors have reason for optimism as the company prepares to launch its Llama 4 artificial intelligence (AI) model in April 2025, which is expected to introduce major technological advancements. At the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference, Meta\u2019s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox highlighted Llama 4\u2019s capability to enhance AI agents, enabling them to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. Additionally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to host its first LlamaCon AI Conference on April 29, further emphasizing its commitment to AI innovation. Industry experts suggest that Meta\u2019s expanding AI initiatives, including a rumored standalone Meta AI app expected in Q2 2025, could strengthen its position in the competitive generative AI market.\n\nInvestor confidence in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to grow, with institutional support increasing significantly. Hedge fund interest also saw a notable rise, with 262 funds holding stakes valued at nearly $59.4 billion by the end of Q4 2024, compared to 235 funds in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database.

            "content": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s leaders appear to have steered it into a record $1.3 billion EU fine by failing to clean up the data practices behind years worth of privacy scandals, two pension funds said in court papers Monday.\n\nA union fund and Rhode Island\u2019s employee retirement system sued the tech giant for internal company documents, claiming they have credible suspicions that Meta\u2019s senior leaders are to blame for the \u201chistoric\u201d penalty. The fine in May 2023 stemmed from a broader crackdown on the company for transferring the data of European users to US-based servers that provide backdoor access to American intelligence agencies.\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesperson for Meta, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders aren\u2019t named as defendants.\n\nThe complaint, filed under seal in Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court, will likely be made public within five days under confidentiality rules providing five days to redact sensitive information. But the pension funds\u2014in related public filings describing the case\u2014called the violations part of a larger pattern of improper or illegal data harvesting.\n\nThey cited the Cambridge Analytica data-mining controversy that came to light after President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election, which led to a record $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nA separate shareholder lawsuit over the FTC fine is set for an April 2 trial in the same elite business court. That case involves an array of overlapping claims, including the allegation that Zuckerberg agreed to a larger-than-necessary fine to escape the prospect of personal liability, effectively using investor money to get himself off the hook.\n\nThe new suit seeks documents under a law giving investors broad access to company files if they have tentative suspicions about self-dealing or other wrongdoing. A proposed overhaul of Delaware corporate law could significantly curtail records cases, which often seek to drum up fiduciary breach claims for future litigation.\n\nThe pension funds are represented by Grant & Eisenhofer PA. Meta hasn\u2019t yet made a court appearance.\n\nThe case is N. Calif. Pipe Trades Trust Funds v. Meta Platforms Inc., Del. Ch., No. 2025-0291, complaint filed under seal 3/17/25.",

However, a low-level TRAI official shut down the campaign by simply opting out of Facebook's messages, rendering the outreach effort ineffective.\n\nRead Also: Legendary Trader Says Tesla, Nvidia, Apple Shares Are Ready To Rally: \u2018I See What I Like To See\u2019\n\nWhat Else: The company's assertive strategies \u2014 including negotiations with various governments and efforts to shape public perception \u2014 have raised questions about its approach to free speech, privacy, and regulatory compliance.\n\nThese concerns come at a pivotal time, as Meta adjusts its policies amid evolving political dynamics, while Zuckerberg positions the company as a prominent player in American tech diplomacy.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

            "content": "DeepSeek sent Wall Street into a frenzy on Monday, sending shares of Nvidia (NVDA) cratering more than 17% and raising questions about whether Big Tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are overspending on their own AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nCut to Microsoft and Meta's earnings calls Wednesday night and things were hunky dory. The CEOs of both companies, while acknowledging the efficiency improvements DeepSeek introduced to its AI models, said the Chinese-made AI will ultimately benefit their companies as well.\n\n\u201cThat type of optimization means AI will be much more ubiquitous,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. \u201cAnd so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, seemed to downplay the threat posed by DeepSeek, saying that the industry is constantly changing and DeepSeek\u2019s announcement is simply a part of that ebb and flow.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a number of novel things that they did that I think we\u2019re still digesting, and there are a number of things that they have \u2026 that we will hope to implement in our systems,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nDeepSeek set off alarm bells earlier this week as Wall Street caught wind of the company\u2019s claim that it trained its open-source DeepSeek-V3 AI model, which matches or beats the performance of US models, for just $5 million using less than state-of-the-art chips.\n\nUS companies have spent tens of millions of dollars training their own AI models, leading investors to question whether US tech companies are being outpaced by Chinese rivals and if they actually need to spend so much training their AI systems. And if they can train those systems on less expensive chips, the thinking goes, why are they spending so much building massive, high-priced data centers?\n\nHowever, analysts have questioned DeepSeek\u2019s claims, noting that the company says it didn\u2019t incorporate the \u201ccosts associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data,\u201d into the $5 million figure.\n\nOthers have criticized the fact that DeepSeek developed its model using a technique called distillation, which \u201cteaches\u201d an AI model using questions and answers provided by a larger model.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (AP Foto/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez, archivo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nDuring Meta\u2019s investor call, Zuckerberg said that it\u2019s too early to tell if there\u2019s any need to pull back on investing in AI infrastructure based on DeepSeek\u2019s data. Instead, the CEO said, Meta is better served by investing more in its data centers because the industry is moving to AI models that provide more accurate answers to questions depending on how much computing power they can pull from.\n\nThat, coupled with the billions of users Meta hopes to serve via its AI services, means the upward of $65 billion the company plans to spend on AI infrastructure this year is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll learn otherwise at some point, but I just think it\u2019s way too early to call that,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd at this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Nadella, for his part, said that the company\u2019s fleet of data centers is \u201cfungible\u201d and that its investments help the company scale long-term business.\n\n\u201cThe big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that [are] the customers,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nThe company previously announced it plans to spend $80 billion on its AI buildout in fiscal 2025.\n\nMeta and Microsoft are just the first of the Big Tech companies to report their earnings this quarter. Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) are set to follow Thursday, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) will report their financials on Feb. 4 and Feb. 6, respectively.\n\nAnd each company is certain to have something to say about the latest AI shake-up.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

There are several methods to establish this connection, each with its own setup process and requirements.\n\nUsing the Quest Link Cable\n\nThe most reliable connection method is through a physical USB-C cable. To get started, you\u2019ll need a compatible USB-C cable that supports data transfer at USB 3.0 speeds or higher.\n\nFirst, plug one end of the cable into a USB 3.0 port on your computer. The port is often colored blue on many PCs. Then connect the other end to the USB-C port on your Quest 3 headset.\n\nWhen properly connected, a notification saying \u201cUSB Detected\u201d will appear in your headset. You\u2019ll need to allow access when prompted.\n\nOpen the Meta Quest app on your PC and select \u201cEnable Link.\u201d In your headset, you\u2019ll need to approve the connection. Once established, your PC will recognize the headset as a display device.\n\nInitiating a Wireless Connection via Air Link\n\nAir Link offers a cable-free way to connect your Quest 3 to your PC. This method requires both devices to be on the same Wi-Fi network.\n\nTo begin, open the Meta Quest app on your PC and enable Air Link in the settings. Next, put on your headset and navigate to the Settings menu. Select the \u201cSystem\u201d option, then \u201cAir Link.\u201d\n\nYour PC should appear in the available devices list. Select it and click \u201cPair.\u201d You\u2019ll receive a pairing code to confirm on both devices.\n\nFor optimal performance, use a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection and keep your router close to your play area. This minimizes latency issues during gameplay.\n\nSetting Up Virtual Desktop for Streamed Connectivity\n\nVirtual Desktop offers another wireless option with some advantages for PC VR gaming. Unlike Air Link, it requires purchasing the app from the Meta Quest Store.\n\nAfter installation, download the Virtual Desktop Streamer application on your PC. Run the program and enter your Oculus username to link your devices.\n\nPut on your headset and open the Virtual Desktop app. Your PC should appear in the list. Select it to establish the connection. The app\u2019s interface gives you access to your PC desktop in VR.\n\nVirtual Desktop includes custom settings for game performance and visual quality. Users can adjust latency settings, bitrate, and rendering quality to find the perfect balance between visual fidelity and smooth gameplay.\n\nSoftware and Compatibility\n\nTo connect your Meta Quest 3 to a PC, you\u2019ll need specific software and compatible hardware. The right setup ensures your VR experience runs smoothly whether you\u2019re using a cable or wireless connection.\n\nInstalling Necessary Software\n\nThe Meta Quest app (formerly Oculus app) is essential for connecting your headset to a PC. Download it from the Meta website and follow the installation wizard. The app manages your VR library and handles the connection between your headset and computer.\n\nAfter installation, create or log into your Meta account. The software will guide you through setting up either Link (wired) or Air Link (wireless) connections.\n\nFor Air Link, enable it in both the PC app and in the headset settings.

            "content": "For years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made impressive developments, but it has always had a fundamental limitation in its inability to process different types of data the way humans do. Most AI models are unimodal, meaning they specialize in just one format like text, images, video, or audio. While adequate for specific tasks, this approach makes AI rigid, preventing it from connecting the dots across multiple data types and truly understanding context.\n\nTo solve this, multimodal AI was introduced, allowing models to work with multiple forms of input. However, building these systems is not easy. They require massive, labelled datasets, which are not only hard to find but also expensive and time-consuming to create. In addition, these models usually need task-specific fine-tuning, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale to new domains.\n\nMeta AI\u2019s Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver (MILS) is a development that changes this. Unlike traditional models that require retraining for every new task, MILS uses zero-shot learning to interpret and process unseen data formats without prior exposure. Instead of relying on pre-existing labels, it refines its outputs in real-time using an iterative scoring system, continuously improving its accuracy without the need for additional training.\n\nThe Problem with Traditional Multimodal AI\n\nMultimodal AI, which processes and integrates data from various sources to create a unified model, has immense potential for transforming how AI interacts with the world. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on a single type of data input, multimodal AI can understand and process multiple data types, such as converting images into text, generating captions for videos, or synthesizing speech from text.\n\nHowever, traditional multimodal AI systems face significant challenges, including complexity, high data requirements, and difficulties in data alignment. These models are typically more complex than unimodal models, requiring substantial computational resources and longer training times. The sheer variety of data involved poses serious challenges for data quality, storage, and redundancy, making such data volumes expensive to store and costly to process.\n\nTo operate effectively, multimodal AI requires large amounts of high-quality data from multiple modalities, and inconsistent data quality across modalities can affect the performance of these systems. Moreover, properly aligning meaningful data from various data types, data that represent the same time and space, is complex. The integration of data from different modalities is complex, as each modality has its structure, format, and processing requirements, making effective combinations difficult. Furthermore, high-quality labelled datasets that include multiple modalities are often scarce, and collecting and annotating multimodal data is time-consuming and expensive.\n\nRecognizing these limitations, Meta AI's MILS leverages zero-shot learning, enabling AI to perform tasks it was never explicitly trained on and generalize knowledge across different contexts. With zero-shot learning, MILS adapts and generates accurate outputs without requiring additional labelled data, taking this concept further by iterating over multiple AI-generated outputs and improving accuracy through an intelligent scoring system.\n\nWhy Zero-Shot Learning is a Game-Changer\n\nOne of the most significant advancements in AI is zero-shot learning, which allows AI models to perform tasks or recognize objects without prior specific training. Traditional machine learning relies on large, labelled datasets for every new task, meaning models must be explicitly trained on each category they need to recognize. This approach works well when plenty of training data is available, but it becomes a challenge in situations where labelled data is scarce, expensive, or impossible to obtain.\n\nZero-shot learning changes this by enabling AI to apply existing knowledge to new situations, much like how humans infer meaning from past experiences. Instead of relying solely on labelled examples, zero-shot models use auxiliary information, such as semantic attributes or contextual relationships, to generalize across tasks. This ability enhances scalability, reduces data dependency, and improves adaptability, making AI far more versatile in real-world applications.\n\nFor example, if a traditional AI model trained only on text is suddenly asked to describe an image, it would struggle without explicit training on visual data. In contrast, a zero-shot model like MILS can process and interpret the image without needing additional labelled examples. MILS further improves on this concept by iterating over multiple AI-generated outputs and refining its responses using an intelligent scoring system.\n\nThis approach is particularly valuable in fields where annotated data is limited or expensive to obtain, such as medical imaging, rare language translation, and emerging scientific research. The ability of zero-shot models to quickly adapt to new tasks without retraining makes them powerful tools for a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing.\n\nHow Meta AI\u2019s MILS Enhances Multimodal Understanding\n\nMeta AI's MILS introduces a smarter way for AI to interpret and refine multimodal data without requiring extensive retraining. It achieves this through an iterative two-step process powered by two key components:\n\nThe Generator : A Large Language Model (LLM), such as LLaMA-3.1-8B, that creates multiple possible interpretations of the input.\n\n: A Large Language Model (LLM), such as LLaMA-3.1-8B, that creates multiple possible interpretations of the input. The Scorer: A pre-trained multimodal model, like CLIP, evaluates these interpretations, ranking them based on accuracy and relevance.\n\nThis process repeats in a feedback loop, continuously refining outputs until the most precise and contextually accurate response is achieved, all without modifying the model\u2019s core parameters.\n\nWhat makes MILS unique is its real-time optimization. Traditional AI models rely on fixed pre-trained weights and require heavy retraining for new tasks. In contrast, MILS adapts dynamically at test time, refining its responses based on immediate feedback from the Scorer. This makes it more efficient, flexible, and less dependent on large labelled datasets.\n\nMILS can handle various multimodal tasks, such as:\n\nImage Captioning : Iteratively refining captions with LLaMA-3.1-8B and CLIP.\n\n: Iteratively refining captions with LLaMA-3.1-8B and CLIP. Video Analysis : Using ViCLIP to generate coherent descriptions of visual content.\n\n: Using ViCLIP to generate coherent descriptions of visual content. Audio Processing : Leveraging ImageBind to describe sounds in natural language.\n\n: Leveraging ImageBind to describe sounds in natural language. Text-to-Image Generation : Enhancing prompts before they are fed into diffusion models for better image quality.\n\n: Enhancing prompts before they are fed into diffusion models for better image quality. Style Transfer: Generating optimized editing prompts to ensure visually consistent transformations.\n\nBy using pre-trained models as scoring mechanisms rather than requiring dedicated multimodal training, MILS delivers powerful zero-shot performance across different tasks. This makes it a transformative approach for developers and researchers, enabling the integration of multimodal reasoning into applications without the burden of extensive retraining.\n\nHow MILS Outperforms Traditional AI\n\nMILS significantly outperforms traditional AI models in several key areas, particularly in training efficiency and cost reduction. Conventional AI systems typically require separate training for each type of data, which demands not only extensive labelled datasets but also incurs high computational costs. This separation creates a barrier to accessibility for many businesses, as the resources required for training can be prohibitive.\n\nIn contrast, MILS utilizes pre-trained models and refines outputs dynamically, significantly lowering these computational costs. This approach allows organizations to implement advanced AI capabilities without the financial burden typically associated with extensive model training.\n\nFurthermore, MILS demonstrates high accuracy and performance compared to existing AI models on various benchmarks for video captioning. Its iterative refinement process enables it to produce more accurate and contextually relevant results than one-shot AI models, which often struggle to generate precise descriptions from new data types. By continuously improving its outputs through feedback loops between the Generator and Scorer components, MILS ensures that the final results are not only high-quality but also adaptable to the specific nuances of each task.\n\nScalability and adaptability are additional strengths of MILS that set it apart from traditional AI systems. Because it does not require retraining for new tasks or data types, MILS can be integrated into various AI-driven systems across different industries. This inherent flexibility makes it highly scalable and future-proof, allowing organizations to leverage its capabilities as their needs evolve. As businesses increasingly seek to benefit from AI without the constraints of traditional models, MILS has emerged as a transformative solution that enhances efficiency while delivering superior performance across a range of applications.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMeta AI\u2019s MILS is changing the way AI handles different types of data. Instead of relying on massive labelled datasets or constant retraining, it learns and improves as it works. This makes AI more flexible and helpful across different fields, whether it is analyzing images, processing audio, or generating text.\n\nBy refining its responses in real-time, MILS brings AI closer to how humans process information, learning from feedback and making better decisions with each step. This approach is not just about making AI smarter; it is about making it practical and adaptable to real-world challenges.",

            "content": "Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, former U.K. deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, is leaving the social giant after more than six years. Taking his place: Joel Kaplan, a Meta lobbying exec with ties to the Republican party.\n\nClegg is stepping down from the role just weeks before Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as U.S. president. \u201cAs a new year begins, I have come to the view that this is the right time for me to move on from my role as President, Global Affairs at Meta,\u201d Clegg wrote in a public Facebook post Thursday.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nKaplan joined Facebook in 2011, and became the company\u2019s VP of global public policy in 2014. He has been seen as key to Meta\u2019s efforts to reach out conservative lawmakers who have criticized the company for a perceived anticonservative bias. \u201cJoel is quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time \u2014 ideally placed to shape the company\u2019s strategy as societal and political expectations around technology continue to evolve,\u201d Clegg wrote in the post.\n\nKaplan was formerly deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush from 2006-09. Prior to that, he worked as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia after graduating from Harvard Law School. Before joining Facebook, Kaplan was EVP for public policy and external affairs for Energy Future Holdings Corp.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Meta/Facebook in the past on numerous occasions \u2014 and also has attacked company co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In Trump\u2019s book \u201cSave America,\u201d published in early September, he repeated allegations that Facebook somehow interfered with the 2020 election and wrote, \u201cWe are watching [Zuckerberg] closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison \u2014 as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s 2024 election win, Zuckerberg traveled to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to dine with the president-elect. In addition, Meta is among companies donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.\n\nZuckerberg, in a reply Thursday on Clegg\u2019s resignation post, wrote, \u201cI\u2019m grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for Meta and the world these past seven years. I\u2019ve learned so much working with you and our whole team is better for having this opportunity. You\u2019ve made an important impact advancing Meta\u2019s voice and values around the world, as well as our vision for AI and the metaverse. You\u2019ve also built a strong team to carry this work forward. I\u2019m excited for Joel to step into this role next given his deep experience and insight leading our policy work for many years.\u201d\n\nClegg had served as head of the U.K.\u2019s Liberal Democrats party before joining Meta (then Facebook) in the fall of 2018. With the company\u2019s rapid growth in the following years \u201ccame significant scrutiny and controversy too \u2014 and I am proud of the work I have been able to do leading and supporting teams across the company to ensure continued innovation can go hand in hand with increased transparency and accountability, and with new forms of governance,\u201d he wrote.\n\nKevin Martin, who served as FCC chairman and was appointed to the commission by President George W. Bush, will replace Kaplan as VP of global policy. Martin joined Facebook in 2018 and has been Meta\u2019s VP of U.S. public policy. \u201cWith his extensive experience at Meta, and his previous record of public service as Chairman of the FCC, I know Kevin will be a strong leader of the policy org and will continue to be a great partner to Joel,\u201d Clegg wrote.\n\nPictured above: Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left), Joel Kaplan\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

            "content": "by Colin Kirkland , Yesterday\n\nMeta has officially announced the first stage of \u201cCommunity Notes,\u201d a controversial user-dependent content-moderation replacement to the company\u2019s longstanding fact-checking program.\n\nDespite the concern of its own Safety Council, which believe Community Notes will put an \u201cunreasonable burden\u201d onto users -- especially groups most vulnerable to long-term, cumulative harm -- Meta plans to begin rolling the feature out early next week across Instagram, Facebook and Threads.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially announced the company\u2019s plans to launch Community Notes shortly after President Donald Trump was re-elected, during which time Zuckerberg also said Meta would end \u201ca bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse.\u201d\n\nNot long after, the company altered its hateful conduct policy to \u201callow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation,\u201d while also removing a long-held policy that barred users from referring to women as household objects or property and referring to transgender or non-binary people as \u201cit.\u201d\n\nWith Community Notes, which is essentially crowd-sourced fact-checking, Meta says it will not be \u201creinventing the wheel.\u201d\n\nAligning more closely with the Trump administration, Meta\u2019s new moderation program will be based on the open-source algorithm developed by X, the social media platform owned by Trump ally Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to Meta, the rating system will take into account each contributor\u2019s rating history and evaluate which contributors usually disagree. Over time, Meta plans to tweak its own algorithm to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated.\n\nLike X\u2019s, Meta\u2019s process will factor in political bias to dilute potential conflict between contributors.\n\n\u201cMeta won\u2019t decide what gets rated or written -- contributors from our community will,\u201d the company says. \u201cAnd to safeguard against bias, notes won\u2019t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them. No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won\u2019t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.\u201d\n\nIn studies, this approach to moderating misleading or harmful content has proven to be ineffective. According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), 73% of Community Notes related to political topics on X are never displayed, although they are providing reliable context.\n\nAnother study conducted last month by Spanish fact-checking site Maldita found that 85% of all Community Notes are never displayed to X users.\n\nFurthermore, X's Community Notes feature has been infiltrated by groups of contributors who strategically collaborate to up and downvote notes based on their communal ideologies, throwing off the effectiveness of the feature. This is also likely to occur on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, which have billions more active users.\n\nMeta has decided to first roll out Community Notes in the U.S. The company says around 200,000 potential contributors have signed up across all three Meta-owned apps.\n\nHowever, notes won\u2019t initially appear on content, as Meta plans to start by \u201cgradually and randomly\u201d admitting people off the waitlist, and says it will \u201ctake time to test the writing and rating system before any notes are published publicly.\u201d\n\nOver time, as Community Notes rolls out to more users in more markets, third-party fact-checking will disappear entirely.\n\nWhile Meta has made it clear that Community Notes will not appear on paid ads, some marketers are still concerned about their future placements.\n\n\u201cWith fewer checks in place, there is a risk that ads may appear next to unverified content, which could impact user trust and engagement,\u201d Director of Product Marketing and Digital Remedy Gabrielle Turyan told MediaPost. \u201cAs a result, advertisers will need to reassess their brand-safety settings, update exclusion lists, and implement additional content certification measures. Monitoring performance closely will also be key to identifying any impact on ad effectiveness.\u201d\n\nOverall, Meta is hopeful about its switch to Community Notes, expecting the program to be \u201cless biased than the third-party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available,\u201d Meta adds. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how it played out, particularly in the United States. Experts, like everyone else, have their own political biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how.\u201d\n\nIn its announcement, Meta cites a study by the University of Luxembourg that shows Community Notes on X reducing the spread of misleading posts by an average of over 60%; a Science study that shows crowdsourced fact-checking to be as accurate as traditional fact-checking, while being more scalable and trustworthy; and a recent study by PNAS Nexus, which finds that the user-provided context of Community Notes results in much higher trustworthiness than fact-checking.\n\nThese findings, however, do not address the possibility that Community Notes will not be shown to users if contributors don\u2019t agree on the harmfulness of certain content. Taking into account how much misinformation Musk shares on his own X account, it is difficult to picture his followers agreeing that even his most misleading posts should be removed.\n\nMeta will begin testing Community Notes in the U.S. on March 18.",

            "content": "Greetings, comms pros! Let\u2019s take a look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them.\n\n1. Meta goes on defense as ex-Facebook employee alleges sexual harassment and human rights issues\n\nMeta has responded after a former employee lobbed explosive allegations against the tech giant in a memoir, accusing the company of an environment rife with sexual harassment and human rights problems. The author, Sarah Wynn-Williams said in her new book that the company created a revenge campaign against her when she reported her boss, current Meta chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan, for sexual harassment.\n\nThe company hit back at the former employee\u2019s claims, questioning their veracity and timing.\n\nAccording to NBC News:\n\n\u201cThis is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\u201d it said in a statement. The company also accused Wynn-Williams of being \u201can anti-Facebook activist.\u201d Since she left Facebook, she has advocated publicly for the company\u2019s shareholders to adopt new policies regarding sexual harassment and China. \u201cWhistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,\u201d the company said.\n\nIf these allegations are true, that\u2019s obviously one situation. But even if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s worth taking a look at Meta\u2019s tone and the implications for current employees. When organizations hit back against employees in these sensitive cases, it\u2019s entirely possible a ripple effect can permeate through the company\u2019s culture negatively. For instance, an employee who\u2019s facing similar treatment may not come forward after seeing how the company talked about Wynn-Williams\u2019 case, perceiving the company as hostile and unwilling to listen to their plight.\n\nWhen you\u2019re communicating about a crisis in the public eye, your organization needs to take special care to consider how current employees will receive the news. Internal and external communication are always tied to one another, and if you aren\u2019t careful you risk damaging your employer brand and company culture.\n\n2. British bank CEO staunchly defends four-day-workweek\n\nMark Mullen, CEO of UK-based Atom Bank, drew attention this week when he claimed that his company\u2019s four-day work-week is ahead of the curve. He said that because of the advancements of AI tech, fewer work days will be a prominent feature of the future of work.\n\nAccording to Fortune:\n\n\u201cI think a four-day week isn\u2019t progressive, it\u2019s bloody logical,\u201d said Mullen. \u201cAnd I expect that before I shuffle off my mortal coil, there\u2019ll be organizations offering a three-day week because why wouldn\u2019t you when the alternative is essentially a no-day week? I just don\u2019t understand how people can say a five-day week, which is a pre-Victorian invention, still works in the digital age. \u201cProject forward and ask yourself whether people are going to be working more hours or less hours. Project forward, and ask yourself whether the world of work that we grew up in over the last 40 years is going to be radically different over the next 40 years.\u201d\n\nMullen added that part of his reason for the policy is the need to attract the best talent in the market. It\u2019s also notable that he called every employee of the company his \u201ccolleague\u201d as opposed to \u201cemployee.\u201d Wording matters!\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cMy attitude to my colleagues is that they sell their talent for hire to me,\u201d said Mullen. \u201cTherefore the onus is on me to make sure that I provide a brand, a culture, a reward proposition, and a working experience that is attractive to them.\n\nMullen\u2019s stance on employee-first leadership messaging is notable for a few reasons. First, he accepts responsibility when it comes to providing a great place to work and a robust culture. That\u2019s a hallmark of effective leadership communication. If your leaders step up and own that responsibility, people are more likely to notice and feel that the company has effective people in charge.\n\nAdditionally, Mullen\u2019s choice to carefully term his employees as his colleagues and double down on a workplace policy that allows them more free time is a great way to build a culture that rallies around a leader and is willing to go to bat for him. His choices stand to make Atom Bank a more popular place to work with employees on the open market and keep retention high, and that\u2019s just good business.\n\nThe moves leaders make and how they speak about them go beyond just impacts on employee life \u2014 they don\u2019t happen in a vacuum and workers will take notice. Making smart moves as a leader can both shore up your culture and even pad the bottom line.\n\n3. Study: Empathetic leadership creates more productive remote and hybrid workers\n\nA recent study from Durham University and Athens University found that leaders and managers who show understanding and emotional connection with remote and hybrid workers are more likely to see increased productivity.\n\nThe study focused on three main elements \u2014 how leaders created employee structure, how they talked about their vision for work and their consideration for others. The study found that when managers and leaders were successful with each of these elements, employees felt closer and more trusting. This in turn led to higher productivity levels.\n\nCommunication touchpoints are especially important for remote and hybrid workers since traditional physical meetings aren\u2019t part of the leader-employee relationship. The data supports conventional knowledge that the more considerate of individual situations and understanding in your words to others within your company, the more likely you are to get better work out of your team.\n\nJust because your team is dispersed doesn\u2019t mean you can overlook close points of contact. Ensure that you\u2019re putting in the work to find common ground with those in remote and hybrid. Team check-ins that touch on how the team is holding up personally and treating pain points with empathy can help form all-important trust bonds that lead to higher productivity and an increased likelihood of employee retention. The data proves as much.\n\n4. How about some good news?\n\nThe world\u2019s largest underground thermal lake was discovered in Albania.\n\nArchaeologists in Denmark found a 4000-year-old \u201cStonehenge-like\u201d circle of wooden posts.\n\nScientists said a lake in Turkey is strikingly similar to a crater on Mars in its composition.\n\nRagan Training is great for communications pros to find inspiration and resources.\n\nYou should be rewarded for your work.

We don\u2019t expect this process to be perfect but we\u2019ll continue to improve as we learn.\u201d\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said that it would begin testing the feature on March 18 and that 200,000 potential contributors had signed up so far to help assess the accuracy of content on its platforms.\n\nThe California-based tech giant said notes would not be published unless they are deemed accurate by contributors with a diverse range of viewpoints.\n\n\u201cWe expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running,\u201d Meta said.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available.\u201d\n\nMeta said the new feature will be rolled out across the US after beta testing and it plans to eventually introduce the feature for all users worldwide.",

This follows the likes of Apple AAPL and TSMC TSM. In February, the iPhone maker invested $500 billion, while TSMC invested $10 billion in the United States, in a move to avoid tariffs and give a boost to Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda. When asked about the impact of tariffs, Trump continued to defend them and stated his belief that they would boost the U.S. economy and create more jobs in the country.\n\nAn anonymous source disclosed to Reuters on Wednesday that the meeting is part of Zuckerberg\u2019s continuous discussions with the administration concerning the leadership of American technology. However, Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Meta, did not confirm the White House visit to the publication.\n\nNotably, Meta has not officially announced the investment yet. The company did not immediately respond to Benzinga\u2019s request for comments.\n\nSee Also: Ross Gerber Finds Tesla Stock Expensive Despite Its 50% Plunge: Why The Investor Says EV Giant\u2019s \u2018Fundamental Story Has To Be Revalued\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: The possible meeting between Zuckerberg and the Trump administration officials comes at a time when Meta\u2019s shares are experiencing a downward trend. Meta\u2019s shares traded lower on Thursday amid an overall market weakness that has been impacting social media and tech stocks.\n\nThe decline in Meta\u2019s shares is attributed to the erasure of Wednesday\u2019s gains by Wall Street, with market sentiment being negatively affected by tariff threats and economic data. The possible meeting with the Trump administration could be seen as a strategic move by Zuckerberg to discuss these issues and potentially influence future policies that could impact Meta and the tech industry at large.\n\nMeta holds a momentum rating of 87.21% and a growth rating of 72.53%, according to Benzinga\u2019s Proprietary Edge Rankings.

Meta\u2019s decisive shift towards OpenXR promises to streamline game development, while the NHS sees tangible benefits from VR-based pain management.\n\nMeanwhile, AI is revolutionizing training and content creation, with platforms like Cicero delivering hyper-realistic scenarios and GIGABYTE partnering with TAICCA to launch an AI-driven XR content creation platform. These developments underscore XR technologies\u2019 growing maturity and versatility, signalling a new era of immersive experiences.\n\nMeta Unleashes OpenXR As Standard Gaming Development Path\n\nMeta is set to introduce a new level of development freedom this week with the release of its v74 SDK. This update makes OpenXR the recommended way to create immersive experiences across Unity, Unreal, and Godot.\n\nSince diving into the OpenXR initiative in 2016, Meta has been quietly laying the groundwork for this moment. With the OpenXR Meta package now matching the capabilities of the Oculus XR plugin, developers can finally build their projects once and deploy them across multiple platforms without sacrificing the unique features of Horizon OS.\n\nAs the XR landscape becomes increasingly crowded and competitive, developers have been seeking to reach more users without the hassle of rebuilding their projects for each platform.\n\nNHS Debuts DR.VR\n\nMedical professionals at Friarage Hospital have released the results of a testing period for the implementation of virtual reality headsets. These headsets have been shown to reduce pain, breathlessness, and anxiety in patients through calming VR experiences.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s specialist palliative care team is deploying DR.VR Immersive Therapy Kits, a VR headset solution designed for patients receiving care at home in the Hambleton and Richmondshire areas.\n\nNHS staff are utilizing the DR.VR Immersive Therapy Kits through a two-year lease, supported by fundraising efforts from Our Hospitals Charity, part of the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nAdditionally, Rescape Innovation Ltd. collaborated to provide the NHS division with the necessary technology and headsets, promoting innovative patient care solutions with the assistance of various funding bodies.\n\nFundraising Manager for Our Hospitals Charity, Lisa Meehan, said:\n\nWe are delighted to be able to fund this equipment and it is wonderful to hear that patients are already benefitting from it. We are always keen to improve patient experience and have been able to do this thanks to a generous donation and hope that many more patients will benefit from its use.\n\nCGS\u2019 AI-driven \u2018Cicero\u2019 Deploys Complex Workplace Training Scenarios in Seconds\n\nCGS announced Cicero, a platform that creates hyper-realistic training scenarios, allowing employees to practice critical business interactions with AI-generated personas that respond dynamically to their approaches.\n\nThis platform enables organizations to deploy customized training scenarios in as little as 15 minutes, addressing a significant challenge in corporate learning and development (L&D): the time lag between identifying training needs and implementing solutions.\n\n\u201cTraditional workplace training is often generic, costly, and lacking in the real-world context employees need to succeed,\u201d said Doug Stephen, President of CGS Immersive. The Executive continued:\n\nWith Cicero\u2019s hyper-realistic scenarios, businesses can immerse their teams in dynamic, unscripted roleplay simulations for a limitless number of real-world circumstances. The engagement and feedback created with Cicero drives measurable performance improvements and ROI. What normally took teams weeks to develop can now be produced in minutes.\n\nGIGABYTE & TAICCA Launch AI-Driven XR Content Creation Platform\n\nAt the 2025 SXSW festival, which is renowned for showcasing the latest in arts and technology, GIGABYTE, an innovator in immersive technology, announced a partnership with the Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA). This collaboration aims to promote the deployment of an AI-powered XR content creation platform.\n\nDuring the SXSW 2025 XR Lounge, this partnership highlighted the event\u2019s reputation as a leader in technological innovation.

Sarah is not to promote the book or continue publishing it in future, though no action has been ordered toward the publisher Macmillan.\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesperson for Meta, said via Threads that the ruling \u2018affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams\u2019 false and defamatory book should never have been published.\u2019 In a recent news article, The Guardian said neither Sarah nor Macmillan responded to a comment request.\n\nOf course, despite the ruling, the book is still available for sale.

The evidence suggests that inadequate sleep could contribute to neurodegeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead author of the study, PhD candidate Dr Tergel Namsrai said while there\u2019s a clear overlap, the connection between our sleep and the health of our brains is poorly understood and needs to be looked at more closely.\n\nWant more breaking news?

            "content": "Crowdsourced moderation is better than nothing \u2014 but how much better remains an open question\n\nEager to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration, Meta kicked off 2025 by announcing a large-scale retreat from its content moderation and fact-checking efforts in the United States . The company had invested billions of dollars in building sophisticated automated systems that detected and removed vast quantities of misinformation, hate speech, and other things that most people would rather not see. But scared of retribution from Trump, and frustrated with high error rates in its systems, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would stop scanning most new posts for violations and instead begin relying more on the user base to report instances of harm.\n\nAs part of these changes, Meta also said it would stop funding third-party fact-checking organizations, which it said had broadly failed to improve trust in its platforms. In their place, Zuckerberg said the company would borrow a feature from X: Community Notes, a way for users to add context to posts by providing additional information about what they are seeing. If a viral photo of a celebrity was actually generated by artificial intelligence, or an image presented as breaking news was actually taken years earlier, Community Notes can help audiences understand the truth of what they\u2019re seeing.\n\nIn a sign of how abruptly Meta had decided to abandon years of investment in content moderation, work on its Community Notes feature had barely begun when Zuckerberg announced it was coming. But today the company announced that they are almost ready to launch : on Tuesday, the company will begin accepting notes across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. (It said it would take an unspecified amount of time to evaluate them before posting them publicly.)\n\n\u201cWe expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces because it allows more people with more perspectives to add context to posts,\u201d the company said in an unsigned blog post.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the one true innovation that Community Notes brought to content moderation after Twitter began experimenting with them in 2021 . Community Notes are the most prominent example to date of a product that uses what\u2019s known as bridging-based ranking \u2014 algorithms that reward behavior that bridges people with different views. When Twitter expanded the program then known as Birdwatch , it decided to display notes on tweets only if they had been marked as helpful by people who normally disagree. If a post was upvoted only by people with left- or right-leaning views, it would not appear. But if a post could get left-leaning and right-leaning users to agree that a post was helpful, Twitter would display it right on the tweet.\n\nThis incentivized people to add notes that were based in fact rather than opinion. In its early tests, Twitter found that surveys showed people were 20 to 40 percent less likely to agree with tweets rated as misleading after they read Birdwatch notes.\n\nThis is good and useful work, even if it stops short of what author Aviv Ovadya called for in his original proposal for bridging-based ranking. \u201cImagine if Facebook rewarded content that led to positive interactions across diverse audiences, including around divisive topics,\u201d they wrote in 2022 . \u201cHow might that change what people, posts, pages, and groups are successful?\u201d I\u2019d still love to find out.\n\nThat core innovation aside, though, Community Notes have several important limitations, according to former Twitter executives I\u2019ve interviewed.\n\nOne, despite being available globally, they appeared relatively rarely outside the United States. Some Twitter executives speculate that this is due to lack of trust in the company, particularly in countries with more authoritarian leaders. If you correct a comment made by your fascist president, will X share that comment with the government? The fear alone has been enough to limit notes\u2019 usefulness abroad.\n\nTwo, Community Notes take longer to appear on viral posts than Meta\u2019s fact checks typically do. This is a downside of bridging-based ranking: it typically takes many hours for a post to accumulate enough votes from people with different perspectives for the system to deem it helpful. In situations where every minute matters \u2014 the aftermath of a tragedy, or in the midst of an election \u2014 Community Notes may not arrive until they\u2019re too late to do much good.\n\nThree, Community Notes on X often rely on information from the independent fact-checking programs that Meta just pulled the funding for. Meta has long said it doesn\u2019t want to be an \u201carbiter of truth,\u201d but it has funded those arbiters for the past several years, and it\u2019s not clear whether anyone will step up to replace it. If no one does, Community Notes will suffer both on X and on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nMost importantly, though, Meta said it will not reduce the distribution of posts that its users have determined to be false. That\u2019s the opposite of the approach it took with fact checks. Until last year , when third-party fact checkers rated a post as false, Meta reduced its distribution significantly. While fact checks themselves seem to have done little to change people\u2019s beliefs, showing them fewer false posts overall seems like an obvious benefit to the quality of Meta\u2019s services.\n\nNow, no matter how false or misleading a post is, Meta has committed to showing it to as many people as its ranking systems predict will find it engaging.\n\nWhen I asked about its rationale, the company told me that having a note attached doesn\u2019t mean that a post is false \u2014 only that people thought it needed more context. And even in cases where someone is lying, Meta said it wants to move away from a more \u201cpunitive\u201d system, instead showing people additional information and letting them make up their own minds.\n\n\u201cNotes \u2026 won\u2019t have penalties associated with them the way fact checks did,\u201d the company said in its blog post today. \u201cFact checked posts often had their distribution across our platforms reduced. That won\u2019t be the case with posts that have notes applied to them. Notes will provide extra context, but they won\u2019t impact who can see the content or how widely it can be shared.\u201d\n\nAnd to be fair, Twitter took this approach as well \u2014 it never downranked content that has Community Notes attached. And notes can result in content being downranked in an indirect way: seeing them generally makes people less likely to interact with a post, which in turn results in platforms showing them to fewer people.\n\nAt the same time, Twitter\u2019s Community Notes \u2014 like Meta\u2019s fact-checking program \u2014 was never intended to be a load-bearing pillar of either company\u2019s content moderation efforts. Rather, it was intended to complement other, more robust efforts, such as relying on internal teams and automated systems to label obvious falsehoods.\n\nMeta will continue to use some automated systems and human moderators, though it has said it will focus them on what it considers the highest-severity harms, such as terrorism. It will be up to individual users to do the rest. (The company says \u201caround\u201d 200,000 people in the United States have signed up to participate so far.) How this will affect the average experience of using Facebook, Instagram, or Threads is still anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nStill, it seems likely that people will now see more nonsense that they did before. If all goes well, it will come appended with a note informing you that you\u2019re looking at nonsense. Meta has expressed confidence that this approach will build trust in its systems. Even if it does so, though, it will come at the expense of wasting huge amounts of its users\u2019 time and attention.\n\nAn earlier generation of leaders at Meta argued, among other things, that filling up feeds with obvious falsehoods made for a bad user experience. But those leaders are gone, and in the place of third-party fact checks you can now find Shrimp Jesus and other AI slop .\n\nThere was a moment when Meta seemed to take seriously the idea that its users might want the truth \u2014 might want journalism, even. But that belief has been thoroughly bullied out of them, and there\u2019s no telling what that might mean for the rest of us.\n\nCorrections, 6:29 p.m.: This post was updated to reflect the proper authorship of the bridging-based ranking paper and to note that while it will begin accepting notes next week, Meta will not publish them until later.\n\nOn the podcast this week: Kevin and I sort through what's going on with Apple Intelligence.

On March 18th, we will begin testing this new approach by allowing contributors from our community to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWe\u2019re going to take time to do this right. Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have signed up so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program. But notes won\u2019t initially appear on content. We will start by gradually and randomly admitting people off of the waitlist, and will take time to test the writing and rating system before any notes are published publicly.\n\nHow Do Community Notes Work?\n\nMany of you will be familiar with X\u2019s Community Notes system, in which users add context to posts. That\u2019s the broad approach we are adopting.\n\nMeta won\u2019t decide what gets rated or written \u2013 contributors from our community will. And to safeguard against bias, notes won\u2019t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.\n\nThis isn\u2019t majority rules. No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won\u2019t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.\n\nCommunity Notes will have a limit of 500 characters and will need to include a link to support the note.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTo start with, notes won\u2019t have author names attached to them. We want notes to be rated based on whether the context they add is helpful, not on who wrote them.\n\nContributors need to be over 18, have an account that\u2019s more than 6 months old and in good standing, and either have a verified phone number or be enrolled in two-factor authentication.\n\nThe Community Notes feature will be available in 6 languages commonly used in the United States to start, including: English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese, and we will expand to other languages with time.\n\nTo start with, contributors will not be able to submit notes on advertisements. They can, however, write and submit notes on almost any other forms of content, including posts by Meta, our executives, politicians and other public figures.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nHow Are We Building Community Notes?\n\nWe won\u2019t be reinventing the wheel. Initially we will use X\u2019s open source algorithm as the basis of our rating system. This will allow us to build on what X has created and improve it for our own platforms over time.\n\nThe rating system will take into account each contributor\u2019s rating history and evaluate which contributors normally disagree.\n\nAs X\u2019s algorithm and program information is open source \u2013 meaning free and available for anyone to use \u2013 we can build on what X has done, learn from the researchers who have studied it, and improve the system for our own platforms. As our own version develops, we may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated.\n\nWe\u2019re building this in the open while learning from contributors and seeing how it works in practice in our products. We don\u2019t expect this process to be perfect but we\u2019ll continue to improve as we learn.\n\nWe expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running. When we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available. But that\u2019s not how it played out, particularly in the United States. Experts, like everyone else, have their own political biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how.\n\nCommunity Notes allow more people with more perspectives to add context to more types of content, and because publishing a note requires agreement between different people, we believe it will be less prone to bias. This requirement is also a safeguard against organized campaigns attempting to game the system and influence what notes get published or what they say.\n\nNotes also won\u2019t have penalties associated with them the way fact checks did. Fact checked posts often had their distribution across our platforms reduced. That won\u2019t be the case with posts that have notes applied to them. Notes will provide extra context, but they won\u2019t impact who can see the content or how widely it can be shared.\n\nOur plan is to roll out Community Notes across the United States once we are comfortable from the initial beta testing that the program is working in broadly the way we believe it should, though we will continue to learn and improve it as we go. Once Notes begin to appear publicly, no new fact check labels from third party fact checkers will appear in the United States, though fact checkers are free to become Community Notes contributors alongside other users of our platform.\n\nOur intention is ultimately to roll out this new approach to our users all over the world, but we won\u2019t be doing that immediately. Until Community Notes are launched in other countries, the third party fact checking program will remain in place for them.",

Photo by Mandel NGAN and Alain JOCARD / AFP\n\nMeta first announced in January that it would end its eight-year independent fact-checking program and transition to a Community Notes system. The company previously relied on experts at organizations like The Associated Press to determine whether its content was factually correct but said it was moving to Community Notes to allow for more people to monitor posts and add context.\n\nSince January, about 200,000 users have signed up to volunteer as contributors to Community Notes across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Meta intends to slowly implement the program and eventually allow contributors to add Community Notes to posts from everyone from public figures to personal connections. The notes will be added anonymously and do not apply to ads.\n\nMeta is copying X's Community Notes model, which has achieved some success. According to a study released in April 2024 by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, X's Community Notes were almost always accurate and cited high-quality sources.\n\nRelated: Meta Says It Has Fired 20 Employees For Leaking Information: 'We Expect There Will Be More'\n\nWhile Zuckerberg may be tapping into the Community Notes algorithm Musk uses at X for Meta's algorithm, the road goes both ways: Musk too has expressed an interest in open-source technology created by Zuckerberg-led Meta.\n\nIn April 2024, Meta released Llama 3, its latest AI model that is free for anyone to download and use. That same month, Musk wrote in a post on X that the AI model was \"not bad.\"\n\nNot bad \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 18, 2024\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Musk and Zuckerberg are among the top three richest people in the world, worth $319 billion and $219 billion respectively.",

            "content": "In January, Meta announced that we will end our third party fact checking program and move to a crowd-sourced Community Notes approach, starting in the United States. On March 18th, we will begin testing this new approach by allowing contributors from our community to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWe\u2019re going to take time to do this right. Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have signed up so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program. But notes won\u2019t initially appear on content. We will start by gradually and randomly admitting people off of the waitlist, and will take time to test the writing and rating system before any notes are published publicly.\n\nHow Do Community Notes Work?\n\nMany of you will be familiar with X\u2019s Community Notes system, in which users add context to posts. That\u2019s the broad approach we are adopting.\n\nMeta won\u2019t decide what gets rated or written \u2013 contributors from our community will. And to safeguard against bias, notes won\u2019t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.\n\nThis isn\u2019t majority rules. No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won\u2019t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.\n\nCommunity Notes will have a limit of 500 characters and will need to include a link to support the note.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTo start with, notes won\u2019t have author names attached to them. We want notes to be rated based on whether the context they add is helpful, not on who wrote them.\n\nContributors need to be over 18, have an account that\u2019s more than 6 months old and in good standing, and either have a verified phone number or be enrolled in two-factor authentication.\n\nThe Community Notes feature will be available in 6 languages commonly used in the United States to start, including: English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Portuguese, and we will expand to other languages with time.\n\nTo start with, contributors will not be able to submit notes on advertisements. They can, however, write and submit notes on almost any other forms of content, including posts by Meta, our executives, politicians and other public figures.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nHow Are We Building Community Notes?\n\nWe won\u2019t be reinventing the wheel. Initially we will use X\u2019s open source algorithm as the basis of our rating system. This will allow us to build on what X has created and improve it for our own platforms over time.\n\nThe rating system will take into account each contributor\u2019s rating history and evaluate which contributors normally disagree.\n\nAs X\u2019s algorithm and program information is open source \u2013 meaning free and available for anyone to use \u2013 we can build on what X has done, learn from the researchers who have studied it, and improve the system for our own platforms. As our own version develops, we may explore different or adjusted algorithms to support how Community Notes are ranked and rated.\n\nWe\u2019re building this in the open while learning from contributors and seeing how it works in practice in our products. We don\u2019t expect this process to be perfect but we\u2019ll continue to improve as we learn.\n\nWe expect Community Notes to be less biased than the third party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale when it is fully up and running. When we launched the fact checking program in 2016, we were clear that we didn\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth and believed that turning to expert fact checking organizations was the best solution available. But that\u2019s not how it played out, particularly in the United States. Experts, like everyone else, have their own political biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how.\n\nCommunity Notes allow more people with more perspectives to add context to more types of content, and because publishing a note requires agreement between different people, we believe it will be less prone to bias. This requirement is also a safeguard against organized campaigns attempting to game the system and influence what notes get published or what they say.\n\nNotes also won\u2019t have penalties associated with them the way fact checks did. Fact checked posts often had their distribution across our platforms reduced. That won\u2019t be the case with posts that have notes applied to them. Notes will provide extra context, but they won\u2019t impact who can see the content or how widely it can be shared.\n\nOur plan is to roll out Community Notes across the United States once we are comfortable from the initial beta testing that the program is working in broadly the way we believe it should, though we will continue to learn and improve it as we go. Once Notes begin to appear publicly, no new fact check labels from third party fact checkers will appear in the United States, though fact checkers are free to become Community Notes contributors alongside other users of our platform.\n\nOur intention is ultimately to roll out this new approach to our users all over the world, but we won\u2019t be doing that immediately. Until Community Notes are launched in other countries, the third party fact checking program will remain in place for them.",

In a study conducted in January this year, across 1,075 ad accounts, Meta found that the added data from GA4 led to a 5% improvement in conversions.\n\nWhich is significant, while the added traffic insight will also provide Meta\u2019s ad system with more context to further enhance and train systematic performance over time.\n\nI mean, not everyone\u2019s going to be comfortable linking up their data sources, and allowing Meta to peek at their website performance. But it does make sense, in that it will provide expanded insight into how your campaigns are driving traffic, and the exact types of activity that users are then undertaking on your site as a result.\n\nWhich, again, will also help Meta better understand ad engagement behavior, and the key elements, in broader terms, that drive conversion.\n\nMeta\u2019s still rolling this out, so it may not be available to you yet. But it\u2019s another potential ad enhancement to consider.\n\nYou can read more about Meta\u2019s integration with Google Analytics here.",

It also discusses Facebook\u2019s role in President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, as well as central characters in Meta\u2019s business, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and newly appointed Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan.\n\nWynn-Williams joined what was then called Facebook in 2011 after working as a diplomat for New Zealand in Washington, DC. She worked her way up to director of global public policy but was fired in 2017, which the company said came after an investigation found that she\u2019d made \u201cunfounded\u201d statements. Wynn-Williams implied in her book that she was fired in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.\n\nMeta has pushed back strongly on Wynn-Williams\u2019 book. In a statement to CNN, Meta spokesperson Nkechi Nneji said the book contained both \u201cout-of-date\u201d claims and \u201cfalse accusations about our executives\u201d and called Wynn-Williams an \u201cactivist.\u201d\n\n\u201cEight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment,\u201d Nneji said. \u201cSince then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work.\u201d\n\nMeta filed an arbitration demand against Wynn-Williams, stating that the claims made in her book violate a non-disparagement agreement she signed when she left the company. On Wednesday, an emergency arbitrator ruled that Meta was likely to succeed in its claim that the book violates Wynn-Williams\u2019 non-disparagement agreement. The arbitrator temporarily ordered her not to make any \u201cdisparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments\u201d related to Meta and to stop promoting the book, among other demands, according to a legal filing shared by Meta spokesperson Andy Stone on X.\n\nAccording to the filing, Wynn-Williams did not formally respond to the arbitration demand. CNN has reached out to her publisher for comment.\n\nWynn-Williams is just the latest former employee to come forward in recent years raising concerns about Meta\u2019s culture, practices and leadership.\n\nHistory of Facebook whistleblowers\n\nIn 2021, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen disclosed hundreds of internal company documents to the government, which revealed everything from the company\u2019s struggles to manage human trafficking on its platforms to its failures to protect young users. She told Congress that she believed the company put profits over societal good.\n\nThat same year, former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang claimed that the company was not doing enough to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation, especially in developing countries, and said she had passed documentation to US law enforcement. Zhang said the company told her that she was fired because of performance issues.\n\nThen in 2023, ex-Facebook engineering director Arturo Bejar testified to Congress that Meta fosters a culture of \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d that overlooks evidence of harm. He also said Zuckerberg ignored warnings for years about the damage its platforms, including Instagram, have inflicted on teens.\n\nIn response to those claims, Meta has denied that it promotes profit over safety and called the documents released by Haugen a \u201ccurated selection\u201d that could \u201cin no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us.\u201d It also said it has invested billions of dollars in recent years in safety and security initiatives, as well as numerous efforts and features to protect teen users.\n\nFollowing the publication of Wynn-Williams\u2019 book, Meta pointed CNN to social media posts from current and former Meta employees cited in the book who contested Wynn-Williams\u2019 depictions of the company and events detailed in the book.\n\nThe company also sent a letter to Wynn-Williams\u2019 publisher prior to publication, saying it had made \u201cno attempt to verify any\u201d of the book\u2019s contents with Meta. It threatened legal action if the book contained \u201cany false statements, characterizations, or implications.\u201d (The publisher did not immediately respond the company\u2019s claims about fact checking, nor its claims that the book is related to Wynn-Williams\u2019 work with \u201canti-Facebook activists.\u201d)\n\nStill, the book could thrust Meta back into the crosshairs of Congress, which has called for tighter regulation of the company and repeatedly hauled Zuckerberg and other executives to Capitol Hill to testify about alleged safety shortcomings. Lawmakers have failed to pass any federal legislation to rein in the internet giant, even after Zuckerberg apologized to families who said their children had been harmed by his platforms in a hearing last January.\n\nWynn-Williams\u2019 account also comes as Meta has sought to gain favor with the Trump administration, including by rolling back some content moderation practices and by promoting Joel Kaplan, who is featured heavily in the book, to its top policy role.\n\n\u201c(People) deserve to know what this big, powerful company is really like,\u201d Wynn-Williams told NBC News of her decision to write the book despite likely backlash from the company.\n\nHere are three notable allegations from Wynn-Williams\u2019 book, according to an advanced copy reviewed by CNN.\n\nDetails on Meta\u2019s new policy chief\n\nThe book offers insight on Kaplan \u2014 who joined Meta the same year as Wynn-Williams after serving in the George W. Bush White House \u2014 that hints at why the company may have elevated him to its top policy job just before Trump took office this year.\n\nIt depicts Kaplan as the architect of Meta\u2019s effort to sell political ads. In 2014, after becoming vice president of global public policy, he began hiring a \u201cpolitical sales team\u201d to encourage politicians to purchase ads, the book states.\n\n\u201cThe idea is, if politicians depend on Facebook to win elections, they\u2019ll be less likely to do anything that\u2019ll harm Facebook,\u201d Wynn-Williams wrote.\n\nThe book indicates that Kaplan did not vote for Trump in 2016, but supported his win because of Trump\u2019s \u201cRepublican agenda,\u201d despite saying there were \u201csome things\u2026 I\u2019m not wild about.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wynn-Williams writes that Kaplan told her that he worried Trump wouldn\u2019t go far enough in cutting Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, providing an alleged glimpse into the political views of who is now Meta\u2019s top lobbyist in Washington.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first administration, Kaplan interviewed for a Cabinet position but decided to remain at Meta, according to the book. But his closeness to Trump allowed Kaplan to gain more power within the company and weigh in on product issues as well as policy matters, the book states.\n\n\u201cThis means that decisions about political speech, content, and the algorithm all go through Joel,\u201d the book says.\n\nWynn-Williams also alleges a pattern of sexual harassment by Kaplan and said that reporting it ultimately led to her firing.\n\nFor example, she claims that while she was on maternity leave following the difficult birth of her second child after which she hemorrhaged, Kaplan asked Wynn-Williams to take weekly video meetings, which he eventually started taking \u201csprawled across his bed rather than in his office.\u201d In one such meeting, when Wynn-Williams said she needed another surgery, she claims that Kaplan repeatedly pushed her to answer, \u201cwhere are you bleeding from?\u201d\n\nA year later, at a company offsite event in California, Wynn-Williams wrote that Kaplan said publicly that she was \u201clooking sultry tonight,\u201d and later grinded into her on the dance floor.\n\nWynn-Williams writes that she was later told by an HR investigator that Kaplan \u201cwas looking at a photo of (Wynn-Williams)\u201d when he called her \u201csultry,\u201d which she said made it \u201cweirder.\u201d Investigators cleared Kaplan but noted Wynn-Williams\u2019 performance issues and fired her shortly after, the book states.\n\nMeta told CNN that its investigation took over a month and involved interviewing 17 witnesses and reviewing documents provided by Wynn-Williams and others. Meta says it determined her accusations were unfounded.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with by Facebook's then-vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, in Paris in 2018. Kaplan was promoted to the company's top policy job this year. Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBackground on Facebook\u2019s fateful push into Myanmar\n\nShortly after the company\u2019s 2012 initial public offering, Wynn-Williams wrote that its executives identified Myanmar as a potential source of growth, with tens of millions of potential users.\n\nAccording to the book, she was sent there to speak with the military junta that controlled the country at the time \u2014 which had blocked the platform. During the trip, Wynn-Williams had to flag down a stranger who did not speak English and mimed to convince him to drive her to the meeting because she did not have cell service or existing contacts in the country, according to the book.\n\nThe outcome of Facebook\u2019s push in Myanmar, where it served as essentially the entire internet in the developing country, is now well-known: Facebook admitted in 2018 that it failed to do enough to prevent its platform from being used to fuel political division and violence during the genocide of the country\u2019s predominantly Muslim Rohingya minority group.\n\n\u201cNone of the senior leaders\u2026 thought about this enough to put in place the kinds of systems we\u2019d need, in Myanmar or other countries,\u201d Wynn-Williams wrote in the book, reflecting on the crisis. \u201cThey apparently didn\u2019t care. These were sins of omission. It wasn\u2019t the things they did; it was the things they didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, Meta says it has taken steps to ensure the safety of its platforms in Myanmar, including building a team dedicated to the country, working with partners on the ground to remove misinformation, hiring content reviewers with native language expertise, and banning hate figures, the military and state-run media. (Meta says its recent rollback of third-party fact checking applies only in the United States, so its misinformation practices in Myanmar have not changed; it did not immediately respond to a question about the size of its workforce dedicated to the country.)\n\nNegotiations with the Chinese government\n\nWynn-Williams writes that in 2014, Zuckerberg laid out in an email a three-year plan to make Facebook accessible in China, where it had been blocked by the government like many other internet platforms. He said the expansion was necessary for the company\u2019s \u201cmission to connect the world\u201d and called for more engagement with the Chinese government, according to text of the email included in the book.\n\nThree years later, as part of that push, Wynn-Williams said Facebook considered a strategy to enter the country that would involve partnering with a Chinese company that would censor and hand over user data on behalf of the Chinese government. Under Zuckerberg\u2019s direction, Facebook engineers began building \u201cnew censorship tools\u201d for the partnership, the book states.\n\nWynn-Williams wrote that, at the time, Facebook employees drafted hypothetical news headlines they might have to respond to if word got out about the company\u2019s work with the Chinese government. Such sample headlines included: \u201cChinese government uses Facebook to spy on its citizens.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the company did not go through with the plan and still does not operate in China, a point Meta notes has been widely reported.\n\nIn a document disputing several of Wynn-Williams\u2019 claims, Meta pointed to a 2019 speech about the company\u2019s focus on free expression, in which Zuckerberg said Meta could \u201cnever come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.\u201d\n\nMeta has called Wynn-Williams\u2019 assertions either misleading or old news. But her book offers one person\u2019s perspective on the evolution of a company that\u2019s seeking to become more powerful than ever by aiming to be a leader in the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t address what has been covered up, we\u2019ll repeat Facebook\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Wynn-Williams wrote at the end of the book.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

During that time, she became a high-level employee who interacted with CEO Mark Zuckerberg, then-COO Sheryl Sandberg and Joel Kaplan, the company's current policy chief. In the book, Wynn-Williams alleges that Kaplan made a number of inappropriate comments to her, which she then reported to the company as sexual harassment.\n\n\"This is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,\" a Meta spokesperson previously said about both her book and complaint.\n\nWynn-Williams also details in her book the company's various attempts to enter the Chinese market, including building tools that would censor content to appease the Chinese Communist Party. Wynn-Williams addressed some of these China-specific claims in a whistleblower complaint that she filed in April with the Securities and Exchange Commission, NBC News reported.\n\nThe emergency arbitrator ruled in favor of Meta after watching a podcast appearance of Wynn-Williams in which she discussed her memoir and her allegations that Meta was attempting to \"shut this book down.\"\n\n\"The Emergency Arbitrator finds that, after reviewing the briefs and hearing oral argument, (Meta) has established a likelihood of success on the merits of its contractual non-disparagement claim against Respondent Wynn-Williams, and that immediate and irreparable loss will result in the absence of emergency relief,\" the filing said.\n\nAdditionally, the arbitrator ruled that so much as Wynn-Williams can control, she is prohibited from further publishing or distributing the book and from further disparaging Meta and its officers or repeating previous disparaging remarks. The arbitrator also ruled that Wynn-Williams is to retract her previous disparaging remarks.\n\nThe company has previously dismissed Wynn-Williams' claims as \"out-of-date\" and said that she was fired for \"poor performance and toxic behavior.\"\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone shared the emergency arbitrator's ruling in a post on Threads, saying that it \"affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.\"\n\n\"This urgent legal action was made necessary by Williams, who more than eight years after being terminated by the company, deliberately concealed the existence of her book project and avoided the industry's standard fact-checking process in order to rush it to shelves after waiting for eight years,\" Stone said.\n\nMeta alleged that Wynn-Williams violated the non-disparagement terms of her September 2017 severance agreement, resulting in the company filing an emergency motion on Friday. The emergency arbitrator then conducted a telephone hearing involving legal representatives of Meta and Macmillan Books, but not Wynn-Williams who did not appear though she was given notice, the filing said.\n\nWATCH: What's driving Meta's stock run",

The world's biggest social media company has begun a small deployment of the chip and plans to ramp up production for wide-scale use if the test goes well, the sources said.\u201d\n\nWhich is a significant development considering that Meta currently has around 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips powering its AI projects, which each cost around $25k to buy off the shelf.\n\nThat\u2019s not what Meta would have paid, as it\u2019s ordering them in massive volumes. But even so, the company recently announced that it\u2019s boosting its AI infrastructure spend by the tune of around $65 billion in 2025, which will include various expansions of its data centers to accommodate new AI chip stacks.\n\nAnd the company may have also indicated the scope of how its own chips will increase its capacity, in a recent overview of its AI development is evolving.\n\n\u201cBy the end of 2024, we\u2019re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100s as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.\u201d\n\nSo, presumably, while Meta will have 350k H100 units, it\u2019s actually hoping to replicate the compute power of almost double that.\n\nCould that additional capacity be coming from its own chips?\n\nThe development of its own AI hardware could also lead to external opportunities for the company, with H100s in massive demand, and limited supply, amid the broader AI gold rush.\n\nMore recently, Nvidia has been able to reduce the wait times for H100 delivery, which suggests that the market is cooling off a little. But even without that external opportunity, the fact that Meta may be able to build out its own AI capacity with internally built chips could be a huge advantage for Zuck and Co. moving forward.\n\nBecause processing capacity has become a key differentiator, and may end up being the element that defines an ultimate winner in the AI race.\n\nFor comparison, while Meta has 350k H100s, OpenAI reportedly has around 200k, while xAI\u2019s \u201cColossus\u201d super center is currently running on 200k H100 chips as well.\n\nOther tech giants, meanwhile, are developing their own alternatives, with Google working on its \u201cTensor Processing Unit\u201d (TPU), while Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI all working on their own AI chip projects.\n\nThe next battleground, then, could the tariff wars, with the U.S. government implementing huge taxes on various imports in order to penalize foreign providers, and (theoretically) benefit local business.\n\nIf Meta\u2019s doing more of its production in the U.S., that could be another point of advantage, which may give it another boost over the competition.\n\nBut then again, as more recent models like DeepSeek have shown, it may not end up being the processing power that wins, but the ways that it\u2019s used that truly defines the market.\n\nThat\u2019s also speculative, as DeepSeek has benefited more from other AI projects than it initially seemed. But still, there could be more to it, but if compute power does end up being the critical factor, it\u2019s hard to see Meta losing out, depending on how well its chip project fares.",

Instead of struggling through your own at-home exercises, you can now track your data using wearables, ask ChatGPT to inform your workouts, or try AI-informed fitness machines for more personalized strength training. Among the more futuristic of these developments is the Meta Quest 3S ($299): a virtual reality (VR) headset specifically designed for fitness and wellness. But is the future of fitness truly accessible for everyone?\n\nHaving lost my right eye in May of 2024, the world looks a little differently now (literally): 3-D glasses have been rendered completely useless, my peripheral vision is limited, and my depth perception is laughable at best. A headset with the ability to transform your living room into a workout class certainly sounds intriguing, but I wasn't sure if it would actually work well for me. Still, I was willing to give it a try . . . and truthfully, my curiosity was at an all-time high.\n\n\"I feel like people think of [VR] as this out-of-reach, techy thing,\" says Leanne Pedante, head of fitness at Supernatural (Meta Quest's VR fitness and wellness app). \"But the reality is that so many of the people \u2014 our members \u2014 who use it, fall in love with it because it actually offers a lot more accessibility.\" Whether you want to do a workout seated, only use one arm, or avoid certain movements (like squats), you can easily make these modifications using the Supernatural app, she says (more on that later). With this in mind, I decided to try the Meta Quest 3S as a person with one eye \u2014 here's how it went.\n\nExperts Featured in This Article:\n\nLeanne Pedante is a coach and head of fitness at Meta Quest's VR fitness and wellness app, Supernatural.\n\n\n\nMy Meta Quest Experience\n\nPedante and I were both a curious to see how the Meta Quest 3S would work with partial blindness. \"I don't think it should actually get that much in the way, because \u2014 at least in the Supernatural experience \u2014 each of the lenses include a stereoscopic vision video, so you should be getting the full experience from one lens,\" she says before I try the headset on.\n\nWe decide to give the headset an initial try, and adjust the accessibility modifiers if needed. \"We have a variety of accessibility modifiers in the app, so if you find that peripheral vision things are not feeling good, we can also limit the peripheral vision,\" Pedante says. To my surprise, I was able to see the screen quite clearly without any major issues. This being my first-ever experience with a VR headset, it took me several moments to get over this excitement.\n\nSupernatural \u2014 Meta Quest's official app for VR fitness and wellness \u2014 comes with two workout modalities. The first is called \"flow,\" which involves moving to music and striking moving targets in the air, and the second is boxing. We started out with a slow flow class so I could get accustomed to the headset.",

Reuters reports that the company went one step further and designed (presumably with Broadcom's assistance) its in-house accelerator for AI training. If the chip meets Meta's goals, it may reduce its reliance on high-end Nvidia AI GPUs \u2014such as H100/H200 and B100/B200\u2014for training advanced large-language models.\n\nMeta and Broadcom have taped out Meta's first AI training accelerator with TSMC; the latter produced the first working samples of these chips, and the partners have successfully brought up the unit, according to the report. By now, Meta has started with a limited deployment of the accelerator, assessing its performance before scaling up production and deployment. It is unclear whether Meta's engineers are running benchmarks on the new chip; it has already been deployed to make some useful work.\n\nThe chip's specifications are unknown, though typically, AI training chips use a design known as a systolic array. This architecture consists of a structured network of identical processing elements (PEs) arranged in rows and columns. Each unit handles computations involving matrices or vectors, and data flows sequentially through the network.\n\nCustom RISC-V Accelerator For AI\n\nSince the processor is designed for AI training \u2014 which means processing vast amounts of data \u2014 expect the processor to feature HBM3 or HBM3E memory. Considering that we are dealing with a bespoke processor, Meta defined its supported data formats and instructions to optimize die size, power consumption, and performance. As for performance, the accelerator has to offer competitive performance-per-watt characteristics with Nvidia's up-to-date AI GPUs, such as H200, B200, and possibly next-generation B300.\n\nThe chip is the latest addition to Meta's Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program. The program has faced various setbacks, including when development was halted at similar stages.\n\nFor example, discontinued its internal inference processor after it failed to meet its performance and power targets during limited deployment tests. This failure led Meta to shift its strategy in 2022, placing large orders for Nvidia GPUs to meet its immediate AI processing requirements.\n\nMeta's Strive for AI Hardware Independence\n\nSince then, Meta has become one of Nvidia's largest customers, acquiring tens of thousands of GPUs. These units have been critical in training AI models for recommendations, advertisements, and the Llama Foundation model series. Also, the green company's GPUs have been employed for inference processes, supporting interactions for over three billion daily users across Meta's platforms, according to Reuters.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Last year, Meta began using an MTIA chip for inference tasks, and looking ahead, Meta's leadership has outlined plans to start using its custom chips for AI training by 2026. The plan is to gradually increase usage if the chip meets performance and power targets, which is a critical component of Meta's long-term goal to design more customized hardware solutions for its data center operations.\n\nOne interesting thing to note is that MTIA's accelerators for inference use open-source RISC-V cores. This enables Meta to customize instruction set architecture as it wishes to meet its requirements at its cadence, but on the other hand, it does not need to pay royalties to any third party. It is unclear whether MTIA's training accelerator is also based on the RISC-V ISA, but this is possible. If this is true, Meta might have developed one of the industry's highest-performing RISC-V-based chips.",

The move might signal a potential shift in user preference which could impact Meta Platforms. Additionally, Meta's 3.44% share price decline over the last quarter may reflect the broader market downturn amidst heightened tariff concerns affecting tech stocks. Despite a 5% dividend increase, anticipated revenue growth, and potential strategic acquisitions such as that of FuriosaAI, these positive signals were overshadowed by uncertainties in trade policies and legal challenges, such as ongoing lawsuits. Furthermore, rising economic apprehensions fueled by the new tariffs have added volatility to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which declined 0.3% as major indices trended downward. Meta's situation reflects these broader market dynamics, contributing to its stock performance in a turbulent quarter.\n\nDig deeper into the specifics of Meta Platforms here with our thorough analysis report.\n\nNasdaqGS:META Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe past five years have seen Meta Platforms deliver a total shareholder return of 311.12%, reflecting strong performance and growth. Key to this success was robust financial results, highlighted in January 2025, with annual sales reaching US$164.5 billion and net income at US$62.4 billion\u2014demonstrating impressive year-over-year growth. Significant earnings growth, particularly in the last year, outpaced industry norms, underpinning this return. A 5% increase in dividends announced in February further supported investor confidence.\n\nMeta's exploration of new avenues, such as the reported discussions in February 2025 to acquire South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI, positioned it for future innovation amidst industry challenges. Additionally, the partnership with Invenergy for over 1 GW of clean energy capacity highlighted Meta's commitment to sustainable growth. However, legal challenges and lawsuits, including those filed in January, represent ongoing hurdles. Meta's recent five-year performance comes as it outperformed both the US market and its industry over the last year.",

But Irwin, who formerly led X\u2019s trust and safety team and served as senior vice president of integrity at Stability AI, claimed that many tech players are reconsidering their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the last however many years, there have been more and more guardrails that have been put in place at many organizations\u2014almost an overcorrection,\u201d said Irwin. \u201cWhat you\u2019re starting to see is companies really evaluate how much of an impact those guardrails have had on the helpfulness and reliability of the products that they provide,\u201d she added.\n\nIn that vein, Meta is working on making the responses of its A.I. models more neutral and devoid of bias. A system that provides a litany of opinions in response to sensitive topics like immigration, for example, is \u201cnot what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d according to Irwin. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for facts, we\u2019re looking for information. We\u2019re not looking for opinions,\u201d she said.\n\nOther instances of biased outputs include models that respond to a question on a topic when it is framed positively or negatively and refuse to provide information on alternative viewpoints. \u201cNobody using our products really wants to feel like they\u2019re trying to steer you in one direction or another in terms of your opinion on matters,\u201d said Irwin.\n\nBut guardrails are still needed for explicit or illegal content like non-consensual nudity or child sexual abuse material are prohibited, she added.\n\nA company-wide shift\n\nEarlier this year, Meta cited freedom of expression and bias prevention as motivating factors behind its decision to end its fact-checking policy after nine years. In January, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company would scrap the program, which relied in part on third-party organizations, in favor of a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d crowdsourcing model\u2014reminiscent to the one used by X\u2014that counts on users to flag disinformation. Meta additionally unveiled plans to decrease censorship on platforms like Facebook and Instagram and cut many of its DEI programs.\n\nIrwin, who worked at X when Community Notes first launched but didn\u2019t work on the program, described herself as a \u201chuge supporter\u201d of the approach. \u201cIt helps with bias tremendously, because you\u2019ve just got a more diverse group of people evaluating and providing feedback,\u201d said Irwin, who left X in 2023 after clashing with Elon Musk on content moderation principles.\n\nMusk has long been a proponent of loosening the content moderation on social media. Grok, an A.I. chatbot developed by his xAI, is positioned an alternative to other \u201cwoke\u201d A.I. products. In February, his company took this strategy a step further by releasing a new voice mode for Grok with personalities like \u201cunhinged\u201d mode, which provides edgier responses.\n\nOther A.I. developers, too, are taking a closer look at testing potential bias in model outputs, said Irwin. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Meta,\u201d she noted, adding that \u201ceverybody\u2019s sort of moving in this direction.\u201d For example, last month OpenAI announced that its models will increasingly engage with controversial topics in part to avoid perceptions of promoting any one agenda.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the things that you see put in place as \u2018guardrails\u2019 can actually significantly impact freedom of expression,\u201d said Irwin. \u201cSo, striking that right balance is really hard.\u201d",

            "content": "Shares of Meta Platforms (META) fell Monday morning, joining a broad market sell-off triggered by President Donald Trump's comments on a possible recession and the emergence of another AI challenge from China, dubbed by one analyst \"another DeepSeek-like moment.\"\n\nThe slide is set to wipe out all gains from Meta stock's record-setting 20-day winning streak in January and February. Meta stock fell as major indexes were sharply lower Monday, after President Trump declined to rule out a recession. The recession fears pressuring the market in recent weeks have hit the Magnificent Seven \u2013 the large tech stocks that powered the S&P 500's rally the past two years \u2013 particularly hard.\n\nMeta also appeared to face a new challenge on the AI front with sudden attention to Manus, an AI assistant developed by a Chinese startup. The product could add to an AI assistant battleground that includes Meta AI, OpenAI's ChatGPT, xAI's Grok, DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Perplexity and more.\n\nWall Street analysts are sizing up what the growing competition means for the big AI investments from Meta and other tech giants.\n\n\"Another DeepSeek-like moment with Manus AI having released its autonomous agent on March 6 which incorporates reasoning and actionability unlike any other competitor we've seen so far,\" wrote RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson in a client note Monday. \"We'd expect a bevy of exploration reviews of Manus by developers this week \u2013 TBD (to be determined) on any infrastructure implications at this point.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock is down more than 4% at 598.74. Shares have not closed below 600 since Jan. 2.\n\nManus Adds To AI Assistant Battleground\n\nRBC's Erickson \u2014 whose stock coverage includes Meta, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 added that the \"breakneck pace of new, innovative AI applications continues to spur debate on what will ultimately be the determinants of winning in AI.\"\n\nDistribution, or the ability to draw on a large existing user base, will be a crucial factor, Erickson added.\n\nNew Street Research analyst Dan Salmon had a similar point in a client note Monday.\n\n\"Like other newly developed products from startups, Manus lacks established businesses with billions of users already to whom new AI products can be pushed by Google, Amazon and Meta,\" Salmon wrote. \"These companies will continue to hold this significant advantage for some time.\"\n\nMeta, for instance, can integrate Meta AI into its existing platforms that together have more than 3 billion active users, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Meta said last month that chatbot had 700 million active monthly users.\n\n\"To be sure, Manus' use case demos are impressive and worthy of today's attention, but there are still many details to learn, especially as the product remains in private beta,\" Salmon added. \"For example, what models is Manus utilizing \u2014 the company has said simply 'several distinct models' versus DeepSeek, which developed its own foundation models \u2014 and has the company developed any new cost-saving innovations for inference?\"\n\nMeta Stock Loses Winning-Streak Gains\n\nMeanwhile, Meta's slump has wiped out the big gains it posted during a record 20-day winning streak.\n\nMeta stock closed at 611.30 on Jan. 16 before it racked up gains every trading day through Feb. 14. Shares peaked with a Valentine's Day high of 740.91.\n\nBut Meta has closed lower in all but three of the 15 trading days since then. Shares are down more than 18% from Meta's February high.\n\nMeta stock broke below its 50-day moving average trendline on Thursday.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nDoorDash, TKO, Williams-Sonoma To Join S&P 500.

That decision makes it more likely the case will end in settlement or trial.\n\n\"[The plaintiffs'] allegations raise a 'reasonable, if not particularly strong, inference' that Meta removed CMI to try to prevent Llama from outputting CMI and thus revealing that it was trained on copyrighted material,\" Judge Chhabria wrote in his order [PDF]. \"This use of copyrighted material is clearly an identifiable (alleged) infringement.\"\n\nMeta has already admitted [PDF] it used a dataset named Books3 to train its Llama 1 large language model. The dataset has been found to include copyrighted works.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t all bad for Meta because Judge Chhabria tossed one of the plaintiffs' claims \u2013 that Meta's Llama use of unlicensed books obtained from peer-to-peer torrents violated California's Comprehensive Computer Data Access & Fraud Act (CDAFA).\n\nEdward Lee, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, told The Register we should not infer anything about fair use based on the author's DMCA 1202(b)(1) claim about the scrubbed CMI.\n\n\"At the hearing, Judge Chhabria also expressed some skepticism the plaintiffs would prove the DMCA [claim] and said it could be revisited on summary judgment,\" Lee said. \"What it does show is that the plaintiffs' attorneys were able to find a more particularized factual basis for their DMCA claim, which had been dismissed earlier in the case.\"\n\nBy allowing the CMI claim to advance, Chabria has delivered a second ruling that suggests the indiscriminate ingestion of copyrighted material to train AI models may have financial consequences.\n\nThe first came last month when Thomson Reuters won a partial summary judgment against shuttered AI firm Ross Intelligence that prevents the defendant firm from avoiding liability by claiming fair use.\n\nLegal scholars have argued that AI inference \u2013 apps that produce outputs based on AI models \u2013 is more likely to be deemed copyright infringement because it's obvious when a model spits out an author's work verbatim. Inputting copyrighted material into models for training has been viewed as more likely to qualify for fair use defenses.\n\nHowever, the Thomson Reuters decision and the survival of the DMCA claim against Meta look likely to strengthen plaintiffs in other AI-related litigation.\n\nFor example, Tremblay et al vs OpenAI et al was amended [PDF] last week. It seeks to revive its previously dismissed DMCA claim based on new but redacted evidence supporting allegations of CMI removal.\n\nCiting revelations that followed from discovery, the revised complaint argues, \"As amended, the DMCA claim sufficiently alleges that OpenAI actually removed CMI for training its large language models.\"\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment. \u00ae",

The report, obtained exclusively by The Washington Post, alleges Facebook considered giving China\u2019s ruling party the ability to censor content and squelch dissent. Also included in the report was Meta\u2019s willingness to share user data with China.\n\nThe complaint from Wynn-Williams reportedly alleged that Facebook, in 2015, created a censorship tool for China that would allow it to remove content or shut down the site during \u201csocial unrest.\u201d The complaint from Wynn-Williams, who was fired in 2017 from her job working on a team that worked on China policy, reportedly contains internal Meta documents.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Facebook also allegedly considered weakening privacy protections for Hong Kong users in an effort to appease China.\n\nSome of this information was already known. Facebook had to answer for its China-centric censorship tool after anonymous employees tipped the media about it in 2015. At the time, Meta \u2014 then Facebook \u2014 didn\u2019t deny that the tool existed but said it had never been used. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told investors at the time that \u201cwe\u2019re studying about the Chinese market, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Per the report, Facebook did eventually abandon its pursuit of breaking into China in 2019.\n\nThe news about sharing user data with China is new but shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. Meta has a history of playing fast and loose with user data , most notably in the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The company considering questionable tactics is also old news. Just last year, Facebook was caught secretly looking at user data in other apps like Snapchat, Amazon, and YouTube to better understand user behavior.\n\nThe good news is that sharing data with China is currently off the table. As The Washington Post notes, Zuckerberg seems to have turned his attention to replacing TikTok if the Chinese social media app fails to find a buyer and gets banned again next month. Per Trump, talks of TikTok\u2019s sale are still ongoing .",

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead\n\nMeta\u2019s plan to potentially spin Instagram Reels into a standalone video app has sparked excitement among creators and influencer marketers \u2014 but also concerns that the move could disrupt creators\u2019 brand partnerships on Instagram.\n\nThe notion that Meta is planning a Reels-spin off, reported by The Information last month, has created many questions for creators, including speculation over the potential decrease in Reels viewership, as well as concerns about whether Meta will allow creators to port over their Instagram followings to the new app, should the decision go through. A Meta representative did not respond to a request for comment prior to the publication of this story.\n\nAlthough Meta allowed Instagram users to bring their followers with them to Threads when it launched the microblogging platform in 2023, it\u2019s unclear whether the company would take a similar approach for Reels. Furthermore, creators and influencer marketers believe that forcing users to download a new video app could deter some of them from watching creators\u2019 videos. In the case of a spin-off, these factors could reduce the reach of influencers, some of whom have hundreds of thousands of followers, who use Reels as brand partnership inventory.\n\nReels continue to grow year-over-year, according to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the company\u2019s Jan. 29 Q4 2024 earnings call, although he did not share specific growth figures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a contract right now for a brand that\u2019s doing stuff across my YouTube, podcast and social channels,\u201d said journalist and creator Taylor Lorenz, referring to an influencer marketing agreement with the data privacy firm DeleteMe. \u201cWe would have to renegotiate, because Reels are part of that contract.\u201d Lorenz didn\u2019t say how much the contract was worth.\n\nThe wide reach of Instagram Reels is a key factor behind brands\u2019 interest in the format, meaning any reduction in viewership that came alongside a potential Reels spin-off would represent an opportunity for brands to renegotiate their agreements with creators, according to three influencer marketers who spoke to Digiday for this article.\n\n\u201cUltimately, brands are paying for people to see the content and if reach fails, everyone will need to get around the negotiating table to find a new way to access communities and audiences,\u201d said Tom Sweeney, global vp of influencer marketing for U.K. media agency Brainlabs, who said that he was personally skeptical that the rumored spin-off would ultimately take place.\n\nAlthough a Reels spin-off could risk burning creators by reducing their viewership metrics, this reduction would be damaging to Meta, too. If the company does separate Reels, influencer marketers believe Meta will take steps to ensure that the move hurts creators\u2019 viewership and follower counts as little as possible.\n\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s going to be renegotiations, changes to those agreements and things of that nature \u2014 but it\u2019s also counterintuitive, from a Meta perspective, if they were to pursue something like that,\u201d said Joe Gagliese, the co-CEO of influencer marketing agency and talent management firm Viral Nation. \u201cMeta doesn\u2019t want the creators to have to rebuild an audience on a new platform.\u201d\n\nThe details of how and why Instagram brand partnership contracts might need to be changed depend on how those contracts were drafted. If a contract requires content to be posted on Instagram, for example, a Reels spin-off could raise questions about whether posts on the new app would still qualify. Furthermore, if the agreement is tied to specific Instagram features, such as \u201cReels posts on Instagram,\u201d splitting off Reels could create potential compliance issues, per Jason Chung, the head of gaming, esports and media practice at the law firm Zuber Lawler LLP.\n\nHowever, Chung was quick to reassure creators. \u201cThese contracts often include flexibility, whether through amendment provisions or good-faith negotiation clauses,\u201d Chung said. \u201cMost brands and platforms have strong incentives to maintain positive relationships with influencers, so they may be willing to adjust expectations rather than enforce a strict interpretation that could harm both sides.\u201d\n\nDespite concerns over potential contract issues, many creators are in favor of Reels becoming a standalone short-form video app. Creator Morgan \u201cModelmorg\u201d Pope, for example, told Digiday that she has reduced her activity on Instagram, but that a return to the platform\u2019s photo-posting roots would encourage her to start posting more frequently. Although Instagram\u2019s total user base continues to grow year-over-year, the platform\u2019s user engagement dropped by 28 percent between 2023 and 2024, according to a report by the data platform Socialinsider.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that I know that have Instagram and they only post Reels,\u201d Pope said. \u201cEveryone is just trying to get the best out of social media by getting the most amount of views \u2014 that\u2019s all people really care about. People have lost the idea of the quality of Instagram, which is why I stopped being on Instagram.\u201d\n\nOther influencer marketers also feel positively about the potential change, noting that Reels typically drive more user activity than other types of Instagram content. With Donald Trump\u2019s extension of the U.S. TikTok ban slated to end on April 5, a dedicated Reels video app could be more inviting than a mixed-media photo and video app to TikTok creators looking for their new home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the majority of engagement happen on Reels,\u201d said Nicole Penn, the president and CEO of the marketing agency The EGC Group. \u201cSo, it could just be a way to segment it, focus it as its own app, and really perfect its algorithm to compete against TikTok.\u201d",

Due to its position as one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, it is constantly under a microscope.\n\nInterestingly, one part of the company\u2019s business adds massive amounts of value while another part drains it.\n\nGet Meta Platforms alerts: Sign Up\n\nReality Labs is Meta\u2019s long-term bet on the future of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), which lost $18 billion in 2024.\n\nBelow is a look at the long-term potential of Meta\u2019s Reality Labs segment. What type of impact could the ultimate success or failure of this segment have on Meta shares in the long term?\n\nUnderstanding Meta\u2019s Bold Reality Labs Strategy\n\nFirst off, it is important to understand why Meta is capable of losing so much money in its Reality Labs segment and why it is allowing this to happen. Meta\u2019s Family of Apps (FoA) segment is arguably the world\u2019s most impressive advertising business. It made around $87 billion in 2024 from this part of its business. Thus, Meta can support losing $18 billion on Reality Labs.\n\nThe bigger question is why Meta is willing to incur such significant losses. Ultimately, Meta views VR/AR as the future of human-technology interaction. However, with the technology still in its early stages, development remains costly, yet Meta isn't pricing its VR hardware to fully reflect these expenses. This is clearly demonstrated by the massive price difference between Meta\u2019s Quest 3 and Apple\u2019s NASDAQ: AAPL Vision Pro.\n\nMeta\u2019s cheapest Quest 3 costs $300, but the Apple Vision Pro costs $3,500. Apple is seemingly charging a price at which it can actually make a profit off these devices. Meanwhile, Meta is fine with losing money on these devices to position itself as the product of choice for customers.\n\nThe latest available data suggests it is succeeding at this, holding a nearly 71% market share among these devices in Q3 2024. Meta aims to secure market share early so that if VR and AR achieve mass adoption, it can generate significant revenue. Over time, scaling the business will allow the company to drive profitability in the segment.\n\nKey Challenges and Opportunities Facing Meta\u2019s Reality Labs\n\nStarting off with the negatives, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs segment has not grown impressively. Revenues in 2024 are down slightly from 2022. Meanwhile, losses have ballooned by $4 billion. Much of this is due to massive research and development spending for products that are possibly years down the road.\n\nMeta Platforms MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 86th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 21.8% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Weak Environmental Score N/A News Sentiment 1.08 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 13.15% See Full Analysis\n\nAside from its hardware, arguably a just as important area of focus for Meta should be its VR/AR application ecosystem. If there aren\u2019t interesting applications for VR/AR users, there is no point in buying the device. Many have made millions in revenue from developing apps.\n\nHowever, many VR app developers have recently laid off workers. This is happening because the Quest Store is moving away from premium games. Now, free-to-play games are becoming the preferred business model. Overall, Meta says the total payment volume in its VR ecosystem will grow by 12% in 2024.\n\nMoving more toward the positive angle is the potential size of the metaverse. This includes devices, content, creation tools, and more. Meta participates in all these areas and can benefit from them. Two estimates put the size of this potential market between $490 billion and $900 billion by 2030, or $695 billion when taking the average.\n\nOverall, if Meta captured 23% of this market, its Reality Labs revenue in 2030 could be equal to the size of its FoA business in 2024. This doesn\u2019t seem completely unreasonable, given the company\u2019s strong leadership so far. However, what Reality Labs' profitability would look like at that point is very hard to say.\n\nReality Labs Could Make or Break Meta\u2019s Long-Term Growth\n\nOverall, in a best-case scenario, the investment in Reality Labs could be highly accretive to Meta shares. However, it will likely take several years or more for this to happen if it ever does. If the experiment fails, it will likely have a significantly negative impact on shares.\n\nThis may take a long period of time to realize, as markets continually see unimpressive results. Or, investor sentiment could suddenly become deeply pessimistic about Reality Labs, which might hit shares hard in a short period. This area should be a key focus for Meta investors. They should track how the potential for success of the company's massive bet develops over time.\n\nBefore you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The URL of the Amazon listing of the book, for example, is simply \u201cUntitled-Flatiron-Author-Revealed-March.\u201d\n\nDetails on the book\u2019s contents are slowly emerging, with Wynn-Williams alleging sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. She also discusses Facebook\u2019s response to violence against Rohingya people in Myanmar, which was stoked by hateful speech on the platform, as well as its efforts to operate in China. The publisher\u2019s notes detail a \u201crotten company culture\u201d and \u201cshocking accounts of misogyny and double standards.\u201d According to the Instagram post from Flatiron Books announcing the book, \u201cCareless People reveals the truth about the executives Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan as callously indifferent to the price others would pay for their own enrichment.\u201d\n\nWynn-Williams is a diplomat, policy expert, and international lawyer, with previous roles including serving as the Chief Negotiator for the United Nations on biosafety liability, according to her bio on the World Economic Forum.\n\nPrior to publishing her memoir, Wynn-Williams filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC, according to The Washington Post. The complaint alleges that Facebook was willing to censor content and bend privacy rules to accommodate China.

Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment. Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work.

The authors were able to show that these AI models were capable of reproducing their work in highly accurate form, which they claim demonstrates that both Meta and OpenAI used their legally protected material without consent. The lawsuit also alleges that both Meta and OpenAI removed the copyright information from their books to hide this infringement.\n\nMeta has since sought to have the case thrown out on various legal grounds, while it\u2019s also sought to keep Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg from having to personally front the trial, in order to answer for his part in the process.\n\nThat stems from uncovered internal exchanges from Meta which appear to indicate that Zuckerberg himself approved the use of \u201clikely pirated\u201d material, as part of a broader push get his team to build better AI models to combat the rise of OpenAI.\n\nIt seems now that more information about Meta\u2019s processes in this case will be revealed, with the trial set to proceed, as approved by a federal judge.\n\nAs reported by TechCrunch:\n\n\u201cIn Friday\u2019s ruling, [Judge] Chhabria wrote that the allegation of copyright infringement is \u201cobviously a concrete injury sufficient for standing\u201d and that the authors have also \u201cadequately alleged that Meta intentionally removed CMI [copyright management information] to conceal copyright infringement.\u201d\n\nAs such, the case will be allowed to progress, with Zuckerberg in attendance, though the judge did dismiss the authors\u2019 claims relating to violations of the California fraud act, as he found no precedent for this element.\n\nThe case could end up being an embarrassing forced disclosure for the company, with Meta essentially required to answer for how it accessed key elements of the data set that powers its Llama AI models. That could also lead to further lawsuits for violation of copyright, and could end up costing the company billions in penalties as a result.\n\nAt the same time, the case may also set a new precedent for AI-related copyright penalties moving forward, by establishing a clear link between illegal data access as it relates to online repositories.\n\nThough that element is likely already fairly solid in legal terms, with Meta apparently knowingly violating existing copyright law by approving the use of pirated material.\n\nIn any event, it could end up being a defining legal case in the broader AI shift, pitting high-profile artists against the tech giant.\n\nThe case is set to proceed shortly.",

I sat down with him this week to learn more about his latest exclusive and what it all means for Meta's future.\n\nQ: What's the reaction been to your coverage of Meta's \"block\" lists?\n\nA: We've had a wave of outreach since publishing. More former employees, both from Meta and other tech companies, have come forward to share similar experiences of being blocked from rehire. Their initial accounts suggest that this practice may be more widespread than initially thought. The story really took off when Laszlo Bock, Google's first HR head, shared it on LinkedIn. That sparked a robust debate.\n\nQ: What's the most important thing you learned from your reporting?\n\nA: I was struck by the remarkable lack of transparency in corporate hiring practices.

            "content": "Meta was willing to go to extreme lengths to censor content and shut down political dissent in a failed attempt to win the approval of the Chinese Communist Party and bring Facebook to millions of internet users in China, according to a new whistleblower complaint from a former global policy director at the company.\n\nThe complaint by Sarah Wynn-Williams, who worked on a team handling China policy, alleges that the social media giant so desperately wanted to enter the lucrative China market that it was willing to allow the ruling party to oversee all social media content appearing in the country and quash dissenting opinions.\n\nMeta, then called Facebook, developed a censorship system for China in 2015 and planned to install a \u201cchief editor\u201d who would decide what content to remove and could shut down the entire site during times of \u201csocial unrest,\u201d according to a copy of the 78-page complaint exclusively seen by The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the United States following pressure from a high-ranking Chinese official the company hoped would help them enter China, according to the complaint, which was filed in April to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen asked about its efforts to enter China, Meta executives repeatedly \u201cstonewalled and provided nonresponsive or misleading information\u201d to investors and American regulators, according to the complaint.\n\nWynn-Williams bolstered her SEC complaint with internal Meta documents about the company\u2019s plans, which were reviewed by The Post. Wynn-Williams, who was fired from her job in 2017, is also scheduled to release a memoir this week documenting her time at the company, titled \u201cCareless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.\u201d\n\nAccording to a memo in the complaint, Meta leaders faced aggressive pressure by Chinese government officials to host Chinese users\u2019 data to local data centers, which Wynn-Williams alleges would have made it easier for the Chinese Communist Party to covertly obtain the personal information of its citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn countries with authoritarian leanings like China, stringent government controls over data flows are twisted into tools of censorship, surveillance, and repression,\u201d Katitza Rodriguez, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s policy director for global privacy, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOnce data is stored locally, companies are pressured to comply with Beijing\u2019s demands or risk losing access to Chinese consumers.\u201d\n\nFor years, Meta has cast China as a foe to a free global internet. In a 2019 Georgetown University talk, Zuckerberg warned that China was \u201cexporting their vision of the internet to other countries.\u201d The next year, then-vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg bemoaned in a Post op-ed that governments were following China\u2019s lead to wall off the internet \u201cfrom the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta has also funded a nonprofit, American Edge, that has run campaigns criticizing China and TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app.\n\nThe company\u2019s anti-China commentary has intensified since DeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant catapulted to the top of app stores in January, with the China-based company boasting that its AI technology was developed at a fraction of the cost of competitors from Meta and OpenAI.\n\nIn a Threads post, Meta\u2019s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, wrote that the company would work with \u201cthe Administration to keep the US at the cutting edge of AI and make sure the global AI standard is based on our shared values, not China\u2019s.\u201d Zuckerberg noted in January that the company would partner with President Donald Trump to \u201cpush back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,\u201d adding that \u201cChina has censored our apps from even working in the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the top priorities for President Trump is the West winning this critical [AI] race and yet for many years Meta has been working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, briefing them on the latest technological developments and lying about it,\u201d said Wynn-Williams, who is now a technology policy consultant. \u201cPeople deserve to know the truth.\u201d\n\nMeta spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement that it was \u201cno secret\u201d the company was interested in operating in China.\n\n\u201cThis was widely reported beginning a decade ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we\u2019d explored, which Mark Zuckerberg announced in 2019.\u201d\n\n\u2018Project Aldrin\u2019\n\nA decade ago, Meta saw China as an unconquered and highly lucrative opportunity, with millions of untapped internet users \u2014 more than existed in the American market, by some estimates. Chinese sellers were already buying scores of ads on Facebook through resellers to target customers outside the country, according to Wynn-Williams. Zuckerberg told top executives including COO Sheryl Sandberg and then-communications and public policy head Elliot Schrage that bringing Facebook to China would fulfill the company\u2019s mission of connecting the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we want to have more of our services available in China in 3 years, I think we need to start intensively working on this now,\u201d he wrote in a 2014 email contained in the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nZuckerberg had publicly demonstrated his interest in the country. The CEO wrote a blurb for CCP Secretary Xi Jinping\u2019s book, \u201cThe Governance of China,\u201d and displayed a copy on his desk when China\u2019s then-deputy head of the propaganda department of the ruling party, Lu Wei, visited him. Zuckerberg also gave a 20-minute speech in Mandarin to university students and asked Xi, by then the leader, to give his unborn baby daughter an honorary Chinese name, according to a New York Times report.\n\nThe complaint alleges that behind the scenes, Zuckerberg assembled a \u201cChina team\u201d in 2014 to develop a version of its services that could be legally offered in China \u2014 a project code-named \u201cProject Aldrin\u201d after the astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta was eager to demonstrate its willingness to cater to the demands of the Chinese Communist Party. In July 2014, Meta employees prepared a draft letter for Zuckerberg to send to Lu, saying the company had already worked with the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to \u201ctake down terrorist sites that are potentially dangerous for China\u201d and offering \u201cto work more closely with all your embassies or Consulates around the world,\u201d according to an email contained in the complaint. A spokesperson for the consulate said in a statement that it was \u201cnot aware of the situation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo strengthen their negotiating power, Meta leaders also considered bending their long-standing privacy rules for the benefit of the Chinese government. In August 2014, members of Meta\u2019s privacy team discussed whether to confirm to the Irish data protection commissioner that Hong Kong users would still be afforded the same privacy protections as users in the United States and the European Union, according to the documents. Days after meeting with Meta\u2019s China negotiating team, the privacy team was willing to weaken Hong Kong users\u2019 rights, according to an email exchange contained in the complaint.\n\n\u201cIn exchange for the ability to establish operations in China, FB will agree to grant the Chinese government access to Chinese users\u2019 data \u2014 including Hongkongese users\u2019 data,\u201d one privacy policy staffer wrote.\n\nBy 2015, Meta and Chinese officials started negotiating a more detailed plan for the company to operate in China later that year, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder one iteration of the proposed agreement, Hony Capital, a Chinese private-equity firm, would be responsible for reviewing and deciding whether content posted by China-based users, including foreigners traveling to the country, was \u201cconsistent with applicable law,\u201d according to a copy of the proposal sent to Lu.\n\nTo aid the effort, Meta built a censorship system specially designed for China to review, including the ability to automatically detect restricted terms and popular content on Facebook, according to the complaint. The company agreed to hire at least 300 content moderators to support the system, the documents show.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFollowing a review of the system with the Cyberspace Administration of China, government officials expressed concern that the U.S. government would be able to access Chinese users\u2019 data stored outside the country, the documents show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2015, Lu was removed from his post and was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison over bribery charges.\n\nDespite losing one of its chief regulatory promoters in the country, Meta continued to pursue the China market. In 2017, Meta covertly launched a handful of social apps under the name of a China-based company created by one of its employees, according to the complaint.\n\nThat same year, Meta restricted the account of Guo Wengui, a wealthy Chinese businessman and critic of the Chinese government, after Zhao Zeliang, a top internet regulator in the country, suggested taking action could demonstrate the company\u2019s willingness to \u201caddress mutual interests,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\n\u201cIf there is nothing we can do [about Guo\u2019s account], there will be an impact on our cooperation,\u201d Meta officials concluded according to internal notes about a meeting contained in the complaint. Later that year, Meta took down a page affiliated with Guo and restricted his account, citing violations of its content rules.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBy 2019, Meta had abandoned its China ambitions just as the Trump administration was waging a fierce battle against China over trade.\n\nNow, Meta aims to benefit from Washington\u2019s aggressive stance on China. Zuckerberg told employees during a companywide meeting this year that its business would be helped if China-based TikTok ends up being banned in the United States.",

            "content": "Meta and Ray-Ban have partnered with Coperni, the French label known for its tech-centric runway presentations, to persuade the fashion crowd that smartglasses are the next hot accessory.\n\nCoperni will debut its take on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses on Sunday at its Paris Fashion Week show, which references the 1990s-era LAN \u2014 or local area network \u2014 parties where gamers would gather to physically link up their computers and play video games. The brand reworked Ray-Ban\u2019s classic Wayfarer with grey mirrored lenses and a semi-transparent black frame to show off the internal hardware from Meta.\n\nThe glasses will go on sale Monday for $549, or a bit more than the roughly $330 that a typical pair of Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers costs, and only 3,600 pairs will be available. Creative director S\u00e9bastien Meyer called the design \u201ca bit nostalgic,\u201d saying it reminded him of Apple\u2019s old translucent iMacs.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do something crazy,\u201d added Coperni chief executive Arnaud Vaillant. \u201cThere is something also very important at Coperni, even if we do crazy fashion shows and everything, there is always this idea of wearability.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWearability has been key to the surprising success of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses since the launch of their second generation in September 2023. Unlike other previous smartglasses, the Ray-Ban Meta maintains the look of traditional Ray-Ban styles while integrating functionalities like taking calls, listening to music and capturing images and video. Meta has also been rolling out AI capabilities, such as the ability to answer questions about what the wearer is looking at.\n\nFrancesco Milleri, CEO of Ray-Ban\u2019s parent company, EssilorLuxottica, said during the company\u2019s February earnings call that they\u2019ve already sold 2 million pairs and manufacturing capacity is currently ramping up to 10 million units annually by the end of 2026. In a recent research note, RBC Capital estimated that the glasses could ultimately scale far beyond that and contribute more than 4 percent revenue growth per year for the next decade.\n\nTo reach those heights, however, Meta and Ray-Ban need to attract more customers, which they\u2019ve done through marketing like their Super Bowl ads but also the Coperni tie up, which marks the first fashion collaboration for the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\n\nCoperni's take on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer. (EssilorLuxottica)\n\n\u201cObviously our product needs to be mainstream, but I think we can do things that are also very custom to a specific market,\u201d said Rocco Basilico, chief wearables officer at EssilorLuxottica. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s always important to keep fashion \u2014 high fashion even \u2014 in mind when we do this type of project, because there is like a trickling down to all the consumers.\u201d\n\nIt was Ray-Ban and Meta that first proposed the collaboration to Coperni. Eva Chen, vice president of fashion at Meta, said the company had been in touch with the brand for years, though they hadn\u2019t worked together directly before. Coperni\u2019s Vaillant noted that the brand had even been contacted about doing something with the Ray-Ban Stories, the first generation of smartglasses from Ray-Ban and Meta, but while he thought it was a good idea, it wasn\u2019t yet a great device. He\u2019s a fan of the newest Ray-Ban Meta glasses, however, and as a lifelong wearer of Wayfarers, this time it felt right for Coperni.\n\nBasilico said there\u2019s more to come from Ray-Ban and Meta. They\u2019re exploring smartglasses in more new styles, as well as from other EssilorLuxottica brands beyond Ray-Ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Meta was looking at Oakley-branded glasses, for example, though Basilico wouldn\u2019t confirm anything. They\u2019re also thinking about how to incorporate the augmented-reality display Meta has been working on, but Basilico added it will be important to maintain the design of the glasses.\n\n\u201cA multi-brand approach, for the wearable category, will be really the future,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "A federal judge is allowing an AI-related copyright lawsuit against Meta to move forward, although he dismissed part of the suit.\n\nIn Kadrey vs. Meta, authors \u2014 including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 have alleged that Meta has violated their intellectual property rights by using their books to train its Llama AI models and that the company removed the copyright information from their books to hide the alleged infringement.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, has claimed that its training qualifies as fair use, and it argued the case should be dismissed because the authors lack standing to sue. In court last month, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria seemed to indicate he was against dismissal, but he also criticized what he saw as \u201cover-the-top\u201d rhetoric from the authors\u2019 legal teams.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s ruling, Chhabria wrote that the allegation of copyright infringement is \u201cobviously a concrete injury sufficient for standing\u201d and that the authors have also \u201cadequately alleged that Meta intentionally removed CMI [copyright management information] to conceal copyright infringement.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaken together, these allegations raise a \u2018reasonable, if not particularly strong inference\u2019 that Meta removed CMI to try to prevent Llama from outputting CMI and thus revealing it was trained on copyrighted material,\u201d Chhabria wrote.\n\nThe judge did, however, dismiss the authors\u2019 claims related to the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA), because they did not \u201callege that Meta accessed their computers or servers \u2014 only their data (in the form of their books).\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit has already provided a few glimpses into how Meta approaches copyright, with court filings from the plaintiffs claiming that Mark Zuckerberg gave the Llama team permission to train the models using copyrighted works and that other Meta team members discussed the use of legally questionable content for AI training.\n\nThe courts are weighing a number of AI copyright lawsuits at the moment, including The New York Times\u2019 lawsuit against OpenAI.",

            "content": "BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana Illuminator) - Environmental and consumer protection advocates are calling for transparency into how Meta will power a massive new data center in Northeast Louisiana.\n\nThe groups want to require Meta, the parent company of Facebook, and its data center developer, Laidley LLC, be listed as parties on Entergy\u2019s application to the Louisiana Public Service Commission to build three natural gas power plants. They will provide electricity for the data center planned for rural Richland Parish.\n\nListing Meta and Laidley as parties on the application would require them to disclose information such as anticipated energy demand from the data center and the number of local jobs it would create.\n\n\u201cIf Meta and its subsidiary are demanding an unprecedented scale of investment, we are asking for straightforward engagement and accountability,\u201d Logan Burke, executive director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said in a press release.\n\nThe Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a joint motion Wednesday with the Public Service that argues for the requirements. Entergy has placed the cost of the new power facilities at $3 billion, an expense consumer advocates fear will be passed along to ratepayers.\n\n\u201cWithout Meta being actually in the process, there\u2019s a bunch of information that we can\u2019t analyze,\u201d Burke said in an interview with the Illuminator.\n\n\u201cLouisiana residents have extraordinarily high bills already \u2026 Are the decisions that Entergy is asking the commission to make, are the approvals for this large amount of new power, high costs of investment, will that put undue burden on residential customers?\u201d\n\nEntergy Louisiana, the subsidiary pursuing the new power plants, has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nThis is the second motion the organizations have filed regarding Entergy\u2019s PSC application. Their first seeks to deny the utility company\u2019s expedited request to build the new natural gas plants on grounds that Entergy hasn\u2019t shown that the plants are cost effective and serve the public interest. An administrative judge has yet to rule on that motion.\n\nEntergy looks to receive expedited permitting on the grounds that powering the data center benefits the public by creating more jobs and prompts investments by Meta into sustainable energy and carbon capture projects in Louisiana. The groups say Entergy\u2019s expedited application should be rejected, with any other application subject to the standard process.\n\nA utility must usually present all types of energy sources that could be used for generation when it seeks approval from the Public Service Commission to build a power plant. Exceptions to the rule exist for situations such as emergency power needs, but Entergy wants these requirements waived because it believes the Meta project provides a greater public good.\n\nEntergy\u2019s application also argues that an expedited permit is essential to meeting Meta\u2019s timeline for the proposed project. State economic development officials have said construction on the data center would continue through 2030, but a start date for operations has not been announced. Meta has said it will eventually hire 500 people to work at the facility.\n\nPaul Arbaje, an analyst for the Climate and Energy program at UCS, said in a news release that the Public Service Commission\u2019s normal process for this kind of permit \u201cis likely to bring cleaner, less expensive proposals for meeting the data center\u2019s energy needs.\u201d\n\nThe second motion argues Entergy\u2019s justification for a fast-tracked application \u201crelies upon a variety of \u2018commitments\u2019 from the Customer [Meta] to support its Application,\u201d but lacks specific enough information to justify an exception to the regular permitting rules.\n\nListing Meta and Laidley in the application would also open doors for legal action on behalf of ratepayers. The motion demands that Entergy\u2019s application be dismissed if Meta and Laidley are not listed as parties.\n\nAn administrative law judge has scheduled a hearing for March 25 on whether to add Meta and Laidley to Entergy\u2019s application.\n\nLouisiana Illuminator is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

            "content": "Are Meta Ray-Bans the next iPhone \u2014 or the next Google Glass? Meta Platforms has sold more than 2 million of their smart glasses \u2014 a collaboration with Franco-Italian eye-wear company EssilorLuxottica \u2014 since hitting the market in late 2023. Sales of the product, which users can ask questions about the world in front of them, are accelerating, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during his post-earnings call on Jan. 29. \"Our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are a real hit,\" he added. \"We still don't know what the long-term trajectory for this is going to be. And I think we're going to learn a lot this year.\" Meta is no stranger to wearables. It purchased virtual reality goggles company Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion and folded the renamed Quest headsets into its money-losing Reality Labs division. The collaboration with Ray-Ban, however, is Meta's first stab at bringing a connected experience to regular glasses that people might actually wear in their everyday lives. The glasses cost between $299 and $379 each depending on prescriptions or customizations. Meta is also working on Oakley-branded smart glasses, according to Bloomberg . Meta did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Of course, smart glasses have been tried before \u2014 without much success. Alphabet failed miserably shortly after Google Glass was launched in 2014. Snap , the parent company behind Snapchat, introduced the first iteration of its Spectacles in 2016. While in their fifth generation, the Spectacles haven't caught on. To be sure, the Ray-Ban smart glasses are still far from mass adoption. Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, said at a Morgan Stanley conference this week that Ray-Bans are \"still in the zone of just getting to like, making sure this is available everywhere and everybody who wants it can get it \u2026 you're starting to see a lot of love for the product.\" The financial impact, at this point, is likely minimal, too. For Meta, even a hit hardware product is just a whimper compared to its massive social media ad business. Company revenue totaled $160.6 billion last year and is projected to grow to more than $183 billion in 2025, according to FactSet. It's hard to say for sure how much Meta makes on each pair of the glasses and how much goes to partner EssilorLuxottica, but even some optimistic back-of-the-envelope math shows how minuscule the impact on its financials has been so far. For this exercise, let's use the rough starting price of $300 a pair. If Meta collected all $300 of revenue on 2 million pairs, the result is $600 million since the fall of 2023. Last year alone, Meta's ad business on average generated an incredible $439 million in revenue per day. Still, the demand for smart glasses is growing, and that counts for something. Market research firm Counterpoint reports that worldwide smart glasses shipments surged 210% year over year in 2024, up from 156% in 2023, driven largely by demand for the Meta Ray-Bans. Their success has attracted new competition with major global tech players, including Xiaomi, Samsung, Baidu and ByteDance, preparing to enter the space. Counterpoint predicts the market will grow another 60% in 2025 and have a sustained compound annual growth rate of over 60% through 2029 as new use cases, pricing segments and competitors emerge. Zuckerberg said he believes the Meta Ray-Bans, which allows users to talk to the glasses and ask questions about the real world around them, has staying power. The company ramped up marketing for the Super Bowl, with two 30-second ads that featured A-list actors Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth, and reality star Kris Jenner. Thirty-second spots in the big game went for as much as $8 million each \u2014 not to mention the production costs for the actual commercials. Meta's last Super Bowl ad was in 2022 when it was touting its Quest 2 headset. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg said 2025 will be a \"defining year\" when it comes to AI glasses as a category, citing that \"many breakout products in the history of consumer electronics have sold 5 million to 10 million units in their third generation.\" Meta and EssilorLuxottica started collaborating in 2019 and have released two generations of Ray-Ban smart glasses since then. In 2024, the companies extended their partnership into a long-term agreement under which they'll develop multi-generational smart eyewear products over the next decade. EssilorLuxottica plans to make 10 million units annually by 2026. Zuckerberg said that smart glasses have the potential to become a \"very important computing platform in the future,\" much as the smartphone did a generation ago. He called glasses the \"ideal form factor for an AI device because you can let an AI assistant on your glasses see what you see and hear what you hear, which gives it the context to be able to understand everything that's going on in your life that you would want to talk to it about and get context on.\" Meta's Cox noted that retention, a measure of a product's usefulness, is high for the smart glasses. \"We see with Ray-Bans, really healthy retention not just for the glasses themselves, but for the use cases, like making phone calls,\" Cox added that another popular use is listening to music. It's still too early to tell if glasses can be the next smartphone \u2014 or even the next smartwatch. Andrew Boone, an analyst at JMP Securities, said that \"monetization potential is still years away\" because the technology is still developing and its utility isn't fully yet realized. However, Boone said the glasses \"create optional pathways for AI distribution,\" positioning them as both a consumer product and a long-term platform for deploying AI services that could eventually be monetized. \"Meta is a data factory \u2013 they take in data and then figure out how to monetize it,\" Boone explained, adding, Meta is following a similar playbook: building engagement first, then introducing ads, just as it did with Facebook and Threads. Brad Erickson, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, sees Meta's smart glasses as part of the company's broader strategy to expand its role beyond social media. \"Meta wants to provide you and I with more utility during our day versus just being a social media platform,\" he said, which ultimately allows the company to \"serve us more ads and drive more revenue.\" Erickson also said Meta's smart glasses are a way for the company to reduce its independence on Apple's dominant iOS ecosystem through its own hardware-software integration. \" Apple is the primary distribution point for all of this\" due to its control over iOS and the App Store, he points out, but smart glasses give Meta an opportunity to have more control over their customers. Still, he remains skeptical about whether Meta can achieve \"critical mass distribution that would be disruptive to Apple.\" Meta is not content to stand still. Last week, the company revealed the latest version of its experimental smart glasses intended to help bolster research into AI, robotics, and machine perception. Called Aria Gen 2 , they are a step forward in Zuckerberg's vision of what the next major computing platform could be following the smartphone. At the company's September product and developer conference, Zuckerberg showcased an augmented reality glasses prototype dubbed Orion. As we wrote at the time, the shades represented a convergence of the company's Quest headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long META, AAPL.

META is said to be maintaining a clandestine \u2018do not rehire\u2019 list of its former employees, who are barred from rejoining the company, irrespective of a vice president\u2019s endorsement.\n\nWhat Happened: A recent report has revealed that a former engineer at Meta found themselves deemed \"ineligible for rehire\" after submitting nearly 20 applications. The engineer was among the 10,000 employees who lost their jobs during the company's 2022 downsizing.\n\nThe engineer had been associated with the company for more than four years and had consistently exceeded expectations in performance ratings.\n\nThey had also been promoted to a senior technical position the previous year. However, after applying for multiple positions, they noticed a worrying trend. Initial conversations with hiring managers would suddenly cease once the recruitment screening phase was reached, reports the Insider.\n\nFive ex-employees, including two managers, confirmed to Business Insider that Meta maintains internal lists that bar certain former employees from being rehired. Employment experts suggest that while such lists are not illegal, they are not common practice. Even high-performing employees can find themselves on these lists without a clear reason.\n\nAlso Read: Mark Zuckerberg Flaunts Watches Valued at a Cybertruck\u2019s Price\n\nMeta reportedly uses several tracking systems to enforce these restrictions, including a \"non-regrettable attrition\" designation and a \"do not rehire\" flag.\n\nThe company asserts that these designations are applied fairly, and rehire eligibility is determined at the time of departure, based on factors such as policy violations and performance metrics.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google HR chief Laszlo Bock has shared his thoughts about Meta\u2019s internal \u201cblock\u201d lists, which can prevent certain former employees from being rehired.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this. I\u2019ve sometimes heard an exec say, \u2018don\u2019t ever re-hire this person\u2019, but never seen a large scale, systematic approach like this. Have folks seen this elsewhere?\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters: This revelation could potentially raise questions about Meta\u2019s hiring practices and treatment of its employees. The alleged \u2018do not rehire\u2019 list, if proven true, could impact the company\u2019s reputation and its ability to attract and retain talent.\n\nIt also raises concerns about the transparency of the company\u2019s policies towards its employees. The impact of this development on Meta\u2019s stock performance remains to be seen.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBig Tech's Security Spending Spree: Zuckerberg Leads In Lavish Security Measures",

            "content": "Over the last three days, Meta has published three in-depth explainers about how its upcoming Meta Orion glasses work, focused on its custom silicon chips, holographic waveguides, and wireless compute puck. It's a refreshing change of pace to see Meta let its engineers be so geekily passionate about their work.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs team leaked a lot of information about future Quest headsets and AR glasses until Meta started issuing anti-leak warnings to staff and firing accused leakers.\n\nThe tech world has always been hyper-fixated on secrecy while despising whistleblowers, leaving its biggest fans dependent on unreliable leaks and fake rumors as they wait for new products. By the time a product launches, the waters are muddied by leaks with incomplete or exaggerated information, making a device look worse before the engineers are allowed to explain the context.\n\nSo that's what makes Meta's current approach with Meta Orion so refreshing. Yes, this is a public proof-of-concept of Reality Labs' work rather than a marketable product, but by eking out information about these glasses now instead of waiting until 2027, it helps inform the public on the challenges of AR glasses engineering and why they're spending billions on research to address them.\n\nWhether you're an old \"Glasshole,\" a Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses owner waiting for an upgrade, or a Quest fan curious about AI glasses in general, I highly recommend you read Meta's three blog posts for yourself. But I'll summarize the highlights below.\n\nMaking custom chips was like 'building the ship as it sails out of the harbor'\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Meta) (Image credit: Meta) (Image credit: Meta)\n\nIn Meta's blog post, titled How Our Custom Silicon & Chips Are Revolutionizing AR, Meta explains why its AR glasses are \"completely dependent\" upon custom silicon instead of mobile-style chipsets.\n\n\"The glasses form factor can only dissipate so much heat, and it can only accommodate so much battery capacity,\" the post explains. So \"if you hold constant the thermal and battery capacities, the only way to deliver a given experience is to optimize the silicon.\"\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nDirector of SoC Solutions Robert Shearer explains that they had to \"reduce power consumption by a factor of 100\" before Meta Orion glasses would work.\n\nSome of that came down to the wireless puck, but even that required \"custom compression protocols to reduce bandwidth and power consumption as data moved from the compute puck to the display, says Director of Product Management Neeraj Choubey. He also described how they used machine learning to reduce the power needed for on-glasses eye and hand tracking.\n\nThe post proceeds to explain how this team also designed the custom silicon in the Orion microLED displays. Display Architecture Technical Director Mike Yee explains how they had to reduce the gap between pixel centers from \"tens of microns\" on phones to \"the single digits,\" which would only work on silicon.\n\nThen, they needed to develop a \"custom power management chip\" that fit in the \"tiny corner\" of Orion's displays to power the holographic content.\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the blog post, which is mostly a platform for this team to brag about how they're \"breaking free from traditional mental models\" to make custom silicon. But considering the years of reports about Meta laying off this team or relying on MediaTek for its silicon, I'd say they deserve some time in the spotlight.\n\nSilicon-carbide took holographic lenses from a 'disco' to a 'symphony'\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nThe post on Our Silicon Carbide Waveguides & the Path to Orion\u2019s Large FoV explains how Meta took advantage of a surplus of silicon-carbide material made for EV cars to make it a \"viable option for AR glasses\" because of its \"high refractive index.\"\n\nOptical Scientist Pasqual Rivera says traditional glass lenses make AR glasses an unsightly rainbow \"disco.\" Silicon carbide was initially so \"nitrogen-doped\" that it was too dark to ever be used for glasses, but Meta's team realized that it's a \"total game changer\" with incredible clarity when it's not optimized for cars.\n\nAR Waveguides Tech Lead Giuseppe Calafiore explained how they had to stack multiple glass plates to hit a refractive index of 1.8, making glasses \"prohibitively large and ugly.\" So they tried different materials and eventually settled on silicon carbide, which can hit a 2.7 index with a single plate for better \"etendue,\" aka 50% better light spread for a wider field of view (FoV).\n\nThe post explains that wider FoV on AR glasses can cause \"ghost images and rainbows\" but that silicon carbide has properties to reduce them, as well as better thermal conductivity.\n\nThat said, the problem is undoubtedly price. Meta's post concludes with Director of Research Science Barry Silverstein saying, \"We\u2019re seeing signs that it\u2019s possible to significantly reduce the cost,\" but that implies that for now, AR glasses either have to settle for worse materials or cost an arm and a leg for a functional display.\n\nLetting XR nerds behind the scenes is the right call\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nThe third blog post about Orion's computing puck explains why Meta quickly abandoned the idea of using a phone to power its glasses because \"demanding performance requirements would drain the phone battery and suck away compute capacity from phone use cases.\"\n\nIt then goes behind the scenes on how they envisioned the puck as a fully functional controller for AR games with 6DoF sensors and haptics, but that they've turned off those functions for the final version to focus more on eye/hand tracking and the EMG band. Still, one could imagine enthusiasts and devs getting those functions working if they wanted to.\n\nThat's partially why I think this blog post isn't just about boasting. It explains to skeptics why they chose a puck instead of a phone, curtails any false rumors about the puck being a controller in the final product, and explains the power demands AR glasses have that necessitate this weight in your pocket.\n\n(Image credit: Android Central)\n\nAnd that brings me back to my original point: I want more companies to let their engineers geek out and explain themselves before products reach the final stage. It primes journalists and hobbyists about the technical side of these products well before launch so they're less reliant on leaks while also building up hype for products and features.\n\nLeaked XR headsets like Valve Deckard have had VR super-nerds pouring over Valve's code for years, looking for hints of what to expect. I'm not saying Valve should reveal its product early, but it's been a long 5+ years since the Index launch with almost nothing VR-related aside from the occasional Steam Link update. Some behind-the-scenes info on what they've been working on would've been a nice nod to its patient fans.\n\nI doubt Meta will let its engineers loose to talk about the Meta Quest 4 anytime soon, nor its leaked smart glasses. But since we all know these devices are coming, it'd be nice if Meta let loose enough to give us some hints and let engineers brag publicly about their work instead of assuming it can fire everyone until the leaks stop.",

Vance, first lady Melania Trump, and/or the White House.\n\nAmidst political division and in the wake of Meta\u2019s recent changes -- including its decision to end fact-checking and enforce Community Notes as its main form of content moderation -- many users on Facebook and Instagram were triggered by notifications that claimed they were now following Trump and his political circle.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nMeta has denied the claims, with spokesperson Andy Stone stating in a Threads post that \u201cPeople were not made to automatically follow any of the official Facebook or Instagram accounts for the President, Vice President or First Lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose accounts are managed by the White House so with a new administration, the content on those Pages changes,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cThis is the same procedure we followed during the last presidential transition.\u201d\n\nHowever, some Facebook and Instagram users continue to say they are unable to successfully unfollow these now-Republican accounts.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, Demi Lovato -- who has 154 million followers on Instagram -- shared a screenshot of her following Vance\u2019s account, although she said she had already tried to unfollow it twice.\n\nSinger-songwriter Gracie Abrams also said she had tried to \"unfollow\" the accounts three different times and was eventually forced to block the accounts to make sure she was not following them anymore.\n\nOther users have stated that the results for the #democrat hashtag weren\u2019t showing up on Monday. Then, on early Tuesday, users trying to access results for the hashtag received a message that read\" \u201cResults for the term you searched for may contain sensitive content.\u201d\n\nMeta has since admitted that some users are indeed having issues unfollowing these accounts, with Stone saying, \u201cIt may take some time for follow and unfollow requests to go through as these accounts change hands.\u201d",

            "content": "Meta Platforms Inc, the social media giant behind Facebook, is ramping up its efforts in the voice-powered AI space.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Meta is planning to introduce improved voice features in its latest version of Llama AI, called Llama 4. The company believes that the future of AI-powered agents will be conversational, rather than text-based.\n\nMeta has been investing heavily in AI over the past two years, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing plans to spend up to $65 billion in 2025 to bolster its AI offerings. The company is looking to expand its AI capabilities beyond social media platforms and is considering trialing premium subscriptions for its AI assistant, Meta AI, for agentic purposes such as booking reservations and video creation.\n\nMeta\u2019s push into voice-powered AI comes as it competes with other tech giants in the industry, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. These companies are all racing to commercialize AI technology and generate revenue from it. Meta is also exploring the possibility of introducing paid advertising or sponsored posts into the search results of its AI assistant.\n\nThe voice capabilities of Meta\u2019s AI have been a focus for the company, with plans to make the conversation between the user and the AI model more natural and two-way. Meta wants users to be able to interrupt the AI model and have a more fluid dialogue, rather than a rigid question and answer format.\n\nMeta\u2019s chief product officer, Chris Cox, described the upcoming Llama 4 as an \u201comni model\u201d that allows for native speech rather than translating voice into text. He believes that the ability to talk to the internet and ask it anything is a powerful feature that is still being fully realized.\n\nMeta has also been discussing the guardrails for its AI models, including the newest Llama model. The company is considering whether to lower the restrictions on what the AI model can output.\n\nMeta\u2019s push into voice-powered AI aligns with its broader strategy of building lightweight headsets, such as its Ray Bans smart glasses, that can replace smartphones as consumers\u2019 main computing devices. The company sees voice interaction as a major feature of these devices.\n\nAs PYMNTS reported recently, Clara Shih, Meta\u2019s head of business AI, hopes to offer agentic AI to \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of businesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quickly coming to a place where every business, from the very large to the very small, they\u2019re going to have a business agent representing it and acting on its behalf, in its voice \u2014 the way that businesses today have websites and email addresses.\u201d\n\nShih wants to become more accessible for small businesses that currently rely on a Facebook page or website as their primary way to attract and engage with customers.\n\n\u201cVery soon, each of those businesses are going to have these AIs that can represent them and help automate redundant tasks, help speak in their voice, help them find more customers and provide almost like a concierge service to every single one of their customers, 24/7.\u201d",

After all, as AI thinks for itself, businesses must put a cage around it to ensure it\u2019s not lured into saying the wrong things \u2013 as others have\u2026\n\nSumming up, Shih noted:\n\nWhether you\u2019re a one-woman shop in Brooklyn, family business in Denver, entrepreneur in Manila, or one of the other 200M businesses connecting with customers on Meta today, here\u2019s to your success!\n\nAs Shih suggests, the scope for this technology is significant, with 600MN conversations happening between people and businesses every day on Meta\u2019s social platforms.\n\nHowever, in delivering such capabilities to small businesses for free \u2013 while in a pilot at least \u2013 Meta showcases how quickly customer service AI is becoming commoditized.\n\nFor many conversational AI vendors that may come as a concern. After all, AI reasoning and communications are no longer differentiative; how it\u2019s integrated into operations to enhance performance is.\n\nSpeaking to this trend last month, Sridhar Vembu, Co-founder & Chief Scientist of Zoho, outlined that tech companies can not charge a premium for AI agents.\n\nMeta\u2019s move to make its AI agent available in a free pilot perhaps speaks to this.\n\nYet, it also leaves the company with a tricky pricing question once that pilot ends.",

Last time, WhatsApp joined Meta's Accounts Center for seamless sharing of status updates across any Meta platform.\n\nThe new functionality is intended to bring AI assistance within reach without even needing to open the app. But with worries over AI intrusiveness already on the rise, is this a game-changer or simply an unwanted extra?\n\nMeta AI Goes Beyond Search, Now Available via Widget\n\nMeta AI has been consistently growing in WhatsApp, from a floating action button to search bar integration and in-chat tagging for group chats. With the latest addition of a specific widget discovered by WaBetaInfo, users will now have direct access to AI-driven features from their home screens.\n\nThis widget will enable users to conduct text-based searches, engage with Meta AI hands-free using just voice commands, and utilize a camera for picture-related queries.\n\nAccording to TechRadar, the goal is to reduce friction and ensure users can access AI-powered assistance without needing to open WhatsApp. Instead of switching to platforms like ChatGPT or Perplexity, users can now get responses directly from Meta AI with a single tap.\n\nConvenience or Unnecessary Clutter?\n\nThough Meta sells this as a huge convenience, user uptake is still split. Some view it as a natural means of engaging with AI, while others perceive it as an overbearing effort to insert AI into daily conversations. WhatsApp users have already complained about the increasing presence of Meta AI, with some griping about its intrusiveness in chats.\n\nWith the lukewarm reception, Meta's attempt to further integrate AI is putting the question of whether users necessarily need AI assistants built into their messaging platforms\u2014or if it's simply another business initiative for adopting AI.\n\nIs Meta AI Dismissible?\n\nFor those who do not want to clutter their experience, the silver lining is that Meta AI can still be turned off. The user will go to Settings, and Chats and switch off the Meta AI button, eliminating the feature from their WhatsApp experience.\n\nBut whether this feature still exists in future releases is a gamble. As Android Police reports, the new AI widget design is still in beta so changes are still expected to arrive.\n\nIf Meta continues highlighting AI adoption, the option to turn it off could become increasingly less accessible or even be eliminated altogether.\n\nMeta's AI Strategy: Succeeding with Users or Spinning Its Wheels?\n\nWhatsApp with its more than two billion monthly active users provides a huge chance for Meta to drive AI penetration. Even if just a segment of its users use Meta AI, that's a big success in the struggle for AI superiority.\n\nBut if most users choose to opt-out or opt it out altogether, it may follow the path of other Meta experiments\u2014like Facebook's push to popularize the Metaverse.\n\nIn June 2024, Meta announced its plans to bring the Meta AI chatbot with Llama 3 models to WhatsApp.",

            "content": "Meta will recommend that developers use the built-in OpenXR support of Unity and Unreal from next week.\n\nWhat Is OpenXR? OpenXR is the open standard API for AR/VR/MR, supported by the vast majority of the industry. The ideal of OpenXR is that developers can build apps that run on any headset, without needing to use vendor-specific core APIs for different hardware. Almost every headset and runtime supports OpenXR today, except for Apple Vision Pro and PlayStation VR2 on PS5. Meta is a founding member of OpenXR, and continues to be the biggest contributor to the standard's development.\n\nThe news comes shortly after we reported on developer frustration that Meta's Unity and Unreal integrations, which are described as using OpenXR, block other PC VR headsets. Developers using these integrations, which Meta had been recommending and promoting, need to implement a separate subsystem to support other PC VR headsets, the problem that OpenXR was supposed to solve.\n\nNow, in a new blog post seemingly in response to these concerns, Meta announced that starting from v74 of its SDKs, releasing next week, \"the built-in OpenXR path for all major game engines will be a recommended path for development\".\n\nFor Unity, the company says that version 1.14 of Unity's own OpenXR Plugin has \"achieved feature and performance parity\" with the Oculus XR Plugin. In addition to this, developers will still be able to \"utilize Horizon OS-specific features through extensions and the Meta XR Core SDK, and continue optimizing their content to take advantage of all our platform features\", Meta writes.\n\nFor Unreal Engine, the situation is somewhat more complicated. Unreal has its own OpenXR support, which Meta's documentation currently doesn't mention, and Meta offers its own integration with more Quest-focused features. Separately, Meta maintains its own fork of Unreal, with the source code available to developers, which it to date \"strongly recommends\". Meta says it will offer \"more details\" on its future recommendations for Unreal engine next week, including a \"trade-off table\" it says it will publish.\n\nFor Godot, the free and open-source alternative to Unity & Unreal, the path to supporting Quest already leveraged its built-in OpenXR support, which Meta funded Godot veterans to improve, and support for Quest features not yet part of the core OpenXR standard can be activated through the Godot OpenXR Vendors plugin, which enables the specific features of headsets from other companies too.\n\nIn what appears to be a response to the allegations from some in the industry of Meta intentionally undermining OpenXR, Meta notes that it has \"played a major role\" in developing, adopting, and advancing the standard since 2016. Here's the company's statement from the blog post:\n\n\"Since ensuring that our OpenXR runtimes for Meta Quest and PC were 100% OpenXR compliant in 2019, we have pushed to continue advancing OpenXR as a viable cross-device solution. We are continuously creating new XR technologies to enable unique and immersive experiences, exposed as OpenXR extensions. We also build libraries to support these new extensions. As part of our commitment to OpenXR, we contribute these advancements back to the community, allowing other companies to adopt and build upon them.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Meta has contributed to 33 (~67%) of Khronos and cross-vendor extensions, as well as 61 vendor-specific extensions. Among those vendor-specific extensions, many of them (e.g. SpaceWarp, foveation, passthrough, etc.) are adopted by other OpenXR vendors for the better interoperability with apps that were originally developed for Meta devices. These contributions have been adopted by other vendors who recognize Meta's dedication to advancing the industry and contributing back to the standard.\"\n\n\"As early adopters of OpenXR, Meta has contributed significant resources to both expanding the standard and enabling OpenXR support in popular game engines. We remain committed to OpenXR and will continue to invest in the success of OpenXR and our developers.\"",

Another hiring manager said they had yet to see someone get off a list and have a chance to interview at Meta again.\n\nThe number of former employees on Meta's block lists was unclear.\n\nRelated: Meta Confirms It Is Doubling Executives Bonuses to 'Motivate' and 'Reward Them' a Week After Layoffs\n\nTwo employees impacted by Meta's 11,000-person layoffs in 2022 told the outlet they had a history of earning \"Exceeded Expectations\" on their performance reviews, but discovered they were labeled \"ineligible to be hired\" by Meta HR when re-applying for different roles through third-party staffing agencies.\n\nRelated: Meta Says It Has Fired 20 Employees For Leaking Information: 'We Expect There Will Be More'\n\nIn response, a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that several factors determine whether an employee is eligible to be rehired, including \"the last rating prior to separation and any other recent performance signals\" and how the employee left the company (\"policy violation, performance termination, voluntary resignation, etc.\").\n\nMeanwhile, Meta's block lists don't appear to be the norm throughout the industry.\n\nLaszlo Bock, Google's head of people operations from 2006 to 2016, told BI in a follow-up story that he has \"never seen\" a formalized, \"large scale, systematic approach\" like Meta's.\n\n\"I've never heard of anything like this,\" Bock wrote in a LinkedIn post about the block lists.\n\nMeta had 74,067 employees as of December 2024.\n\nRelated: I Got Laid Off at Meta Despite a Glowing Performance Review.

            "content": "Meta Platforms is among the U.S. tech giants leading the race to invest in generative AI and the foundational large language models that the AI breakthroughs rely on, and it's also taken an open-source approach to its AI development, allowing the tech innovations to be shared widely.\n\nThose innovations are occurring rapidly. \"Not just daily. It's evolving multiple times a day,\" says Clara Shih, head of business AI at Meta.\n\nIts Llama LLMs, available to developers around the world, have been downloaded over 800 million times. Earlier this week, Meta chief product officer Chris Cox said the upcoming open-source Llama 4 AI will help power AI agents, the latest trend in generative AI.\n\nThe AI agents won't just be responding to prompts. They will be capable of new levels of reasoning and action \u2014 surfing the web and handling many tasks that might be of use to consumers and businesses. And that's where Shih comes in. Meta's AI is already being used by over 700 million consumers, according to Shih, and her job is to bring the same technologies to businesses.\n\n\"Not every business, especially small businesses, has the ability to hire these large AI teams, and so now we're building business AIs for these small businesses so that even they can benefit from all of this innovation that's happening,\" she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an interview for the CNBC Changemakers Spotlight series.\n\nShe expects the uptake among businesses to happen soon, and spread far and wide.\n\n\"We're quickly coming to a place where every business, from the very large to the very small, they're going to have a business agent representing it and acting on its behalf, in its voice \u2014 the way that businesses today have websites and email addresses,\" Shih said.\n\nWhile major companies across sectors of the economy are investing millions of dollars to develop customer LLMs, \"doing fancy things like fine tuning models,\" as Shih put it, \"If you're a small business \u2014 you own a coffee shop, you own a jewelry shop online, you're distributing through Instagram \u2014 you don't have the resources to hire a big AI team, and so now our dream is that they won't have to.\"\n\nFor both consumers and businesses, the implications of the advances discussed by Cox and Shih will be significant in daily life.\n\nFor consumers, Shih says, \"Their AI assistant [will] do all kinds of things, from researching products to planning trips, planning social outings with their friends.\"\n\nRival OpenAI recently launched its Operator AI for tasks like travel planning.\n\nOn the business side, Shih pointed to the 200 million small businesses around the world that are already using Meta services and platforms. \"They're using WhatsApp, they're using Facebook, they're using Instagram, both to acquire customers, but also engage and deepen each of those relationships. Very soon, each of those businesses are going to have these AIs that can represent them and help automate redundant tasks, help speak in their voice, help them find more customers and provide almost like a concierge service to every single one of their customers, 24/7.\"\n\nThe more AI does, the less people have to do, at least in traditional definitions of roles. Shih says every person must prepare now for the changes that will be coming. \"There isn't a single job that hasn't been completely transformed by the internet and by mobile and by social media. I think we're at the same juncture now with AI, where it's clear that there are certain professions where AI will significantly change the job. But my prediction is that over time, AI will change every job function across every industry,\" she told Boorstin.\n\nHer advice for every individual and every company is \"to learn, to experiment, to understand and to almost define what that [AI transformation] could look like for their particular job.\"\n\n\"Just like in 1990 we had to learn email, we had to learn search. I think today, everyone, regardless of where they live, what job they have or want to have, needs to learn AI,\" she said.\n\nThe good news? According to Shih, AI makes it easier to learn. \"You can talk to it. You can literally talk to it.\"\n\nShe's been doing that herself. \"Something that I often do is, if there's long research papers, AI research papers, or there's developments, you can ask AI. You can use Meta AI, and it'll break it down for you. You can ask it, 'Explain this at a ninth grade level, explain this at a fifth grade level,' and it'll do it. And you can kind of go back and forth. And so that's how I learn a lot of the more complicated topics.\"\n\nThe full interview with Shih is available at CNBC Changemakers and on CNBC's YouTube channel.",

He said that in time, AI agents will affect some retail job functions, but that most of those tasks are digital and not physical.\n\n\u201cAs such, many of these functions are still marketing- or commerce-based, and retailers will be looking to companies in adjacent industries to see how well AI agents from Salesforce, Microsoft, and others are delivering value to their customers,\u201d said Kirkpatrick.\n\nHe added that the most important question is whether retailers will make the investment in technology that is still relatively new and in many ways, hasn\u2019t demonstrated ROI.\n\n\u201cMargins are thin, and I think there will need to be fairly significant ROI examples that are directly relevant to retailers, in order to drive early adoption. I think pricing will be important, and AI agent pricing will need to be tied to specific metrics or outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

            "content": "Now, the company is taking advantage of San Francisco\u2019s wide-open office market and upgrading its workspace on the cheap.\n\nFirst, as people were forced to distance and exercise outdoors, its user base exploded from 50 million at the start of 2020 to more than 150 million today.\n\nStrava, the company behind the popular exercise-tracking app that incorporates social networking, has benefitted twice from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s commute improved as a result of this move,\u201d Strava CEO Michael Martin said during a tour of the company\u2019s new offices. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened anywhere I\u2019ve worked before.\u201d\n\nIn November, Strava finalized a sublease at 181 Fremont St., the barely 7-year-old, 55-story skyscraper neighboring Salesforce Tower and the Transbay Transit Center. Meta leased all 34 floors of office space when the building opened in 2018 but vacated the entirety during the pandemic.\n\nLike many tech companies, Strava embraced a remote working model at the height of the pandemic. But when Martin took charge in 2024, he said the scattered workforce had become \u201csomewhat of an impediment\u201d to accommodating the company\u2019s rapid transition from startup to global business.\n\nPrior to making the move, Strava had been based in a century-old brick-and-timber building at 208 Utah St. \u2014 tucked between the Mission and Potrero Hill \u2014 for nearly a decade.\n\nEverything you need to know to start your day.\n\nSo he and his executive team set about finding an office that Strava\u2019s workers would actually want to return to.\n\nSince 2019, the company\u2019s headcount has grown from 175 to 430, she said. Strava employees are still allowed to work from home but are asked to come in at least two or three days a week. Lunch is catered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and the employees have organized a weekly team workout since moving into the building.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were going to get good value,\u201d Bousquet said, adding that after three months of touring, Strava was able to quickly negotiate a sublease deal with Meta and move in four months later.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief people officer, Michele Bousquet, said the search for a new headquarters started in earnest last spring. After touring more than 20 properties, she said, the company narrowed down the list to five but circled back to 181 Fremont because of its location, safety, and access to amenities like Salesforce Park, which is connected to the building.\n\nMatt Hart, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield who represented Strava in the sublease, declined to disclose the deal\u2019s terms. But rents for commercial real estate in the city are generally far lower than pre-pandemic prices.\n\nWhen Jay Paul Co. opened 181 Fremont, Chief Investment Officer Matt Lituchy said the asking rent was around $80 per square foot .\n\nStrava subleased floors 25 through 28 from Meta, which signed a long-term lease with the property\u2019s owner in 2017, prior to the building\u2019s completion. Meta\u2019s Instagram division briefly occupied a handful of floors , but real estate sources say most of the office space at 181 Fremont was left unused since the social media giant also leases nearly 800,000 square feet at 250 Howard St.\n\n\u201cThis move was about reorienting our culture to more in-person without being heavy-handed,\u201d Bousquet said. \u201cForcing people to come in can sometimes work against you.\u201d\n\nMartin charged Strava\u2019s internal design team with bringing to life the minimalist space that Meta had left behind. They answered the call by building a giant interactive map of San Francisco at the entrance that spotlights all Strava user activity that day. The hallways are decorated with employees\u2019 marathon bibs and framed prints of user-generated Strava art .\n\nThe four floors leased by Strava, totaling around 50,000 square feet, are connected by a contiguous staircase. The 25th floor houses the company\u2019s kitchen and all-hands meeting space, while the 27th is for meeting rooms, which are named after routes Stava users have popularized around the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been rewarding helping [Strava] establish their new normal and energize their employee base,\u201d Hart said. \u201cEspecially since these are the sorts of environments they wouldn\u2019t have even considered five years ago.\u201d\n\nThe building with the pointed corner was a culmination of the Transbay Center District Plan, which passed in 2012 and allowed developers to build skyscrapers around the transit hub. SKS Partners purchased the property in 2007 and shepherded the project through entitlement before selling it to the Jay Paul Co. in 2013.\n\nMeta and Jay Paul\u2019s relationship predated the 181 Fremont development, as the firm had worked on the social giant\u2019s campus in Sunnyvale.\n\nAccording to CoStar, roughly 62% of the office space at 181 Fremont is still available for sublease. The upper 16 floors of the building are dedicated to condominiums.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the available sublease space [in San Francisco] is being marketed by large-block users, primarily in tech, with much of that space having been on the market since early to mid-pandemic,\u201d said Derek Daniels, regional director of research at Colliers. \u201cWhile those spaces are in abundance, the pace of new large block sublease availability has slowed.\u201d\n\nOther companies that have joined Strava in the new building include Zendesk and Navan (previously known as TripActions).\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie, who has made revitalizing downtown one of his top priorities, addressed Strava employees Wednesday in an all-hands meeting.",

Here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest attempts to flee Facebook and other Meta products, such as Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. 2006: News Feed blowback The earliest notable Facebook revolt was over \u2014 surprise \u2014 privacy. People were upset at the two-year old site\u2019s launch of the News Feed , which took personal profile updates like relationship statuses and turned them into a broadcast seen by all their friends. 2009: The Terms of Service power grab An update to its Terms of Service gave Facebook more ownership of what people posted to the site. Users banded together and threatened to delete their accounts. 2010: \u201cQuit Facebook Day\u201d One of the first movements to come up with branding and a stand alone website, \u201cQuit Facebook Day\u201d got tens of thousands of users to promise to quit. They were upset the company was collecting too much personal information and purposefully making it complicated to opt out of sharing. 2018: Cambridge Analytica and #DeleteFacebook The scandal that gave birth to the first (but not last) #DeleteFacebook hashtag campaign came after political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was accused of improperly accessing the personal data of 87 million Facebook users, without their consent. The firm worked with Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. 2020: Election troubles The hashtag was revived in 2020 when Facebook was accused of not doing enough to crackdown on hate speech and misinformation, or put limits on political advertising ahead of the election. Novelist Stephen King deleted his account and major advertisers took part in a \u201cStop Hate for Profit\u201d boycott campaign. The company ended the year with 2.8 billion users worldwide. 2021: Frances Haugen and the Facebook Papers Whistleblower Frances Haugen collected internal documents and testified that Facebook put profit over the safety of its users. She said the company knew about real-world harms its products causes but chose not to address them. People once again said they were leaving the app. 2025: Meta and Trump A flurry of moves that appealed to President Trump and his supporters had many Meta users wanting to delete the company\u2019s apps. Meta said in early January that it would end its fact-checking program to prioritize \u201cfree expression,\u201d and it loosened its community guidelines around LGBTQ and immigrant issues. Zuckerberg also voiced support for President Trump and appeared at his inauguration. 1 / 8 End of carousel\n\nKnow your options\n\nIf you want to test how well you manage without your accounts before committing to deletion, consider deactivation. Deactivating your accounts hides your profile and posts from other users without permanently deleting the account. Deactivation temporarily locks you out of your account until you reactivate your profile using your username and password. If you want to keep your options more open, you can just delete the apps off your phone or stay logged out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to minimize your Meta usage, you can hold on to the Meta accounts that matter the most to you. Users who risk losing contact with family and friends abroad may opt to just keep their WhatsApp account. Avid deal hunters may opt to keep Facebook for Marketplace.\n\nDownload your data first\n\nBefore making any big decisions, download all your past data. This could include likes, comments, messages and saved posts. Downloading your photos and contacts can ensure you don\u2019t lose precious memories and information. And having a list of friends or followers will help you re-create networks elsewhere.\n\nMeta has merged many app settings and put them in the Accounts Center. That means downloading your data should be the same process across most services. In some cases you may be able to download two sets of data at once, like with Instagram and Threads. These instructions are based on the mobile apps, but should be similar on a browser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook: Open your Facebook app and select Menu in the bottom right corner. Scroll down to Settings and privacy \u2192 Settings \u2192 Accounts Center \u2192 Your information and permissions \u2192 Download your information \u2192 and hit Download or transfer information.\n\nIf you have linked your Meta accounts, you might be able to download information for multiple apps here. If they aren\u2019t linked, you can go through this process in each individual app. Choose what you want to save, Available Information, which is everything, or Specific Types of Information. Select your download location, choose your date range and make sure you have picked HTML as the format, then tap Create files. You will get a notification when it is ready.\n\nYou can save the files to your device or a cloud account. If you want to view them, however, you\u2019ll need to open them in a browser. After a few minutes you should receive the compressed Meta file. Find the \u201cStart Here\u201d file and open in a browser to view your data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram: On Instagram, go to your profile page, tap the three vertical lines at the top right corner. Go to the Accounts Center, select Your information and permissions and follow the same instructions as for Facebook.\n\nThreads: Threads accounts are created through Instagram, so your data will be included in that download. To download only Threads information, follow the same steps you did for Instagram to get to the Download your information page \u2192 download current activity. Go to Some of your information \u2192 Select Threads.\n\nMessenger: This data is also included in a Facebook download, but to get to it directly in Messenger, go to Menu \u2192 Settings \u2192 Account Center. Follow the same instructions as you did for Facebook.\n\nWhatsApp: To download your WhatsApp data, go to Settings \u2192 Account \u2192 Request account info, and tap Request account report. The final report can take up to three days and won\u2019t include your messages, but will have a list of phone numbers without any names. Once it\u2019s ready, you\u2019ll be prompted to download a file that you can open on your desktop.\n\nTransfer your data\n\nYou can transfer some data to another app, like Google Photos. On Facebook or Instagram, go to the Meta Accounts Center \u2192 Your information and permissions \u2192 Transfer a copy of your information. Select the account you want, then choose what files you want. You can select a destination like Google Photos, Dropbox or other storage services. You will need to verify your account.\n\nBroadcast that you\u2019re leaving\n\nBefore deleting your accounts, let people know you\u2019re leaving. Reach out to people personally and ask to stay in touch beyond social media to keep those valuable connections. You can also make a post or a story letting connections know in advance you plan to leave and where to reach you. Posting at least a week before you delete your accounts will give your followers time to see your post.\n\nFile a data deletion request\n\nCalifornia residents can take it a step further and request that Meta delete all their data permanently. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, consumers can request a copy of their personal data from companies or request that it be deleted entirely. Do this before deleting your account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis option is somewhat hidden, but Meta and other companies are legally required to let you delete your own information. Go to Meta\u2019s privacy rights request page, make sure you are logged in and that your location is set to California. Next, select the app you want to delete all data for, click \u201cHow can I delete my information?\u201d and scroll down to the very bottom of the screen. It will say \u201cCan\u2019t find the information you need? Create a case.\u201d Click on the link for \u201cCreate a case\u201d and fill out the form to start the process.\n\nDelete or deactivate your accounts\n\nYou are finally ready to deactivate or delete your accounts. Both options are in the same place. Deactivation is temporary, while deletion is permanent but can be reversed within 30 days by logging in. Account deletion is different from deleting the apps off your phone, which will only remove the app but not the actual accounts or any of your data. The deletion and deactivation process is similar across all of Meta\u2019s platforms with some minor differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook: Select Menu \u2192 Settings and Privacy \u2192 Settings \u2192 Accounts Center \u2192 Personal details \u2192 Account ownership and control \u2192 Deactivation or deletion.\n\nInstagram: Go to your profile and hit the three lines at the top right. Select Accounts Center \u2192 Personal details \u2192 Account Ownership and Control \u2192 Deactivation or deletion.\n\nThreads: Go to your profile and hit the two horizontal lines at the top. Go to Account \u2192 Deactivate or delete profile.\n\nWhatsApp: Open Settings on the bottom right corner \u2192 Account \u2192 Delete my account.\n\nYou\u2019ve left your Meta accounts. Now what?\n\nFinding replacements for Meta\u2019s apps can be hard, but there are plenty of alternatives.\n\nTo help pass the time, you can endlessly scroll on TikTok or YouTube shorts.

Meta says that advertisers with an existing verified business portfolio may be eligible to skip this step, but you will need to provide additional info in some form.\n\nAll ads targeting Singapore will now also be required to include the name of the individual or organization paying for and/or benefiting from the ad.\n\nAs per Meta:\n\n\u201cThis information will be visible on the ad's infosheet and in the Ad Library. You can specify the beneficiary and payer when setting up your ads.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure requirements are similar to what Meta requires for political ads, ensuring a higher level of transparency for the region.\n\nMeta says that it\u2019s rolling out this updated process from April, with all advertisers expected to have access to early-May.\n\n\u201cWe encourage you to complete the beneficiary and payer verification and start designating this verified information for your ads as soon as you are notified that you are eligible to start the verification process in Ads Manager.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively minor addition for ad partners, but it does mean that it will take more time to set up ads targeting this region.\n\nBut overall, it could be of benefit, with ad viewers now able to access more information about each provider.\n\nYou can read more about Meta\u2019s OCHA update for Singapore here.",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was valedictorian of my high school and graduated from college with honors. I've always valued excellence, so it was such a treat when, just out of college in 2021, I landed a contract job at Meta that turned into a full-time, six-figure job as a content designer around the start of 2022.\n\nI worked on every major surface of Instagram, including profiles, explore, search, and home. I got to work on features that were used by so many people.\n\nMy first annual performance rating was \"exceeds expectations\" on all markers, and I was given a raise. I thought I was doing really well at the company. Then two months later, in April of 2023, I was laid off.\n\nFor the first time, I realized that hard work doesn't always reap rewards. Finding full-time work felt impossible, but struggling to find a job pushed me to give my passion project a shot.\n\nI planned to work in Big Tech for a while, but layoffs happened across the entire industry\n\nI was laid off via a generic email as part of a series of mass layoffs. The message cited that Meta had changing business needs, and my role was no longer needed. I was devastated.\n\nMy true passion has always been indie video games, but I planned to stick around in Big Tech for several years before starting my own studio. I thought I had done really well at a big company like Meta. When I got laid off, it messed with my worldview.\n\nI started applying to more tech jobs, and after four months of unemployment, I landed a contract role at Yahoo as a content designer, which kept me afloat. That job ended a few months later, and I was back to being unemployed.\n\nThere were so many Big Tech layoffs happening at the time.\n\nI was on Forbes 30 under 30 and still couldn't find a job\n\nI had been making some money from content creation promoting my indie game, Gold Lining, which I'd been developing with some friends since college.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn the midst of my unemployment, I was included in Forbes 30 under 30 for my work on the game.\n\nIt felt like such a jarring discrepancy. On one hand, I received this esteemed achievement and was being told I was a part of the next generation of changers in the game industry. On the other hand, I was crying alone in my bedroom because I couldn't even land a regular job. It felt very dystopian.\n\nI thought maybe being on Forbes 30 under 30 would help me get a job, but it didn't. Nobody cared.\n\nI started a hobby project to help me cope with my failures\n\nAround this time, I started hating the game I was developing with my friends. We were receiving rejection after rejection from investors, and I found myself trying to appease them at the expense of my own better judgment. I wanted to get back to making games I loved.\n\nI decided to start a hobby project as a way to cope with the anxiety of my two colossal failures \u2014 unemployment and a failing game. My honest hope was just to reignite my spark for game development.\n\nI stepped away from Gold Lining in July 2024, and that same month, I came up with the idea to develop Lily's World XD, a psychological horror game where players investigate a young girl's computer.\n\nI made a little Instagram video promoting its development, which got over 2 million views. Now, I fully finance myself through content creation about my journey building Lily's World XD.\n\nWorking for myself has been challenging, but I'm taking this time to give my dreams a shot\n\nI feel so lucky that I'm able to pursue my passion at such a young age, but I still have anxiety every day that it's all going to stop working out because content creation is so futile.\n\nI'm still learning how to manage the anxiety and overwhelm of being my own boss. When I was working at Meta, I'd turn my work brain off after work. Now, I lay in bed at night, still thinking about a bug in my game or stressing about a video that isn't performing well.\n\nIt can be tough, but leaning on my network of fellow game developers and content creators for support has been extremely helpful. I'm taking this as my chance to give my dreams a shot, and I won't hold back.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from your dream job?

A lot,\" Cox said. \"Having it understand all of them automatically is a huge deal from a friction perspective.\"\n\nHis comments follow similar statements made by Clara Shih, Meta's head of business AI, who told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on Wednesday that the company believes more businesses will use AI agents to automate complex tasks.\n\n\"We already have these trusted relationships with 200 million small businesses around the world,\" Shih said. \"Very soon, each of those businesses are going to have these AIs that represent them and help automate redundant tasks, help speak in their voice, help them find more customers and provide almost like a concierge service to every single one of their customers, 24/7.\"\n\nMeta will host its first LlamaCon AI conference on April 29.\n\nLast week, CNBC reported that the social networking company will debut a stand-alone Meta AI app during the second quarter.",

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other good stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhen seeking investment opportunities, individual investors often look to hedge funds for guidance. Hedge funds are known for their sophisticated investment strategies, high-level expertise, and significant market influence. Hedge funds are massive players in the global investment landscape, managing trillions of dollars in assets. According to Preqin, as of Q3 2024, hedge funds manage approximately $4.87 trillion in assets globally. This significant amount of capital means that hedge funds have substantial market power. When they invest in certain stocks, their actions can impact stock prices, drive market trends, and influence broader economic sentiment. As such, their decisions are followed closely by institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nA key reason hedge fund stock picks are worth paying attention to is their wide diversification across various sectors and strategies. Multi-strategy hedge funds, which allocate capital across various investment strategies, have gained prominence. According to WealthBriefing from 2017 to the third quarter of 2024, the number of multi-strategy fund launches grew at an annual rate of 4%.\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 Dual Investment Strategy (Long and Short Positions)\n\nHedge funds are also known for using a dual approach\u2014investing in both long and short positions. This allows them to profit from rising and falling markets, giving them a comprehensive view of market dynamics. According to data from BarclayHedge, hedge funds that employed a long/short strategy in 2024 saw returns of around 9%.\n\n\u200bHedge funds have increasingly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sectors, adjusting their portfolios to capitalize on emerging opportunities. According to a Goldman Sachs report analyzing 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion in gross equity positions at the start of Q1 2025, there has been a notable shift in investment strategies. The report indicates that hedge funds have become more selective within popular sectors and themes. Notably, they have incrementally added positions to AI Phase 3 companies with AI-enabled revenues. Companies like Salesforce are ranked among the \u201cRising Stars,\u201d reflecting a significant increase in hedge fund popularity during the last quarter. \u200b\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a consensus-based approach by using opinions from financial websites like Forbes Advisor, Motley Fool, and Morningstar to first compile a list of good stocks to invest in right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.",

The decline of big social media platforms is accelerating, and this is reshaping how brands should approach customer engagement.\n\nTrust on trial. Consumers trust user-generated content far more than influencer promotions, which signals a shift in what drives brand credibility.\n\nOwn your channels. Brands must invest in direct channels like websites, apps and email to regain control over customer relationships.\n\nA few years from now, we may look back on 2025 as the beginning of the end of two long-standing mega pillars of the internet.\n\nThe first is Google\u2019s domination of the search engine marketplace, which is being disrupted by generative AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, with Google\u2019s market share falling below 90% for the first time since 2015. Antitrust issues aside, there are plenty of reasons to believe it will never be that high ever again.\n\nThe second is the end of the era of big social media platforms.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the crumbling that\u2019s already started, where things are likely headed and why the momentum isn\u2019t likely to let up.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Canary in the Coal Mine\n\nBefore its acquisition by Elon Musk, Twitter was widely viewed as the world\u2019s digital town square. Since its transformation into X, it\u2019s become a shadow of its former self, more of a ghost town than the world\u2019s town square.\n\nSince Musk purchased the platform in 2022 for $44 billion, X\u2019s valuation has plunged. According to Fidelity\u2019s valuation of its investment in X, the platform\u2019s worth has fallen by 79% to just $9.4 billion. Brand Finance is even less generous, valuing it at just $498 million earlier this year.\n\nThis change of fortune was driven by an 80% reduction in staff, which notably included all of its content moderation staff and partners. That change directly led to a marked decline in content quality and negative shift in tone. This caused millions of active users to leave the platform, and it raised brand safety concerns among advertisers, many of which reduced or ended their advertising. As a result, X is \u201cbarely breaking even\u201d and has sued its former advertisers, claiming conspiracy.\n\nThat chain of events is important because of what happened next.\n\nMeta Doubles Down on the Wrong Lessons\n\nOn Jan. 7, a couple of weeks before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Facebook founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would be \u201crestoring free expression on our platforms\u201d by getting rid of fact-checkers, removing restrictions on controversial topics like immigration and gender, dialing back other content filters, increasing recommendations of political content and \u201cgoing to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world going after American companies and pushing to censor more.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg explicitly says they\u2019re going to be doing things \u201csimilar to X\u201d and rolling those changes out across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nBased on what\u2019s happened at X, there\u2019s every reason to believe that these changes will cause many unintended consequences.\n\nMany Meta users may spend less time on its platforms or depart for other platforms like Mastodon and Bluesky, which have benefited tremendously from X\u2019s similar policy shifts.\n\nAdvertisers may pull back or depart out of concern for brand safety.\n\nForeign governments may levy additional fines or further restrict Meta\u2019s activities in their nations, worsening its already poor relations.\n\nOne of Meta\u2019s early attempts at rolling back content moderation resulted in Instagram users seeing violent and graphic content recommended in their Reels feeds, which led to a flood of user complaints.\n\nRelated Article: 10 Social Media Trends You Can't Ignore\n\nSocial Media as a Black Box\n\nThe double-whammy of lower user engagement and advertiser pullbacks is likely to be devastating, just as it\u2019s been at X. Making matters worse is the fact that social networks have gradually restricted organic brand reach to near zero over the years.\n\nWhat little organic traffic that exists is often obscured by these platforms, according to SparkToro. And cookie consent is further complicating attribution, suppressing conversion tracking by up to 20%, according to Orbit Media. All of that has further discouraged brands from investing much in an organic presence on social media platforms.\n\nAs a result, when brands pull back from social media advertising, they\u2019re often left with a minimal direct presence. That said, some may have an indirect presence via influencers, but even that is on shaky ground.\n\nInfluencer Fatigue\n\nPlenty of consumers feel a kinship with their favorite influencers. That\u2019s particularly true of younger consumers in Gen Z.\n\nHowever, in general, trust is slipping. A common consumer belief today is that most influencers only endorse and promote products because they\u2019re paid to, not because they use or even like the product.\n\nAccording to a survey by EnTribe, 81% of consumers said a brand\u2019s use of influencers has either no impact or a negative impact on their perception of that brand. Fifty-one percent said they scroll right past influencer posts, in much the same way that consumers ignore ads. When asked if their purchases were ever impacted by an influencer, 62% said they\u2019ve never purchased an influencer-promoted product, while 42% of those who had purchased an influencer-promoted product said they regretted doing so.\n\nThe most shocking evidence that the influencer market has peaked is that 86% said they\u2019re more likely to trust a brand that publishes user-generated content, compared to just 12% who said they\u2019re inclined to purchase a product promoted by an influencer.\n\nBots Are Taking Over \u2014 and Everyone Knows It\n\nAuthenticity and trust are being further undermined by AI bots, which in some cases are being directly created and enabled by social media platforms. For instance, Meta created Facebook and Instagram AI bots for living celebrities, dead famous people and others. Meta also allows Instagram users to create AI versions of themselves to interact with their followers (seemingly to save them from having to waste their time doing so).\n\nThese programs aren\u2019t fringe. They\u2019re core to social media\u2019s future. Meta has even told The Financial Times that it envisages social media filled with AI-generated users.\n\nTo their credit, these AI bots are clearly labeled. But it conjures up a dystopian future where we all create AI versions of ourselves that chat with one another and periodically update us about the fake conversations our fake selves are having with all the other fake people. That\u2019s a far cry from the original promise of social media. In fact, we probably won\u2019t call it \u201csocial\u201d media at that point.\n\nOf course, all of that is on top of the enduring problem of run-of-the-mill fake accounts. Facebook alone removes around 1 billion fake accounts each quarter.\n\nTake Back What You Can Control\n\nIf you throw in the uncertainty swirling around TikTok, social media has never looked more shaky. Still huge, but shaky.\n\nThe natural response from brands should be to counterbalance that uncertainty by investing more in channels they have much more control over, including websites, apps, customer loyalty programs, email, SMS (RCS), mobile and browser push, and podcasts.\n\nIn addition to building up first-party audiences, which give you much more direct and unmediated relationships with your customers and prospects, investing in these channels also gives you many opportunities to collect first-party data. This data is vital for driving message targeting, ad targeting and analytics that get us closer to our customers.\n\nThe internet is undergoing massive changes. And if Twitter\u2019s transformation into X demonstrates anything, it\u2019s that big changes can happen faster than you think. Every brand should be watching carefully and coming up with contingency plans before they realize they\u2019re a few years too late.\n\nCore Questions About the Decline of Big Social Media\n\nEditor's note: Key questions surrounding the decline of major social media platforms and how brands should adapt their customer engagement strategies.\n\nHow is the collapse of big social media changing customer engagement?\n\nAs trust in major social media platforms declines, brands are shifting their focus toward direct engagement strategies such as email marketing, owned communities and first-party data collection. Consumers are looking for more meaningful interactions, prompting businesses to invest in personalized customer experiences outside of traditional social media channels.\n\nWhat role does user-generated content (UGC) play in brand credibility?\n\nWith consumers increasingly skeptical of paid influencer promotions, authentic user-generated content has become a powerful trust-building tool. Brands that encourage customers to share real experiences\u2014through testimonials, reviews, and organic social posts\u2014see stronger engagement and credibility compared to those relying on traditional advertising.\n\nWhy should brands invest in owned channels over social media?\n\nBrands that rely heavily on platforms like X and Meta face risks due to algorithm changes, declining organic reach and shifting audience behaviors. Investing in owned channels such as company websites, email newsletters and brand communities provides greater control over customer relationships and reduces dependence on unpredictable third-party platforms.\n\nHow can brands mitigate the risks of AI-generated content and fake engagement?\n\nAI-generated interactions and fake engagement on social media are eroding trust. To counter this, brands are prioritizing authenticity by fostering real customer conversations, leveraging human-led content creation, and verifying the credibility of online interactions. Transparency about AI usage in customer engagement is also key to maintaining consumer trust.\n\nWhat are the long-term implications of social media\u2019s decline for digital marketing?\n\nThe decline of traditional social media is pushing marketers toward more diversified digital strategies. SEO-driven content, community-based marketing and personalized experiences are becoming more effective than broad social media outreach. Businesses that focus on building loyal audiences through multiple touchpoints will be better positioned for long-term success.\n\nLearn how you can join our contributor community.",

            "content": "Meta reportedly maintains secretive lists of former employees who are prohibited from returning to the company. Some who have reapplied were even courted by their former managers, only to be ghosted after recruiters found they were on a mysterious \u201cineligible for rehire\u201d list. Former employees are not told when they are added to such lists; some only learned about it after cajoling recruiters for information.\n\nMeta conducted mass layoffs in 2022 and 2023, letting go of tens of thousands of employees in successive waves in order to make the company leaner and more efficient. Some former employees told Business Insider they reapplied not because they like Meta but because the pay was good. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst company I\u2019ve ever worked for,\u201d one said. \u201cBut they also pay the best. If I could get in there for a couple more years and make bank, I would do it.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, however, at least dozens of these individuals have been iced out during the application process, even if they had met or exceeded expectations during their earlier tenure and were not dismissed for any wrongdoing. Apparently, former employees can be added to these lists with little effort; when an employee is off-boarded, an email asks them to indicate whether the employee is hireable again in the future. It is possible that employees were added just because someone did not like them, or maybe Meta has simply increased its standards. Meta, for its part, insists there are checks and balances in place concerning who gets added.\n\nFrom Business Insider:\n\nAnother director, who was actively trying to rehire the senior engineer, expressed frustration about the block and said that it was preventing them from rehiring multiple people they hoped to recruit. In an email viewed by BI, a hiring manager expressed frustration that they couldn\u2019t figure out why someone they wanted to rehire had ended up on a block list. It seemed, they said, that they were running into a mechanism outside normal recruiting tools. They wrote that they had not seen anyone successfully get off a list and be able to interview at the company again.\n\nHuman resources experts quoted in the story said it is unusual for large companies to maintain such lists for former employees who committed no policy violations. Lazlo Bock, Google\u2019s head of people operations for ten years, said the blocklist practice is \u201cvery, very rare.\u201d He went on to add, \u201cI\u2019ve actually never heard of a company having a \u2018do not rehire\u2019 designation for former employees, because if an employee was a decent or good performer, you\u2019d much rather hire somebody who actually knows your company and culture than somebody else.\u201d\n\nA Meta employee speaking to Gizmodo under the condition of anonymity said they do not believe the lists are unusual, and have seen similar activity at another major tech company where they previously worked. The employee posited former staff let go during Meta\u2019s mass layoffs that now find themselves on the do-not-rehire list may have been in reality fired even though it was framed as a restructuring-based layoff. Meta has increased its performance expectations and they may not have met the new standard, despite having received positive reviews in the past.\n\nMaintaining such lists is not considered illegal unless it over-indexes on a protected class, like people of color. So long as that is not the case, Meta has free reign to add people to such lists. It is unfortunate and seems unfair to those added on the lists since they have no recourse and the company is not willing to offer any explanation about their specific circumstance.\n\nIf anyone from Meta has a better explanation for this phenomena, feel free to get in touch. We would love to know more.",

However, Cramer said investors should get used to this volatility and be ready for different situations.\n\n\u201cCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the last of his myriad interviews of the day that maybe the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could be partially rolled back, perhaps as soon as tomorrow.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber Of Hedge Fund Investors: 262\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program said he sold some Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares for this charitable trust amid the strong bull run. However, Cramer said the trust still owns the stock.\n\n\u201cIt went up so much that we actually did a little bit of trim for the trust because it got so huge for us.\u201d\n\nMeta crushed expectations with the latest quarterly results, but yet again pointed to higher expenses in the future. In 2025, it sees total operating expenses in a range of $114-$119 billion, with 19-25% y/y growth. Capex is expected to rise 61-74% y/y to $60-$65 billion, compared to just $37.3 billion in FY24. Advertising rose strongly but analysts believe it should be seen in the context of higher political ad spend and holiday quarter perspective. In 2025, the company might not be able to keep reporting double-digit growth in ad pricing amid weaker consumer spending and a cautious macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nIn the long term, Meta shares are expected to grow because of AI.

            "content": "The growth of data and need for increased power efficiency are leading to innovative storage solutions.\n\nHDDs have been growing in density, but not performance, and TLC flash remains at a price point that is restrictive for scaling.\n\nQLC technology addresses these challenges by forming a middle tier between HDDs and TLC SSDs. QLC provides higher density, improved power efficiency, and better cost than existing TLC SSDs.\n\nToday, HDDs are the go-to storage solution for most data centers because of their lower cost and power footprint compared to other solutions like TLC flash. But while HDDs are growing in size, they haven\u2019t been growing in I/O performance. In other words, the bandwidth per TB for HDDs has been dropping. This has been forcing data center engineers to meet their storage performance needs by shifting hot (frequently accessed) data to a TLC flash tier or by overprovisioning storage.\n\nQLC flash as a technology has been around since 2009. Adoption has been slow because it has historically operated at lower drive capacity points \u2013 less than 32TB. As well, high cost and limited write endurance didn\u2019t make it an attractive alternative to TLC in the datacenter.\n\nIn the meantime, HDD densities have been growing without any significant increase in the throughput. As more data is stored on a given drive the need for I/O goes up proportionally. The continued densification of HDD capacity has led to a consistent decline in BW/TB. This has negatively affected a portion of hot workloads and forced bytes to get stranded on HDDs.\n\nQLC flash occupies a unique space in the performance spectrum in between HDDs and SSDs for servicing workloads that still depend upon performance at 10 MB/s/TB range i.e., where we had 16-20TB HDDs. Additionally there are workloads doing large batch IOs which do not need very high performance but still are in the 15-20 MB/s/TB range and use TLC flash today.\n\nQLC flash introduced as a tier above HDDs can meet write performance requirements with sufficient headroom in endurance specifications. The workloads being targeted are read-bandwidth-intensive with infrequent as well as comparatively low write bandwidth requirements. Since the bulk of power consumption in any NAND flash media comes from writes, we expect our workloads to consume lower power with QLC SSDs.\n\nThe advent of the 2Tb QLC NAND die along with 32-die stack becoming mainstream illustrates just how rapidly the density scaling of QLC flash is growing at a NAND package level as well as at drive level.\n\nWe expect QLC SSD density will scale much higher than TLC SSD density in the near-term and long-term. This will bring meaningful impact to server and rack level bytes densification as well as help lower per-TB acquisition and power costs at both the drive and server level.\n\nQLC at Meta\n\nMeta\u2019s storage teams have started working closely with partners like Pure Storage, utilizing their DirectFlash Module (DFM) and DirectFlash software solution to bring reliable QLC storage to Meta. We are also working with other NAND vendors to integrate standard NVMe QLC SSDs into our data centers.\n\nWhile today QLC is lower in cost than TLC, it is not yet price competitive enough for a broader deployment. Still, the gains in power consumption efficiency are material and the above mentioned use cases are expected to greatly benefit from that. Given that HDDs are continuing to get colder as their density increases (decreasing BW/TB), and that NAND cost structures are improving with technology advancements, we believe that adding a QLC tier is the right path forward.\n\nHardware considerations for adopting QLC\n\nWhile E1.S as a form factor has been great for our TLC deployments, it\u2019s not an ideal form factor to scale our QLC roadmap because its size limits the number of NAND packages per drive.\n\nThe Industry standard U.2-15mm is still a prevalent form factor across SSD suppliers and it enables us to potentially scale to 512TB capacity. E3 doesn\u2019t bring additional value over U.2 at the moment and the market adoption split between the 4 variants of E3 makes it less attractive. Pure Storage\u2019s DFMs can allow scaling up to 600TB with the same NAND package technology. Designing a server to support DFMs allows the drive slot to also accept U.2 drives. This strategy enables us to reap the most benefits in cost competition, schedule acceleration, power efficiency, and vendor diversity.\n\nThe primary benefit of QLC drives is byte density at the drive and server level and the associated power efficiency. Within Meta, the byte density target of the QLC-based server is 6x the densest TLC-based server we ship today. Even though the BW/TB expected of QLC is lower than TLC, the QLC server bytes density requires a more performant CPU, faster memory and network subsystem to take advantage of the media capabilities.\n\nAdapting our storage software for QLC\n\nAdopting Meta\u2019s existing storage software to QLC has presented some interesting challenges. As discussed above, our QLC systems are very high in density. And we are targeting QLC SSDs as a higher performance media compared to HDDs. This raises throughput expectations beyond any single server throughput we ever had.\n\nScaling such high throughput across CPU cores and sockets requires careful placement of data and compute to process that I/O. We need to make sure we minimize data touchpoints and can separate the I/O by type. The software stack in Pure Storage\u2019s solutions uses Linux userspace block device driver (ublk) devices over io_uring to both expose the storage as a regular block device and enable zero copy for data copy elimination \u2013 as well as talk to their userspace FTL (DirectFlash software) in the background.\n\nFor other vendors, the stack uses io_uring to directly interact with the NVMe block device.\n\nFurther, QLC SSDs have a significant delta between read and write throughput. Read throughput in the case of QLC can be as high as 4x or more than write throughput. What\u2019s more, typical use cases around reads are latency sensitive so we need to make sure that the I/O delivering this massive read BW is not getting serialized behind the writes. This requires building, and carefully tuning, rate controllers and I/O schedulers.\n\nLooking forward\n\nMeta recognizes QLC flash\u2019s potential as a viable and promising optimization opportunity for storage cost, performance, and power for data center workloads. As flash suppliers continue to invest in advanced fab processes and package designs and increase the QLC flash production output, we anticipate substantial cost improvements, making QLC flash progressively more attractive for a broader range of data center workloads. We are excited about driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and promoting ecosystem alignment in this evolving storage space.",

            "content": "Main findings\n\nThe current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at gaining a better understanding of whether social media abstinence interventions can promote well-being. To this end, we reviewed and analyzed studies that examined the impact of refraining from social media on positive affect, negative affect, and life satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigated whether and how these three well-being indicators are related to the duration of social media abstinence.\n\nFirst, our study showed that temporarily refraining from social media did not have a significant impact on life satisfaction. As Vanden Abeele et al. [35, p. 4] already argued, it could be that temporary social media abstinences, which were mostly short-lived in the current meta-analysis, are not powerful enough to influence distal well-being outcomes such as one\u2019s overall, aggregated life satisfaction. Instead, it might affect lower-order variables that could over time impact these generalizable well-being outcomes, such as day satisfaction. To the best of our knowledge, however, only Hall et al.16 and Przybylski et al.40 examined the impact of refraining from social media on quality of day and day satisfaction, respectively, and both observed no significant effects. We advocate for future researchers to look into the relationship between social media abstinence and variables that measure well-being at the daily level by using intensive longitudinal designs, which are increasingly put forward as the preferred approach to examine the link between social media use and well-being62.\n\nNevertheless, this meta-analysis found no significant effects on either positive affect or negative affect, which are considered lower-order well-being variables. Concerning negative affect, it is possible that the mean scores for negative affect were already quite low at baseline, leaving more room for an increase in negative affect rather than a further decrease following a social media break. Another potential explanation for both positive and negative affect might be that the benefits and drawbacks of social media abstinence cancel each other out9: while individuals might feel more peaceful and connected to offline relationships after a temporary social media break14,63, they also might experience boredom or feelings of missing out19,24,40,44. However, we did not find any support for the coexistence of both greater positive and greater negative emotions after refraining from social media but rather found no meaningful changes in affect overall. While this observation does not rule out the possibility of a \u2018zero net-sum\u2019, a research design that is more sensitive to momentary experiences of potential ambivalence is recommended.\n\nLastly, the analyses revealed no significant associations between the duration of a social media break and the three outcomes. To date, there is limited research that looks at the relationship between social media abstinence duration and well-being16, making it difficult to provide a clear explanation for this finding. The vast majority of the included studies had a social media abstinence duration of approximately seven days, with only a few studies having considerably shorter (i.e., 1 day)40 or longer (i.e., 14, 21, 28 days)16,30 durations. As Stieger and Lewetz19 already noted, refraining from social media for only seven days is likely not sufficient to influence one\u2019s well-being, which might also be the reason why the results were not significant for life satisfaction. Moreover, a lengthier social media abstinence might also increase the chance of experiencing drawbacks from it19,24,40,44. Hence, the direction of the effect of a longer-term social media abstinence on well-being could go both ways. Nonetheless, due to the limited number of studies examining longer abstinence periods and extended follow-up durations, we are unable to make definitive claims about the role of social media abstinence duration. More studies looking at longer abstinence durations and long-term effects of refraining from social media are therefore required to better grasp whether, how, and why the quantity and the quality of social media abstinence interventions may or may not be related to changes in individual well-being.\n\nImplications for the social media and mental health debate\n\nWhat do these non-significant results now mean for the current debate surrounding social media, digital disconnection, and well-being? Taken together, this study indicates that abstaining from social media might not be the most effective method for individuals wanting to improve their well-being. This is an interesting finding in light of ongoing discussions over the impact of social media use on mental health64,65. An implicit assumption of those who believe this impact to be detrimental is that by abstaining from social media we might reverse its negative effect64. Our meta-analysis, however, suggests that abstaining from social media does not make you feel better; nor does it make you feel worse.\n\nWhile the results of this meta-analysis mark an important point in the examination of the effects of social media disconnection on well-being, they are not conclusive. More research is needed to fully understand the nuanced and complex relationship between social media use and well-being, as well as the potential factors that might influence these outcomes. We recommend that this is best done through longitudinal designs in which person-specific effects are considered, as the impact of social media (dis)connection on well-being may vary significantly between individuals62,66. Ideally, this research considers relevant population characteristics upon which the success of the intervention may be contingent. Researchers might examine, for instance, if having a more negative mindset towards social media67 might result in greater effectiveness of a social media intervention. Similarly, it is important to take into account participants\u2019 intentions and/or motivations for engaging in social media abstinence studies, and whether participating in exchange for course credit or a (financial) incentive is truly voluntary35,38,40. It is possible that the effects of a researcher-imposed social media abstinence intervention may not fully align with those of a self-imposed social media break and thus may be influenced by individual motivations35,40. Lastly, research ideally operationalizes the specific harm mechanisms assumed to be tackled by the intervention; for instance, by measuring daily time expenditure (to examine displacement effects) and daily occurrences of negative upward social comparison.\n\nLimitations of the included studies and recommendations for future research\n\nIn reviewing the ten studies that were included in this study, we made several important observations that should be taken into account when evaluating our study findings. First, the sample of the included studies often contained a rather small number of participants. The majority of the studies also did not conduct a power analysis to determine the adequacy of their sample sizes. The statistical power for life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect in this meta-analysis is visualized in a firepower plot (see Fig. A9 in Supplementary Material), showing that all three outcomes yielded a very similar pattern, indicating low statistical power. It is possible that the studies included in this meta-analysis were underpowered to reliably detect small effects. Future studies should consider higher sample sizes to achieve the required sensitivity for measuring effects of social media abstinence.\n\nFurthermore, the studies that were included in our meta-analysis were mostly conducted in Western countries and among students. As a result, we cannot generalize the findings of this study to other demographic regions and age groups. We therefore suggest that researchers examine the impact of social media abstinences on well-being among non- \u201cWEIRD\u201d samples (i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic samples)68, as well as in different age groups (e.g., teenagers, elderly).\n\nSeveral studies also did not specify which applications were considered social media applications and whether instant messaging applications were included in this definition. We advise future researchers to clearly define which applications are seen as social media. It could also be valuable to distinguish between \u201cpure\u201d social media applications and instant messaging applications when studying the impact of social media abstinence on individual well-being [e.g.,49], as the effects of their use may differ across these platforms.\n\nMoreover, none of the studies blinded their participants, potentially leading to demand effects, where participants alter their responses based on their awareness of the study\u2019s purpose69. We acknowledge that blinding participants in a social media abstinence intervention, where the participants are involved in the intervention, is not feasible. Yet, we think that future researchers could try to address this issue by, for example, objectively measuring the outcomes, using log data or physiological data70, and perhaps also by deceiving participants about the true purpose of the study. A few studies also suffered from low compliance and only a limited number of studies in our sample objectively measured compliance rates. We therefore recommend that future researchers prioritize using objective methods to assess compliance, rather than relying solely on self-reported data. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that, although the included researcher-imposed social media abstinence studies offer valuable insights, they may not fully capture the dynamics of voluntary digital detoxes. As such, it is essential to consider the role of intentions and motivations when examining the effectiveness of social media abstinence interventions.\n\nLimitations of the current study\n\nThe current systematic review and meta-analysis is not without limitations. To begin with, the number of studies exploring the effects of abstaining from social media on affective well-being and/or life satisfaction was limited. As a consequence, we could not conduct any subgroup analyses because of the few included studies in our meta-analysis. Moreover, there was high heterogeneity between the studies, which was also observed in the meta-analysis of Ferguson23. In the current meta-analysis, the studies differed greatly in terms of the duration of the social media abstinence and the social media platforms and devices the participants were asked to abstain from. There was also some variation in the measurement of the outcome variables. Although most studies used the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule42 to assess negative affect, there were few studies that used different measures for negative affect, including loneliness16 and depression43. This should be carefully considered when interpreting the results of this study.\n\nRegardless of these limitations, our systematic review and meta-analysis advance the field of digital disconnection by improving knowledge of the effectiveness of social media abstinence interventions. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that social media abstinence does not impact individual well-being. Temporarily abstaining from social media may therefore not be the most effective disconnection method for improving one\u2019s mental health. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore that public opinion continues to worry about smartphone and social media use and well-being. This underscores the importance of additional research into more nuanced disconnection strategies, such as reducing social media usage using device settings and/or applications71. These kinds of strategies could offer a more feasible and sustainable solution and might assist individuals better in their pursuit of digital well-being, attempting to find a balance between connection and disconnection in a manner that allows them to maximize the benefits of digital media while minimizing its drawbacks9. Living in a society that revolves around smartphones and social media applications, mastering this juggling exercise between connecting and disconnecting from smartphones and the associated social media applications will become ever more important. Therefore, we argue that more research on the effectiveness of other disconnection interventions is needed to better support people in maintaining a healthy relationship with these devices, which is essential given that the \u201csmartphone is and will remain people\u2019s daily companion\u201d [21, p. 208].",

Business AI is part of an invite-only pilot program, which was originally tested with a select group of advertisers but is now available for any business to apply to be invited.\n\nBusiness AI is intended primarily for small and midsize organizations that lack the infrastructure to offer immediate customer support or program a dedicated chatbot.\n\nThe tool sits atop a brand\u2019s existing social media presence on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, where it can provide real-time answers to customer questions over direct messages.\n\nHead of Business AI Clara Shih told reporters at a press event in New York, \u201cIt\u2019s really about delivering that 24-seven personalized service that every consumer, every person, wants from the businesses.\u201d\n\nAcclimating to AI\n\nBusiness AI reportedly trains itself on existing brand-uploaded content across Meta\u2019s platforms, as well as whatever else the business is able to provide from its own knowledge base \u2013 even uploaded pictures of handwritten material, Shih said.\n\nTheir team has also been working with new-to-Meta brands to develop a guide for how much baseline content the AI needs to operate effectively right out of the gate.\n\nOnce the AI has all the data it needs, account managers can choose what kinds of functions the agent is permitted to perform, including sharing business information, recommending products and gathering customer data. It can even handle purchases, shipping or returns directly through the existing shop ads framework.\n\nIf the AI doesn\u2019t know the answer to a question or isn\u2019t permitted to handle a particular task, it will redirect the customer to a human member of the brand\u2019s support team to take over.\n\nSo far, said Shih, most businesses have been slow to open the AI up to autonomous functions as they start to acclimate themselves to the tool, mostly starting with answering easy questions about shop hours and product costs.\n\nThe concierge treatment\n\nSo far this all sounds a bit like a beefed-up version of Instagram\u2019s existing auto reply feature, which business owners can turn on to answer up to four frequently asked questions in one go.\n\nAccording to Shih, however, Business AI\u2019s underlying LLM structure allows it to better interpret oddly worded or incomplete sentences with more natural-sounding responses, even if it\u2019s explicitly limited in what kinds of information it can communicate to customers.\n\nPilot program aside, Meta already has big plans for Business AI\u2019s future development, including a voice-activated chat function that will directly answer spoken questions and even complete purchases \u00e0 la Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant. The thinking, Shih said, is that busy, multitasking users will be less likely to abandon a cart before completing their transaction if the AI is able to assist them in the moment.\n\nUltimately, the goal is for Business AI to develop a rapport with returning customers, approximating the kind of white-glove, concierge service associated with luxury retailers.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the potential resell and upsell opportunities that come with maintaining a conversation with customers. If someone\u2019s already cool with ordering a necklace through an AI agent on WhatsApp, what could recommending a matching pair of earrings hurt?",

            "content": "Moreover, Eagle Capital Management follows a value-oriented investment strategy with a long-term perspective, assessing price in relation to intrinsic value rather than relying solely on traditional valuation metrics like price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios. The firm\u2019s investment team focuses on long-term prospects, particularly beyond five years, analyzing business growth, industry dynamics, and margin potential while identifying opportunities that the broader market may overlook. A key component of Eagle\u2019s strategy is maintaining a \u201cMargin of Safety,\u201d achieved through valuation discounts, business resilience, growth potential, and strong, experienced leadership.\n\nEagle Capital Management adheres to a disciplined investment philosophy centered on identifying undervalued companies with unrecognized long-term growth potential. The firm employs a fundamental, bottom-up research approach, focusing on the key drivers of long-term value creation. By maintaining an extended investment horizon, Eagle Capital is able to take a distinctive perspective on industry and company trends. The firm\u2019s investment strategy prioritizes businesses with two essential characteristics: strong underlying assets capable of generating cash flow and sustaining value even in challenging market conditions, and transformative changes within the company that remain unrecognized by the broader market yet are likely to drive future growth. This approach aims to provide downside protection during market downturns while positioning the portfolio for enhanced returns as these changes materialize. These core principles have been integral to Eagle Capital\u2019s strategy since its founding, forming the foundation of its competitive advantage and contributing to its consistent market outperformance since 1988.\n\nEagle Capital Management , a New York-based hedge fund, was founded in 1988 by Beth and Ravenel Curry. Their son, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, joined the firm around the early 2000s after managing a portfolio at Kingdon Capital and is currently a key partner. A Yale University graduate with an Economics degree and an MBA from Harvard Business School, he plays a pivotal role in the firm\u2019s strategy. Historically, Eagle has outperformed major benchmarks, including the broader market and the Russell Value Index. Over five years, Eagle delivered a 5.7% return versus the market's 2.4%, and since its inception, it has generated a cumulative return of 2,031%, significantly surpassing both indices.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Eagle Capital Management . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe firm concentrates its portfolio on high-conviction investments, typically holding 25-35 stocks. As of Q4 2024, it holds over $27.4 billion in 13F securities, and its top ten positions account for 57.62% of its portfolio. This approach allows Eagle to focus on asymmetric risk opportunities, ensuring that its top positions offer significant upside potential while maintaining strong downside protection. Adopting a private equity-style approach to public equity investing, Eagle builds positions in high-quality businesses with sustainable returns and durability.

            "content": "Last October, Meta dipped its toe into the world of facial recognition with an international test of two new tools: one to stop scams based on likenesses of famous people, and a second feature to help people get back into compromised Facebook or Instagram accounts. Now that test is expanding to one more notable country.\n\nAfter initially keeping its facial-recognition test off in the United Kingdom, Meta on Wednesday began to roll both of the tools there, too. In other countries where the tools have already launched, the \u201cceleb bait\u201d protection is being extended to more people, the company said. It will also roll out the test across the European Union.\n\nMeta said it got the green light in the U.K. \u201cafter engaging with regulators\u201d in the country, which itself has doubled down on embracing AI.\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, public figures in the U.K. will start seeing in-app notifications letting them know they can now opt-in to receive the celeb-bait protection with facial recognition technology,\u201d Meta said in a statement. Both this and the new \u201cvideo selfie verification\u201d for all users will be optional tools, Meta said.\n\nMeta has a long history of tapping user data to train its algorithms, but when it first rolled out the two new facial-recognition tests in October 2024, the company said the features were not being used for anything other than the purposes described: fighting scam ads and user verification.\n\n\u201cWe immediately delete any facial data generated from ads for this one-time comparison regardless of whether our system finds a match, and we don\u2019t use it for any other purpose,\u201d wrote Monika Bickert, Meta\u2019s VP of content policy, in a blog post.\n\nThe developments come at a time when Meta is betting the barn on AI.\n\nIn addition to building large language models and using AI across its products, Meta is also reportedly working on a stand-alone AI app. It has also stepped up lobbying efforts around the technology and given its two cents on what it deems to be risky AI applications \u2014 such as those that can be weaponized (the implication being that what Meta builds is not risky!).\n\nGiven Meta\u2019s track record, a move to build tools that fix immediate issues on its apps is probably the best approach to gaining acceptance of any new facial-recognition features \u2014 an area where it has had a tricky track record.\n\nThis test fits that bill: As we\u2019ve said before, Meta has been accused for many years of failing to stop scammers from misappropriating famous people\u2019s faces to spin up ad scams like dubious crypto investments.\n\nFacial recognition has been one of the thornier areas for Meta over the years. Most recently, the company in 2024 agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle a long-running lawsuit that alleged inappropriate biometric data collection related to its facial-recognition technology.\n\nBefore that, Facebook in 2021 shut down its decade-old facial-recognition tool for photos, which had faced multiple regulatory and legal problems across several jurisdictions. Interestingly, at the time the company chose to retain one part of the technology \u2014 the DeepFace model \u2014 saying it would incorporate it into future technology. That could well be part of what is being built on with today\u2019s products.\n\nUpdated to note that the test will run in the EU, too.",

            "content": "Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been a volatile stock over the years, and it still sports a beta of 1.20, according to Yahoo Finance. This means that on average, the stock is 20% more volatile than the overall market. But usually, volatility means a stock moves up and down. This has not been the case recently with Meta\u2019s stock, which posted an incredible run of 20 straight trading days in the green.\n\nExplore More: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire \u2014 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\n\nTry This: 5 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nBut as an investor, is it a good time to buy at stock after it has gone straight up? Is it worse after it breaks that streak? And what about Meta in particular makes it a good or bad investment? Read on to learn more.\n\nHow Much Did Meta Gain During Its Run?\n\nMeta Platforms closed at $611.30 per share on Jan. 16. Its 20-day rally pushed it up every single trading day through Feb. 14, when it closed at $736.67. Over those roughly four weeks, the stock gained 20.5%.\n\nFor You: Suze Orman \u2014 3 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make as an Investor\n\nWhat Does It Mean That Meta Broke Its Streak?\n\nOn Feb. 18, Meta closed at $716.37, a loss of 2.75%. But that was just the beginning of the profit-taking. The stock continued to decline for numerous sessions in the following week, closing at $658.24 on Feb. 27. That closing price marked a 10.6% decline from the stock\u2019s Feb. 14 peak. However, it still remained about 7.7% above its Jan. 16 close, when it began its record streak.\n\nShould You Buy Stocks That Keep Going Up?\n\nThe decision on when to sell a stock is one of the most difficult for investors to make. On the one hand, momentum tends to breed momentum. When stocks go up, investors fearful of missing out on gains tend to jump in. This can continue to push a stock\u2019s price higher, even beyond what may seem to be rational levels. This is part of the reason why Meta was able to gain for 20 days in a row.\n\nBut trees don\u2019t grow straight to the sky, and no stock goes up every single day in perpetuity. Even Meta gave back more than half of its gains in the ensuing few trading sessions, as the stock\u2019s short-term trend reversed course and investors began taking profits.\n\nNow That Meta Has Sold Off, Is It Time To Buy?\n\nOne of the paths to long-term riches in the stock market is to \u201cbuy low and sell high.\u201d In other words, if you\u2019re a long-term believer in Meta, buying it after its recent 10% decline gives you a better entry point than when it peaked on Feb. 14. And the same factors that drove Meta on its multi-week rally still remain.\n\nIn addition to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg cozying up with the current presidential administration, the stock rallied in large part due to Meta\u2019s aggressive investment into AI infrastructure \u2013 $65 billion in 2025 alone, to be exact. With AI being the buzzword dominating all technology these days, this seems like a prudent bet going forward. Coupled with the company topping Wall Street\u2019s earning expectations in its most recent quarter and Meta still seems to have the wind at its back.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Say About Buying Meta?\n\nWall Street analysts tend to have 12-month price targets, meaning they look a bit longer term than a 20-day trading session. Ultimately, earnings drive stock prices, and part of the job of being a good analyst is to sort through any short-term noise or market movements to project company earnings and growth rates over the intermediate-to-long term.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, analysts remain firmly bullish on shares of Meta. They hold a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating on the stock, with 44 out of 48 analysts following the company holding a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. The average 12-month price target among these analysts is $764.61. That suggests a gain of about 16% from current levels.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 2 Reasons Meta Stock Broke Its Winning Streak: Should You Still Invest?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

His company has overhauled policies, cut thousands of employees, and prepared to launch its own form of fact-checking posts to its platforms \u2014 and it's only March. All the while, Zuck said he's examining the role of \"masculine energy\" in corporate culture.\n\nDuring an appearance on the\"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, he said an environment that \"celebrates the aggression\" of masculinity has \"really positive\" merits.\n\nWith a new president in the White House and the AI arms race in full swing amid DeepSeek mania, Zuckerberg has kept busy.\n\nReferring to Meta's January as \"a rather frenzied start,\" Forrester VP and research director Mike Proulx said that the company's past \"year of efficiency\" was being \"trumped in 2025 with an apparent year of 'intensity.'\"\n\n\"Everyone always says that every year is a big year, right?\" Zuckerberg said during the all-hands meeting.\n\n\"When I look at the kind of long-term trajectory for the stuff that we're doing this year, I think by the end of this year we're going to have a much clearer sense of the trajectory of a lot of the long-term things that we're doing, whether that's AI or glasses, or a number of areas around the future of social media, a number of key partnerships that we're working on,\" the Meta CEO said.\n\n\"This year feels a little more like a sprint to me,\" he added.\n\nNew year, new policies that will impact your News Feed\n\nIf 2025 represents a sprint for Meta, the first leg of the race saw some of its biggest changes in years.\n\nThe most impactful for Meta's billions of users was announced on January 7, when Zuckerberg messaged that Meta's content moderation policy would be overhauled.\n\nIn a controversial decision, Meta said that it would sunset its third-party fact-checking in favor of community notes, similar to that of Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAs of February, it's giving users a chance to try the new notes to \"add more context\" to posts that could be \"misleading,\" Meta said on its site. Users will be able to join a waitlist to try out the new feature. Zuckerberg previously said he thinks a community notes model \"is just going to be more effective.\"\n\nThe company also loosened its hate speech policies and announced that it would return to promoting political discussions in its apps.\n\nMeta's moves coincided with the temporary TikTok ban that went into effect on January 19. It left some users expressing their uncertainty on which platforms they should use. LGTBQ+ people who said they were looking for a sense of community and safety called out the company's decisions.\n\n\"This is the most anti-LGBTQ announcement that a social-media platform has made in recent memory,\" Josh Helfgott, an LGBTQ+ advocate and content creator, told BI in January.\n\nThe policy changes may not move the needle much on the ad dollars spent on Meta's platforms as its size alone makes it a \"must-have\" for advertisers, Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali told BI.\n\n\"Large advertisers will tell you that. Small advertisers will tell you that,\" the analyst said. \"So there's scarcity value for advertisers and their ability to access some of these platforms that actually work for them.\"\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li said in the January 29 earnings call that the company hadn't observed a noticeable difference in ad spending in the weeks following the announcement. When reached for comment, Meta referred BI to Zuckerberg's video and its blog post on the content moderation changes.\n\nCollectively, Meta's policy overhaul means big changes are coming to your Instagram, Threads, and Facebook news feeds.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAd testing on Threads begins\n\nMeta's slew of January moves continued with its attempt to generate revenue for Threads, the platform created to compete with Elon Musk's X.\n\nThreads launched in 2023, and Meta said January 24 that it'd begin testing advertisements to small groups of users in the US and Japan in an attempt to monetize the site for the first time.\n\n\"We'll closely monitor this test before scaling it more broadly, with the goal of getting ads on Threads to a place where they are as interesting as organic content,\" Adam Mosseri , who leads Instagram and Threads, posted the day of the ad announcement.\n\nMeta maneuvers closer to Trump\n\nMark Zuckerberg was part of the tech broligarchy at President Trump's inauguration. Rebecca Noble/Getty Images; AP Photo/Mark Lennihan; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI\n\nThe content moderation policy overhaul is one of a slew of recent changes at Meta widely viewed as a way to appease President Trump, who frequently criticized and even threatened the company and its chief executive in the past.\n\nTrump told reporters the content moderation changes were \"probably\" in response to threats he's made to Meta.\n\nFollowing a dinner with the president at Mar-a-Lago and Meta's $1 million donation to his inauguration fund, Zuckerberg was one of a handful of tech execs seated close to Trump during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20.\n\n\"Having Trump coming back into office \u2014 and we all know Trump's position with regards to Meta and Zuck, in particular \u2014 I feel there was a lot of pressure for him to revisit his stance,\" Truist Securities' Squali told BI of the content moderation changes.\n\nMeta's chief marketing officer, Alex Schultz, previously told BI that Trump's election win, coupled with shifting \"vibes in America,\" were factors in the content moderation overhaul.\n\nOther big changes include the company rolling back its programs for DEI. Diversity programs have been a frequent target for Trump and other conservative activist groups.\n\nIn the recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said 2025 would be \"a big year for redefining our relationship with governments.\" He added that he's \"optimistic\" about the Trump administration, saying it \"prioritizes American technology winning\" and \"will defend our values and interests abroad.\"\n\nMeta also made some personnel changes that could help it better navigate the next four years.\n\nAhead of the administration change, Meta named Joel Kaplan its new chief global affairs officer. Kaplan, a former adviser to George W. Bush and a longtime Republican lobbyist for Meta, replaced Nick Clegg, former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, in the position.\n\nMeta also added several new names to its board of directors, specifically tech investor Charlie Songhurst, Exor CEO John Elkann, and UFC chief Dana White. Zuckerberg, an MMA hobbyist, has been photographed with White, a longtime friend of Trump, multiple times in recent years.\n\nAnd in a recent move to end a legal battle involving Trump, Meta also agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit the president brought against it and Zuckerberg after Facebook suspended his account in 2021 following the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nCutting the 'low performers' and doubling down on AI\n\nMeta's work to reshape its workforce, which began in late 2022, shows no signs of slowing down as it races to keep up with AI pioneer OpenAI and newcomers like Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.\n\nIt began the planned reduction to its workforce in February. In a memo obtained in January by BI, Meta announced layoffs coming for 5% of its workforce, targeting its \"lowest performers.\"\n\nThose who lost their jobs pushed back on the \"low performer\" label, telling BI that they'd received positive performance ratings during their 2024 reviews.\n\nHowever, discussing its quarterly earnings on January 29, Meta said it plans to hire in \"the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\"\n\nMeta's AI Studio is one of several ways it's trying to engage users with its AI products. Courtesy of Meta\n\nThe company expects to spend $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year as it barrels full-steam ahead on AI, a significant increase from $39.23 billion in 2024, which already raised eyebrows among investors and analysts.\n\nZuckerberg said during the earnings call he thinks 2025 will be the year an AI assistant hits 1 billion users, and naturally he wants that of Meta AI. He also teased upcoming news about its Llama 4 AI model and hinted at getting back to \"some OG Facebook\" this year.\n\nResponding to Wall Street analysts' questions about DeepSeek, Zuckerberg said it was important for a US firm to set the standard on open-source AI \"for our own national advantage.\"\n\n\"I think that, if anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing for us to be focused on,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn audio from one of Meta's all-hands meetings, Meta CFO Susan Li said the company is \"excited for the roadmap\" this year and for AI initiatives \"driving further momentum\" that would \"fuel 2025 growth.\"\n\nDo you work at Meta?

            "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Meta Platforms\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Meta Platforms is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $914.61, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Meta Platforms\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Meta Platforms look like?\n\nNasdaqGS:META Earnings and Revenue Growth March 3rd 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Meta Platforms. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since META is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on META for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy META. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence leaders and researchers convened at Duke for a four-day symposium on responsible AI, placing discussions of AI ethics, alignment and labor market impacts in the limelight.\n\nAmong the symposium\u2019s lineup of speakers Monday were Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and Ronnie Chatterji, inaugural chief economist of OpenAI and Mark Burgess & Lisa Benson-Burgess distinguished professor of business and public policy.\n\nThe event, co-sponsored by the Society-Centered AI Initiative and other programs across health, engineering and sustainability, featured over 10 talks ranging academic disciplines and a Society-Centered AI Hackathon.\n\nYann LeCun\n\nAfter receiving the symposium\u2019s inaugural Society-Centered AI Distinguished Lecturer Award, LeCun shared his perspective on the state of artificial intelligence and where new development should be directed.\n\n\u201cFirst, what I want to say is that regardless of what your interest in AI is, at some point, we're going to need human-level AI systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're going to assist us in our daily lives [and] be with us at all times.\u201d\n\nLeCun said he envisions a future where people can interact with AI similarly to how they interact with other humans. Still, he noted that there\u2019s a challenge getting to that future.\n\n\u201cMachine learning sucks \u2026 in terms of sample efficiency, in terms of being able to acquire new skills quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cMachine learning is nowhere near the kind of capabilities that we observe, not just in humans, but in most animals.\u201d\n\nHe added that researchers \u201chave no idea\u201d how to develop machines that function with comparable efficiency to humans, noting that large language models (LLMs) \u201cspend the exact same amount of computation for every word or every token\u201d that they produce. So where should researchers look for solutions to these problems? They should not look to training AI using videos instead of text, according to LeCun. Even though he believes that humanlike AI is not attainable when models are only trained to respond probabilistically with text data, training AI to understand and predict videos at the pixel level \u201cjust doesn't work.\u201d Instead, LeCun believes researchers should learn from babies and develop AI with the ability to observe and sense.\n\nHe recommended that researchers aiming to develop better models \u201cforget about generative AI\u201d and opt instead for joint-embedding predictive architecture. This method involves training AI models to understand and predict \u201crepresentations,\u201d or simplified states of the world. Models are trained to ignore irrelevant and unpredictable details and focus on how a given representation of the world will change if a specific action is taken.\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of making AI technology open source so that researchers outside of leading nations and corporations can advance the technology, advocating for a diversified \u201cinformation diet.\u201d\n\nRonnie Chatterji\n\nChatterji outlined his journey from joining the Fuqua School of Business faculty in 2006 to gaining tenure in 2014, where he cultivated his interest in the economics of innovation, entrepreneurship and technology.\n\nIn 2010, Chatterji joined the White House as a senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisers. In 2021, he began serving as the Department of Commerce\u2019s chief economist in the Biden administration.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic induced global supply chain shortages, Chatterji spoke of his realization that the United States\u2019 dependence on Taiwan to manufacture semiconductors posed national security concerns. In response, he oversaw the implementation of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which invested $280 billion in scientific research and manufacturing, including $52 billion in subsidies for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThis experience alerted Chatterji to the importance of investment in AI and other \u201cdeep technology\u201d that require long-term infrastructure investments to cultivate major breakthroughs.\n\nNarrowing the discussion to AI\u2019s potential labor market impact, Chatterji shared a wide range of forecasts by \u201ccredible economists\u201d about annual AI-driven productivity growth in the U.S. economy, with estimates ranging from 0.06% to between 7% and 18%. To Chatterji, these values reflect significant but divergent estimates about the impact of AI.\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Sign up for our weekly newsletter. Cancel at any time. Email Address\n\nThis is consistent with a trend in \u201ctechnological history,\u201d where there is \u201cdivergence before convergence\u201d in predictions about emerging technologies, he added. For AI, Chatterji believes this divergence is rooted in competing views of LLMs either as a \u201chelpful editor and summarizer\u201d or agents that can \u201cbuild and scale.\u201d He added that adoption of new technologies \u2014 and subsequent productivity gains \u2014 differs by geography and industry.\n\n\u201cThis is, to me, the one blind spot for a lot of people who are thinking purely in technological terms,\u201d Chatterji said. \u201cThey completely underestimate, often, how long it takes organizations to change and how resistant people in organizations are to change.\u201d\n\nAs evidence of AI\u2019s uniquely rapid growth, he shared that modern AI systems are surpassing performance benchmarks at an increasing rate. Chatterji pointed out that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT had over 100 million users within two months of its launch, a pace of adoption he described as \u201cpretty amazing\u201d and lacking precedent.\n\nHe also conveyed enthusiasm about AI use in education, explaining that AI tools can complement teachers by offering \u201cdifferent ways of learning the same concept\u201d and \u201ctailoring\u201d teaching methods to specific students.\n\nAccording to Chatterji, the OpenAI economic research team\u2019s current work includes engaging with the research community and creating an \u201cinnovative AI tool that enhances qualitative survey responses,\u201d in addition to measuring the impact of AI within a statewide higher education system, a multinational corporation and a small country.\n\nMichael Austin | Managing Editor Michael Austin is a Trinity junior and managing editor of The Chronicle's 120th volume.",

            "content": "The Data Center revenues came in at $35.58 billion compared with the consensus estimate of $33.51 billion, marking a jump of 93% year over year. Within this segment, Computing revenues were $$32.56 billion versus the consensus mark of $30.22 billion. Networking revenues were $3.02 billion versus the consensus estimate of $3.35 billion.\n\nDespite this stellar performance, a section of financial researchers is complaining about slowing growth. NVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin of 73.5% reflects a contraction of 3.2% on a year-over-year basis and 1.5% sequentially. This was primarily due to a transition to more complex and higher-cost systems within the Data Center segment.\n\nNVIDIA came up with quarterly adjusted earnings of $0.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.52 per share a year ago. Reported quarterly revenues of $39.33 billion compare to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.72 billion, representing a surprise of +4.3%.\n\nIrrespective of these drawbacks, NVIDIA has been able to keep the flag high with its path-breaking vision, innovation and solid execution. The recent decline in stock price has actually placed NVDA in negative territory year to date. We believe that, at this stage, NVIDIA offers a lucrative buying opportunity for the rest of 2025.\n\nYet, the stock price of NVDA plummeted 8.5% on Feb. 27 on concerns of a minor miss in adjusted gross margin and slowing growth of year-over-year revenues and earnings as we have seen in the last several quarters. Concerns about a possible tariff on NVIDIA\u2019s inputs and export restrictions also dampened investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nOn Feb. 26, after the closing bell, NVIDIA Corp. \u2014 the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) \u2014 released outstanding fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results and strong guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2026.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 3, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corp. NVDA Meta Platforms Inc. META, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Crop. MSFT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost importantly, NVDA has mostly resolved the supply-related issues of its next-generation Blackwell chips and ramped up its production and shipment. In the reported quarter, the company sold $11 billion Blackwell chips, higher than the consensus estimate of $6-7 billion.\n\nStrong Guidance\n\nNVIDIA expects an impressive first quarter fiscal 2026 buoyed by rock-solid demand for its AI-powered GPUs, and downplayed the Chinese DeepSeek-related availability of low-cost solution concerns. NVDA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said that the next-generation AI model requires more computing power. Per Huang, \u201cThe amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do.\u201d\n\nNVDA anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%), higher than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.06 billion. The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 71% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3.6 billion.\n\nThe consensus mark for non-GAAP gross margin is 72.1%. Nevertheless, an adjusted gross margin of more than 70% for a company that is the leader of a highly competitive high-end industry is something commendable.\n\nNVDA\u2019s Growth to Generate From Robust AI Spending\n\nThe AI frenzy will continue with astonishing spending. The four major data center operators \u2014 Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Crop. and Amazon.com Inc. pledged $325 billion as AI expenditure in 2025.\n\nOn Jan 21, President Donald Trump unveiled a joint venture called \u201cStargate\u201d with OpenAI, Oracleand Softbank. The project will create an AI infrastructure, especially data centers in the United States.\n\nThe initial investment of $100 billion can go up to $500 billion in the next four years. This expenditure will be in addition to Softbank\u2019s pledge of $100 billion in December to create AI infrastructure in the United States.\n\nApple has decided to invest $500 billion over the next four years, part of which will be spent on developing and manufacturing AI servers to power its Apple Intelligence AI tools. Moreover, Meta Platforms is reportedly planning to construct a new data center campus for its AI projects, with potential costs exceeding $200 billion.\n\nContinuous Innovations\n\nFor all the above-mentioned companies, NVIDIA is the largest chipset supplier. In addition to Blackwell, on June 2, 2024, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called Rubin. The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called Vera. Rubin is expected to be introduced in 2026.\n\nThe automotive industry may become another growth driver for NVIDIA in the future. In the last reported quarter, Automation segment revenues came in at $570 million compared with the consensus estimate of $472.35 million, up 102.9% year over year. The Automation segment\u2019s growth was primarily driven by NVDA\u2019s self-driving platforms. The company is increasingly focusing on powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.\n\nExcellent Estimate Revisions for NVDA Stock\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 45% and 41.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% in the last seven days.\n\nIt has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.7% and 25.5%, respectively, for next year (ending January 2027). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.4% in the last seven days. NVDA has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 20%, outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 12.2% growth rate.\n\nLucrative Valuation of NVDA Shares\n\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has a return on equity (ROE) of 122.83% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s ROE of 17.1% and the industry\u2019s ROE of a mere 6.4%.\n\nNVDA has a current net margin of 55.85% compared with the industry\u2019s net margin of 8.4% and the S&P 500\u2019s net margin of 12.57%. It has forward P/E (price/earnings) of 31.14% compared with the industry\u2019s P/E of 31.01% and the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 18.9%.\n\nAs of Jan. 26, 2025, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $43.2 billion, up from $38.4 billion as of Oct. 27, 2024. The increases primarily reflect higher revenues partially offset by stock repurchases. As of Jan. 26, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, which remained unchanged sequentially. NVIDIA generated $16.6 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $11.5 billion\n\nThe short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 35% from the last closing price of $120.15. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $220-$135. This indicates a maximum upside of 83.3% and no downside.\n\nInvestment Thesis for NVDA\n\nShares of NVDA have seen a growth rate of -10.5% year to date. However, given that earnings estimate revisions are likely to trend higher in the coming weeks, many analysts are expected to raise their price targets. This will make NVDA\u2019s risk/reward ratio more favorable.\n\nNVIDIA represents a rare opportunity to invest in a company with proven execution and substantial unrealized potential in the AI revolution. At this stage, it will be prudent to buy this stock on every dip. Create a systematic investment plan for this stock to do a cost average.\n\nHold this stock for the long term as the company\u2019s strong execution of the last several quarters and robust future projections will generate more value. Consequently, the stock price of NVIDIA should witness an attractive upside.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Meta researchers built a \"large reconstruction model (LRM)\" that can generate an animatable photorealistic avatar head in minutes from just four selfies.\n\nMeta has been researching photorealistic avatar generation and animation for more than six years now, and its highest-quality version even crosses the uncanny valley, in our experience.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for photorealistic avatars to date has been the amount of data and time needed to generate them. Meta's highest-quality system requires a very expensive specialized capture rig with over 100 cameras. The company has shown research on generating lower quality avatars with a smartphone scan, but this required making 65 facial expressions over the course of more than three minutes, and the data captured took multiple hours to process on a machine with four high end GPUs.\n\nNow, in a new paper called Avat3r, researchers from Meta and Technical University of Munich are presenting a system that can generate an animatable photorealistic avatar head from just four phone selfies, and the processing takes a matter of minutes, not hours.\n\n0:00 / 0:39 1\u00d7\n\nOn a technical level, Avat3r builds on the concept of a large reconstruction model (LRM), leveraging a transformer for 3D visual tasks in the same sense that large language models (LLMs) do for natural language. This is often called a vision transformer, or ViT. This vision transformer is used to predict a set of 3D Gaussians, akin to the Gaussian splatting you may have heard about in the context of photorealistic scenes such as Varjo Teleport, Meta's Horizon Hyperscapes, Gracia, and Niantic's Scaniverse.\n\nThe specific implementation of Avat3r's animation system isn't driven by a VR headset's face and eye tracking sensors, but there's no reason it couldn't be adapted to leverage this as the input.\n\n0:00 / 0:41 1\u00d7\n\nHowever, while Avat3r's data and compute requirements for generation are remarkably low, it's nowhere near suitable for real-time rendering. According to the researchers, the end result system runs at just 8 FPS on an RTX 3090. Still, in AI it's common to see subsequent iterations of new ideas achieve orders of magnitude optimizations, and Avat3r's approach shows a promising path to one day, eventually, letting headset owners set up a photorealistic avatar with a few selfies and minutes of generation time.",

            "content": "[By Ravi Nayyar]\n\nAnnounced on 14 February, Meta\u2019s Project Waterworth is not just proposed to be the world\u2019s longest submarine cable but reflects ever-shifting geopolitical and geoeconomic landscapes. It presents a great opportunity for Australia to collaborate more with its regional partners, especially India and the Pacific countries, on technologies keeping us online.\n\nFor Meta, this addition to subsea infrastructure is slated to open a chance to monetize accelerating international data flows. In developing and running this cable, Meta also seeks to prioritise its own traffic and minimise latency for its and its partners\u2019 infrastructure and services. No surprises there.\n\nBut what is different this time is the clear recognition of intense geostrategic competition featuring both state and non-state actors. Connecting five continents, the proposed route, longer than the circumference of the planet, avoids areas subject to malign influence or control, such as the Baltic, Red and South China seas. Meta plans to lay as much of the cable as possible in deep water, making it harder for malicious actors to spy on or sabotage it.\n\nPerhaps an even bigger takeaway is Meta\u2019s choice of locations for cable landing points: the coastlines of three BRICS countries (India, South Africa and Brazil) and three Quad countries (India, Australia and the United States). With India being in both groupings, the route particularly reflects India\u2019s rise as a digital, geopolitical and economic power. Meta has specifically said the cable will support India\u2019s continued rise in the digital realm. With the world\u2019s largest population, India is both a massive source of data to train Meta\u2019s AI products and an emerging hub for data centres.\n\nMore broadly, Meta is seeking to be a bigger player in the submarine cable industry, and thus in geopolitics, competing with fellow US hyperscalers Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Indeed, those three companies and Meta represent about three quarters of active submarine cable capacity worldwide. Meta seeks to go one better by, as it said, \u2018opening three new oceanic corridors\u2019 with Project Waterworth.\n\nMeta knows how the geostrategic significance of submarine cables is causing the technology\u2019s politicisation, reflecting an ongoing split between the anti-China and pro-China camps in telecommunications amid the larger Sino-US technological rivalry.\n\nAs a US technology company, Meta arguably seeks to reinforce its value as a member of the anti-China camp, alongside Google, Microsoft and Amazon. It would see Project Waterworth as a downpayment on support from Western and partner governments (such as finance, easier regulatory approvals and oversight, and more robust diplomatic and operational support) to help counter Chinese influence in digital infrastructure, especially in the Global South.\n\nIn this context, Meta must beware cyber supply-chain risks that can arise from its and its operating partners using: Chinese equipment at any point in the technology stack; and unvetted remote access applications, managed security service providers and managed network service providers.\n\nRising cyber threats around telecommunications infrastructure underline the importance of such cyber supply chain risk management. In 2022, cybercriminals attacked the servers of the operator of a submarine cable that connected Hawaii with the Pacific. Chinese state-sponsored hackers have compromised US terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure for espionage and pre-positioning malicious capabilities to be deployed during a major security crisis (such as a Taiwan contingency).\n\nIndeed, such are the risks to submarine cables that the US Federal Communications Commission has proposed reforms to its regulatory regime. These changes relate to: cyber risk management by operators; banning certain hardware or software from regulated cables and their infrastructure; risks from remote access solutions; and cable operators reporting their use of managed network service providers.\n\nWhile Project Waterworth may seem like just another planned cable by another Big Tech company, Australia should be paying attention because a cable landing point in northern Australia has been proposed. Meta\u2019s plan reinforces the extraordinary significance of the maritime domain for Australia, with more than a dozen submarine cables already connecting us with the world via the Indian and Pacific Oceans. India\u2019s role as a landing site is also important as Australia seeks to continue boosting economic and technology ties with New Delhi.\n\nProject Waterworth also allows for further cyber diplomacy with Pacific partners. The project could bolster Pacific connectivity and cyber resilience through branches to Pacific countries, complementing Google\u2019s efforts through the Pacific Connect Initiative.\n\nThe project further offers Australia the opportunity to work with regional partners to tackle regulatory fragmentation and boost operational collaboration on submarine cables. For example, the Australian Communications and Media Authority should engage regional counterparts to identify opportunities to harmonise and expand regulatory regimes, such as for cable repair and by mandating transparency from operators around cable damage (as ASPI\u2019s Jocelinn Kang and Jessie Jacob have recommended). Canberra should work with regional partners to also increase information-sharing on risks around cables traversing exclusive economic zones. The Cable Connectivity and Resilience Centre of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could help mediate such engagement, while the Australian Cyber Security Centre and Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre could provide expert advice to inform policy on the operational resilience of submarine cable infrastructure\n\nProject Waterworth reflects our brave new world, especially its contested digital and maritime domains, and the opportunity for Australia to collaborate further with regional partners to keep us all online.\n\nRavi Nayyar is a fellow and research contributor at ASPI, associate fellow at the Social Cyber Institute, and a PhD Scholar at the University of Sydney.

TikTok has just over a month remaining to find a new, non-Chinese owner for its US operations or face a ban in the country, because of a law passed last year by then-President Joe Biden and extended in January by President Donald Trump.\n\nInstagram has been seeking to attract users wary about the possibility of losing TikTok by introducing features similar to those popular on its biggest competitor, such as a longer time limit for videos and a \u201ctap to pause\u201d option for Reels.\n\nMeta is also set to launch in the coming weeks a new video creation app called Edits that\u2019s similar to CapCut, the app owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance that many creators use to make short-form videos.\n\nMeta has also recently made significant and controversial changes to its content moderation policies and practices. The company said in January it would do away with fact checkers in favor of a user-generated, \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d model of adding context to posts, and that it would scale back its automated systems for removing content to focus on only the most extreme rules violations, such as terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams.\n\nWhen CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the moderation changes, he acknowledged that the company would \u201ccatch less bad stuff\u201d on its platforms, but said, in turn, it would allow more free speech.\n\nHowever, a Meta spokesperson said the error that caused users to see violent videos Wednesday was unrelated to the content moderation changes.",

            "content": "Branding themselves as a metaverse-driven asset with staking rewards, NFT integration, and virtual banking ambitions, is PVC Meta Coin likely to deliver on its promises? Here\u2019s what we think\u2026\n\nCrypto never runs out of bold promises. Every other week, a new token pops up, swearing it\u2019ll change the game, revolutionize finance, or at the very least, make investors rich. PVC Meta Coins are among the latest contenders, branding themselves as a metaverse-driven asset with staking rewards, NFT integration, and virtual banking ambitions. Sounds impressive? Maybe. But we\u2019ve heard all this before.\n\nWith countless tokens riding hype waves only to be doomed by the proverbial rug-pull that usually follows, the real question isn\u2019t what PVC claims to do, it\u2019s whether it can actually deliver. While grand visions are easy; execution is typically infinitely harder. So, do we think PVC Meta has the foundation to back up its ambitions, or is this just another case of crypto d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\n\nPVC Meta\u2019s Financial Performance\n\nFor all its metaverse ambitions, PVC Meta\u2019s financial track record tells a different story. The token launched with bold claims of revolutionizing virtual finance, but its price chart paints a familiar picture, initial hype, a dramatic surge, and then a steady decline. Like so many other hype coins, PVC Meta hit its peak at $13.75, only to crash over 90%, now trading around $0.01.\n\nThis kind of volatility isn\u2019t unusual in crypto, but it does raise a key question: was the early momentum organic, or was it just another speculative bubble? Many projects experience inflated values due to influencer promotions, aggressive marketing, or artificial scarcity tactics. If PVC Meta can\u2019t establish real-world adoption or maintain investor confidence, it risks becoming another forgotten token in an industry full of short-lived hype cycles.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, liquidity and trading volume remain low, with most transactions happening on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap. While early-stage projects often rely on DEXs before landing major exchange listings, PVC Meta\u2019s absence from platforms like Binance or Coinbase is a red flag. Just because PVC is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a common misconception is it should be listed on Binance.\n\nBSC is an open-source blockchain that anyone can deploy a token on while Binance, the exchange, has strict listing requirements, and it doesn\u2019t list every BSC-based token. So while most legitimate projects typically tend to be listed on larger exchanges, especially once they start growing, PVC Meta remains confined to smaller trading markets where price swings are easier to manipulate, leaving investors way more vulnerable to pump-and-dump cycles.\n\nRed Flags and Risks\n\nPVC Meta positions itself as more than just a cryptocurrency, it claims to be a metaverse-integrated ecosystem with everything from virtual banking to NFT trading, and GameFi mechanics. The vision? A world where users can trade, earn, and interact in a fully digital economy. The problem, however, is that unlike projects like Decentraland (MANA) or The Sandbox (SAND) where time and money were both invested in order to create functional virtual spaces, PVC Meta\u2019s \u201cmetaverse\u201d remains a concept.\n\nThe lack of tangible evidence of a metaverse here is definitely a red flag that leaves investors with rather vague roadmaps and begs the question: are they actually building a metaverse, or just using the term to build hype?\n\nPlenty of projects have latched onto the metaverse buzzword since Facebook rebranded to Meta, and most of them followed a familiar pattern, hype, speculation, and eventual disappearance. It\u2019s easy to throw around ambitious terms like \u201cvirtual economy\u201d and \u201cdigital ownership,\u201d but without a working product, it\u2019s all just talk.\n\nRight now, PVC Meta seems to be leaning way more heavily on marketing instead of actual development. While the whitepaper is filled with promise, lessons from the past require us to be skeptical, especially when the lack of real-world progress suggests a case of hype outpacing reality. If PVC Meta is serious about its metaverse ambitions, it needs to show actual functionality. If we wanted to invest in buzzwords, there are meme coins for that.\n\nAn Educated Gamble\n\nPVC Meta isn\u2019t the first project to dangle the metaverse carrot in front of investors, and it won\u2019t be the last. Maybe one day, its so-called virtual banking and NFT economy will exist outside of a whitepaper, but right now, it\u2019s about as real as a no-transaction-fee Ethereum. There isn\u2019t a shortage of projects that are in the \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re building it\u201d phase in the crypto world, and until PVC Meta proves otherwise, that\u2019s where we think it sits.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t go so far as to call it speculative gambling as there are way worse bets out there, there isn\u2019t enough information or proof here for an \u201ceducated\u201d gamble.\n\nIn case you missed:",

Lichtinghagen et al.31 created and donated the dataset to the Machine Learning Repository of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). This data included laboratory values as well as demographic data. The thirteen parameters were Age, Gender, Albumin(ALB), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate transaminase (AST), Bilirubin (BIL), Cholinesterase (CHE), Cholesterol (CHOL), Creatinine (CREA), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), Total Protein (PROT), and the ground truth feature categorizes patients as either positive or negative for hepatitis C. All values except the target variable were numerical. The features and descriptions are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 Feature description for UCI dataset. Full size table\n\nThe NHANES dataset32,33 consisted of data from 254 patients with eleven parameters obtained from a standard biochemistry blood test merged with demographic data. The data was sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . The eleven parameters utilized were Age, Gender, ALB (g/L), ALP (IU/L), ALT (U/L), AST (U/L), CHOL (mmol/L), CREA (umol/L), GGT (IU/L), PROT (g/L) and the target variable which categorized the patient based on the presence or absence of hepatitis C, tested through an HCV-RNA test. All values except gender and the target variable were numeric. The features and their descriptions are shown in Table 2.\n\nThe two datasets were hybridized into one dataset with 869 patient entries and thirteen parameters. Table 3 displays the dataset description and class details. Figure 3 shows the class-wise distribution of the data. The given parameter and its count are displayed by the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The hybrid dataset\u2019s features and descriptions are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 2 Feature description for NHANES dataset. Full size table\n\nA multi-source dataset has been used to produce a more generalizable result. This hybrid dataset is believed to be a balanced representative of hepatitis C patient data and can help mitigate biases by overfitting a particular class.\n\nIt could be argued that due to the lack of a perfect overlap between the features of the two datasets, hybridizing them could result in several missing values that may hamper the training of ML models. Still, appropriate measures have been implemented to ensure that does not happen. These measures are included in the preprocessing section of this study and include imputation of the missing values through medians. Outlier treatment has also been performed to address this issue. These measures and their entire methodology are explained in further detail in the forthcoming section.\n\nIt could be argued that removing the total bilirubin parameter from the NHANES dataset could be detrimental to the predictions made by the model. However, a Han Ah Lee et al. study demonstrated that direct bilirubin was more predictive of prognosis in patients with cirrhosis than total bilirubin34.\n\nTable 3 Feature description for the hybrid dataset. Full size table\n\nResearch questions\n\nThis study aims to answer the following questions during its completion:\n\nWould using pre-clustering provide a higher accuracy than a purely supervised machine learning approach?\n\nWould it be possible to demystify the black-box operations of the proposed method?\n\nWould a hybrid meta-model perform better than applying individual models?\n\nCould our proposed approach provide a more generalizable model?\n\nExperiments\n\nIn this section, we performed two experiments, the first experiment aimed to set a baseline performance for the ML models. The models were trained on pre-processed data and their performance was evaluated. In the second experiment, we aimed to utilize the proposed clustering approach for feature extraction. The introduction of these features improved the performance of the first experiment. The second experiment was vital in identifying how the proposed approach affected the outcome. Additionally, it studied the ability of a stacked meta-model to improve the accuracy of the achieved results. Throughout the experiments, each step is carefully analyzed to avoid data leakage. Finally, an ablation study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual models. These experiments are expanded in further detail in the following sections. Figure 1 provides an overview of the entire process.\n\nFig. 1 Diagrammatic representation of the process followed by this study. Full size image\n\nExperiment 1: Baseline evaluation\n\nThis experiment was subdivided into two phases. The pre-processing phase included data clean-up and the model implementation phase, during which various ML models were implemented. In the first phase, we addressed the problem of missing values and outliers. The two datasets used in this study differed in the number of features. Additionally, the features in the hybrid dataset had outliers, which were treated before applying machine learning techniques. We split the data post-clean-up and kept a \u2019holdout set\u2019 aside for future evaluation. This holdout set is used for performance evaluation in the second phase. The following sections \u201cMissing value imputation\u201d, \u201cOutlier detection and treatment\u201d, and \u201cImplementing ML models\u201d explain these phases in detail.\n\nThe scores obtained from this experiment are considered baseline scores throughout this study. In the upcoming sections, these baseline scores are compared with the scores obtained from the proposed model.\n\nMissing value imputation\n\nImputation refers to filling in missing values in a dataset using statistical estimates, usually of central tendencies. This study utilized the median as the measure of central tendency for imputation. Every occurrence of a missing (NA) value is replaced with the median of the observations. The distribution of features in our dataset is observed to be skewed. Additionally, it\u2019s noted that the missing values appear to be random, indicating that they are not directly linked to specific patients or patient groups. Moreover, our dataset contains a considerable number of outliers. Considering these reasons, this research deemed the usage of median imputation appropriate. This method also gave us the best performance during mode evaluation. As a means of additional justification, many medical studies have been observed to employ median imputation to deal with missing values.\n\nOutlier detection and treatment\n\nAn outlier is an observation or subset of observations that seem to diverge from the remaining data points significantly. The inconsistencies might arise from incorrect records, measurement errors, rare events, or biological extremities. Since ML relies on pattern learning, the existence of outliers can significantly deteriorate the model\u2019s accuracy. This study uses an interquartile range (IQR) approach to deal with outliers. The outliers from all the variables outside the 2.5% to 97.5% range have been replaced with the lower and upper limits, respectively. The lower and upper limits are mathematically defined as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2)\n\n$$upper = q3 + (1.5 \\times iqr)$$ (1)\n\n$$lower = q1 - (1.5 \\times iqr)$$ (2)\n\nwhere q1 and q3 represent the first and third quartiles, IQR is their difference.\n\nThe sensitivity of the limits was chosen as 1.5 after analysis of the data. An IQR approach is less sensitive to extreme values than its alternatives as it focuses only on the middle 50% of the data distribution. Additionally, our data is skewed and observed to be non-normal. An IQR method shows remarkable resilience against data skewness while maintaining the original integrity of the dataset. Additionally, the IQR method had the highest performance among the other techniques during testing35. We detected an aggregate of 6.004% outliers in the dataset. The highest number of outliers was found in the attribute bilirubin, with 98 outliers (11.277%), and the lowest was Age, with four outliers (0.46%). Table 4 shows the total number of outliers, the total number of values before, and the total number of values after the treatment process. Since none of the outliers have been removed, we see no change in the number of observations in rows 2 and 3. The importance of this outlier imputation process is further explored in \u201cPreprocessing impact study\u201d.\n\nTable 4 Tabular overview of outlier imputation. Full size table\n\nFeature scaling\n\nWe used a normalization process called standard scaling to scale the features before passing them through the models. Standard scaling nullifies the mean and scales the data to have a unit variance. The majority of the algorithms benefit from this process as it reduces the number of large-value calculations, speeding up the convergence and increasing the chance for higher accuracy. All features with an integer value have gone through this scaling process. These features were: Age (in years), Gender, ALB (g/L), ALP (IU/L), ALT (U/L), AST (U/L), BIL(umol/L), CHE, CHOL (mmol/L), CREA (umol/L), GGT (IU/L), PROT (g/L), \u201ckmodes_predicted\u201d. This process was used in all experiments in this manuscript. We further explored the efficacy of this step in the section \u201cPreprocessing impact study\u201d.\n\nImplementing ML models\n\nThe data obtained in the previous steps was used to train the following standard ML models: XGBoost, KNN, RF, and SVC. Additionally, tenfold cross-validation was used with stratified sampling to tune the hyperparameters. The hyperparameters of each model and their ranges are shown in Table 5. This manuscript implements a tenfold cross-validation approach for tuning all hyperparameters. The training dataset is divided into 10 subsets, each following the same class distribution as the original class, called stratification which helps prevent biases in the learning process. 9 subsets are used to train the model, and the last subset is used as validation. This process is repeated till all the subsets have been used for validation once i.e. 10 times for each parameter combination. The accuracy is averaged out for these 10 combinations. This single iteration is repeated for all hyperparameter combinations. We used accuracy as an optimization metric for this process since we are trying to maximize it. The hyperparameters with the highest accuracy are then chosen and applied to the model which is then used on the training set and tested on the test set. The test set is unseen by the model until all the hyperparameters are tuned.\n\nTable 5 An overview of the hyperparameters. Full size table\n\nXGBoost\n\nXGBoost is a gradient-boosting ML algorithm used for classification in this study. It builds an ensemble learning model by combining weaker learners and employs tree pruning to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting. XGBoost was chosen as the base learner due to its speed, performance, and versatility36.\n\nRandom Forest\n\nRandom forest constructs diverse decision trees by randomly selecting features at each split, reducing the correlation between trees and improving the model\u2019s robustness. Due to its versatility, ability to handle complex data, and resistance to overfitting, random forest is a key classification model used in this study37.\n\nAt their core, both XGBoost and RF are based on decision trees. Decision trees divide the training examples into smaller trees until a pattern is found. There is a change in the entropy when these trees are divided into smaller groups. This change in the entropy is known as the information gain and is given by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} Entropy(S) = \\sum _{t=1}^{c} - (P_{t}\\log _{2} P_{t}) \\end{aligned}$$ (3)\n\n$$Information\\;Gain(S,A) = Entropy(S){\\mkern 1mu} - \\sum\\limits_{{v \\in Values(A)}} {\\frac{{|S_{v} |}}{{|S|}}} \\cdot Entropy(S_{v} )$$ (4)\n\nKNN\n\nKNN is a simple ML algorithm for classification and regression. It memorizes the entire training data and predicts the label for new data based on the majority vote of its K nearest neighbours. To determine these neighbours, KNN employees use distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan distance38.\n\nSVM\n\nSVM is a power ML algorithm used for both regression and classification. It aims to find the best hyperplane (separation line) by maximizing the distance to the closest support vectors (data points). SVM uses kernel operations like radial basis functions to create new dimensions and find the optimal hyperplane39.\n\nExperiment 2: Proposed clustering-based approach\n\nThe second experiment was divided into three phases based on the task performed. These were the feature generation, model implementation, and eXplainable AI (XAI) phases. The first phase implemented principles of unsupervised machine learning and generated an additional feature. K-centroid clustering techniques were used at multiple stages in the model. The pre-clustered data was used in the third phase to train the same ML models from the section \u201cImplementing ML models\u201d.\n\nFurther, the hold-out data underwent the same feature extraction process to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness. Finally, XAI tools were employed to comprehend the impact of individual features on the predictions of the best-performing model. SHapley values were used to explain the model.\n\nNotably, the test-train split was performed before beginning the clustering process. The test data was held out until training the learning model on the training set. The test set undergoes an identical process as the training dataset. We perform splitting before further processing the data to prevent data leakage from the test set to the training set. This preventive measure is taken to avoid the model being influenced by future data from the test set. Doing this provides a higher likelihood of generalizability and lowers the chances of an overly optimistic result. All the clustering steps were repeated for the test set with the same parameters as the training set. Figure 2 shows this entire process diagrammatically.\n\nThe sections \u201cClustering for production of categorical bins\u201d and \u201cClustering for feature extraction\u201d further elaborate on the phases.\n\nFig. 2 Diagrammatically elaborating on the feature generation process. Full size image\n\nClustering for production of categorical bins\n\nClustering is a machine learning technique that segregates subsets of a dataset into groups based on commonalities and patterns in their attributes. It is used to gain essential insights from datasets that might go unnoticed. This unsupervised technique forms the crux of this research. It is used in two stages, first for binning individual features (columns) and second for predicting clusters for the entire binned dataset on individual patient entries (rows). This multidimensional clustering (row-wise and column-wise) on the dataset helps reduce complicated (noisy) data into a more interpretable version by assigning specific clusters.\n\nBinning is the process of converting continuous numeric data into its categorical counterparts. This process involves splitting numerical values into appropriate ranges and providing a categorical label for each range. Categorizing data into bins increases the interpretability and reduces noise or non-linearity. This is essential as it sets the base for the following step. We use k-means clustering to predict the cluster bins for each parameter. The underlying data are reports from laboratory tests, thus well-defined and separated. K-means clustering performs well on such spherical or hyperspherical data and is thus used in this step. Also, it displays the best performance when compared to other k-centroid approaches.\n\nClustering is only effective if an optimal number of clusters are formed. In this study, we make an optimal number of bins or clusters by analysing the elbow curve and silhouette scores for up to ten clusters. These are graphical methods for evaluating cluster optimality by using the within-cluster sum of squares and the cluster cohesion or separation, respectively. Figure 3 depicts the elbow plot and silhouette scores for the variable \u201cAge\u201d. Once the optimal number of clusters for a given feature is decided, the feature is split up at the acquired optimal indices. This process is repeated for each feature in the dataset. The resulting dataset contains only categorical values.\n\nFig. 3 The plot on the left shows the elbow plot to find the optimal number of clusters. The point where the elbow is formed is the optimal number of clusters. The plot on the right shows the plot of silhouette scores to find an optimal number of clusters. A high amount of silhouette score is better. Full size image\n\nClustering for feature extraction\n\nSince all the features are categorical, k-modes is the only feasible clustering approach. It uses the most frequent occurrence of a particular label to determine the clusters. The optimal number of k-mode clusters is also found using the elbow and silhouette methods. Additionally, we use the Davies-Bouldin (DB) scores to help us improve the estimation of the optimal clusters. The DB scores represent the mean similarity measure between each cluster and its most similar cluster, with the similarity measure determined by comparing distances within clusters to those between clusters and then averaging these ratios across all clusters. A lower score is better as it depicts clusters farther apart and evenly spread out. The three graphical evaluation methods are presented in Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4 Silhouette score: higher is better, DB score: lower is better. Full size image\n\nThe Cao method is used for cluster initialization. It was introduced by Cao et al.40 in 2009 and is one of the most popular cluster initialization methods. This method selects the initial cluster centres based on the distances between the objects and the density of each object. This study also found this initialisation method to give better results than its predecessors. This second clustering step introduces a new parameter, \u201ckmodes_predicted\u201d, using the intermediary binned data obtained in the previous step. This new parameter further increases the interpretability of the dataset, aiding the model performance. The new parameter is then appended to the original dataset, which contains continuous values, thus concluding the clustering phase. This new feature includes the collective underlying information from the categorical data, vital to improving model accuracy.\n\nExplainable AI\n\nXAI or eXplainable AI refers to a set of methods for interpreting the inner mechanisms of an AI model. Understanding the reason behind the prediction is usually difficult and creates a trust deficit. This section attempts to demystify the black-box operations proposed by the method proposed in this study.\n\nSHapley additive exPlanations\n\nThis study utilized SHAP values to understand each feature\u2019s contribution to the final prediction. SHAP utilizes concepts from cooperative game theory and SHapley values. For a given coalition, SHapley values determine the average contribution of a player (or feature) to the result (or prediction). The intuition behind these values is the analysis of the difference in the performance of a model with and without a particular feature or subsets of features. For a feature x, the contribution of x for each subgroup that includes x is calculated and averaged over all those contributions. This gives a marginal contribution of a feature to the feature set.\n\n$$\\phi _{i} (\n\nu ) = \\frac{1}{{{\\text{no}}{\\text{.}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{players}}}}\\sum\\limits_{{{\\text{coalitions}}\\;{\\text{including }}i}} {\\frac{{i'{\\text{s}}\\;{\\text{marginal }}\\;{\\text{contribution}}\\;{\\text{ to}}\\;{\\text{ coalition}}}}{{{\\text{no}}{\\text{.}}\\;{\\text{ of}}\\;{\\text{ coalitions}}\\;{\\text{ excluding}}\\;i\\;{\\text{ of }}\\;{\\text{this}}\\;{\\text{ size}}}}}$$ (5)\n\nObservations\n\nUsing SHAP, the beeswarm plot is obtained using the best-performing model. This plot is generated for class 0, which corresponds with the blood test reporting positive for the presence of HCV, and vice versa represents class 1. This plot provides a global understanding of the data. It visualizes the distribution of SHAP values (impact on the prediction) for a feature\u2019s high or low values over all instances in the testing data. Each point represents a feature, and its position on the plot corresponds to its SHAP value. The plot is shown in Fig. 5, and the observations drawn are further explained in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nFig. 5 Beeswarm plot of class 1 (top) and class 0 (bottom) for the first instance in the test set. Since this is a binary classification, they are the inverse of each other. Full size image\n\nThe observations drawn from the plot are as follows. We notice that Aspartate transaminase (AST), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), Bilirubin(Bil), Cholesterol (CHOL), and Albumin (ALB) are the five major contributors in the predictive output of the model. Further, it is noted that increased levels of AST, GGT, and Bil positively impact prediction for class 0, whereas decreased levels positively impact prediction for class 1. This implies that the value of AST, GGT, or Bil directly contributes to the likeliness of the patient suffering from HCV. Previously published studies also support this41,42,43.\n\nFurthermore, the converse is observed for the values of CHOL and ALB. As the values of these features increase, a negative impact is generated on the output of class 0, while a positive impact is seen towards the prediction of class 1. This suggests an inverse relation between these features and the model output. This has also been observed in previous biological studies regarding these features44,45.\n\nIn this experiment, we chose two output models from the section \u201cExperiment 2: Proposed clustering-based approach\u201d to build a stacked meta-model. The models were selected based on their performance in the previous section. A third model (RF) was the final estimator, which combined the base models. The following section elaborates further on the proposed model.\n\nStacked meta-model\n\nA meta-model is a higher-level model that combines the outputs of multiple machine learning models, called base models, into a single framework. A meta-learner generates the final predictions by training on the outputs of base ML models. This approach can be particularly practical when the base models exhibit complementary behaviors. By leveraging the learning capabilities of the meta-model, we further enhance the performance of the base models by reducing their biases. This study proposes a meta-model for the detection of hepatitis C. This model uses a stacking ensemble method. The base models used are the XGBoost and Random forest models obtained from the section \u201cExperiment 2: Proposed clustering-based approach\u201d. The meta-model in a stacking classifier gives the final output using the base models. In the proposed model, we use a random forest model as the meta-model. This stacking classifier was optimized sequentially. The random forest model is optimized while the XGBoost model is not. This approach is followed as it yields the highest accuracy from our tests.\n\nEthical approval\n\nThis article contains no studies with human participants or animals performed by authors.",

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other best money making stocks to buy now.\n\nThe US markets have been on a stellar run over the past couple of years, with two-year gains of 53%. This is the best performance for the broad market index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market has benefited from waning inflation, declining interest rates, and a resilient economy that has avoided recession. While continued growth is projected for 2025, analysts also warn of the rally having gone too far, with a correction in the offing this year. Moreover, the looming threat of fierce trade wars is already taking a toll on investor sentiment.\n\nThe broad market index fell for the fourth successive day on Tuesday, February 25, slipping 0.47% amid heightened concerns about economic growth and global trade. According to CNBC, investors are turning to US bonds, with treasury yield dropping below 4.3% to touch the lowest level since December.\n\nThe US president has announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will begin next month, ending the month-long suspension. The new administration also recently imposed additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and continues to warn the European Union of similar import taxes, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of Washington.\n\nProtectionist policies have sparked market concerns about which countries will be next on the American president\u2019s list, leaving several large multinationals unsure of how to plan. Past trends show that the broad market index dropped by 5% on days when the US, under Trump\u2019s first stint as president, announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. The index fell by a cumulative 7% when other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe recent consumer confidence survey for February has added to the negative mood, with results coming in weaker than economists\u2019 estimates and registering the largest deterioration since August 2021. This is the third straight monthly decline, pushing the index to 98.3%, its lowest since June 2024.\n\nStephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, stated the following about the dip:\n\nOf the five components of the Index, only consumers\u2019 assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through screeners to identify stocks with a market cap of over $2 billion (mid-cap or above), whose ROE was greater than 30%, and ROI of more than 25%, as of the close of business on February 25. From there, we selected the 7 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 prominent hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.67 trillion\n\nROE: 37.14%\n\nROI: 27.07%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 262\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. It owns numerous popular social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. An estimated 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta\u2019s apps every day.\n\nThe stock gained 71% in 2024 and is already up 15% year-to-date in 2025 on the back of advancements in AI integration, strategic restructuring, and successful streamlining of operations. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s impressive profitability metrics and commitment to shareholder returns have further enhanced the stock\u2019s appeal among investors.\n\nDuring its Q4 2024 earnings call on January 29, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported revenues of $48.39 billion for the fourth quarter and $164.50 billion for the full year, representing increases of 21% and 22% from the corresponding periods last year. Net income surged 49% during Q4 to $20.8 billion, while for the full year, it stood at $62.36 billion, a remarkable increase of 59.5% year-over-year.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s capital return program included share repurchases worth $29.75 billion in 2024. The company also made dividend payments of $5.07 billion during the year, including $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock, with a consensus Strong Buy rating and an average share price upside potential of 6%. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database for Q4 2024, 262 hedge funds held a stake in the company, up from 235 at the end of the third quarter.\n\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of best money making stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Back in 2020, Meta announced proudly that \"nothing's changed, everything\u2019s changed\" when it replaced the blue Facebook Messenger logo with a series of redesigns sporting purple and pink gradients. Four years on, now nothing has changed for real.\n\nMeta has baffled Messenger users by rowing back on the much publicised logo redesign and reverting to the previous blue palette. It's offered no explanation for the change, but people have already reached their own conclusions about the reverse rebrand.\n\nFull circle. The Facebook Messenger logo in 2020, the redesigns that lasted until this year and the new old logo design (Image credit: Meta / Future)\n\nIn January, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook's token commitment to standards and moderation was now \"out of touch with mainstream discourse\" and that he had decided to get rid of fact checkers and replace them with community notes. Because we all know how well that has worked on X.\n\nZuck was instantly accused of bowing down to Donald Trump \u2013 or simply of taking advantage of the change of administration to lower Facebook's standards and costs. We can't say whether Zuckerberg's decision to join the \"anti-woke\" party is also responsible for Messenger going back to a less vibrant and more conservative logo design, but the timing means that users are inevitably reading the rebrand in that way.\n\n\"100% did it because the last one was very close to trans pride colors. Just like they removed all trans and pink/ white/ blue themes from messenger last month,\" one user writes over on Reddit. \"Honestly that was my first thought. 'The gradient might imply we like trans people and bring der pumpkinfurher against us. We must comply', another person says.\n\nOthers have linked the decision to revert to a blue colour palette to Zuckerberg's much-mocked suggestion that corporate America needed more \"masculine energy\u201d.\n\nThere's also some debate about how the rebrand will be read longer term. Blue is often considered to communicate trust \u2013 which Meta could do with earning more of as it pushes its Meta AI tools in Messenger. But some suggest the change will have the opposite effect. \"This is a company going backwards to their 'old ways',\" one person suggested on Reddit.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

The Facebook Messenger logo was redesigned to incorporate a more vibrant gradient at a time when Meta was merging it with Instagram's messenger so users could access the same messages across both platforms. But Meta abandoned that much-hyped plan at the end of 2023 with no explanation. If there's no longer a plan to add more cross-functionality between Instagram and Messenger, it could make sense to 'demerge' their branding.\n\nThe problem is that since people have become used to the 2021 logo, the old design now looks \"basic\". \"It feels so bland \u2013 like an artifact from 2016 in my home screen,\" one person complains.\n\nFor more logo design news, see the controversial new Green Party of Canada logo.",

According to a report from CNBC, Meta is planning to create a standalone AI app at some point in the second quarter. Assuming no delays, that means any point between April and June.\n\nThe aim, according to the site\u2019s sources who asked not to be named for confidentiality reasons, is to see Meta leapfrog Google and Open AI as the leading AI company by the end of the year.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise. Not only has Mark Zuckerberg endorsed posts on Threads suggesting that Meta should make its own app, but he told investors in January that AI would be a big focus this year.\n\n\u201cIn AI, I expect that this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,\u201d he said at the time. He added that the company\u2019s \u201creally exciting road map\u201d for the year would have a \u201cunique vision focused on personalization\u201d because \u201cpeople don't all want to use the same AI.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nWhile Meta has billions of users across its many apps, one possible stumbling block to the company\u2019s plans to rule the AI roost is pricing. CNBC\u2019s sources claim that Meta plans to charge a monthly fee to offer more advanced features.\n\nTrue, both ChatGPT and Gemini do the same, but Meta users are more used to getting things for free. Facebook, Instagram and Messenger have always been free, and Meta actually removed WhatsApp\u2019s 99c a year fee two years after buying it.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Possibly both. Despite its possible disadvantages in pricing and privacy, Meta has a huge amount of money to spend, so Zuckerberg\u2019s vision shouldn\u2019t be dismissed out of hand. The speed at which AI technology is moving means that the AI chatbot landscape could look very different at the end of 2025.",

            "content": "Meta issued an apology on Thursday after some Instagram users reported being shown violent and graphic content on their Reels feed.\n\nUsers turned to other social channels to express concerns about disturbing content appearing despite having the highest moderation setting enabled.\n\nOn Wednesday night, CNBC reported that its staff members viewed several IG reels that appeared to show dead bodies, graphic injuries and violent assaults. The posts had \u201cSensitive Content\u201d labels, per the report.\n\n\u201cWe have fixed an error that caused some users to see content in their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologize for the mistake,\u201d Meta told CNBC.\n\nHow the incident happened isn\u2019t exactly clear. Meta allows some graphic content to raise awareness about issues like human rights abuses and terrorism, often with warning labels, but it stresses that those are exceptions to its content policy. The technology company uses AI and a team of over 15,000 reviewers to detect disturbing content, prioritizing the removal of most violations before users report them.\n\nMeta\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t provide any indication of what went wrong, only saying it had \u201cfixed\u201d something.\n\nWhy it matters: Any worthwhile apology must include a couple simple elements beyond a heartfelt \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It needs a reason why the incident happened and a reasonable promise that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\nMeta didn\u2019t do that. Not doing so was a missed opportunity to take accountability seriously and show a commitment to providing a safe, trustworthy experience.\n\nDoing so is especially important for Meta right now given all the changes it\u2019s making related to content moderation in the name of free expression.\n\nThat included shifting its automated systems from scanning for \u201call policy violations\u201d to a focus on \u201cillegal and high-severity violations, like terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams,\u201d CNBC reported. It also did away with its independent third-party fact-checkers in favor of a new \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d model. It also has laid off employees recently, including 20 on Friday for revealing confidential information.\n\nIn light of these changes, Meta needed to answer how they\u2019d affect content decisions and address concerns about its ability to manage content effectively.\n\nIt didn\u2019t do that, though. And now IG users are left wondering what\u2019s taking place inside Meta\u2019s algorithm.\n\nEditor\u2019s Top Reads\n\nJeff Bezos plans to use the opinion section of The Washington Post to support viewpoints about \u201cpersonal liberties\u201d and \u201cfree markets.\u201d The outlet will cover other topics as well, Bezos wrote on X, \u201cbut viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d The move signals a more hands-on approach by Bezos in shaping the paper\u2019s editorial direction. Elon Musk applauded Bezos\u2019 decision. The decision has already led to internal upheaval at WaPo, with Editorial page editor David Shipley resigning over the changes, and economics reporter Jeff Stein called it a \u201cmassive encroachment\u201d into the opinion section. \u201c(I)f Bezos tries interfering with the news side I will be quitting immediately and letting you know,\u201d Stein wrote on X. While news and opinion remain separate at the Washington Post, it doesn\u2019t mean readers will see things that way. The publication reportedly lost 250,000 subscriptions following Bezos\u2019 decision to rescind an editorial endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris weeks before the presidential election. Brands looking at earned media placements with WaPo should consider this editorial realignment when making their pitch, as it may influence the reception.\n\nParamount is the latest brand to roll back DEI policies amid growing opposition to such initiatives. In a memo to employees, the co-CEOs announced the company will end aspirational hiring goals based on race, gender, and ethnicity, stop collecting diversity data for many U.S. job applicants, and remove DEI from employee incentives. \u201cWith our business objectives firmly in mind, we will continue to evaluate our programs and approach to ensure that we are widening our aperture to attract talent from all geographies, backgrounds and perspectives,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cThat may mean expanding existing programs while ending others.\u201d It also includes phrases like having a \u201cworkforce that reflects the perspectives and experiences of our many different audiences\u201d and states that \u201cValues like inclusivity and collaboration are a part of the Paramount culture and will continue to be.\u201d Brands are in a tough spot. On one hand, they face pressure to roll back DEI policies. On the other, they want to highlight a commitment to diversity, even though it\u2019s no longer a formalized priority. Paramount\u2019s statement highlights its commitment, but without specifics, it feels hollow. Remember that classic writing mantra: show, don\u2019t tell.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just dropped multiple lawsuits against financial institutions, marking a shift in consumer protections. One of the biggest cases accused Capital One of using deceptive tactics that cost customers $2 billion in interest. Others targeted mortgage lenders, student loan servicers and financial firms accused of shady practices, according to the New York Times. Acting Director Russell Vought has wasted no time scaling back the agency, putting staff on leave, canceling contracts and planning massive layoffs. \u201cThe weaponization of \u2018consumer protection\u2019 must end,\u201d Russell posted on X announcing the dismissal of a case against SoLo Funds, making it clear this is just the beginning. For brands, these changes and court dismissals may lead to increased skepticism among consumers toward banks, lenders and businesses in general. With the current state of the world, it\u2019s more important than ever to prioritize messaging around transparency and building meaningful relationships with consumers. In a time when many consumers feel vulnerable, brands that proactively earn and demonstrate trust will distinguish themselves and create long-lasting loyalty.\n\nCasey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily.

Others flagged footage of a man being dismembered by a helicopter and a video where \u201ca guy put his face into boiling oil\u201d. Several users posted videos of their Reels feeds dominated by \u201csensitive content\u201d screens that are designed to shield users from graphic material.\n\nA list of violent content on one user\u2019s feed, published by the tech news site 404, included: a man being set on fire; a man shooting a cashier at point-blank range; videos from an account called \u201cPeopleDeadDaily\u201d; and a pig being beaten with a wrench. The user in question had a biking-related Instagram account, 404 Media reported.\n\nAnother Reddit user wrote: \u201cFor the past 24 hours, it feels like Instagram\u2019s algorithm has gone rogue. My feed is absolutely packed with violent Reels \u2013 like, one after the other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Instagram is now trying to make me question if I accidentally followed a \u2018bloodshed and chaos\u2019 account. I get that the platform\u2019s all about \u2018engagement\u2019 and \u2018trending,\u2019 but did they really think this was the way to get people to scroll more?\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said: \u201cWe have fixed an error that caused some users to see content on their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologise for the mistake.\u201d\n\nThe error follows recent changes to Meta\u2019s approach to content moderation. However, the company told 404 Media that the deluge of graphic videos was not related to the overhaul of Meta\u2019s content rules, which included removing factcheckers and \u201cdramatically\u201d reducing the amount of censorship on its platforms.\n\nMeta\u2019s content guidelines state the company will remove content that is \u201cparticularly violent or graphic\u201d and that some imagery will be shielded by sensitive content screens. In the UK, the Online Safety Act requires social media platforms to take measures to prevent under-18s from seeing material that is harmful to them such as violent, hateful or abusive material, which will include configuring their algorithms to filter out such content.\n\nOne internet safety campaign group demanded a \u201cfull explanation\u201d of what had happened to Instagram\u2019s algorithm.\n\nThe Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the family of the UK teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017 after viewing distressing content on Instagram, said questions needed to answered about why such graphic content was on the platform in the first place.\n\n\u201cAs Instagram rolls back content moderation this is likely to be a sign of things to come,\u201d said Andy Burrows, the foundation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cMeta\u2019s changes will mean this type of content is more freely available and will more often be recommended to appear in user\u2019s feeds.\u201d",

Five thousand members of the group filed complaints with the data protection watchdogs in Norway, Germany, and Spain after having collected evidence that Meta had disregarded their explicit user requests to opt out of data collection and targeted advertising.\n\nThe complaints are grounded in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU, due to which Meta had introduced ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram that require users to purchase a paid subscription while other users continue to receive a free service funded by revenues from advertising. Eko aims to prompt regulatory actions through its complaint filings.\n\nThis comes after civil rights group Equal Rights Center filed a lawsuit against Meta earlier this month alleging that it unlawfully discriminated against Black users by advertising for-profit colleges to them, while advertising public colleges to white users. Further, Meta has faced ongoing scrutiny in Europe over its data collection and advertising practices, with the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling in October that Meta must restrict its use of personal data harvested through its platforms for targeted advertising purposes, even when users have consented to such use. This also follows a similar decision by the European Data Protection Board, which found Meta\u2019s method of obtaining user consent for behavioral advertising had violated EU law.",

            "content": "Sevilla F\u00fatbol Club (Sevilla FC), based in the southern Spanish city of Seville, are seven-time Europa League champions.\n\nTalent scouting in the Europa League is competitive, so Sevilla FC have worked to stay ahead. And with more data in their hands than ever before \u2013 Sevilla FC have over 300,000 scouting reports to use for recruiting new players \u2013 they need a way to turn that information into real-world talent.\n\nTo analyze and make use of their soccer talent data, Sevilla FC\u2019s data department partnered with IBM to create Scout Advisor, a generative AI-driven scouting tool designed and built on watsonx, IBM\u2019s portfolio of AI products, with Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 70B Instruct model.\n\n\u201cScout Advisor uses Llama 3.1 70B Instruct\u2019s advanced natural language processing to bridge the gap between qualitative human insights and quantitative data analysis,\u201d says Elias Zamora, Chief Data Officer (CDO) for Sevilla FC. \u201cThis fusion enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of our scouting operations, ensuring that our recruitment strategies are both data-driven and deeply informed by human expertise.\u201d\n\nMaking Scouting Report Searches Easier\n\nTo make recruiting decisions, Sevilla FC needed to assess qualities like attitude, tenacity and leadership across a large volume of scouting reports. Without Scout Advisor, recruiters had to spend 200 to 300 hours analyzing a single shortlist of players.\n\nNow Sevilla FC\u2019s recruiters can simply ask Scout Advisor a question about the soccer talent they\u2019re looking for to see a list of matching players, including precise AI-generated summaries of their performance. IBM\u2019s watsonx and Meta\u2019s Llama enable Sevilla FC to bridge the gap between traditional human-centric and data-driven scouting in the identification and characterization of potential recruits.\n\nHaving such an effective operation for scouting players has helped Sevilla FC attract talent, while generating opportunities from other teams who want to use AI for help.\n\nLearning to Talk Soccer\n\nBuilt with IBM\u2019s watsonx and leveraging Llama, Scout Advisor is able to comprehend soccer-industry terms and answer questions accurately.\n\nThrough prompt enrichment, Scout Advisor automatically optimizes questions to get the best possible results from the AI solution. Prompt enrichment ensures that soccer-specific questions give the agent enough context for a thorough analysis of Sevilla FC\u2019s scouting reports.\n\nFor example, a simple query like \u201cshow me talented wings\u201d automatically gets refined with soccer-specific information, so that search results look right: \u201cA talented wing takes on defenders with dribbling, creating space and penetrating the opposition.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, a general-purpose model\u2019s response might include irrelevant results, like a chicken wing recipe.\n\n\u201cWe selected Llama 3.1 70B for its text enrichment and summarization performance, particularly in the Spanish language,\u201d Zamora says.\n\nStrong Results for Scout Advisor\n\nSince implementing Scout Advisor, Sevilla FC have improved their scouting process with shorter evaluation time, enhanced talent identification, a stronger competitive edge and new consulting opportunities and revenue streams.\n\n\u201cThis is a revolutionary tool for a football director. I don\u2019t need to review 45 reports for a player to know what my scouting department thinks of them,\u201d says Victor Orta, Sporting Director at Sevilla FC. \u201cIn perhaps two minutes, I can get all the information that I need to make a decision.\u201d\n\nFor those inspired by their AI initiatives, Zamora says it\u2019s crucial to have a solid data foundation, deep business understanding and a well-educated team. In the future, Sevilla FC plans to evaluate new versions of Llama to keep refining Scout Advisor\u2019s capabilities, helping them keep their leading edge in sports AI.",

It marks a major step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to make his company the leader in artificial intelligence by the end of the year, ahead of competitors such as OpenAI and Alphabet , said the people, who asked not to be named because the project is confidential.\n\nThe Meta AI chatbot launched in September 2023, with the company pitching it as a generative AI-powered digital assistant that can provide responses and create images based on user prompts within its existing apps. The company brought Meta AI to the forefront of its apps in April, when it replaced the search feature for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger with the chatbot.\n\nMeta AI has since become the primary method for Zuckerberg to showcase his company's generative AI technologies to billions of consumers.\n\n\"This is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January.\n\nUnlike competing generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, Meta AI is currently only available to users via a website and the company's apps such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Although Meta's vast user base across its family of apps can access Meta AI, users could potentially interact more deeply with the digital assistant if it were available as a standalone app, the people said.\n\nIn January, Zuckerberg publicly agreed with a Threads user who said Meta should create a standalone mobile app for its digital assistant.\n\nThe Threads user wrote that a separate Meta AI app could help the company unify the digital assistant across smartphones and different hardware platforms such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, help users organize their conversational histories with the digital assistant and allow for \"Deeper personalization and customization.\"\n\nZuckerberg responded to the Threads user with a red \"100\" emoji, often used in online chatter to convey wholehearted agreement.\n\nMeta also plans to test a paid subscription service for Meta AI, similar to the way OpenAI and Microsoft charge users monthly fees to access more powerful versions of their respective ChatGPT and Copilot chatbots, the people said.\n\nMeta finance chief Susan Li told analysts in January that while the company's Meta AI efforts are focused on \"building a great consumer experience,\" there are \"pretty clear monetization opportunities here over time, including paid recommendations and including a premium offering.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment.\n\nShortly after this story was published, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman slyly said in an X post, \"ok fine maybe we'll do a social app.\"",

Thanks to their immersive nature, virtual and mixed reality can give students hands-on, interactive experiences that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise. Whether exploring the molecular structure of a chemical compound or getting a front-row seat to epoch-defining historical events, headsets like Meta Quest 3 and 3S open up exciting new possibilities for a truly memorable lesson plan.\n\nAcross 83 Inspired Education Group schools already using immersive technology in the classroom, 90% of students reported increased engagement and interest in their lessons, along with a 25% boost in confidence in their knowledge. Additionally, 85% of teachers found virtual and mixed reality to be a valuable tool to enhance their teaching. Students also experienced a 15% improvement in their academic performance on multiple-choice assessments.\n\nWhat is Meta for Education?\n\nBuilt on the successful foundation of our enterprise solution for work, Meta for Education is now offering a Meta Quest headset and a subscription to Meta Horizon managed solutions for education. This bundle is designed to give students access to an immersive learning experience that keeps educators in control.\n\nServing as a platform for interactive and engaging third-party content that aims to make learning more enjoyable and effective, Meta for Education provides access to a range of subjects including science, history and language arts. We believe it represents a significant step forward in the use of immersive technology in education, with enormous potential to transform the way we learn and teach.\n\nOur Beta Program\n\nWe partnered with over a dozen participating colleges and universities across the US and UK through our beta program \u2013 including Savannah College of Art & Design, Imperial College London, Morehouse College, University of Michigan and more \u2013 gathering valuable feedback to help improve our product. Educators in the beta found that virtual and mixed reality made educational content more memorable for students and helped educators to explain and demonstrate complex concepts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not replacing things that we can do in person\u2026we\u2019re empowering students to do things that would be out of reach otherwise,\u201d said San Diego State University Senior Director of Instructional Technology Dr. Sean Hauze.\n\nMeta for Education represents a significant leap forward in educational technology, and we\u2019re excited to continue offering new, immersive ways for educators and students to engage and interact beyond the physical world.",

            "content": "As Meta continues to ramp up its AI and VR plans, it\u2019s also going to need a lot more computing power, and data storage capacity to power its next-level initiatives.\n\nAnd it\u2019s willing to invest, big time.\n\nAccording to a new report from The Information, Meta\u2019s currently in the process of assessing locations for a new $200 billion data center, with the construction likely to place the new facility in either Louisiana, Wyoming or Texas, based on early talks.\n\nMeta hasn\u2019t confirmed that any such project will be taking place, labeling the latest report as \u201cpure speculation.\u201d But it would align with Meta\u2019s broader expansion plans for its AI projects, while it would also help Zuckerberg in his efforts to cosy up to the Trump Administration, which is keen to see more investment into tech projects based in the U.S.\n\nMeta has already confirmed that it\u2019s likely to spend more than $65 billion this year on AI infrastructure, including the development of a new 2-gigawatt data center \u201cthat is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.\u201d\n\nMeta also recently brought its new data center in Mesa, Arizona online, while it\u2019s also looking to invest around $10 billion into a new undersea cabling project to improve connectivity to India and Africa specifically.\n\n$200 billion would be a significant jump on what Meta has already pledged, and again, Meta says that it hasn\u2019t made any official decision on deepening its spending beyond what\u2019s been announced.\n\nBut with xAI and OpenAI both also digging deeper in their own efforts to win the AI race, Meta may be looking to blow them out of the water with its own expanded capacity.\n\nThere are also emerging AI threats from China, with DeepSeek recently taking many U.S. AI firms by surprise with its advanced capabilities. Indeed, Chinese tech giants Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance have all announced significant new AI investments, and with Meta\u2019s pushing for the Trump Administration to help it in supporting AI innovation, particularly in Europe, where the EU\u2019s complex regulations have stifled its progress, increased investment in U.S. development could also signal Meta\u2019s own commitment to expanding American leadership in the AI race.\n\nSo while Meta is denying the reports right now, it wouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise to see Meta sinking more into its AI projects, as it seeks to build the best AI model on the market, and win out in the latest tech race.\n\nWhich, at least in theory, could open up a range of new opportunities.\n\nMeta says that its Meta AI chatbot now has 700 million monthly active users, while it\u2019s also open sourced its Llama model to facilitate expanded use cases for its AI tools. That could see Meta\u2019s AI infrastructure become the backbone of many industrial and specialized models, which would hen provide more opportunity for Meta to power the next stage of AI innovation.\n\nEvery AI project is aiming for the same, and each will have their own strengths, but with its massive advantage in resourcing, and connectivity, Meta may be better placed than any of them to win out.\n\nAs such, and extra $200 billion could easily be offset by the longer term business benefits.",

Meta would \"get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse.\"\n\nIn January, Business Insider reported that the tech giant would officially end its US fact-checking partnerships in March.\n\nMeta has faced a string of controversies since 2016 over lapses in content moderation. It has faced criticism for, among other issues, its role in illicit drug sales. Last year, founder Mark Zuckerberg joined other tech CEOs for a Congressional grilling about safety measures for children online.\n\nInternationally, Meta's lack of content moderation and reliance on third-party civil society groups to report misinformation have been found to play a role in proliferating violence in Myanmar, Iraq, and Ethiopia.\n\nZuckerberg's content moderation changes resemble those made by Elon Musk on the social media platform X, which he bought in 2022.",

In fact, they may go down. I always use the term may. I don\u2019t want to say absolute but I\u2019ll let y\u2019all decide. The customer is picking up a huge amount of storm costs from before they were here or walked into the state,\u201d said Entergy vice president Jody Montelaro.\n\nState officials say the project will create 5,000 jobs during construction and at least 500 permanent jobs once operational. Site preparation is expected to begin this year, with full construction taking approximately five years.\n\nThe Louisiana Economic Development Department calls it a historic investment that could position the state as a leader in AI infrastructure.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

            "content": "Happy Tuesday! I\u2019m Geoffrey A. Fowler, The Post\u2019s tech columnist based in San Francisco, and I\u2019m filling in for Will today to write about one way users could feel the effect of the content-moderation debate. Send tips to: geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com. 277 million more harmful posts could flood Facebook and Instagram, study says\n\nAfter Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s January turnaround on \u201cfree expression,\u201d what\u2019s in store for the billions of users of Facebook and Instagram?\n\nThey could encounter at least 277 million more instances of hate speech and other harmful content each year, according to a new estimate from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit that frequently battles social media companies over moderation practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Meta announced sweeping changes to the community guidelines that define what sorts of speech it does and doesn\u2019t allow. The company said it would shift how it enforces many of its rules and ratchet back limits to speech targeting women, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants and other marginalized groups.\n\nThe main driver for a potential surge in hate speech, CCDH said, is an important change to how Meta says it will identify some harmful content: relying on users to report it rather than automated systems to take it down.\n\nUntil last month\u2019s changes, CCDH said, it was Meta\u2019s proactive enforcement measures that barred 97 percent of the hate speech, bullying and harassment kept off its social networks. Reducing those tools will leave Facebook and Instagram wide open for a lot of harmful content, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a tidal wave of hate and disinformation that will be flooding back onto their platforms,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of CCDH, which published the estimates Monday as part of a broader critique of Meta\u2019s new policies.\n\nThat could matter for users choosing which online spaces feel safe for families, for governments weighing how to regulate social media and for advertisers looking to avoid placement aside toxic content.\n\nMeta took issue with CCDH\u2019s estimates.\n\n\u201cCCDH\u2019s methodology is flawed and makes significant assumptions that don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny,\u201d Meta spokesman Ryan Daniels said. \u201cWhile we will still address content that violates our policies, we are focused on reducing mistakes and over-enforcement of our rules.\u201d\n\nMeta didn\u2019t specify what was flawed about CCDH\u2019s methodology and declined to provide its own projections for how much content will be barred under its new policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallum Hood, CCDH\u2019s head of research, said his estimate of Meta missing about 277 million instances of harmful content is derived from Meta\u2019s own transparency reports. In the most recent one, which runs through the third quarter of 2024, Meta reported proactively taking down 346 million pieces of content in areas like hate speech, bullying and harassment. CCDH adjusted its estimate to account for Meta\u2019s claims that up to 20 percent of its proactive enforcement decisions could be mistakes.\n\nMeta has said it plans to curtail proactive enforcement because its automated systems made too many errors \u2014 an issue that irked both ends of the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cFor less severe policy violations, we\u2019re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take any action,\u201d the company said in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta has said it would continue proactive enforcement on \u201chigh-severity violations\u201d including \u201cterrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams.\u201d But that list does not include the categories of hate speech, bullying or incitement to violence \u2014 and Meta declined to answer questions from The Post about how it would enforce its rules in such cases.\n\nThe 277 million more pieces of harmful content in CCDH\u2019s estimate would be on top of the unknown number of posts Meta\u2019s systems previously missed \u2014 and also wouldn\u2019t account for new additional activity, CCDH said.\n\nThe challenge of measuring Meta\u2019s self-reported enforcement speaks to a broader problem.\n\n\u201cWithout any regulatory or economic incentives to provide actual transparency, we have no true idea of how much dangerous or even illegal content is actually enforced, whether by their automated systems or user reports,\u201d said Yael Eisenstat, Facebook\u2019s former head of election integrity for political ads in 2018 who is now director of policy at Cybersecurity for Democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also isn\u2019t clear how effectively Meta will respond to the user reports it has now placed at the core of its moderation efforts.\n\n\u201cOur repeated tests of Meta\u2019s enforcement of its policies in response to user reports indicate that the company fails to act on the majority of violative content reported to them,\u201d CCDH\u2019s Hood said. Past tests by the ADL and PEN America have similarly found Meta has done a poor job responding to user reports of antisemitism and abuse.\n\nMeta has said it would move its enforcement staff from California to Texas as part of its new policies, but it has not outlined plans to invest in additional staff that might be required to handle a rise in user reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPutting the responsibility on those who are suffering the abuse to also do the moderation work for this multibillion dollar company is a gross abdication of the company\u2019s own responsibility to keep people safe,\u201d Eisenstat said.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD said Meta\u2019s shift to user reports is a radical departure from industry best practices. \u201cFor years, the company has bragged about how it proactively mitigates enormous quantities of violative content, without user reporting. Meta now says it\u2019s shifting to reactive mode,\u201d said Leanna Garfield, GLAAD\u2019s Social Media Safety Program Manager. \u201cWe can expect that more users will increasingly come into closer contact with harmful content.\u201d\n\nGovernment scanner\n\nApple announces billions in U.S. investment after Trump meeting (Shannon Najmabadi and Gerrit De Vynck)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMove fast, break things, rebuild: Elon Musk\u2019s strategy for U.S. government (Hannah Natanson, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Gerrit De Vynck and Faiz Siddiqui)\n\nTrump administration tells agencies they can ignore Musk order on email reply (Emily Davies, Hannah Natanson, Jeff Stein and Lisa Rein)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside the industry\n\nCompetition watch\n\nTrending\n\nDaybook\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee holds hearings on the nominations of Michael Kratsios to direct the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Mark Meador to be a Federal Trade Commissioner, today at 1o a.m.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee hosts a nomination hearing on Wednesday at 10:15 a.m.\n\nThe FCC hosts an open commission meeting on Thursday at 10:30 a.m.\n\nBefore you log off\n\nimagine WANTING to receive two million emails \u2014 Alexandra Petri (@petridishes.bsky.social) February 25, 2025 at 3:50 AM",

Apple's Tim Cook has publicly taken swipes at Meta over its privacy stumbles. And in January, Mark Zuckerberg went for the jugular, saying on Joe Rogan's podcast that Apple hasn't \"really invented anything great in a while.\"\n\nVicious.\n\nOne front of the current battle is over who should be responsible for restricting kids and teens from accessing social media apps \u2014 something both companies argue the other should do.\n\nMeta has published a blog post from its head of safety stating its position that the app stores \u2014 Apple and Google \u2014 should be the ones restricting app downloads for younger users. Apple has concerns this would invade privacy, and critics worry this would encroach on free speech.\n\nAnd it appears Meta just won a small victory.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that nine states have introduced bills in the last two months that would require Apple and Google to take up the unwanted task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It looks like the policy-debate equivalent of a game of 'not it,'\" said Kate Ruane, director of a free-speech campaign at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that has opposed many child-safety laws on the grounds that they are ineffective and infringe on free speech and privacy. Both Apple and Meta think the onus to verify user ages shouldn't be on them. Apple last year helped kill a bill in Louisiana that would have forced app stores to handle age verification. Meta, along with social-media companies Snap and X, last week sent a letter to legislators in South Dakota arguing app-store verification would be simplest since app stores already collect user information.\"It looks like the policy-debate equivalent of a game of 'not it,'\" said Kate Ruane, director of a free-speech campaign at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that has opposed many child-safety laws on the grounds that they are ineffective and infringe on free speech and privacy.\n\nKeeping kids safe online is a multifaceted issue with no single good, clear answer.\n\nLawmakers are finding themselves vexed by how to come up with solutions to a problem their constituents clearly care about. According to a 2024 Pew Report, 38% of parents said they argued with their teens about screen time, and 43% said that it was \"hard\" to manage their kids' phone use.\n\nBut don't count this as a total win for Meta just yet. These bills are merely introduced, not passed, and a similar bill introduced in Louisiana was eventually shut down after intense lobbying efforts by Apple.",

They spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about future employment. Business Insider has verified their identity, employment, and supporting documents. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was hired by Meta in late 2022. During my time there, I received performance evaluations every six months, in which my ratings were always \"at or above expectation\" or \"consistently met expectation.\" Of course, I received small tweaks and feedback that are normal in any review, but I never received any signal that I was a low performer or that I was trending downwards.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg announced Meta would be laying off the lowest 5% of performers, I felt a general sense of anxiety, but I looked at the criteria they were going to apply and thought: \"This doesn't apply to me. I've gotten really good ratings up to this point.\" I didn't consider I'd be in that bucket.\n\nI woke up to a layoff email at 5 a.m., and by 8 a.m. I'd lost all access to chats\n\nThey sent an email at 5 a.m. PST, and by 8 a.m. we'd been locked out of our chats. I didn't get to say goodbye to my colleagues. The morning of my layoff, I felt despondent. I'd worked really, really hard to get this job, had worked long hours, and had put a lot of effort into supporting my team. I just felt this deep sense of defeat.\n\nAnd then I got angry. I was livid, like transcendentally livid. I can't even really put into words how it felt. I'd lost so much \u2014 my confidence, my reputation, a substantial amount of unvested stock. I just remember being in bed, screaming into a pillow.\n\nI felt betrayed by the company I'd worked for, and they destroyed my confidence in the process.\n\nI have no idea how they decided I was a low performer\n\nI haven't received any documentation explaining how they got my \"low performer\" rating, so I don't have any official idea of why this occurred. I didn't get a signal from my manager. I just received the rating and the termination letter stating I was being let go.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI'm so scared about how this \"low performer\" label will affect my ability to find a new job.\n\nRight now, the zeitgeist is sympathetic to those of us who've been laid off, but I know it's going to impact future employment. It's already a tough job market, so I'm scared. I'm really, really scared.\n\nBecause Meta clearly labeled people affected as low performers, any hiring manager who looks at my end date will know. We are uniquely disadvantaged because this announcement was leaked and widely publicized.\n\nFor the first week after my layoff, I couldn't even fathom the idea of updating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or looking for jobs. I felt so hopeless that I could hardly even motivate myself to get out of bed. I already struggled with imposter syndrome, and this felt like Meta threw salt in the wound. I'm going to have to rebuild my self-confidence, and that's going to take time.\n\nI think this is going to be a moment to take a step back, recenter myself, and think about what I truly want for myself and my career. Right now, I know I value some sense of stability. I know no job is stable, but I really want my next role to be somewhere where I feel like leadership at least doesn't seem to have an openly hostile position toward its employees.\n\nMy opinion on Mark Zuckerberg has completely changed\n\nI used to defend Mark Zuckerberg to people. I thought he was personable in company meetings and really funny. Now, I feel like that was just a facade.\n\nBetween the layoff, removing DEI initiatives, and changes around content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg seems to be testing how many decisions he can make without retribution. Because Meta is such a big player in the tech industry, I'm concerned the company is creating an environment where other employers will follow suit.\n\nTech used to be a place where companies took care of their employees and where we were supported, but now it feels like we're all in a meat grinder. It's really sad to see.\n\nMeta could already be backfilling these roles\n\nMeta laid off thousands of employees and said they were going to start filling many of those roles with new people.\n\nI joined at a time when Meta's stock was lower, and like many of my coworkers, a portion of my compensation is tied to the value of the company's stock. I have questioned whether the low-performance label was a way to let expensive employees go.\n\nI'm worried about speaking out for fear of retribution. I hope people are empathetic toward those impacted by layoffs six months or a year down the road.\n\nNobody knows how long we'll be looking for a new job. I've heard horror stories of people applying to hundreds of jobs for over a year. I don't think that's going to be my position, but it indicates how hard the market is right now.\n\nI had a call with my dad the other day and told him I just don't know what to hope for right now. The rug was pulled out from under me. I don't know how to move forward from that.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.\n\nIf you've been affected by Big Tech layoffs and would like to share your story, email Kiera Fields at kfields@businessinsider.com.",

            "content": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) delivered a 23% return last year, which was more than twice its average annual gain dating back to when it was established in 1957. It was led higher by some of its trillion-dollar constituents, including Tesla (TSLA -2.99%) and Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) which both soared by more than 60%:\n\nTesla and Meta are entirely different companies. The former manufactures electric vehicles (EVs), whereas the latter is the social media giant behind Facebook and Instagram. However, both of them are counting on artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver the next phase of growth for their businesses.\n\nWhich stock will be the better buy in 2025? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Tesla\n\nDespite its incredible run last year, Tesla stock is currently down 26% from its December record high. Although the company is packed with long-term potential, investors are concerned about its passenger EV sales, which appear to be rapidly declining.\n\nLess than two years ago, CEO Elon Musk consistently told investors Tesla could grow its EV production by 50% per year on average. But the company sold 1.79 million cars during 2024, which was a 1% drop from 2023. It was the first annual decline since Tesla launched its flagship Model S in 2011, and the company simply can't increase production if the cars aren't selling.\n\nSome early reports suggest a recovery is unlikely in 2025. In January, Tesla's sales plunged by over 50% year over year across Europe, which included a 75% decline in Spain, a 63% decline in France, and a nearly 60% drop in Germany. Sales also fell by 33% in Australia, which highlights how widespread the weakness really is.\n\nSince passenger EV sales still account for 78% of Tesla's revenue, the declines are a serious concern in the short term. But most investors are looking further into the future, because there is a belief that products such as the company's AI-powered full self-driving (FSD) software, its Cybercab robotaxi, and its Optimus humanoid robot, could be orders of magnitude more valuable than passenger EVs.\n\nThe Cybercab will run entirely on Tesla's FSD software, so it will be capable of operating autonomously within a ride-hailing network, where it can haul passengers and even make commercial deliveries around the clock. According to Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management, this could make up the lion's share of Tesla's revenue by 2029 and drive the company to an $8.2 trillion valuation, eight times what it's currently worth.\n\nBut Musk thinks Optimus presents an even bigger opportunity because it could be used everywhere from manufacturing facilities to households in the future, so it has significantly more use-cases than the typical car. His recent comments suggest the humanoid robot could rake in $10 trillion in revenue over the long term, making Tesla more valuable than the next five companies combined. For some perspective, the five most valuable companies today are worth a total of $14.8 trillion.\n\nThe case for Meta Platforms\n\nOver 3.3 billion people use one of Meta's social networking apps every day. Since that number is approaching half the world's population, generating user growth is becoming more and more difficult. That's why the company is focusing on boosting engagement instead. Users see more ads when they stay online for a longer period, which translates into more revenue.\n\nMeta has embedded AI into the algorithms on Facebook and Instagram, because it can rapidly learn what type of content people like to see, and it feeds them more of it to keep them interested. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors at various stages last year that this strategy was successfully increasing the amount of time users were spending online.\n\nThe new Meta AI chatbot is also helping the company drive engagement. It's available through all of Meta's apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, where it stands ready to answer complex questions or even suggest fun activities for you and your friends. Meta AI had 700 million monthly active users at the end of 2024, up 50% from just three months earlier.\n\nThe chatbot is powered by the Llama family of large language models (LLMs) that Meta developed in-house. The models are open source and have been downloaded more than 600 million times, which means Meta can crowdsource bug fixes and improvements from a gigantic community of other developers. That's how Llama quickly caught up to industry-leading closed source LLMs like those from OpenAI. Zuckerberg thinks the upcoming Llama 4 model will actually be the most advanced in the industry when it launches this year.\n\nMeta generated a record $164.5 billion in total revenue during 2024, a 22% increase from the prior year. It marked an acceleration from its growth rate of 16% during 2023, which speaks to the company's momentum right now, thanks partly to its efforts in the AI space.\n\nThe verdict\n\nTesla was slashing the sticker price on most of its EVs to spur demand last year, and since sales still declined, the company's earnings per share plunged by 53% year over year. Since its stock also soared 62% in 2024 at the very same time, it now looks extremely expensive, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 173.3.\n\nThat makes Tesla stock five times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 33.7. Meta stock, on the other hand, is actually cheaper than the Nasdaq-100, with a P/E of just 29.1:\n\nAs a result, this choice comes down to valuation. It's hard to justify paying such a steep premium for Tesla stock right now, given the state of its core business. Since products such as the Cybercab and Optimus aren't expected to reach mass production until 2026 or later, passenger EV sales will remain the company's primary revenue source for at least the next 12 months, but probably longer.\n\nBased on what we know from Tesla's January sales, the picture doesn't look very promising, and delivering positive returns might be an uphill battle for its stock this year.\n\nMeta, on the other hand, is growing nicely at the top and bottom line, and yet its stock is cheaper than most of its peers in the tech sector. In my view, it has a much better chance to deliver upside in 2025 for those reasons alone, which makes it a much better buy than Tesla.",

Instead, it contains a detailed guide on how to prevent Meta from accessing one's data and sharing it with third-party advertisers that help them earn revenue.\n\nJohn Oliver and the EFF's Meta Data Protection Guide\n\nThe guide directs users to go to either the Facebook or Instagram account center to put into effect these advertisement and data protection methods. Oliver's website was made in collaboration with the EFF, which helped in creating the step-by-step guide on making one's data less appealing to Zuckerberg and Meta, preventing the company from earning profits.\n\nOliver's guide focuses on stopping Meta from giving users targeted ads based on the data collected from the account owner's activities on other apps and websites, and it also prevents Meta from sharing one's data to target you on other apps.\n\nMoreover, users may also unlink their accounts from the data collected from other apps, which is later shared with Meta. The detailed guide from Oliver and the EFF claims that for users who have linked their accounts on Facebook and Instagram, they only have to change the settings on one platform and it will be applied to the other.\n\nHowever, it if is unlinked, users would have to repeat the steps on the guide to also disable it on the other app.\n\nLastly, Oliver suggested that users should make a switch to privacy-centered browsers like Mozilla's Firefox and install browser extensions like the Privacy Badger that block advertisers and third parties from tracking their activities. There is also a guide on disabling phone advertising identifiers on iOS and Android.",

With this new chapter in our expansion, millions of users across the region now have unlimited free access to one of the world\u2019s most advanced AI assistants conveniently located in the apps you know and love, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\u201d\n\nThe expansion marks a key milestone for Meta\u2019s AI ambitions, and connecting the next billion users via its AI tools. Indeed, Meta further notes that Meta AI is now used by 700 million people every month, up from the 400 million that it reported in September last year.\n\nThe company has gone all-in on AI development, and is planning to spend around $65 billion on infrastructure investment to power its push this year alone.\n\nThat\u2019ll also include around $10 billion for a new subsea cable development, the largest connective project in history, which will help to maximize accessibility for users in Africa and India specifically.\n\nWhich will eventually power this new age of AI functionality for these users, with today\u2019s expansion being just the first step.\n\n\u201cAs we continue Meta AI\u2019s rollout across the region, users can anticipate continued launches of advanced multimodal features that enable greater creativity and connection. Beyond generating text, Meta AI is set to introduce tools like simultaneous dubbing for Reels content, AI image editing, and the highly anticipated \u2018Imagine Me\u2019 feature, which generates personalized portraits based on user photos and prompts.\u201d\n\nYeah, I\u2019m not sure Meta\u2019s image generation tools are as anticipated as Meta seems to think, but Meta highlights that users in these regions will soon be able to \u201cupload an image of the view from your apartment and ask Meta AI to reimagine a whole new world out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to envision yourself with a new hair color or style? Meta AI will be your makeover assistant. These innovations are designed to make advanced AI tools accessible to everyone, ensuring that creativity knows no bounds.\u201d\n\nMeta seems overly keen to push these generative AI elements to users, with in-app prompts asking you to imagine yourself in fantastical scenarios. That, to me at least, is not what social media is about, in sharing real images of real things that are happening in your real life.\n\nBut Meta has the usage data, and clearly, some people are interested in imagining themselves as aliens, or Olympic athletes, or whatever else.\n\nI don\u2019t see the value, but Meta\u2019s once again pushing this as a key functional option for these new users.\n\nMeta\u2019s still working to bring its AI chatbot to all regions, though it remains hamstrung in Europe due to the EU\u2019s more complex AI regulations. Meta executives have repeatedly criticized EU officials for slowing AI progress in the region, and impeding European consumers as a result, but EU officials are looking to take a cautious and measured approach to AI development, including the use of EU user data in such models.\n\nBut eventually, Meta\u2019s hoping to get more people connected to its AI tools, as it looks to establish itself as a leader in the space. And while I don\u2019t think that image generation is the technological leap that Meta seems to suggest, I do think that the next stage of AI creation, in building more complex AR and VR experiences, by simply speaking them into existence, will be significant, and will be a critical evolution of Meta\u2019s AI tools.\n\nAs such, this latest expansion is important in the broader scheme, and will eventually enable Meta to establish more expansive utility for its AI tools.",

After picking up the latest DLC packs on a major sale, I decided to step back into the world and see what I missed.

And when Bungie left the franchise to work on something new, I was there on Day One. And even after exploring all of the content in the original Destiny, I was still having a blast. But after the release of Destiny 2, the lack of companionship was felt more than ever. Destiny 2 feels like a much more social game than the original Destiny, and a solo Guardian was a lonesome one.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThat\u2019s why, after the most recent sale, a few of my friends decided to check it out once again. And I\u2019m happy to have the chance to experience Destiny 2 as intended. Because the difference is night and day. While Destiny 2 can be an okay game to experience on your own, having a dedicated group of friends that can join you on Strikes and missions makes everything much more alive. I tried running Strikes with random players. And it\u2019s very unforgiving, to say the least. You\u2019ve got players that have run these routes hundreds of times before, leaving you in the dust and scrounging to even get a few kills.\n\nBut with friends? It\u2019s so much more relaxed. Even playing through The Witch Queen or the much-maligned Lightfall is so much more fun with a few pals. Finding ways to make the boring story of Lightfall entertaining while screaming about being Spider-Man once Strand powers have been unlocked is a blast. Shooting through waves of enemies is a treat.

I\u2019m not here for the Meta, to be honest. I\u2019m just here to have some fun with my friends and explore the vast worlds ahead of us.\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing like Destiny 2. It\u2019s a beautiful game. One that gives players a chance to meet new friends, explore new planets and locations, and has lore that goes beyond ages. And now that I\u2019ve finally gotten a chance to experience the game as it was originally intended? I finally understand why the fanbase is as dedicated as it is.",

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\nHours after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, users spread a false claim on Facebook that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was paying a bounty for reports of undocumented people.\n\n\u201cBREAKING \u2014 ICE is allegedly offering $750 per illegal immigrant that you turn in through their tip form,\u201d read a post on a page called NO Filter Seeking Truth, adding, \u201cCash in folks.\u201d\n\nCheck Your Fact, Reuters and other fact-checkers debunked the claim, and Facebook added labels to posts warning that they contained false information or missing context. ICE has a tip line but said it does not offer cash bounties.\n\nThis spring, Meta plans to stop working with fact-checkers in the U.S. to label false or misleading content, the company said on Jan. 7. And if a post like the one about ICE goes viral, the pages that spread it could earn a cash bonus.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said in January that the company was removing or dialing back automated systems that reduce the spread of false information. At the same time, Meta is revamping a program that has paid bonuses to creators for content based on views and engagement, potentially pouring accelerant on the kind of false posts it once policed. The new Facebook Content Monetization program is currently invite-only, but Meta plans to make it widely available this year.\n\nThe upshot: a likely resurgence of incendiary false stories on Facebook, some of them funded by Meta, according to former professional Facebook hoaxsters and a former Meta data scientist who worked on trust and safety.\n\nProPublica identified 95 Facebook pages that regularly post made-up headlines designed to draw engagement \u2014 and, often, stoke political divisions. The pages, most of which are managed by people overseas, have a total of more than 7.7 million followers.\n\nAfter a review, Meta said it had removed 81 pages for being managed by fake accounts or misrepresenting themselves as American while posting about politics and social issues. Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesperson, declined to respond to specific questions, including whether any of the pages were eligible for or enrolled in the company\u2019s viral content payout program.\n\nThe pages collected by ProPublica offer a sample of those that could be poised to cash in.\n\nMeta has made debunking viral hoaxes created for money a top priority for nearly a decade, with one executive calling this content the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d Meta has a policy against paying for content its fact-checkers label as false, but that rule will become irrelevant when the company stops working with them. Already, 404 Media found that overseas spammers are earning payouts using deceptive AI-generated content, including images of emaciated people meant to stoke emotion and engagement. Such content is rarely fact-checked because it doesn\u2019t make any verifiable claims.\n\nWith the removal of fact-checks in the U.S., \u201cwhat is the protection now against viral hoaxes for profit?\u201d said Jeff Allen, the chief research officer of the nonprofit Integrity Institute and a former Meta data scientist.\n\n\u201cThe systems are designed to amplify the most salacious and inciting content,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an exchange on Facebook Messenger, the manager of NO Filter Seeking Truth, which shared the false ICE post, told ProPublica that the page has been penalized so many times for sharing false information that Meta won\u2019t allow it to earn money under the current rules. The page is run by a woman based in the southern U.S., who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said she has received threats due to her posts. She said the news about the fact-checking system ending was \u201cgreat information.\u201d\n\nClayton said Meta\u2019s community standards and content moderation teams are still active and reiterated the company\u2019s Jan. 7 statement that it is working to ensure it doesn\u2019t \u201cover-enforce\u201d its rules by mistakenly banning or suppressing content.\n\nMeta\u2019s changes mark a significant reversal of the company\u2019s approach to moderating false and misleading information, reframing the labeling or downranking of content as a form of censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Zuckerberg said in his announcement. His stance reflects the approach of Elon Musk after acquiring Twitter, now X, in 2022. Musk has made drastic cuts to the company\u2019s trust and safety team, reinstated thousands of suspended accounts including that of a prominent neo-Nazi and positioned Community Notes, which allows participating users to add context via notes appended to tweets, as the platform\u2019s key system for flagging false and misleading content.\n\nZuckerberg has said Meta will replace fact-checkers and some automated systems in the U.S. with a version of the Community Notes system. A Jan. 7 update to a Meta policy page said that in the U.S. the company \u201cmay still reduce the distribution of certain hoax content whose spread creates a particularly bad user or product experience (e.g., certain commercial hoaxes).\u201d\n\nClayton did not clarify whether posts with notes appended to them would be eligible for monetization. He provided links to academic papers that detail how crowdsourced fact-checking programs like Community Notes can be effective at identifying misinformation, building trust among users and addressing perceptions of bias.\n\nA 2023 ProPublica investigation, as well as reporting from Bloomberg, found that X\u2019s Community Notes failed to effectively address the misinformation about the Israel-Hamas conflict. Reporting from the BBC and Agence France-Presse showed that X users who share false information have earned thousands of dollars thanks to X\u2019s content monetization program, which also rewards high engagement.\n\nKeith Coleman, X\u2019s vice president of product, previously told ProPublica that the analysis of Community Notes about the Israel-Hamas conflict did not include all of the relevant notes, and he said that the program \u201cis found helpful by people globally, across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nAllen said it takes time, resources and oversight to scale up crowdsourced fact-checking systems. Meta\u2019s decision to scrap fact-checking before giving the new approach time to prove itself is risky, he said.\n\n\u201cWe could in theory have a Community Notes program that was as effective, if not more effective, than the fact-checking program,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to turn all these things off before you have the Community Notes thing in place definitely feels like we\u2019re explicitly going to have a moment with little guardrails.\u201d\n\nBefore Facebook began cracking down on content in late 2016, American fake news peddlers and spammers based in North Macedonia and elsewhere cashed in on viral hoaxes that deepened political divisions and played on people\u2019s fears.\n\nOne American, Jestin Coler, ran a network of sites that earned money from hoax news stories for nearly a decade, including the infamous and false viral headline from 2016 \u201cFBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide.\u201d He previously told NPR that he started the sites as a way to \u201cinfiltrate the echo chambers of the alt-right.\u201d Coler said he earned five figures a month from the sites, which he operated in his spare time.\n\nWhen people clicked on the links to the stories in their news feed, they landed on websites full of ads, which generated revenue for Coler. That\u2019s become a tougher business model since Meta has made story links less visible on Facebook in recent years.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new program to pay publishers directly for viral content could unlock a fresh revenue stream for hoaxsters. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same formula to get people riled up. It seems like it could just go right back to those days, like overnight,\u201d Coler told ProPublica in a phone interview. He said he left the Facebook hoax business years ago and won\u2019t return.\n\nIn January, ProPublica compiled a list of pages that had been previously cited for posting hoaxes and false content and discovered dozens more through domain and content searches. The pages posted false headlines designed to spark controversy, such as \u201cLia Thomas Admits: \u2018I Faked Being Trans to Expose How Gullible the Left Is\u2019\u201d and \u201cElon Musk announced that he has acquired MSNBC for $900 million to put an end to toxic programming.\u201d The Musk headline was paired with an AI-generated image of him holding a contract with the MSNBC logo. It generated over 11,000 reactions, shares and comments.\n\nMost of the pages are managed by accounts outside of the U.S., including in North Macedonia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, according to data from Facebook. Many of these pages use AI-generated images to illustrate their made-up headlines.\n\nOne network of overseas-run pages is connected to the site SpaceXMania.com, an ad-funded site filled with hoax articles like \u201cElon Musk Confronts Beyonc\u00e9 Publicly: \u2018Stop Pretending to Be Country, It\u2019s Just Not You.\u2019\u201d SpaceX Fanclub, the network\u2019s largest Facebook page, has close to 220,000 followers and labels its content as satire. One of its recent posts was a typo-laden AI-generated image of a sign that said, \u201cThere Are Only 2 2 Genders And Will Ban Atheletes From Women Sports \u2014 President.\u201d\n\nSpaceXMania.com\u2019s terms and conditions page says it\u2019s owned by Funky Creations LTD, a United Kingdom company registered to Muhammad Shabayer Shaukat, a Pakistani national. ProPublica sent questions to the site and received an email response signed by Tim Lawson, who said he\u2019s an American based in Florida who works with Shaukat. (ProPublica was unable to locate a person by that name in public records searches, based on the information he provided.)\n\n\u201cOur work involves analyzing the latest trends and high-profile news related to celebrities and shaping it in a way that appeals to a specific audience \u2014 particularly conservatives and far-right groups who are predisposed to believe certain narratives,\u201d the email said.\n\nLawson said they earn between $500 and $1,500 per month from web ads and more than half of the traffic comes from people clicking on links on Facebook. The pages are not currently enrolled in the invitation-only Facebook Content Monetization program, according to Lawson.\n\nThe SpaceXMania pages identified by ProPublica were recently taken offline. Lawson denied that they were removed by Meta and said he deactivated the pages \u201cdue to some security reasons.\u201d Meta declined to comment.\n\nIt remains to be seen how hoax page operators will fare as Meta\u2019s algorithmic reversals take hold and the U.S. fact-checking program grinds to a halt. But some Facebook users are already taking advantage of the loosened guardrails.\n\nSoon after Zuckerberg announced the changes, people spread a fake screenshot of a Bloomberg article headlined, \u201cThe spark from Zuckerberg\u2019s electric penis pump, might be responsible for the LA fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunity note: verified true,\u201d wrote one commenter.",

            "content": "Meta platforms, led by CEO Mark Zuckerburg, has been experiencing quite a resurgence over the past several months, marked by significant financial gains and technological advancements.\n\nStrong financial performance\n\nMeta\u2019s revenue increased 21% during the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching $48.4 billion. Profits surged to $8.02 per share, proving that META has a strong business model that can capitalize on emerging trends.\n\nKey drivers of this success are Meta\u2019s push into artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR). Improving these technologies has helped attract advertisers who use the tools to optimize their campaigns for better results.\n\nMeta has seen the number of advertisers using the technology increase from one million to four million in just six months, and that trend is likely to continue. Meta says they will invest even more in the technology and plan to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025.\n\nUsers can see the impact of AI across META\u2019s platforms. Machine learning enhances content recommendations, advertising strategies, and even user safety, helping META become a leader in AI-driven digital experiences.\n\nAR is also becoming a strong growth area for META thanks to a successful launch of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. Some of the features these smart glasses provide include environment recognition, real-time translations, and multimedia capabilities.\n\nThese glasses got a nice boost when Oprah Winfrey featured them in her 2024 gift guide. Some glasses even fetch a resale value above $1,000, highlighting their desirability. This success will likely pave the way for even more immersive technology from META in the future.\n\nChallenges in the metaverse\n\nDespite Meta\u2019s hot streak, not all of its ventures are thriving. The company\u2019s Reality Labs division, which focuses on the metaverse and VR/AR technologies, has reported significant losses. Since its inception, Reality Labs has accumulated a total loss of $68.9 billion. Its revenue has also declined, dropping from $2.3 billion in 2021 to $2.1 billion in 2024.\n\nCritics of META point to a lack of meaningful metrics and user engagement data to support META\u2019s claim that consumers are ready to embrace the metaverse vision fully. To maintain its momentum, Meta is introducing cost-saving measures that include a 10% reduction in equity-based awards for employees. By cutting costs in non-core areas and doubling down on AI and AR, Meta is hoping for sustained growth.\n\nMeta\u2019s current hot streak is a testament to its adaptability and innovation. While challenges remain, Meta\u2019s strategic investments in AI and AR suggest that the company is betting on the future rather than just the present. If these bets pay off, it could be the beginning of a new era of technological dominance.\n\nFollow GeekSided to stay up to date with META advancements",

According to a corporate filing, the company has increased executive bonuses to 200% of their base salary\u2014more than double the previous 75%.The decision, approved on 13 February 2025 by Meta\u2019s Compensation, Nominating, and Governance Committee (CNGC), does not include CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Meta justified the increase by stating that its executive compensation was falling behind industry competitors, as reported by Moneycontrol.Meta\u2019s board argued that, before the hike, the \u201ctarget total cash compensation\u201d for executives was \u201cat or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions\u201d at rival companies. The company stated, \u201cFollowing this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation.\u201dThe board insisted the move was necessary to retain top talent and keep compensation competitive within the industry. However, the timing of the announcement has sparked widespread criticism.The news comes shortly after Meta laid off around 5% of its global workforce, citing \u201clow performance\u201d as the reason for job cuts. The layoffs triggered backlash on social media, with many accusing the company of prioritising executive pay over regular employees\u2019 livelihoods.One social media user wrote, \u201cExecutives always think they are deserving of more money, regardless of their performance. And they rarely think regular workers are deserving of more money.\u201d Another user added, \u201cAlways more for the top, less for workers. Meanwhile, thousands are out of work looking for opportunities. I wish we could easily avoid Meta, but it's hard to avoid in this social media era.\u201dBeyond public backlash, some former Meta employees have accused the company of unfairly dismissing workers. Many believe the layoffs were not truly performance-related but motivated by cost-cutting measures.Some claim they lost their jobs for reasons other than poor performance, including taking approved leave. \u201cMeta is the cruelest tech company,\u201d one former employee stated, alleging the company was more focused on financial gain than treating its workforce fairly.While some acknowledge that Meta\u2019s executive pay hike brings compensation in line with industry standards, they argue the timing is poor. A social media user commented, \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the new bonus plan is intended to bring Meta\u2019s executive compensation more in line with industry standards. However, the timing of the announcement has raised eyebrows, given the significant job cuts happening within the company.\u201dThe stark contrast between rewarding top executives and cutting thousands of jobs has intensified scrutiny on Meta\u2019s leadership. As the company navigates this backlash, questions remain about how it will balance profitability with ethical workforce management",

But eventually, the idea is that AI tools, powered by devices like Meta\u2019s Ray Ban glasses, will enable you to simply ask the assistant to do things for you, and the system will be attuned to your personal preferences, budget, and other specifics.\n\nWhich could be hugely beneficial, much more so than the basic chatbot interface.\n\nThere\u2019s still a way to go, but this function, currently in early testing on IG, seems like an early step in that direction.",

            "content": "Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nWhile there numerous augmented reality (AR) glasses like the Xreal One and RayNeo Air 2s available for enthusiasts looking for the next generation of eyewear, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses is a comparatively straightforward eyewear experience. While those AR glasses provide a big-screen viewing experience in a familiar form factor, the Ray-Ban Meta more closely resembles traditional specs without the bulky frames necessary to accommodate micro-LED displays and complex optics.\n\nAs a result, the Meta glasses are a less ambitious and fundamentally different product, but one that deserves your attention nonetheless. Whereas AR glasses are more adept at providing an immersive multimedia experience or expanding your workspace for productivity tasks, our Ray-Ban Meta review unit (in the \"Headliner\" style) can be thought of as a helpful digital assistant that can scan your environment to provide beneficial feedback/information, capture moments with the 12MP camera, respond to your voice controls, and even playback audio thanks to the built-in speakers.\n\nWith a price of $299, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are a pricey extension of the capabilities already built-in to your smartphone, but it\u2019s still an interesting product that could find an audience because it looks like glasses more than anything else.\n\nDesign of the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses\n\nUnlike AR glasses, our Ray-Ban Meta \u201cHeadliner\u201d review unit mostly resembles a pair of thick eyeglasses/sunglasses. The frames are made entirely of plastic with integrated nose pads and foldable arms. Our review unit is made of translucent brown plastic (or as Ray-Ban calls it, \"Shiny Warm Stone\"), allowing you to see the electronics incorporated in the arms. The translucent plastic reminds me of turn-of-the-century iMacs, and it\u2019s not exactly my cup of tea. I would have preferred solid black or blue if I had chosen a pair of frames for myself (which you can find on Ray-Ban\u2019s website ).\n\nBesides the clear view of the internals, there are other giveaways to the intent of these glasses. There is a 12MP camera (3024 x 4032 pixels) on the top left of the frame and a round LED indicator on the top right. Other giveaways are two pogo pins above the nose pads for charging the glasses with the smart case, two open-air speakers (one on each arm), a capture button on the top of the right arm, and a power switch on the inside of the left arm.\n\nImage 1 of 6 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThere is a touch-sensitive area on the right arm, situated to the left of the Ray-Ban logo. You can swipe towards the front of the glasses to increase the volume and swipe in the opposite direction to lower the volume. You tap and hold to activate Meta AI.\n\nThe glasses are light without feeling cheap, and the metal hinge swings smoothly when you open them to affix them to your face.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe Meta glasses come in a faux leather case with an integrated battery that provides enough power for 32 hours of use (eight total charges for the glasses). The case has a USB Type-C port on the bottom for charging, and the snap-button enclosure has an integrated LED light ring that glows green when charging. When you slide the Meta glasses into the case, two Pogo pins supply power to recharge them.\n\nUsing the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses\n\nSetting up the glasses was relatively straightforward. They came pre-charged so I could get started quickly. I left the glasses in the included case and downloaded Meta View, the companion app for the glasses, to my iPhone. The app searched for and found my glasses. It then performed a firmware update to ensure that the glasses were running the latest version of the software provided by Meta.\n\nAfter that, I was on my own to explore the Meta glasses' many uses. My first step was to turn them on and place them on my face. After a little sound prompt to acknowledge that I was wearing the glasses, a male voice called out the percentage of charge for the glasses (in this case, 89%).\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nMy review unit didn\u2019t have a prescription or tinted lenses in place. Instead, it had clear lenses, allowing me to wear them around the house without impacting my vision (I wear contacts daily). Pressing the silver capture button on the top of the right arm snaps a picture. In my opinion, the images come out a tad underexposed, but they\u2019re perfectly fine for a quick post on social media. Press and hold the capture button for about a second, and it will begin capturing video (1080p at 30 fps). However, due to space and battery constraints, video footage is limited to one minute in length by default, but you can extend that to up to 3 minutes. The Meta View app does warn that setting the time limit to 3 minutes will drain your battery faster. You can also select lower thresholds of 30 seconds and 15 seconds.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThe round LED notification light is activated when taking photos or videos. When you snap a picture, the notification light flashes. Likewise, it blinks when you record a video. Meta implemented this feature to let those around you know that you\u2019re recording, perhaps to reduce the \u201ccreep\u201d factor. You cannot disable this notification light in the app.\n\nMeta crammed five microphones into the glasses, so voices and ambient sounds are picked up well in video recordings with the glasses. Also, the captured video was surprisingly clear and crisp.\n\nRay-Ban Meta Glasses demo - YouTube Watch On\n\nOnce you\u2019ve loaded the glasses with photos and videos, how do you offload them for future use? Well, you\u2019ll need to fire up the Meta View app on your phone. On the app\u2019s homepage, there\u2019s a Gallery feature. Open the gallery, select the media you want to transfer to your phone and tap the Import button.\n\nAt that point, the glasses will create a Wi-Fi network to transfer the images to your smartphone. The time it takes to create the network and transfer the media files depends on how much data you\u2019re trying to move (the glasses have 32GB of storage capacity). Of course, if your assortment is video-heavy, it will take longer. But to give you an idea of how long you\u2019ll be waiting, I transferred 15 images and a minute-long video, and it took 15 seconds from the time I hit import until the last files were transferred to my iPhone. That included the time it took to establish the Wi-Fi connection between the two devices.\n\nWhile you can transfer media whenever you want, you can also have the glasses perform this task automatically. The Meta View app can auto-import media when the glasses are turned on and charging within the case.\n\nMeta AI Assistant\n\nBesides the usual photo and video-taking tasks, the glasses also have a built-in Meta AI assistant. The assistant is invoked by saying \u201cHey Meta,\u201d which responds with a sound prompt. You can then ask it questions as you would with Siri or the Google Assistant. I first asked it something simple, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather?\u201d However, the assistant told me that I needed to specify my location. So, I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in Garner, NC,\u201d and it told me: \u201cIn Garner, North Carolina, it's currently snowing at 27 degrees Fahrenheit. Today's forecast is a high of 29 degrees Fahrenheit and a low of 23 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s simple stuff, but Meta AI can also use the onboard camera to identify objects within your line of sight. For example, I looked at my dog and said, \u201cHey, Meta. What kind of dog is this?\u201d It responded correctly, stating, \u201cThis appears to be a small, white dog with wiry fur. It may be a Schnauzer or Terrier mix breed.\u201d I do in fact have a Miniature Schnauzer.\n\nMeta AI correctly identified all sorts of objects, including food, plants, and household objects. Again, I can already do this by snapping a picture with my iPhone. However, the Meta glasses are a more low-impact way of identifying objects without needing to point-and-shoot with your phone.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nYou can even use Meta AI to perform more mundane tasks. You can ask it to take a picture or a video without pressing the capture button. For calls and messaging, you can give the Meta View app permission to access your phone\u2019s contacts, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram. You can then make and receive calls or send messages using those respective apps using Meta AI. The onboard microphones and speakers are perfect for outgoing and incoming calls. Speech processing was impeccable, and callers on the other end said my voice was loud and clear.\n\nBecause the Meta glasses identify as a standard Bluetooth audio device, they can also be used to stream audio from your phone. I listened to tunes from YouTube Music and watched plenty of videos on YouTube and from my Plex Media library on my phone, using the glasses for audio. While lacking in bass, the audio clarity was excellent and distortion-free. There was none of the tinniness that I often find with cheap AR glasses. I\u2019d liken the quality of the open-air speakers to the Bose-tuned speakers on the Xreal One.\n\nThe Meta View app has many settings to tailor your Meta AI experience. For example, there\u2019s app integration with Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, Calm, and Shazam accounts. So, you can play music hands-free with Spotify and Apple Music or ask Meta AI to identify a song playing in the background with Shazam.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in the review, the default voice for Meta AI was a synthetic male voice, which Meta calls Sage. There\u2019s also another male voice, Indigo, and a female voice, Aspen. However, four celebrity voices that use AI to produce speech are available: Awkwafina, John Cena, Kristen Bell, and Keegan-Michael Key. I find Keegan-Michael Key to be hilarious, so I settled on his voice for Meta AI.\n\n\n\nBattery Life\n\nBattery life isn\u2019t the glasses' strong suit. Meta says that with normal use, they will last up to four hours per charge, but your mileage will vary. That figure largely depends on what you\u2019re using the glasses for. If you\u2019re taking a lot of pictures and videos, expect to use up the battery in an hour or less.\n\nStarting with a full battery (just 154 mAh), I used the glasses to take a couple dozen photos and one 30-second video. I also performed about a dozen Meta AI requests, including two that required taking a snapshot to identify objects. I also played some YouTube Music at a moderate volume with the glasses. After an hour, the battery dropped from 100% to 75%, which matches Meta\u2019s estimates. However, when capturing a copious number of 3-minute videos, I saw 50% battery erosion in just an hour.\n\nIf you intend to go heavy on video capture, bring the camera case with you. Meta says the case will take your glasses from empty to 50% in around 20 minutes. A full charge from empty takes around 75 minutes with the charging case. The charging case provides 32 hours\u2019 worth of juice, enough to recharge the glasses from empty to full eight times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nI\u2019ve enjoyed using the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. They\u2019re very low-impact, mostly resembling a pair of glasses with no obstructions blocking your field of view (unlike AR glasses). The images and videos taken with the glasses also look good, although not as good as on a modern iPhone or Galaxy smartphone. However, they\u2019re good enough for social media or sharing with family.\n\nIn addition, Meta AI is generally useful. It provides quick answers to questions without needing to check your phone for help. It also answers calls, allows hands-free access to popular music streaming services, and has good audio quality, allowing you to better enjoy those glorious tunes.\n\nBut best of all, the glasses allow you to capture moments without getting in the way. Whipping my phone out to take a picture can waste precious seconds to capture something happening before my eyes versus just clicking the capture button on the glasses. If I\u2019m at a school performance for one of my kids, I\u2019d feel a bit out of place with a smartphone outstretched in front of me, which gets in the way of me enjoying the performance rather than just looking at the stage like a normal human being.\n\nIn moments like these, I can appreciate what Meta is trying to accomplish with these glasses. Whether it\u2019s worth spending at least $299 is up to you.",

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nMeta may have recently slashed up to 5% of its workforce, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from introducing a lucrative new executive bonus scheme.\n\nAccording to a recent SEC filing, executive officers at Meta can now get up to 200% of their base salary in the form of an annual performance-based payout, up from 75%. Meta says the move is based on its analysis of executive compensation at comparable companies, as well as input from its \u201cindependent compensation consultant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe filing says the \u201cvariable cash incentives\u201d are meant to \u201cmotivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities\u201d and \u201creward them for company results and achievements.\u201d The decision to boost executive compensation won't impact CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal pay packet, according to the filing.\n\nMeta started laying off US-based employees earlier this month, with their severance packages including 16 weeks of pay plus an extra two weeks for each year of service.

Meta also recently opted to reduce its annual distribution of stock options by about 10% for most of its staff, The Financial Times reports, reducing the total compensation for tens of thousands of employees.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news of larger executive payouts comes as Meta is recording some of its highest-ever profits. The company reported a net income of $62 billion in its 2024 financial year, a 59% year-over-year increase, while revenues were also up 22%.\n\nMeta announced in January it plans to invest as much as $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, including making numerous new hires in artificial intelligence roles and building a 1-gigawatt data center that \"would cover a significant part of Manhattan.\"",

David Zalubowski via Associated Press\n\nMeta isn\u2019t alone in winding down diversity initiatives, as McDonald\u2019s, Ford Motor Co. and Walmart have made similar moves in recent months.\n\nZuckerberg told Rogan that he now feels a \u201cmuch greater command\u201d over what Meta\u2019s policies should be, and dismissed the idea that the changes are \u201cpurely political\u201d due to their proximity to last year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe tech billionaire \u2014 whose company donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund after Zuckerberg met with him in late November \u2014 caught up with the president-elect at his Florida estate Friday, according to Semafor.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s discussion with Rogan, a UFC color commentator and Trump supporter, comes just days after the tech billionaire named Dana White, the MMA organization\u2019s CEO and a pal to the president-elect, to Meta\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThough Trump once threatened Zuckerberg with \u201clife in prison\u201d after claiming that he\u2019d \u201csteered\u201d Facebook against him amid the 2020 elections, the Meta CEO seemed to use Rogan\u2019s podcast to move closer to the president-elect.\n\nHe said that administration officials under Democratic President Joe Biden would \u201cscream\u201d and \u201ccurse\u201d at Meta employees over content moderation, including around the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was brutal,\u201d Zuckerberg said, recalling government bodies \u201cinvestigating and coming after our company.\u201d He later added that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump, saying that the president-elect \u201cjust wants America to win.\u201d\n\nRelated...",

            "content": "After another round of mass layoffs and reports of slashed stock options for remaining employees, Meta has like clockwork opted to reward its top executives with a substantial bonus increase.\n\nThe Facebook giant revealed in a government filing that its Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (CNGC) approved a target annual bonus increase for its top executive officers bar CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The bonus was raised from 75 percent of base salary to a whopping 200 percent, effective with the 2025 annual performance period.\n\n\"Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation,\" the filing notes. It added that prior to the adjustment, those executives were only at or below the 15th percentile in total cash compensation compared to their peers.\n\nAccording to Meta's April 2024 proxy statement [PDF], CTO Andrew Bosworth's base salary was $945,000. His actual eligible earnings were slightly lower due to the timing of his raise. However, factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and Meta's 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023, his total bonus payout amounted to about $1.05 million.\n\nAssuming Bosworth's salary remains the same, and Meta's company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025, the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly $3 million. That's before any stock-based compensation and other add-ons. And he's not even the highest-paid member of Meta's named executive team.\n\nFor balance's sake, and some might find this hard to swallow but, $3 million annual cash compensation for a CTO in Bosworth's position is about right for Silicon Valley; it's nothing outrageous, relatively speaking. The vast majority of his pay package is in shares; in 2023 for instance, he was awarded more than $20 million in stock. The salary, like for many in his role, is the cherry on top of an enormous cake.\n\nSome of that bonus cash, though, might be coming from Meta's latest round of layoffs, which saw around 3,700 people - about five percent of its workforce - axed this month. The cut reportedly targeted low performers, and followed a year in which the biz reported a net income of $62.36 billion, a 59 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nThis comes reports surfaced this week that Meta has cut back on its yearly distribution of stock options by 10 percent to most staff, though we do note that the corp's share price has climbed 10 percent in the past month, and 46 percent for the past year.\n\nWe've reached out to Meta to confirm reports of the stock option cut.\n\nZuckerberg started 2025 by describing Meta's plans for the year as \"intense,\" with massive AI investments lined up as the Facebook maker shifts focus beyond its struggling metaverse ambitions.\n\nFollowing OpenAI's announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to $500 billion in an AI infrastructure project dubbed Stargate, Zuckerberg announced his own AI spending plans - Meta would pour $60 billion or more to expand its AI infrastructure in 2025.\n\n\"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,\" Zuckerberg said of the effort. Hopefully it will prove more successful than that Metaverse shift for the sake of those executives' bonuses. \u00ae",

            "content": "A recent study by the German digital rights organization Eko has revealed that Meta and X (formerly Twitter) approved advertisements containing violent anti-Muslim and antisemitic hate speech ahead of Germany\u2019s federal election on February 23, 2025. These findings raise significant concerns about the platforms\u2019 content moderation practices and their potential impact on the electoral process.\n\nEko\u2019s investigation involved submitting deliberately harmful political ads to Meta and X to assess their ad approval systems. Alarmingly, X approved all 10 of the submitted hate speech ads, while Meta approved five out of ten, despite both companies\u2019 policies prohibiting such content. Some ads featured AI-generated imagery depicting hateful narratives without disclosing their artificial origin. Meta\u2019s policies require such disclosures for social issues, elections, or political ads, yet half of these undisclosed AI-generated ads were still approved.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Involvement in German Politics\n\nIn addition to platform-specific issues, Elon Musk, the owner of X, has actively engaged in Germany\u2019s political discourse. In December 2024, Musk tweeted, \u2018Only the AfD can save Germany,\u2019 expressing support for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party. He also hosted a live stream with AfD leader Alice Weidel on X, providing the party with a significant platform during the election period.\n\nThe Digital Services Act and EU Investigations\n\nIn addition, Meta failed to enforce its own AI content policies. Some of the submitted ads contained AI-generated imagery depicting hateful narratives, yet Meta approved half of these without requiring disclosure that AI was used\u2014a direct contradiction to its policy mandating transparency for AI-generated political content.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that Meta\u2019s AI-driven ad moderation systems remain fundamentally broken, despite the Digital Services Act (DSA) now being in full effect\u201c.\n\nEko has submitted its findings to the European Commission, which oversees the DSA\u2019s enforcement. The organization argues that neither Meta nor X fully comply with the act\u2019s hate speech and ad transparency provisions. This aligns with Eko\u2019s prior investigation in 2023, which similarly found Meta approving harmful ads despite the DSA\u2019s impending implementation.\n\n\u201cRather than strengthening its ad review process or hate speech policies, Meta appears to be backtracking across the board,\u201d an Eko spokesperson said. The statement points to Meta\u2019s recent decisions to scale back its fact-checking and moderation policies, which they argue could place the company in direct violation of the DSA.\n\nPotential Penalties Under the DSA\n\nViolations of the DSA could lead to significant penalties, including fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. If systemic non-compliance is proven, regulators could even impose temporary access restrictions on platforms within the EU. However, the EU has yet to finalize its decisions on Meta and X, leaving the possibility of enforcement actions uncertain.\n\nCivil Society Organizations Raise Alarm Over Election Security\n\nWith Germany\u2019s election imminent, digital rights groups warn that the DSA has not provided adequate protection against tech-driven election manipulation. A separate study from Global Witness found that algorithmic feeds on X and TikTok favor AfD content over other political parties. Researchers have also accused X of limiting data access, preventing independent studies on election-related misinformation\u2014despite the DSA requiring platform transparency.\n\n\u201cBig Tech will not clean up its platforms voluntarily,\u201d Eko\u2019s spokesperson stated. \u201cRegulators must take strong action\u2014both in enforcing the DSA and implementing pre-election mitigation measures.\u201d\n\nWill Regulators Step In Before the Election?\n\nAs German voters prepare to go to the polls, pressure is mounting on EU regulators to act swiftly to prevent further disinformation and hate speech from spreading online. Despite calls for intervention, neither Meta nor X has publicly responded to Eko\u2019s latest findings. With election integrity at stake, the question remains: Will Meta and X adjust their policies in response to regulatory pressure, or will the EU take more decisive action to enforce compliance?\n\nRead More: Meta Rolls Out Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",

This isn't an uncommon practice since chief executive compensation can be structured differently, focusing more on stock options.\n\nMeta also recently trimmed the value of annual equity refreshers some staffers receive by about 10%, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with BI but asked not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak with the media.\n\nThe reduction in the total amount of restricted stock units means some employees would receive about 10% less in the stock refreshers each quarter this year that vest over a four-year period.\n\nThat means, for example, if an employee previously received $220,000 in stock refreshers to vest over four years, they would now get about $200,000 worth of RSUs over the same period. Equity refreshers often form a significant part of workers' remuneration alongside salary and bonuses.\n\nA Meta spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the SEC filing, the company wrote that its compensation, nominating, and governance committee approved the change after analyzing market data for executive compensation. They determined the target total cash compensation for their executives \"was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions.\"\n\nThe new target puts the compensation in the 50th percentile, according to the filing.\n\nThe approval came amid another round of job cuts at Meta this month. The company said it aimed to eliminate about 5% of its workforce, which would amount to nearly 4,000 employees.\n\nZuckerberg said the cuts were meant to target \"low performers\" as the company looked to streamline its operations in \"an intense year\" and invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nIn an internal memo announcing the cuts last month, Zuckerberg said Meta would backfill these roles this year.

            "content": "Meta executives can now make bonuses valued at up to 200% of their base salaries.\n\nMeta is giving its top executives bigger bonuses than ever as it tries to stay competitive with other tech giants.\n\nOn Thursday, Meta wrote in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it had \"approved an increase\" in the target bonus percentage for its executive officers. The target has more than doubled, from 75% of their base salaries as a bonus in 2023 and 2024, to 200% in 2025.\n\nRelated: 'There Are Repercussions': Meta Reminds Staff of Its Strict No-Leaks Policy \u2014 That Has Since Been Leaked to the Press\n\nAccording to the filing, the bonus plan \"provides variable cash incentives\" that \"motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities\" and \"reward them for company results and achievements.\"\n\nLast week, meanwhile, Meta laid off 5% of its 72,000-person workforce (about 3,600 employees) via email. Zuckerberg said the cuts were aimed at \"low performers,\" though workers are challenging that notion. According to Business Insider, Meta is currently increasing its hiring efforts for machine-learning engineers.\n\nIn approving the bonus increase, Meta said it considered how the payouts compared to others in the space, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Per the filing, the company found that the bonuses it paid out in 2024 were \"at or below the 15th percentile\" of bonuses received by executives in similar roles at peer companies. After the target bonus percentage increases to 200% this year, Meta will be \"at approximately the 50th percentile,\" a more balanced midway point with its peers.\n\nThe increase applies to Meta's Chief Financial Officer Susan Li; Chief Product Officer Christopher K. Cox; Chief Operating Officer Javier Olivan; and Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth. Each made around $1 million in bonuses in 2023, according to an April 2024 SEC filing.\n\nAny change in bonuses does not apply to Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who earns a base salary of $1 and does not participate in bonus or equity compensation. Zuckerberg received $24.4 million in \"other compensation\" in 2023, for costs like security and personal use of private aircraft.\n\nThe new bonus percentage also arrives as Meta cuts its annual distribution of stock options by 10% for thousands of workers, according to a Thursday Financial Times report.\n\nThe median pay at Meta was $379,000 in 2023, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the No. 2 richest person in the world with $245 billion, per Bloomberg.",

It will not extend to ads (which can be Community Noted on X)\n\nApproved Community Notes contributors will have 500 characters to explain their concern with the content, and will also be required to include a reference link for context.\n\nMeta\u2019s even created a new mini-site to explain this approach.\n\nBut what Meta hasn\u2019t included in this new overview is an explanation of the key element that renders Community Notes on X largely ineffective as a misinformation-addressing system: That users of conflicting political beliefs will need to agree that a note is necessary before it\u2019s displayed in the app.\n\nAs Meta explained in its initial overview of how Community Notes will work:\n\n\u201cJust like they do on X, Community Notes will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings.\u201d\n\nThe idea being that this will redress any preferential bias by ensuring that there\u2019s agreement between people of opposing ideologies.\n\nBut as research on X has shown, that means that a lot of Community Notes never get shown to users as a result, even when they do highlight provable misinformation.\n\nIn fact, according to analysis conducted by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a whopping 73% of Community Notes related to political topics are never displayed, despite them providing valuable context.\n\nThis chart highlights the topics most likely to fail on this front, and it\u2019s no surprise that things like election interference will never reach agreement from people on both sides of the ideological aisle.\n\nAnd in a time where the President himself is prone to amplifying misleading, and often flat out incorrect information, that could be extremely problematic, essentially eliminating any sort of barrier that might limit the amplification of such claims.\n\nWhich, at Facebook\u2019s scale, could be far more problematic than it is on X.\n\nThere\u2019s also no definitive explanation as to how Meta will determine a contributor\u2019s political leanings.\n\nOn X, contributor perspective is based on how people have rated notes in the past, with the idea being that \u201ccontributors who tend to rate the same notes similarly are likely to have more similar perspectives.\u201d X also ascertains political leanings, \u201cby analyzing X's follow, like, and repost graphs,\u201d and that combined analysis helps X determine your personal, ideological perspective.\n\nFacebook already tracks people\u2019s political leanings (as you\u2019ll find in the \u201cAd Preferences\u201d section of the \u201cPrivacy Center\u201d), so it likely already has some strong indicators on this front, but this is another measure that would provide transparency, and highlight potential flaws in how its Community Notes process will work.\n\nAlso worth noting: Community Notes on X has already been infiltrated by organized groups of contributors who collaborate to up and downvote Notes, based on political and/or philosophical alignment.\n\nEven Elon himself has repeatedly admitted that Community Notes is being \u201cgamed by state actors,\u201d with his latest revelation on this front coming this week. \u201cUnfortunately, @CommunityNotes is increasingly being gamed by governments & legacy media. Working to fix this,\u201d Musk shared in a now-deleted post.\n\nConveniently, Meta has included any of this context in its overview of Community Notes, its great new solution for detecting and limiting misinformation in its apps. Which now reach over 3.3 billion people per month.\n\nWhich is more than a third of the world\u2019s population.\n\nBut sure, should be fine. Big thumbs up all round. Community Notes FTW.\n\nMeta says that it will be phasing in Community Notes \u201cover the next few months.\u201d",

This isn't an uncommon practice since chief executive compensation can be structured differently, focusing more on stock options.\n\nMeta also recently trimmed the value of annual equity refreshers some staffers receive by about 10%, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with BI but asked not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak with the media.\n\nThe reduction in the total amount of restricted stock units means some employees would receive about 10% less in the stock refreshers each quarter this year that vest over a four-year period.\n\nThat means, for example, if an employee previously received $220,000 in stock refreshers to vest over four years, they would now get about $200,000 worth of RSUs over the same period. Equity refreshers often form a significant part of workers' remuneration alongside salary and bonuses.\n\nA Meta spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the SEC filing, the company wrote that its compensation, nominating, and governance committee approved the change after analyzing market data for executive compensation. They determined the target total cash compensation for their executives \"was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions.\"\n\nThe new target puts the compensation in the 50th percentile, according to the filing.\n\nThe approval came amid another round of job cuts at Meta this month. The company said it aimed to eliminate about 5% of its workforce, which would amount to nearly 4,000 employees.\n\nZuckerberg said the cuts were meant to target \"low performers\" as the company looked to streamline its operations in \"an intense year\" and invest heavily in artificial intelligence.",

Also, tech giants like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Salesforce (CRM) have cut jobs in 2025, shifting budgets toward AI.\n\nMeta is working to redirect funds from stock awards to boost its AI infrastructure.

Premi\u00e8rement, je pense qu'il y a le risque imm\u00e9diat de voir surgir des informations erron\u00e9es sur la plateforme, alors que Meta s'\u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs organisations de v\u00e9rification des faits \u00e0 travers le monde pour lutter contre les informations erron\u00e9es. D'ici au mois de mars 2025, la d\u00e9cision d'arr\u00eater le fact-checking sur Meta va entrer en vigueur. Il annonce que les fact-checks vont \u00eatre remplac\u00e9s par un syst\u00e8me de notes de communaut\u00e9 qui n'est pas encore tr\u00e8s clair. On n'en sait pas grand-chose sur comment les notes de communaut\u00e9 vont \u00eatre choisies, sur quelle base, le niveau de pertinence des r\u00e9ponses sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es. Tout \u00e7a reste ambigu. Ce qui est s\u00fbr, c'est qu'il y a un risque de voir surgir une surabondance de fake news.\n\nAss Momar Lo (AML): Meta scrapped fact-checking on its platform in the US, which is not without consequences. As Meta dealt with various international fact-checking organizations to combat false information, I believe there is an immediate risk of this false information appearing on its platform. The decision to end fact-checking on Meta will be effective by March 2025. Although Meta announced that Community Notes would replace fact-checking, this remains unclear. We don\u2019t know much about how the Community Notes will be selected, on what basis, or how relevant the suggested answers will be. What is clear is that a plethora of fake news will likely appear.\n\nJS: What type of fake news has the most significant impact on the continent?\n\nAML: Il est difficile de dire avec certitude quel genre de fake news semble avoir le plus d'impact, mais sur la base de notre exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 Africa Check, on se rend compte que beaucoup de fake news qui touchent aux sujets d'ordre social ont beaucoup d'impact. Je cite un exemple r\u00e9cent au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal qui date de juillet 2024. Des fake news ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es disant que le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique offrait des logements gratuits aux populations qui sont dans la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9, surtout celles qui ont du mal \u00e0 trouver un logement. Cette fausse annonce a pouss\u00e9 des personnes \u00e0 aller occuper ill\u00e9galement des maisons d'un promoteur priv\u00e9 qui avait termin\u00e9 des maisons qui n'\u00e9taient pas encore occup\u00e9es. En 2021, une vid\u00e9o diffus\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux montrait des ressortissants ivoiriens tortur\u00e9s au Niger. Malheureusement, des populations de certains quartiers d'Abidjan en C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, ont cru \u00e0 cette fake news et se sont attaqu\u00e9es aux ressortissants nig\u00e9riens qui se trouvaient dans ces quartiers. Il y a eu des rixes qui ont occasionn\u00e9 un mort. Sur la base de ces deux exemples, je peux dire que les fake news qui touchent aux sujets d'ordre social et parfois \u00e0 la race, \u00e0 l'ethnie sont des domaines tr\u00e8s sensibles et semblent avoir beaucoup d'impact.\n\nAML: It\u2019s difficult to confidently say what type of fake news has the most significant impact. However, based on our experience at Africa Check, fake news on social issues has a huge impact. I can give you an example from Senegal in July 2024. Fake news spread online saying the president of the republic was offering free housing to people living in poverty, especially those struggling to find housing. This bogus announcement encouraged people to illegally occupy unoccupied properties that a private property developer had just built. In 2021, a video circulated on social media showing Nigeriens torturing Ivorian citizens in Niger. Unfortunately, some people in various districts of Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, believed this fake news. They subsequently attacked Nigerien nationals in these districts, killing one. Based on these examples, I can tell you that fake news on social issues, and sometimes race and ethnicity, are highly sensitive topics that have a significant impact.\n\nJS: Does fake news work differently for each language on the continent?\n\nAML: Peu importe la langue, les fake news ont plus ou moins les m\u00eames modus operandi. Les auteurs des fake news essaient de jouer sur la psychologie de ceux \u00e0 qui ces fausses informations sont destin\u00e9es. Souvent, ce sont des informations qui cherchent \u00e0 toucher l'\u00e9motion du public cible pour les pousser \u00e0 la r\u00e9action. Le sociologue espagnol Manuel Castells a prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 travers ses analyses que les gens r\u00e9agissent \u00e0 l'information non par la raison, mais par l'\u00e9motion. C'est pourquoi, \u00e0 mon avis, peu importe la langue, que ce soit en wolof, bambara, hausa, yoruba, fran\u00e7ais, anglais, le mode op\u00e9ratoire est le m\u00eame.\n\nAML: Regardless of the language, fake news has the same modus operandi. Fake news authors often try to play on the psychology of their target audiences with their false information. This information aims to stir the target audience\u2019s emotions to get a reaction. Through his analysis, Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells proved that people don\u2019t react to information with reason but with emotion. Therefore, I believe the modus operandi is the same regardless of whether the language is Wolof, Bambara, Hausa, Yoruba, French, or English.\n\nJS: Does African civil society make their governments aware of these issues and suggest solutions suited to Africa?\n\nAML: Sur la base de mes observations, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine m\u00e8ne diverses actions et projets afin de pousser les autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre au s\u00e9rieux la question de la d\u00e9sinformation. Par exemple, au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, je peux citer S\u00e9n\u00e9gal Vote, des activistes tr\u00e8s actifs en p\u00e9riode \u00e9lectorale pour lutter contre la d\u00e9sinformation. Au Cameroun, il y a Defy Hate Now. Mais sans une r\u00e9elle volont\u00e9 politique, ces plaidoyers port\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile peinent \u00e0 porter leurs fruits. Il faut r\u00e9ellement une volont\u00e9, un accompagnement des politiques pour que ces actions propos\u00e9es par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s civiles puissent avoir un r\u00e9el impact.\n\nAML: Based on my observations, African civil society has carried out various initiatives, prompting the authorities to take the matter of disinformation seriously. For example, in Senegal, there is S\u00e9n\u00e9gal Vote, an activist group that actively combats disinformation during election periods. Defy Hate Now is in Cameroon, but civil society struggles to yield results without political commitment. Politicians\u2019 support and commitment are essential in ensuring these civil society initiatives have a real impact.\n\nJS: Are there any alternatives to fact-checking to prevent the spread of fake news on this continent?\n\nAML: Comme alternatives, il faut plus d'\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias et \u00e0 l'information, la sensibilisation: ce sont les principales alternatives au fact-checking. Les journalistes fact-checkers ont compris que le fact-checking \u00e0 lui seul, ne pourra jamais r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me de la d\u00e9sinformation. C'est comme vouloir arr\u00eater la mer par ses bras. C'est pourquoi nous, fact-checkers, \u00e0 Africa Check, \u00e0 travers nos articles, nous prenons le soin d'expliquer \u00e0 nos lecteurs comment, \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape, nous v\u00e9rifions les informations qui sont fausses. L'objectif sur le long terme est d'outiller le public pour qu'il soit ind\u00e9pendant et dot\u00e9 de r\u00e9flexes pour \u00e9viter de tomber dans le pi\u00e8ge de la d\u00e9sinformation, m\u00eame sans Africa Check. Notre objectif est que ceux qui nous lisent parviennent eux-m\u00eames de mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante \u00e0 pouvoir s\u00e9parer la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la fiction et ne pas tomber dans le pi\u00e8ge de la d\u00e9sinformation.\n\nAML: The main alternatives to fact-checking are awareness-raising and more education on the media and information. Fact-checking journalists have learned that fact-checking alone will never fully resolve the issue of disinformation. It\u2019s like trying to hold back the sea with your hands. That\u2019s why we, fact-checkers at Africa Check, explain to our readers how we check false information step-by-step in our articles. The long-term objective is to equip people to instinctively and independently avoid falling into the disinformation trap, even without Africa Check. Our aim is for our readers to be able to independently separate fact from fiction, thus avoiding the disinformation trap.\n\nJS: Where does freedom of expression stand when it fake news?\n\nAML: Des lois qui encadrent la libert\u00e9 d'expression interdisent formellement le fait de diffuser des fake news. Il y a des gens qui passent leur journ\u00e9e \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des fake news de toutes pi\u00e8ces, soit pour nuire, pour induire une erreur, soit pour porter une cause. Les lois interdisent \u00e0 raison cette pratique-l\u00e0. Dans de nombreux pays, plusieurs lois encadrant la loi d'expression, surtout dans la presse, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites, pas forc\u00e9ment pour contrer la d\u00e9sinformation, mais surtout pour faire taire des voix critiques, surtout quand ce sont des journalistes ou des activistes qui sont contre le r\u00e9gime. Mais une personne peut diffuser une fausse information par erreur. Cela arrive surtout chez les journalistes, mais on a vu des pouvoirs politiques instrumentaliser ces lois-l\u00e0, qui sont cens\u00e9es r\u00e9guler la d\u00e9sinformation pour faire taire des voix critiques.\n\nAML: The laws formally governing freedom of expression prohibit the dissemination of fake news. Some people spend their days creating fake news from scratch to either cause harm, mislead, or champion a cause. The laws rightfully prohibit this practice. Many countries have introduced laws restricting freedom of expression, especially in the press. These laws don\u2019t necessarily counter disinformation but stifle criticism, especially from journalists or activists who oppose the regime. An individual can spread false information by mistake, which is especially true for journalists. However, we\u2019ve seen politicians use these laws, which are supposed to regulate disinformation, to silence their critics.\n\nThe report \u201cMeeting the Challenges of Information Disorder in the Global South\u201d that the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) published in 2022 concluded:",

            "content": "7 min read\n\nBefore we begin with this After The Story review, I feel compelled to share this disclaimer: The original Beyond Blue is among my absolute favourite games from the previous console generation. Combining gorgeous aquatic environments, a plethora of nature facts that wash over you while you play and an engaging narrative, it earned a place in my heart despite its few flaws. With a \u2018Very Positive\u2019 user rating on Steam, I certainly wasn\u2019t the only one that enjoyed it.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I discovered that a follow-up was in development from E-Line Media and Chaos Theory Games. I was even more excited when I found out it was to be a VR game, releasing on the Meta Quest. The thought of being totally immersed in a similar title, learning about aquatic animals while taking in the oceanic beauty was an intoxicating prospect.\n\nThese opening disclaimers are important because, despite my feelings about the original and my excitement for its follow up, Beyond Blue: After The Storm couldn\u2019t meet my expectations and is a bit of a disappointment. While this game addresses some of the criticisms that were levelled at the original, it loses something in the process. Lets slip into a wetsuit and dive into it.\n\nThe Second Wave\n\nBeyond Blue: After The Storm sees the return of the sassy and strong-willed marine biologist Mirai and her support crew as they once again head beneath the waves. The game opens with a pretty straightforward MacGuffin presented via static images and some dialogue; An automated research base on the ocean floor has gone offline, and seeing as though you\u2019re in the area, you agree to go and check it out.\n\nThe narrative for the game barely bubbles up to anything more interesting than that. What transpires over the 2 to 3 hour length of Beyond Blue: After The Storm can be simplified as a list of chores that you need to complete in order to find out what\u2019s going on in the depths, and eventually stop it.\n\nBecause of its length and shallow nature, it\u2019s also very difficult to share any more details in a review without completely undermining the games narrative. What I will say is that, like its predecessor, After The Storm has a message and is a warning of what could come to pass in the future. That message is central to its impact on you, as the player, but that impact will be limited by your own interest in the subject manager. If you care about the future of our oceans already, this game will certainly hammer home the importance of protecting our seas from emerging threats. After The Storm won\u2019t be the game to convince you to care about the ocean if you don\u2019t already, however. It\u2019s simply not that powerful.\n\nA Whale of A Time?\n\nWhether you care about the future of our oceans or not, there are elements of Beyond Blue: After The Storm that almost everyone will enjoy. The first of these is the way that it controls. Following the industry standard for first-person VR games, via the Quest 3 headset you can see your hands. On those hands are your method of propulsion through the water \u2013 powerful propellers. Point in a direction with one of your arms and with a push of the button, you\u2019ll be gently pushed in that direction. Use both hands and you\u2019ll jet along much quicker under the power of both propellers. Waving your arms around in order to accurately navigate the depths makes you feel like Aquaman and is a definite highlight of the game.\n\nUnlike her first adventure, Mirai will be doing a lot more than simply exploring and scanning sharks or fish too. On her utility belt (accessed by reaching your hand down to your waist), are tools that can help her to overcome obstacles. Need to get into a sealed metal structure? There\u2019s a cutting tool available that\u2019ll slice right through. Got a few leaky pipes? Utilise a polymer sealant to sure them up.\n\nMy personal favourite of the tools is a foam spray which miraculously cures oceanic occupants of their ills. You\u2019ll find a number of sick sea creatures during Beyond Blue: After The Storm, highlighted by a purple haze that surrounds them. Spray a layer of this healing foam on the unfortunate shark/fish/coral/turtle and they\u2019ll quickly recover. While there\u2019s no mandate to do so in the game, you certainly do get a hit of dopamine when you find a shark that\u2019s obviously in distress and manage to nurse them back to health, simply by spraying them with some foam.\n\nBeyond Blue v2.0.9878\n\nMirai isn\u2019t scouring the depths of the ocean alone this time either. Joining her on her adventure is a robotic drone called Kanaloa that\u2019ll tackle the jobs she\u2019s incapable of doing. This drone is the deep-sea equivalent of the Incredible Hulk. Super strong and physics-defying, you can switch to take control of this drone at any time to grab hold of heavy objects and simply lift them out of the way.\n\nThe interplay between Mirai and Kanaloa quickly become the core to the experience with Beyond Blue: After The Storm. Picking up heavy broken objects with the drone, moving them to the correct spot, and then switching to Mirai to stick them in place is something you\u2019ll become very familiar with. Towards the end of the game, the drone gets a new ability (that I won\u2019t spoil here) that makes it all the more useful. Here, switching quickly between Mirai in order to complete an objective adds a little more tension to the play.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that most of the interactions between Mirai and her drone feel like little more than busywork. Picking up things, cutting rubble, sticking things together; compared to the first game that had the exploration of the deep sea and examining its inhabitants at its core, this game focuses on simply doing things that you can do in many other VR games. In fact, outside of a few scripted events and animals that patrol around on set trajectories, the exploration of the deep see creatures feel like it has taken a back seat here. You won\u2019t be watching for unique behaviours of Whales here, like you did in the original Beyond Blue. They\u2019ll simply circle around on their predefined path. These sharks and Whales are a wonder to behold the first time you see them, but that sheen quickly washes away.\n\nGetting The Blues\n\nThe lack of dynamic interactions or variety with the wildlife isn\u2019t the only disappointing element of Beyond Blue: After The Storm. There have obviously been concessions made with the visuals in order to portray this game in VR. This game isn\u2019t ugly, in fact, it\u2019s quite pretty in places, but there\u2019s elements that brought the original Beyond Blue to life that are missing here. The sea feels far less natural in After The Storm, looking flatter and less polished. There\u2019s also some significant pop up with objects when moving quickly that somewhat spoils the immersion.\n\nThe most disappointing element of Beyond Blue: After The Storm for me however is the ending. I won\u2019t spoil it here, but it\u2019s abrupt and underwhelming. The pacing of the game builds in the last hour, and it feels like the game is intensifying towards a crescendo. What actually occurs lands like a fart in a wetsuit. With more time to explore the characters and build a connection with them, it might have been improved, elevating the whole experience.\n\nDevelopers: E-Line Media, Chaos Theory Games\n\nPublisher: E-Line Media\n\nDisclaimer: In order to complete this review, we were provided with a promotional copy of the game.

This isn't Beyond Blue 2. This isn't an improvement on the original game. It's set in the same world, with the same characters, with a similar focus on preserving the oceans. But this is a very different game viewed from a new perspective and while it falls short of meeting the quality of the original, the game still has enough saving graces to save it from the depths entirely.

The tech giant's share price was down 2% as of 2 p.m. ET and had been down as much as 2.9% earlier in the daily session.\n\nMeta's valuation is moving lower following news that its WhatsApp messaging platform will fall under new regulations in the European Union. Despite a modest pullback today, the stock is still up roughly 48.5% over the last year.\n\nMeta stock slips as WhatsApp crosses regulatory threshold\n\nIn a filing submitted on Feb. 14, Meta Platforms revealed that it had roughly 46.8 million average monthly active users on its WhatsApp platform across the six-month period that concluded on Dec. 31. While growth for WhatsApp is good news in many respects, the service is now above the 45 million user threshold that causes platforms to fall under the European Union's Digital Services Act. A spokesperson from the European Commission confirmed that WhatsApp would now be subject to the tighter regulations that come with the \"very large online platform\" designation under the law.\n\nWhat's next for Meta Platforms?\n\nMeta's WhatsApp service has still not been officially designated as a large platform, but it's likely that it will be included in the category in the very near future. As a result, the service will be subject to stricter content moderation and monitoring policies. The shift will also give users greater control over their data privacy on the platform and close off some monetization opportunities for Meta.\n\nWhile the upcoming regulatory shift for WhatsApp isn't favorable for Meta, it's also unsurprising and doesn't represent a material divergence in the company's long-term outlook. As a messaging platform, content moderation costs should be relatively low compared to other types of social media platforms -- and Meta is already dealing with the large online platform designation for its Facebook and Instagram services in the E.U.\n\nRecent comments from national leaders of E.U. countries also suggest that the supranational organization may soon move to create more lax regulatory standards for the tech industry. Even if that doesn't wind up impacting WhatsApp in a meaningful way, it's likely that new regulations applying to the service will wind up being a small footnote for Meta within a year's time.",

            "content": "Kareer teleoperates the robot to capture co-training data for EgoMimic. Teleoperation can be difficult to scale and require significant human effort.\n\nEven if you had the available hardware system, teaching a robot to do everyday tasks can only be achieved through a slow and clunky data collection method called robot teleoperation. Until now. By using the Project Aria Research Kit , Professor Danfei Xu and the Robotic Learning and Reasoning Lab at Georgia Tech use the egocentric sensors on Aria glasses to create what they call \u201chuman data\u201d for tasks that they want a humanoid robot to replicate. They use human data to dramatically reduce the amount of robot teleoperation data needed to train a robot\u2019s policy\u2014a breakthrough that could some day make humanoid robots capable of learning any number of tasks a human could demonstrate.\n\nImagine having help completing everyday tasks in your home such as doing the laundry, washing dishes, and making repairs. We already use tools to help with these tasks, like washing machines, dishwashers, and electric drills. But what if you could have an even more powerful and flexible tool in the form of a humanoid robot that could learn from you and accelerate any number of physical projects on your to-do list?\n\nToday, we\u2019re highlighting new research from Georgia Tech that helps train robots to perform basic everyday tasks using egocentric recordings from wearers of Meta\u2019s Project Aria research glasses. Check out the video below, read the full story, or apply for your own Project Aria Research Kit .\n\nInspired by Project Aria and Ego-Exo4D which includes a massive egocentric dataset of over 3K hours of video recordings of daily-life activities, Kareer developed EgoMimic , a new algorithmic framework that utilizes human data and robot data for humanoid robot development.\n\nToday, robot policy models are trained with large amounts of targeted demonstration data specific to each narrow task at a high cost. Kareer hypothesizes that passively collected data from many researchers, like the data captured by Aria glasses, could instead be used to enable data creation for a much broader set of tasks to create more generally useful robots in the future.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, collecting data for robotics means creating demonstration data,\u201d says Simar Kareer, a PhD student in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing . \u201cYou operate the robot\u2019s joints with a controller to move it and achieve the task you want, and you do this hundreds of times while recording sensor data, then train your models. This is slow and difficult. The only way to break that cycle is to detach the data collection from the robot itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I looked at Ego4D, I saw a dataset that\u2019s the same as all the large robot datasets we\u2019re trying to collect, except it\u2019s with humans,\u201d Kareer explains. \u201cYou just wear a pair of glasses, and you go do things. It doesn\u2019t need to come from the robot. It should come from something more scalable and passively generated, which is us.\u201d In Kareer\u2019s research, Aria glasses were used to create human data for co-training the EgoMimic framework.\n\nKareer creates co-training human data by recording with Aria glasses while folding a t-shirt.\n\nAria glasses aren\u2019t just used for human data collection in Georgia Tech\u2019s research. They\u2019re also used as an integral component of the robot\u2019s real-time operation setup. Aria glasses are mounted to their humanoid robot platform just like a pair of eyes and serve as an integrated sensor package that enables the robot to perceive its environment in real time. The Aria Client SDK is utilized to stream Aria\u2019s sensor data directly into the robot\u2019s policy, running on an attached PC, which in turn controls the robot\u2019s actuation. Using Aria glasses for both the data collection and the real-time perception pipeline minimizes the domain gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, paving the way for scaled human data generation for future robotics task training.\n\nAria glasses mounted to the top of the robot provide the system with sensor data that allows the robot to perceive and interact with the space.\n\nThanks to EgoMimic, Kareer achieved a 400% increase in his robot\u2019s performance across various tasks vs previous methods with just 90 minutes of Aria recordings. The robot was also able to successfully perform these tasks in previously unseen environments.",

She is also fascinated by the process of science, the institutions that fund it, and the people who make it happen.\n\nElon Musk has arguably been the boldest broligarch when it comes to brain-machine interfaces. But Mark Zuckerberg is hot on his heels.\n\nSince then, Meta-funded researchers have figured out how to decode speech from activity recorded from surgically implanted electrodes inside people\u2019s brains. While brain surgery could feel worth it for a paralyzed person who wants to regain the ability to communicate, invasive devices like these are a hard sell for someone who just wants to type faster. Commercial devices regular people might actually want need to be wearable and removable, rather than permanent.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nMeta tabled its efforts to build consumer brain-computer interfaces a few years ago: Brain-reading headbands weren\u2019t ready for prime time. Instead of developing new gadgets directly, the company has been investing in slower-burning neuroscience research. Their hope is that studying the brain will help them build AI that\u2019s better at stuff humans are good at, like processing language. Some of this research still focused on mind-reading: specifically, decoding how the brain produces sentences.\n\nThis month, though, Meta made a breakthrough.\n\nIn collaboration with the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language, researchers at Meta\u2019s Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) lab were able to accurately decode unspoken sentences from brain signals recorded outside the skull \u2014 no surgery required.\n\nThis was just in a lab, of course. But these findings mark a major step toward the wearable mind-reading devices Zuckerberg promised eight years ago.\n\nAnd as brain-to-text devices inch closer toward commercial viability in the not-so-distant future, we\u2019ll need to grapple with what it means for Meta to be their gatekeeper. In the lab, mind-reading technology promises to reveal previously unknowable information about how our brains construct thoughts, make decisions, and guide our actions. But out in the world, tech companies may misuse our brain data unless we establish and enforce regulations to stop them.\n\nMeta can decode unspoken sentences from your brain\u2019s magnetic fields\n\nUntil a couple years ago, researchers couldn\u2019t decode unspoken language without implanting electrodes inside the brain, which requires surgery. In 2023, scientists at the University of Texas used fMRI, coupled with a version of the AI models that power ChatGPT, to decode the gist of unspoken sentences from brain activity. But fMRI machines cost millions of dollars and can outweigh a fully grown elephant, limiting their usefulness outside the lab.\n\nBecause neuroscientists are generally unwilling to stick recording devices inside of a human\u2019s brain, most studies of the human brain involve measuring some proxy for neural activity itself. fMRI scanners measure how much blood flows to brain cells while they work, which entails a bit of a lag. Another method, called magnetoencephalography (MEG), measures magnetic fields brain cells create when they send electrical signals. While neither of these techniques can track what individual cells are doing, they both provide a rough snapshot of the brain\u2019s activity patterns while someone is doing a task, like reading or typing. The cool thing is that unlike fMRI, MEG can record the brain in near-real time.\n\nSo, Meta researchers recruited 35 volunteers to type sentences on a keyboard while sitting in an MEG scanner, which looks like a salon hair-drying chair from outer space. Some also had EEG (electroencephalography) electrodes gelled to their face and scalp to record electrical signals radiating from brain cells through their skulls.\n\nEach person\u2019s brain activity helped train an AI model to guess what they typed. Essentially, part of the model learned to match patterns of brain activity to the letters someone was typing at the time. Researchers fed another part of the model a bunch of Wikipedia articles to teach it how sentences work, and what words often appear next to each other in different contexts. With this information, if someone meant to type \u201cI love you,\u201d but their brain signals read \u201cI lovr yoi\u201d \u2014 possibly because their brain actually led them to make a typo \u2014 the model could effectively autocorrect that prediction, because it knows how letters and words should work in context.\n\nUsing EEG, which is much more portable than an fMRI or MEG scanner, Meta researchers were able to use AI to decode the exact letters someone was typing about a third of the time. That doesn\u2019t sound particularly impressive, until you consider that EEG records brain cells via electrodes outside the skull, many layers of separation away from the brain itself. It\u2019s like trying to eavesdrop on a conversation at a crowded bar by standing outside and holding a glass against the wall: Given all the noise, catching even a third of that conversation is already quite challenging.\n\nMEG captures brain activity more precisely than EEG, because magnetic signals from brain cells don\u2019t get as distorted by the skull as electrical signals. By feeding MEG data to their AI model, Meta researchers accurately decoded between 70 to 80 percent of what people typed, blowing previous models out of the water. So, if Meta ever wants to build mind-reading headbands, recording magnetic fields might be their best bet.\n\nLike fMRI, the MEG device used in this study was huge and expensive. But wearable helmet-like MEG scanners, which only weigh a few pounds, already exist and are even more sensitive than non-portable scanners. These portable MEG devices are just a couple pounds heavier than the Quest 3, Meta\u2019s latest VR headset, and about as silly-looking. While these MEG devices still don\u2019t work outside of special magnetically-shielded rooms (nor are they available to the public yet), it\u2019s not hard to imagine a future where they could.\n\nTech companies won\u2019t protect brain data unless we make them\n\nMeta isn\u2019t the only tech giant investing heavily in neuroscience research. Google and Microsoft both have teams dedicated to studying the brain, and NVIDIA and IBM both collaborate with neuroscience research institutions.\n\nHere, Meta used the brain data they collected while people typed to study how the brain transforms abstract ideas into words, syllables, and letters, with the long-term goal of figuring out how to help AI chatbots do the same.\n\nThe data support a long-held hypothesis held by neuroscientists and linguists, proposing that we produce speech from the top down. As I prepare to say something, my brain pictures the whole thing first (\u201cI\u2019m going to lunch soon\u201d), then zooms in on one word (\u201cgoing\u201d), then one syllable (\u201cgo-\u201d). As I type, my brain focuses on each specific letter (\u201cg,\u201d \u201co,\u201d...) as it tells my fingers what to do. Meta saw that these representations \u2014 context, words, syllables, letters \u2014 all overlap during language production, peaking and fading in strength at different times.\n\nUnderstanding language production will also, in theory, help Meta achieve their stated goal of \u201crestor[ing] communication for those who have lost the ability to speak.\u201d And there are indeed millions of people recovering from traumatic brain injury, stroke, or another neurological disorder that makes it hard to talk. A wearable device that makes communication easy again could be a hugely positive force in someone\u2019s life.\n\nBut we know that\u2019s not their only motivation. For Silicon Valley, the brain also represents the final barrier between humans and their devices.\n\nA quick sanity check: Meta\u2019s goal was never to merge humans with computers (that\u2019s Musk\u2019s thing), but to sell a portable, removable headset that someone could use to type or play video games with their mind. To manifest a device like this, Meta needs to cross two huge technological hurdles, and one even bigger ethical one.\n\nFirst, they need to decode unspoken thoughts from outside the skull. Check.\n\nSecond, they need to do that with a device that someone could reasonably afford, keep in their house, and wear on their head. For now, this is pretty far off.\n\nMost importantly, once these devices exist, we\u2019ll need robust protections for people\u2019s cognitive liberty \u2014 our fundamental right to control our own consciousness. The time for these safeguards isn\u2019t after they hit stores. It\u2019s now.\n\n\u201cFacebook is already great at peering into your brain without any need for electrodes or fMRI or anything. They know much of your cognitive profile just from how you use the internet,\u201d Roland Nadler, a neuroethicist at the University of British Columbia, told my colleague Sigal Samuel back in 2019.\n\nMeta already uses AI to extrapolate your mental health from your digital footprint. They use AI to flag, and sometimes delete, posts about self-harm and suicide, and can trigger nonconsensual \u201cwellness checks\u201d when they detect concerning messages on Messenger or WhatsApp.\n\nGiven how much convenience we gain by giving away personal data \u2014 food deliveries, remote work, connecting with friends online \u2014 lots of people give up on digital privacy altogether. Even though many people feel uncomfortable with the amount of personal information companies take from us, they also believe they have no control over their privacy.\n\nLast year, neuroscientists, lawyers, and lawmakers began passing legislation to explicitly include neural data in state privacy laws. Some smaller neurotech companies are already gathering brain data from consumer products \u2014 stronger protections need to be put in place before massive companies like Meta can do the same.\n\nZuckerberg has spent the past two months racing to Trump-ify Meta. His company is unlikely to handle our most private data with care, at least not unprompted.\n\nBut in a world where Meta-branded brain-to-text headbands are as normal as keyboards are now, sharing brain data might feel like a prerequisite for participating in normal life. Imagine a workplace where, instead of giving you a monitor and a keyboard at the office, they give you a text-decoding helmet and tell you to strap in. If mind-typing becomes the default for computer systems, then avoiding brain-to-text devices will feel like avoiding smartphones: possible, sure. But certainly not the path of least resistance.\n\nAs our mental security becomes less guaranteed, we\u2019ll need to decide whether the convenience of controlling stuff with our minds is worth letting tech companies colonize our last truly private space.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

Designed to enhance software reliability and security, ACH generates faults in source code and subsequently creates tests to detect and address these issues.\n\n\n\nTraditional automated test generation methods have primarily concentrated on increasing code coverage. However, this focus does not always result in effective fault detection. ACH represents a shift from this approach by targeting specific faults rather than simply attempting to cover more code. This system enables engineers to define the types of issues they want to address using plain text descriptions, even if those descriptions are incomplete or contradictory. ACH then automatically generates faults (mutants) and corresponding tests that are designed to identify the specified faults.\n\n\n\nMutation testing involves intentionally introducing controlled faults to evaluate the effectiveness of a testing framework. However, creating realistic faults and corresponding tests has been challenging. ACH simplifies this process by utilizing LLMs to:\n\nInterpret engineers\u2019 descriptions of potential faults. Generate realistic faults based on these descriptions. Automatically create tests to identify and address these faults.\n\nThe ACH system follows a structured workflow to generate and validate faults efficiently. It starts by processing a free-form text description of an issue, which can come from various sources, such as previous development faults, user requirements, technical constraints, regulatory compliance needs, or engineering concerns. The system then employs three key LLM-based agents:\n\nFault Generator: This agent introduces simulated faults into the code based on the provided issue description. Equivalence Detector: To prevent redundant fault generation, this agent determines whether a newly introduced fault is semantically different from the original code. Test Generator: This agent creates test cases specifically designed to catch the introduced faults.\n\nSource: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12862\n\n\n\nMeta has implemented ACH across several platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Initial findings indicate that ACH assists engineers in hardening code against specific concerns while also providing broader benefits by optimizing test generation processes.\n\n\n\nRajkumar S, a senior developer at SAP Labs India, highlighted ACH\u2019s impact, stating:\n\nAutomated Compliance Hardening (ACH) tool uses LLMs to revolutionize software testing by automatically generating both code mutations and the tests to catch them. A real game-changer for improving code reliability and efficiency. Test cases are not just for code coverage.\n\nMeta aims to expand ACH\u2019s deployment, refine methods for measuring mutant relevance, and improve fault detection mechanisms. By integrating LLM-powered test and fault generation into large-scale industrial systems, ACH represents a significant step forward in automated software testing, potentially influencing industry-wide practices in compliance and quality assurance.",

The company seeks to strengthen control over the management of its services and guarantee the necessary infrastructure for the development of its products, especially those based in artificial intelligence.\n\nSubmarine cables support more than 95 percent of intercontinental internet traffic. \u201cProject Waterworth will be a multibillion dollar, multiyear investment to strengthen the scale and reliability of the world\u2019s digital highways by opening three new oceanic corridors with the abundant, high-speed connectivity needed to drive AI innovation around the world,\u201d the company said in a post about the undertaking. The project was first reported last autumn by entrepreneur Sunil Tagare.\n\nThe interoceanic cable will be longer than the circumference of Earth, making it the longest in the world, according to the company. It will have landing points in India, the United States, Brazil, South Africa, and other strategic locations. The company suggests that the construction of this network will bring significant opportunities in the AI space, particularly in the Indian market.\n\n\"In India, where we\u2019ve already seen significant growth and investment in digital infrastructure, Waterworth will help accelerate this progress and support the country\u2019s ambitious plans for its digital economy,\" the compay's post reads.\n\nLast week, US president Donald Trump and India prime minister Shri Narendra Modi issued a joint statement on cooperation between the two countries. The document includes commitments on undersea technologies and mentions Project Waterworth.\n\n\"Supporting greater Indian Ocean connectivity, the leaders also welcomed Meta\u2019s announcement of a multibillion, multiyear investment in an undersea cable project that will begin work this year and ultimately stretch over 50,000 km to connect five continents and strengthen global digital highways in the Indian Ocean region and beyond,\" the statement released by the White House said.\n\nThe new undersea network will use a cable architecture with 24 fiber pairs and routing designed to maximize deep-water routing, reaching up to 7,000 meters. Meta claims to have improved its burial techniques in high-risk areas, such as shallow near-shore waters, to reduce the risk of damage from ship anchors and other external factors.\n\nMeta's ecosystem, which includes services such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, by some accounts comprises as much as 10 percent of fixed traffic and 22 percent of mobile traffic globally. Over the past decade, the company has developed more than 20 undersea cables in collaboration with various partners. Waterworth would be the first project to be fully owned by the company.\n\nWith this initiative, Meta will compete directly with Google, which has around 33 undersea cable routes, some of them exclusively owned, according to the specialist firm TeleGeography. Other technology companies such as Amazon and Microsoft are also investing in this sector, although they only own shared interests or acquire capacity on existing cables.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Espa\u00f1ol and has been translated from Spanish.",

We projected this price using the bars pattern tool that takes the October to November move lower within the channel and repositions it from yesterday\u2019s high, speculating how a future test of the pattern\u2019s lower trendline may play out.\n\nA breakdown below the ascending channel\u2019s lower trendline could see the shares fall to the $632 level, a location on the chart that may provide support near peaks in mid-December and early January.\n\nFurther selling opens the door for a retest of support around the key $600 level. Investors could look for buying opportunities in this area near the psychological round number and a range of similar trading levels on the chart between October and January.\n\nMeasured Move Price Target to Monitor\n\nInvestors can forecast a price target above the ascending channel\u2019s upper trendline by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle.\n\nWhen applied to Meta\u2019s chart, we calculate the width of the channel in points and add that amount to the pattern\u2019s top trendline. For instance, we add $120 to $741, which projects a target of $861, about 20% above Tuesday\u2019s closing price where investors may decide to lock in profits.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

            "content": "Meta is rumored to be eyeing a deal that could further separate the company from Nvidia.\n\nOne artificial intelligence (AI) stock that got off to a scorching start this year is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms (META -4.67%). Just a couple of weeks ago, Meta's leadership told investors that 2025 is going to be a jam-packed year as the company seeks to continue moving aggressively on its AI roadmap.\n\nTo be specific, Meta is preparing to spend up to $65 billion in AI infrastructure this year -- representing a 65% increase year over year. Given the company works closely with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, and is also working with Broadcom to design its own custom inferencing chips, it's not too surprising that Meta is planning for such a robust increase in capital expenditures (capex).\n\nWhat may be surprising, though, is that Meta may have just found a new source for its capital -- and it could put Nvidia in a jam. Below, I'll dig into some recent news involving Meta right now and detail how Nvidia could be impacted.\n\nHow Meta might be trying to leapfrog Nvidia\n\nEven though Nvidia dominates the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, the company has been facing some competition beyond the usual suspect of AMD. Namely, many of Nvidia's largest customers, such as cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, as well as social networking platform Meta, are investing in their own custom chip products. The rationale behind these investments is to complement existing chipsets with new architectures in an effort to migrate away from a full reliance on Nvidia's stack.\n\nMeta's foray into the GPU realm revolves around its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip. While the MTIA chip is still a nascent initiative at Meta, the company may have identified a way to push the project forward much faster than initially anticipated.\n\nSeveral media outlets are reporting that Meta is considering acquiring FuriosaAI, a chip start-up out of Korea. FuriosaAI claims that its processing power is more cost efficient compared to Nvidia's newest GPUs. If this is true, that could change the game for Meta as it pertains to its capex plans this year and its focus on acquiring more data center chips.\n\nIn theory, the cost efficiencies brought from FuriosaAI as well as the company's chip development processes could bring some obvious synergies to Meta's AI budget and its product roadmap as development for the MTIA chips continues.\n\nCould Meta's deal spell trouble for Nvidia?\n\nOn the surface, the introduction of the MTIA chip might seem like a crisis for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Meta's chip is only about a year old -- so it's unlikely that the company developed something as sophisticated or more when compared to Nvidia in just one year.\n\nFor this reason, I wouldn't say that Nvidia is at risk of losing Meta as a customer soon. Moreover, the news around Meta's interest in FuriosaAI is, for now, still a rumor.\n\nFurthermore, even if Meta does move forward with acquiring FuriosaAI, there will be a lot of work to do on the integration and product development sides of the house. Augmenting FuriosaAI's technology with Meta's AI isn't necessarily a bad thing for Nvidia. If anything, the added competition could lead to more innovation and cutting-edge architectures in the GPU landscape.\n\nI think it's a matter of time before the semiconductor sector begins to consolidate anyway. Many of Nvidia's largest customers are already focusing on their own in-house chipware. With that in mind, I wouldn't be surprised to see big tech start acquiring or partnering with other chipmakers outside of the Nvidia ecosystem over the next few years.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do not see a potential acquisition by Meta as a checkmate move against Nvidia. Unless and until a deal is formed, any movement in Nvidia's stock based on Meta's motives is rooted in emotion-driven speculation.",

Prior to this rally, Meta's longest steak of gains on the stock market was 11 in September 2015, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe stock rally included positive reaction to Meta's fourth-quarter results late last month, which beat expectations for earnings and sales. Before that, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would spend $60 billion to $65 billion on capital expenditures this year with a focus on AI infrastructure, well ahead of previous estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta's 23% gain so far this year is easily tops among Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nMeta Robotics Push\n\nThe cause of Tuesday's decline is unclear.\n\nOn Friday, Meta announced plans to build a massive undersea internet network cable. The tech giant is also reportedly forming a team within its metaverse-focused Reality Labs division that will focus on robotics. That includes investments into developing humanoid-style robots, according to a Bloomberg report Friday. But shares closed higher Friday, after both news items.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley were positive on the robotics idea in commentary for clients on Tuesday.\n\n\"Meta's reported robotics team formation speaks to its physical AI opportunity across wearables and robotics, and its growing and underappreciated presence in the race to capture more real-time offline data to train/develop future differentiated language models and GenAI enabled products,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak.

Finance ranked in second place. Tech CFOs are \u201cfocused on profitable growth, so having a good measure of profitability and being able to measure that continually is important,\u201d Galligan said.\n\nTech sector headcounts ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic amid heightened demand for IT products and services. After massive layoffs in the last few years, the sector continues to lean on job cuts to boost efficiency and free up capital for purposes such as investing in artificial intelligence, according to a September report from New York-based consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\n\u201cThese [AI] investments come at the expense of other strategic initiatives at a time when tech companies are already navigating a high-interest-rate environment, ongoing efforts to course-correct overhiring during the pandemic, and a deceleration in the market growth rate,\u201d the report said. \u201cFreeing up capital for AI and other growth initiatives will first mean trimming excess costs where feasible across the business.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, enterprise software giant Workday announced plans to eliminate about 1,750 positions, or 8.5% of its workforce. The move is part of a restructuring plan intended to prioritize the company\u2019s investments while advancing an \u201congoing focus on durable growth,\u201d according to a securities filing.\n\n\u2018Difficult, but necessary, decision\u2019\n\nIn a memo to staff that was included in the filing, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach called the layoff a \u201cdifficult, but necessary, decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis creates a massive opportunity for us, but we need to make some changes to better align our resources with our customers' evolving needs.\u201d\n\nWorkday said it expects to continue to hire in \u201ckey strategic areas and locations\u201d throughout its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2026.\n\nIn mid-January, Meta employees were informed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the company\u2019s plan to cut about 5% of its workforce, with a focus on the lowest-performing staffers, according to a Bloomberg report. Zuckerberg made the announcement in an internal memo, saying that 2025 will \u201cbe an intense year\u201d for the company, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, Business Insider reported in early January that Microsoft was planning an unspecified number of job cuts and was taking a \u201charder look\u201d at under-performing employees as part of the effort.\n\nOther major tech companies that have announced layoffs since the start of the year include Salesforce and Amazon.\n\nStaff \u2018right-sizing\u2019 versus \u2018remixing\u2019\n\nWhile the industry has seen rampant job cuts in recent years, the trend appears to be easing up. Last year, tech companies announced a total of 152,104 layoffs, compared with more than 260,000 in 2023, according to layoffs.fyi. And about 2,400 layoffs were announced by the sector during the first month of this year compared with over 34,000 during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe slowdown may reflect a shift away from tech layoffs driven primarily by the need to \u201cright-size\u201d bloated staffs, analysts said. \u201cNow what you\u2019re seeing is more remixing, based on, let\u2019s say, the efficiency you might gain through investing in AI or some other technology,\u201d Galligan said.\n\nIn the coming year, layoffs aren\u2019t likely to return to peak levels absent a larger economic downturn, according to Challenger.\n\n\u201cIt really was such a unique phenomenon following Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies hired so many workers that they ended up not needing, so they had to make these huge reductions.\u201d",

            "content": "At this point, it's become so common it's a social media clich\u00e9: the post-layoff note on LinkedIn. Overly polite and awkwardly upbeat, the freshly unemployed thank their ex-employer for a great few years and highlight all the great things they did there. I'm looking forward to the next challenge, they write, adding the #opentowork hashtag. Please reach out if your company is hiring. Every time a big company makes a round of cuts, I see a few of these pop up in my feed.\n\nBut last week, when Meta culled some 4,000 workers, I expected total silence. Mark Zuckerberg had announced that the cuts were designed to get rid of \"low performers,\" burdening the departing employees with the professional equivalent of a scarlet letter. I felt terrible for them. No one, I thought, would want to call attention to the fact that they'd been branded as below average.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nWithin a day, laid-off Meta employees were taking to LinkedIn \u2014 not just to announce they were looking for work, but to fight back against Zuckerberg's assessment of their work. It was a new iteration of the classic #opentowork post, ditching the deference for a tone of defiance.\n\n\"I am not a low performer,\" a content manager wrote. \"I am an adaptive hard worker who thrives in work that I can be passionate about.\" A product designer asserted: \"That label is misleading, and for many of us, it's flat-out wrong.\" A lawyer \u2014 deriding what she called \"Zuck's newfound 'masculine energy'\" \u2014 offered to provide the receipts: \"I'm not a 'low performer.' I've got the reviews to prove it, and countless colleagues and managers will vouch for me!\" A data scientist even uploaded screenshots of his glowing performance reviews, which indicated he routinely \"exceeded expectations\" and \"greatly exceeded expectations.\"\n\nThis is something we haven't seen before in the professional world: Employees sticking up for themselves in public, and calling out their former employer for misrepresenting their work. When LinkedIn introduced the #opentowork feature during the early days of the pandemic, it was a tall order to get people to announce that they'd been laid off. In the past, people usually kept their dismissal private, fearing the stigma would prevent them from getting another job.\n\nThat began to change in late 2022, when a huge round of layoffs hit the tech sector. Suddenly, tens of thousands of coders, product managers, and marketers found themselves out of a job all at once. Some of their CEOs went out of their way to apologize for overhiring, and to praise their axed staffers as great employees. That encouraged people to use the #opentowork banner to announce that they'd been laid off. Last summer, when I spoke with corporate recruiters about the trend, most told me it no longer gave them pause to see that a candidate had been laid off. They'd come to understand that it doesn't automatically cast doubt on someone's performance.\n\nNow, Meta's employees are taking that realization to the next level. The groundswell of defiance started last year, when a handful of people posted videos of themselves on TikTok as they received the news of their layoffs. The most viral was Brittany Pietsch, a Cloudflare employee who kept asking the HR person for evidence of her supposed low performance. The videos were uncomfortable, but I found it refreshing to watch these young people tell their side of the story. Similarly, the new crop of #opentowork posts is enabling Meta's employees to assert their value in the marketplace \u2014 using social media, the very thing Zuckerberg helped supercharge, to counter the narrative he's telling about the layoffs. \"While we can't do anything about being laid off,\" a Meta research manager posted on LinkedIn, \"we aren't without any agency.\"\n\nThe question is: Will standing up to your former boss hurt your chances of landing a new job? The standard advice for laid-off workers is to avoid saying anything negative about their former employers, both on social media and in job interviews. Ashley Herd, a former head of HR who founded a firm that provides training for managers, acknowledges that speaking up might turn off some potential employers. But getting rejected by them, she adds, might not be a bad thing.\n\n\"Good employers are looking for people who are good communicators \u2014 who can advocate for themselves just like they would in their role for the organization,\" Herd says. \"Those that speak up might realistically find themselves with a smaller pool of potential employers, but that will be a group that actually aligns with their values and supports long-term career success and happiness.\"\n\nSandra Sucher, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies layoffs, agrees that it's good for employees to stick up for themselves. \"I don't think it's a mistake,\" she tells me. \"As soon as you've got the CEO of my company saying, 'I'm laying off people because they're no good at their job,' reasonable people are going to say, 'Do I accept that or do I try to change the narrative here?'\"\n\nIf that's their goal, Meta's employees seem to be succeeding. People have begun to question the \"low performer\" label that Zuckerberg has been throwing around. When those who were laid off start sending out their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, recruiters will likely have heard that the purge included a lot of employees with excellent performance reviews. Besides, the defiant posts are proving to be a good way to kick off a job search: Many of the comments on LinkedIn are filled with warm endorsements from ex-colleagues and networking offers from total strangers. This, ironically, was always the power of social media, as Zuckerberg championed it \u2014 the promise of \"connecting people\" and \"building community.\" When it comes to making good on the company's slogans, Meta's former employees have proven themselves to be high performers.\n\nAki Ito is a chief correspondent at Business Insider.",

As part of the project proposal, Entergy submitted a plan to build three combined-cycle combustion turbines with a combined capacity of 2,260MW, two substations, six customer-owned substations, 100 miles of 500kV transmission lines, and eight new 230kV transmission lines.\n\nThe cost estimations for the power plant build-out are around $3.2 billion, and the total cost of the data center project is estimated at $10 billion.\n\nPending regulatory approval, the new generators are expected to come online between 2028 and 2029.\n\nIn the motion, as reported by Kpel965, the groups contend that Entergy did not follow the correct procedure when proposing the new gas-fired plants, which could result in significant costs for ratepayers.\n\n\"This is a real problem from our perspective for ratepayers because we effectively have to take it on faith that Entergy has found the least cost option that will serve their customers,\" Logan Burke, the executive director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, told The Advocate.\n\nMeta has offered to offset most of the costs for Entergy's customers, with the company set to pay the full annual revenue for the plants for 15 years. The groups contend that Entergy did not offer the most cost-effective option for ratepayers.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Entergy received an exemption from regulators to build the new power plants to directly serve the data center. However, the groups claim that Entergy's plan does not qualify for an exemption, and they are asking an administrative judge and the PSC to review it.\n\nThe group's goal is to \"determine the impact on ratepayers,\" they say, though they also believe that \"there is every reason to believe the project will impact ratepayers even if Meta does not terminate early and re-signs a new agreement when the agreement\u2019s first term ends.\"\n\nIf the gas power plants are delayed, this could ultimately impact Meta\u2019s timeline and lead to much longer lead times for the data center to achieve energization.",

The company\u2019s significant contribution to the atrocities suffered by the Rohingya people is the subject of a new whistleblower complaint that has just been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn January 7, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a raft of changes to Meta\u2019s content policies, seemingly aimed at currying favor with the new Trump administration. These include the lifting of prohibitions on previously banned speech, such as the denigration and harassment of racialized minorities. Zuckerberg also announced a drastic shift in content moderation practices \u2013 with automated content moderation being significantly rolled back. While these changes have been initially implemented in the US, Meta has signaled that they may be rolled out internationally. This shift marks a clear retreat from the company\u2019s previously stated commitments to responsible content governance.\n\n\u201cI really think this is a precursor for genocide [\u2026] We\u2019ve seen it happen. Real people\u2019s lives are actually going to be endangered. A former Meta employee recently speaking to the platformer\n\nAs has been well-documented by Amnesty International and others, Meta\u2019s algorithms prioritize and amplify some of the most harmful content, including advocacy of hatred, misinformation, and content inciting racial violence \u2013 all in the name of maximizing \u2018user engagement,\u2019 and by extension, profit. Research has shown that these algorithms consistently elevate content that generates strong emotional reactions, often at the cost of human rights and safety. With the removal of existing content safeguards, this situation looks set to go from bad to worse.\n\nAs one former Meta employee recently told Platformer, \u201cI really think this is a precursor for genocide [\u2026] We\u2019ve seen it happen. Real people\u2019s lives are actually going to be endangered.\u201d This statement echoes the warnings from various human rights experts who have raised concerns about Meta\u2019s role in fuelling mass violence in fragile and conflict-affected societies.\n\nWe have seen the horrific consequences of Meta\u2019s recklessness before. In 2017, Myanmar security forces undertook a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against Rohingya Muslims. A UN Independent Fact-Finding Commission concluded in 2018 that Myanmar\u2019s generals should be tried for genocide. In the years leading up to these attacks, Facebook had become an echo chamber of virulent anti-Rohingya hatred. The mass dissemination of dehumanizing anti-Rohingya content poured fuel on the fire of long-standing discrimination and helped to create an enabling environment for mass violence. In the absence of appropriate safeguards, Facebook\u2019s toxic algorithms intensified a storm of hatred against the Rohingya, which contributed to these atrocities. According to a report by the United Nations, Facebook was instrumental in the radicalization of local populations and the incitement of violence against the Rohingya.\n\nRather than learning from its reckless contributions to mass violence in countries including Myanmar and Ethiopia, Meta is instead stripping away important protections that were aimed at preventing any recurrence of such harms.\n\nIn enacting these changes, Meta has effectively declared an open season for hate and harassment targeting its most vulnerable and at-risk people, including trans people, migrants, and refugees.\n\nMeta claims to be enacting these changes to advance freedom of expression. While it is true that Meta has wrongfully restricted legitimate content in many cases, this drastic abandonment of existing safeguards is not the answer. The company must take a balanced approach that allows for free expression while safeguarding vulnerable populations.\n\nAll companies, including Meta, have clear responsibilities to respect all human rights in line with international human rights standards. Billionaire CEOs cannot simply pick and choose which rights to respect while flagrantly disregarding others and recklessly endangering the rights of millions.\n\nRather than learning from its reckless contributions to mass violence in countries including Myanmar and Ethiopia, Meta is instead stripping away important protections that were aimed at preventing any recurrence of such harms. Pat de Br\u00fan is Head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International\n\nAn investigation by Amnesty International in 2021 found that Meta had \u201csubstantially contributed\u201d to the atrocities perpetrated against the Rohingya, and that the company bears a responsibility to provide an effective remedy to the community. However, Meta has made it clear it will take no such action.\n\nRohingya communities \u2014 most of whom were forced from their homes eight years ago and still reside in sprawling refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh \u2014 have also made requests to Meta to remediate them by funding a $1 million education project in the refugee camps. The sum represents just 0.0007% of Meta\u2019s 2023 profits of $134 billion. Despite this, Meta rejected the request. This refusal further demonstrates the company\u2019s lack of accountability and commitment to profit over human dignity.\n\nThat is why we \u2013 Rohingya atrocity survivor Maung Sawyeddollah, with the support of Amnesty International, the Open Society Justice Initiative, and Victim Advocates International \u2013 on January 23, 2025, filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC. The complaint outlines Meta\u2019s failure to heed multiple civil society warnings from 2013 to 2017 regarding Facebook\u2019s role in fueling violence against the Rohingya. We are asking the agency to investigate Meta for alleged violations of securities laws stemming from the company\u2019s misrepresentations to shareholders in relation to its contribution to the atrocities suffered by the Rohingya in 2017.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Meta executives told shareholders that Facebook\u2019s algorithms did not result in polarization, despite warnings that its platform was actively proliferating anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar. At the same time, Meta did not fully disclose to shareholders the risks the company\u2019s operations in Myanmar entailed. Instead, in 2015 and 2016, Meta objected to shareholder proposals to conduct a human rights impact assessment and to set up an internal committee to oversee the company\u2019s policies and practices on international public policy issues, including human rights.\n\nWith Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs lining up (literally, in the case of the recent inauguration) behind the new administration\u2019s wide-ranging attacks on human rights, Meta shareholders need to step up and hold the company\u2019s leadership to account to prevent Meta from yet again becoming a conduit for mass violence, or even genocide.\n\nSimilarly, legislators and lawmakers in the US must ensure that the SEC retains its neutrality, properly investigate legitimate complaints \u2013 such as the one we recently filed, and ensure those who abuse human rights face justice.\n\nGlobally, governments and regional bodies such as the EU must redouble their efforts to hold Meta and other Big Tech companies to account for their human rights impacts. As we have seen before, countless human lives could be at risk if companies like Meta are left to their own devices.\n\nPat de Br\u00fan is Head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International and Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech.\n\nMaung Sawyeddollah is the founder and Executive Director of the Rohingya Students\u2019 Network.

This project will enable greater economic cooperation, facilitate digital inclusion, and open opportunities for technological development in these regions.\u201d\n\nAs noted, reports of the project first begin circulating late last year, with initial estimates placing the cost of the project at around $10 billion.\n\nWhich, considering that Meta\u2019s projecting that it will spend up to $70 billion on infrastructure in 2025 alone, is probably not that significant in the scheme of things.\n\nBut it is a massive undertaking, which will give Meta significantly more capacity to expand its usage and utility, particularly in regards to AI, which requires significant computing resources.\n\nIndeed, Meta notes that expanded AI usage is a key focus of the project:\n\n\u201cAs AI continues to transform industries and societies around the world, it\u2019s clear that capacity, resilience, and global reach are more important than ever to support leading infrastructure. With Project Waterworth we can help ensure that the benefits of AI and other emerging technologies are available to everyone, regardless of where they live or work.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly important for the Indian market, where Meta is targeting its next billion users. India is already the leading usage market for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and as connectivity continues to evolve in the region, so too will Meta\u2019s expansion opportunities.\n\nWhich is why it needs to ensure greater connectivity between its key data centers and India, while Waterworth will also increase Meta\u2019s linkage to Africa, the next key developing region.\n\nThe project will be Meta\u2019s 21st subsea cable project, making it a key leader in digital connectivity and capacity in the world.\n\nWhich also comes with a level of risk, in leaving the connectivity of certain regions in the hands of a private company, though Meta would also have to reach agreements with the respective governments in each region to ensure free access to such infrastructure.\n\nBut even so, it is a consideration, especially given the Trump Administration\u2019s more recent moves to leverage America\u2019s power and influence over global trade, in various ways, to gain the upper hand in geopolitical negotiations.\n\nAnd when you also consider the TikTok ban push, there is also a level of risk in an American company in charge of data flow to such a degree.\n\nAgain, this would all be factored into the broader approval process, but given the increasing reliance on such infrastructure, there is a question as to whether private organizations should be funding such at all.\n\nBut, they are, and Meta\u2019s now moving ahead with the next phase of the project.",

The cable would be the longest to date that uses a 24 fibre-pair system, giving it a higher capacity, according to the firm. Sub-sea cables have become increasingly important as they provide the means to power a variety of digital services and transfer data worldwide at speed. One regularly-cited statistic suggests more than 95% of the world's internet traffic is transferred through undersea cables. Telecommunications market research firm TeleGeography says there are currently more than 600 publicly-known sub-sea cable systems worldwide. This includes the 2Africa cable, backed by Meta and mobile network operators such as Orange, Vodafone and China Mobile, which links three continents and spans 45,000km.\n\nTech's bigger stake\n\nTech firms that serve as major providers of web services have invested huge sums in cable infrastructure. Google said in 2024 it would build the first sub-sea cable connecting Africa and Australia, and announced a $1bn investment to boost connectivity to Japan with two new sub-sea cables in the Pacific Ocean. \"Over the past decade there has been a shift in which these cables are increasingly laid by large technology companies,\" Professor Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute told the BBC. He said this is in contrast to the past, where underwater cables were laid and financed by large groups of national telecoms firms, due to their considerable investment needs. Prof Lehdonvirta said this reflects the growing size and position of big tech firms to be able to fund such infrastructure independently - something that \"may be significant to policy makers concerned with concentration in digital markets\". Telecoms and technology industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said it spoke to Meta's ambitions. \"Meta has shown a strong desire to own more of the connectivity slice,\" he told the BBC. \"This is a further demonstration as it seeks to leapfrog rivals in providing users with an unique experience by tightly integrating hardware, software, platform and its growing aspirations in connectivity,\" he added.\n\nProtecting against threats",

Meta claimed in its lawsuit that Voyager violated federal and California anti-hacking laws, and that Voyager broke its contract with Meta by failing to follow its terms of service, which prohibit scraping.\n\nVoyager urged Martinez-Olguin to throw out the case for several reasons. Among other arguments, Voyager said Meta's allegations regarding a violation of its terms of service were vague, and that the complaint conflated Voyager Labs (also called Voyager UK) with its subsidiaries -- Voyager Analytics (based in Delaware), Novarize (based in Delaware) and Bionic 8 Analytics Inc. (based in Israel).\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\n\u201cMeta's theory of contract formation appears to be: there are billions of users of Meta's Facebook and Instagram websites, and Voyager UK allegedly was one of them; therefore, some contract must have been formed between Meta and Voyager UK,\u201d the company argued in a written motion.\n\nVoyager also said California courts lacked jurisdiction to decide whether it violated federal or state anti-hacking laws.\n\nMartinez-Olguin rejected those arguments in May, paving the way for the lawsuit to move forward.\n\nMeta has sued other companies for allegedly violating its terms of service by scraping data, including analytics business BrandTotal.

Once contact is made on a social media platform, the DEA says the parties often move to an encrypted messaging app like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. Finally, a payment is usually requested via Venmo, Zelle, or a similar payment app.\n\nAll of this, the DEA says, is directly connected to overdose deaths, especially when the drugs are laced with fentanyl.\n\nEarlier this week, the Wall Street Journal federal prosecutors are investigating Facebook and Instagram's parent company Meta for its role in illegal drug sales and whether it profits from those sales.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to Sinclair, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cThe sale of illicit drugs is against our policies and we work to find and remove the content from our services. Meta proactively cooperates with law enforcement authorities to help combat the sale and distribution of illicit drugs.\u201d\n\nJust last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken touted at a session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) recently launched a new collaborative effort with Meta, Snap and others to disrupt synthetic drug activity online and instead to have these platforms use their influence to educate users about the risks,\" Blinken said, encouraging member-states to participate.\n\n\n\nCongress established the as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 with the task of developing a strategic approach to stop the flow of these deadly drugs into the United States.\n\nWe went online, we used normal search terms and pulled up locations, sites. On pretty much most of the social media sites and apps that we used there were examples of both finished products, synthetic opioids for sale and precursor chemicals to make synthetic opioids for sale and delivery,\" said David Luckey, a senior researcher at RAND Corporation who served on . \u201cWe found that it was extremely simple and easy and inexpensive.\n\nLuckey said it's critical for social media platforms to self-monitor for illicit activities on their sites. If they are unable or unwilling, he said government regulations need to fill in the gaps.\n\nAction can't come soon enough: The number of people who died of a drug overdose in 2021 was more than six times greater than it was in 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For Americans younger than 50, fentanyl overdose is the , according to the DEA.\n\n\u201cIt might not benefit their bottom line,\" Luckey said. \"But if it keeps the people who are using their sites and platforms and apps alive, I think that\u2019s a tremendous value and if it takes extra money to do that, I think it is incumbent upon these companies to spend those extra monies to provide safety for the users on their sites.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.\n\nDozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.\n\n\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.\n\nAn analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.\n\n\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"\n\nCBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.\n\nUnder Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.\n\nBut questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.\n\nOne such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.\n\nThe two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.\n\nMeta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.\n\nThe Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year, including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.\n\nThe board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.\n\nAsked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.\n\nMeta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.\n\n\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.\n\n\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.\n\nMeta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.\n\nLast year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.\n\n\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.\n\nA study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations on cloud revenue in their latest quarters; Apple (AAPL) fell short on iPhone sales; and Tesla (TSLA) disappointed on the top and bottom lines.\n\nAnd that's weighing on the companies\u2019 stock prices. Google and Microsoft are down 1.9% and 3.1% year to date, respectively, while Tesla is off nearly 12%. Apple's stock has declined over 2.3%. Amazon is up 4.2% during the same period, but, as of Friday, is off 3% since it reported its earnings on Feb. 7.\n\nBut one company is thriving: Meta (META).\n\nThe social media giant\u2019s stock is up 25% since the start of the year and, as of Friday, is riding a 20-session winning streak on Wall Street. Why is Meta performing so well when other hyperscalers are falling?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not because its rivals are plowing money into AI investments. Sure, Amazon said it plans on capital expenditures north of $100 billion in 2025, and Google and Microsoft will shell out $75 billion and $80 billion, respectively. But Meta also plans to splash huge sums on the technology, saying it\u2019ll pour between $60 billion and $65 billion into capital expenditures this year.\n\nIt's simpler than that. While its Big Tech rivals are spending to draw outside customers, Meta's spending will power its own growth.\n\n\u201cI think Meta may actually be the most consequential company of our time right now, and I think it's because they are the ultimate customer zero,\u201d Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman explained. \u201cNothing they are doing as a hyperscaler is merely for the sake of reselling to others.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s investments are powering growth now\n\nPart of the reason Meta\u2019s AI investments are paying off on Wall Street is because the spending directly benefits the company\u2019s ad sales and the time users spend on its platforms.\n\n\u201cThey've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where \u2026 other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people,\u201d explained Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research.\n\nThe benefit to Meta\u2019s approach is clear in its early results. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, artificial intelligence is impacting virtually all of the company\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cImprovements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone,\u201d Zuckerberg explained during the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call in October.\n\nAnd during Meta\u2019s Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the company\u2019s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago.

The stock surged recently after the company reported strong revenue and earnings performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the stock's monster run, it still offers upside. The shares are trading at a reasonable earnings multiple of 30, consistent with the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%) average. Moreover, the latest earnings report revealed a few catalysts that are boosting investor confidence in the social media leader's growth prospects.\n\nHere are three reasons the stock is a buy.\n\n1. Meta's AI investments are driving higher returns on capital\n\nBig tech companies have accelerated their capital spending over the last year to support the build-out of technology infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). But not all are seeing improving earnings growth and return on capital employed.\n\nConsider that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have roughly doubled their capital expenditures over the last three years, but Microsoft reported earnings growth of just 10% year over year in the most recent quarter, while its return on capital dipped a few percentage points to 30%.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms increased its capital expenditures by 37% to $37 billion in 2024, but its earnings per share grew an impressive 60% year over year. This stellar performance increased its return on capital to a company-record 33.6% last year.\n\nMeta's improving returns on capital and robust earnings growth is boosting investor confidence in its AI strategy.\n\n2. Growing advertising revenue\n\nMeta's primary means of generating revenue from its social media platforms is advertising. The company's revenue grew 22% in 2024, reaching $164 billion, and there are two ways AI could benefit its future growth.\n\nMeta AI is a personalized assistant that could reach more than 1 billion users this year. As the company continues to train its AI models, this assistant will get better at learning about a user's interests and increase their engagement with Meta's family of apps. This could have a significant impact on advertising.\n\nLast year, Meta and AI chip leader Nvidia teamed up to launch Andromeda, a machine learning system that is improving advertising performance. Andromeda filters through tens of millions of ads to find a small number that will be most relevant to someone browsing one of Meta's apps.\n\nMeta has a powerful growth engine working here. Meta AI is helping increase user engagement on one end, and on the other, Andromeda is making it easier for advertisers to connect with more than 3.3 billion daily active users.\n\n3. Hardware innovation\n\nAnother factor that is raising investor sentiment around Meta stock is the potential for a growing number of use cases with AI over the long term. One of those opportunities is Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses that have reportedly sold more than 1 million, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic about future sales.\n\n\"This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path toward many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions, of AI glasses, and glasses being the next computing platform like we've been talking about for some time, or if this is just going to be a longer grind,\" he said during the Q4 earnings call.\n\nIt's possible Meta's Ray-Ban glasses might have hit their ceiling, considering how previous attempts have failed (e.g., Alphabet's Google Glass). But management is clearly not giving up on the potential for this to become a significant revenue contributor over time, and considering the popularity of Ray-Ban, these new glasses could find a growing audience.\n\nImportantly, this product won't hurt Meta's business if it fails, but if they take off, it would further validate Meta Platforms' AI strategy and fuel the stock higher.",

One of its most confusing features is the Meta pixel\u2014an essential element of any successful Facebook ad strategy.\n\nThis guide explains what the Meta pixel is, how to set it up, and different ways to use it to refine your ad targeting, boost conversions, and improve your return on investment (ROI) .\n\nWhat is the Meta pixel (formerly Facebook pixel)?\n\nThe Meta pixel is an analytics tool that measures how effectively your Facebook ad campaigns drive actions on your website. You can find it in your Meta ads manager. In February 2022, Facebook rebranded the pixel from \u201cthe Facebook pixel\u201d to \u201cthe Meta pixel,\u201d which now supports both Facebook and Instagram advertising.\n\nPixels are common across most advertising platforms. They\u2019re used to track visitors on your website so you can advertise to them later, a strategy known as sequential retargeting.\n\nWhen you create a Meta pixel, you get a unique Meta Pixel ID\u2014essentially a string of numbers assigned to your website. That pixel code tracks user activity on your site, including page views, add-to-cart events, purchases, and more. You can then see how your ads perform and refine them to reach more people likely to take meaningful actions\u2014like purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter.\n\nGet better ad performance with Shopify Audiences Shopify Audiences helps you find relevant buyers and lower advertising costs with custom audience lists\u2014powered by Shopify\u2019s unique insights from commerce data. Discover Shopify Audiences\n\nHow does the Meta pixel work?\n\nFacebook advertising used to require separate pixels\u2014one for retargeting past website visitors (custom audience pixel) and another for tracking specific website conversions, like sales.\n\nToday, the Meta pixel combines these functions into a single tool. Once installed on your website, the Meta pixel collects data on how visitors interact with your site after seeing an ad\u2014helping you optimize campaigns, refine messaging, and track conversions.\n\nThe Meta pixel works in six steps:\n\nInstall the pixel. Start by adding a snippet of tracking code to your website. Collect insights. You\u2019ll begin receiving insights about site visitor demographics, what device they\u2019re using, and traffic sources. Review behaviors.

No matter which page a visitor loads, the pixel will fire and record their activity.\n\nHere\u2019s how to set up the Meta pixel:\n\n1. Create your pixel\n\nLog in to the Meta Business Suite and go to Events Manager. Clickto \u201cConnect a new data source,\u201d then select \u201cWeb\u201d as your data source.\n\n2. Name your pixel\n\nAfter choosing \u201cWeb\u201d as your data source, click \u201cConnect.\u201d Then name your pixel.\n\n3. Check for partner integration\n\nNext, you\u2019ll be asked to check for a partner integration. Enter your website URL and click \u201cCheck\u201d to see if your platform supports automatic setup.\n\n4. Choose how to connect your website\n\nIf your platform supports integration, select how to connect your website to Facebook. Meta recommends \u201cConversions API and Meta pixel\u201d for the best tracking and optimization.\n\n5. Set up Conversions API\n\nChoose how you want to set up Conversions API. The easiest way is through partner integration. Choose \u201cSet up with partner integration\u201d and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\nSelect Shopify, then follow the prompts to connect your Shopify store to Facebook.\n\nFor more information on connecting the Meta pixel to your Shopify store, read our help guide.

Start selling on Facebook\n\nThe Meta pixel\u2019s targeting options\n\nThe Meta pixel offers four key functions to help you maximize return on investment from Facebook ads:\n\n1. Custom audiences from your website\n\nCustom audiences from your website allow you to retarget website visitors who have interacted with your site. Once the Meta pixel is installed, it tracks user behaviors\u2014like page visits and time spent on site\u2014helping you refine your ad targeting across Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe pixel tracks activities including:\n\nPages visited\n\nPage not visited\n\nDate of visit\n\nScroll depth\n\nTime spent on a page\n\nUsing this data, you can advertise to highly targeted groups or create lookalike audiences to reach potential new customers. You can also exclude specific groups, so you don\u2019t keep targeting users who have already converted or are not highly engaged.\n\nWhen advertising on Facebook, you can\u2019t target a specific individual visitor. Instead, you build custom audiences based on shared behaviors, including:\n\nPeople who visited your website in the past 24 hours\n\nPeople who visited in the past 180 days but have not returned in 30 days\n\nPeople who viewed a specific landing page on your website\n\nPeople who visited one specific page on your website but not another specific page\n\nYou can define time frames between one and 180 days and combine conditions for specific groups. Once an audience is created, you can choose when to advertise to it, select specific ads, or save the audience for future campaigns.\n\n2. Custom conversions\n\nA custom conversion tracks when a user completes a specific action on your website. It\u2019s created by selecting a completion page and naming the conversion. Typically, the completion page is some kind of thank-you page\u2014for example:\n\n\u201cThank you for shopping. Your order is on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for signing up. You\u2019ll receive your first email from us shortly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for your comment. Here\u2019s your free download.\u201d\n\nYou can create custom conversions independently of your Facebook ads, then choose when to use them in the future.\n\nBecause the tracking pixel fires on every page of your site, it can track when someone visits a completion page\u2014especially if they arrived via a Facebook ad.\n\nAssigning categories and values\n\nWhen setting up a custom conversion, you can choose a category to define the type of action tracked and add a monetary value. For example, if you create a custom conversion that tracks visitors to an ebook download page, you can assign the cost of the ebook to your custom conversion. This allows you to determine if your ad campaigns are profitable. If you charge $20 for your ebook, but you\u2019re spending $25 per conversion on Facebook ads, you\u2019ll probably want to adjust your campaign.\n\nThe custom conversion categories include:\n\nAdd Payment Info\n\nAdd to Cart\n\nAdd to Wishlist\n\nComplete Registration\n\nInitiate Checkout\n\nLead\n\nPurchase\n\nSearch\n\nView Content\n\nOnce created, custom conversions track across all your ads\u2014whether you optimize for them or not. You can generate reports to monitor conversion rates.\n\nCreate up to 100 custom conversions per ad account, and delete them anytime if not longer needed.\n\n3. Standard and custom events\n\nEvents are actions people take on your site. The Meta pixel tracks two types of events:\n\nA standard event, or predefined actions recognized by Meta across ad products. Custom events, or an action you define\u2014often used to track events not typically covered by Meta.\n\nMeta pixel standard events\n\nThere are 17 standard Meta pixel events you can use by copying and pasting a simple event code to your website:\n\nAdd payment info. For adding payment information during checkout. Add to cart. For adding an item to a shopping cart. Add to wishlist. For adding an item to a wishlist. Complete registration. For signing up for an event or email subscription. Contact. For getting in touch with your business. Customize product. For customizing a product on your website, like choosing a color. Donate. For allowing a visitor to donate to your business. Find location. For helping to find one of your locations. Initiate checkout. For starting the checkout process by clicking a Checkout button. Lead. For allowing a visitor to identify themselves as a lead on your website, such as submitting a form or starting a trial. Purchase. For when a visitor completes a purchase and ends up on a Thank You landing page or confirmation page. Schedule. For booking an appointment with your business. Search. For searching for something on your website or app. Start trial. For beginning a trial of a product or service you offer. Submit application. For submitting an application for a product, service, or program. Subscribe. For signing up for a paid product or service. View content. For when a visitor visits a landing or product page you care about.\n\nEvent parameters\n\nStandard events support parameters, which let you include additional information about an event, such as:\n\nProduct IDs\n\nCategories\n\nNumber of products purchased\n\nContent type\n\nConversion value\n\nSay you want to track events like scroll depth on specific pages on your website, instead of all pages. You can create custom parameters to segment audiences based on their engagement levels, allowing you to further define any Custom Audiences you create.\n\nCustom events\n\nCustom events are user-defined actions that aren\u2019t tied to specific URLs. They require adding extra code snippets to relevant pages and are used to collect more data than a standard event can provide. For example, you can track actions like video plays or specific button clicks using custom events.\n\n4. Dynamic ads\n\nIf you run an ecommerce site, the Meta pixel allows you to create dynamic ads. These ads\u2014also referred to as catalog sales in your ads account\u2014automatically show products from your catalog based on your target audience\u2019s behavior.\n\nInstead of manually creating individual ads for each product, Dynamic ads use a product catalog to show personalized recommendations to potential customers. .\n\nHow dynamic ads work:\n\nThe Meta pixel tracks user behavior on your website.\n\nDynamic ads then automatically serve relevant products from your catalog based on what users interacted with.\n\nThis eliminates the need to manually create individual ads. It\u2019s a highly efficient ad format option if your business has a large product inventory.\n\nLet\u2019s say a user views a pair of shoes on your website but doesn\u2019t make a purchase. A dynamic ad can later show them the same shoes (or related products) on Facebook or Instagram\u2014encouraging them to complete their purchase.\n\nWhy install the Meta pixel?\n\nDespite privacy updates\u2014like IOS restrictions limiting some of its features\u2014the Meta pixel remains a powerful tool for expanding your audience and tracking meaningful interactions.\n\nImprove ROI of Facebook ad spend\n\nGetting your ads in front of your target audience is just the first step in improving your ROI. The next step is getting your ads in front of the people who are more likely to respond positively to your calls to action. The Meta pixel collects user data that will help get your ads seen by these people.\n\nTake advantage of Facebook conversion tracking\n\nThe Meta pixel allows you to see how your audience responds to your ads in real time. It tracks how people are interacting with your website, and if your audience is switching between desktop to mobile. With this information, you can identify what\u2019s working, spot drop-off points, and tweak your Facebook ad strategy to drive more meaningful interactions.\n\nRun retargeting ads\n\nThe Meta pixel\u2019s retargeting data allows you to show personalized ads to past site visitors based on what they have already shown interest in. If a customer viewed a product, added it to their cart, or put it on their wishlist but didn\u2019t complete the purchase, you can remind them with a tailored ad\u2014increasing the chances they\u2019ll return and convert.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ad library is a good place to find inspiration for your ad campaigns. Here\u2019s a guide to the cost of running Facebook ads and the latest Facebook ad sizes.\n\nCreate lookalike audiences\n\nThe Meta pixel lets you find new customers who resemble people who are already engaging with your website and paid social ads. This will help you expand your customer base and maybe even find unexpected customer demographics.\n\nOptimizing ad spend with Meta pixel Insights\n\nThe Meta pixel tracks specific actions like purchases, sign-ups, and downloads, helping you see which campaigns drive real results. If a campaign generates clicks but few conversions, you\u2019ll need to adjust ad creatives, messaging, and audiences.\n\nBy comparing campaign performance, you can identify top performers and invest more in the ads that are working.\n\nImpact of algorithm changes on Meta pixel performance\n\nMeta\u2019s algorithm and privacy policy updates can affect how the Meta pixel collects and processes data. If you notice a drop in ad performance, review your tracked events and make sure they align with current platform requirements.\n\nReach customers everywhere they are with Shopify Shopify comes with powerful tools that help you promote and sell products on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google, and YouTube from one back office.

            "content": "Image by Getty / Futurism Neuroscience/Brain Science\n\nMark Zuckerberg's Meta says it's created a device that lets you produce text simply by thinking what you want to say.\n\nAs detailed in a pair of studies released by Meta last week, researchers used a state-of-the-art brain scanner and a deep learning AI model to interpret the neural signals of people while they typed, guessing what keys they were hitting with an accuracy high enough to allow them to reconstruct entire sentences.\n\n\"As we've seen time and again, deep neural networks can uncover remarkable insights when paired with robust data,\" Forest Neurotech founder Sumner Norma, who wasn't involved in the research, told MIT Technology Review of the work.\n\nBut, as Tech Review cautions, don't expect the potentially game-changing gizmo to hit the market \u2014 ever.\n\nThat's because the platform's built on a prohibitively large and expensive magnetoencephalography scanner, which detects the magnetic signals in your brain. The upside is that it can peer into your mind without having to place a device, like a brain computer interface, inside your skull \u2014 an invasive approach favored by other mind-typing techniques.\n\nBut the downside is that it's as unwieldy as an MRI machine, weighing about half a ton and costing $2 million. Not only that, but the scanner can only work in a shielded room that dampens the Earth's magnetic field, which would otherwise blow out our puny brain signals from being detected. And while it's being used, the subject can't move their head at all, or the signal is kaput.\n\nThat's a lot of caveats \u2014 too many and too significant to let the device become commercial. And yet, it's an undeniably impressive achievement, and Meta thinks it can use what it's learned here to give it a leg-up in the development of other AI models.\n\n\"Trying to understand the precise architecture or principles of the human brain could be a way to inform the development of machine intelligence,\" Jean-R\u00e9mi King, leader of Meta's Brain & AI team, told Tech Review. \"That's the path.\"\n\nAccording to the researchers' findings, the system is able to correctly detect what keys a \"skilled\" typist hit as high as 80 percent of the time. That's not flawless, but it's accurate enough to construct full sentences from brain signals, the researchers said.\n\nThis is facilitated through Meta's deep-learning system called Brain2Qwerty, which can learn what keys a user is pressing after observing them for several thousand characters.\n\nWith an average error rate of 32 percent, it's far from perfect. But Meta says this is the most accurate brain typing system using a full keyboard that reads brain signals from outside the skull, per MIT. Another one of the most promising approaches boasts an accuracy rate as high as 99 percent, but it relies on placing a neural implant directly on the brain.\n\nStill, Meta's system isn't likely to provide direct pathway to practical applications of the tech. The researchers are stoked, though, that what they've found seems to confirm the theory that our mind forms language signals hierarchically, which could be a boon for AI research.\n\n\"Language has become a foundation of AI,\" King told MIT. \"So the computational principles that allow the brain, or any system, to acquire such ability is the key motivation behind this work.\"\n\nMore on brain tech: Paralyzed Man Can Now Fly Drone Using Brain Implant",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nI noticed the compulsive behaviors first.\n\nThe way, at any pause or break in my day, my finger clicked the Instagram or X app on my phone, seemingly without my consent. Eating a snack? Click. Sitting on the toilet? Click. In bed, in the moments before falling asleep? Click again.\n\nEvery time the app began to load, I yelped, closed it in a frenzy and switched over to my email or, in one very desperate case, the weather app. Unplugging from social media was proving harder than I expected.\n\nStill, any attempts at unplugging for me would be inherently temporary \u2014 I use the apps almost daily as part of my job, making fully disconnecting from Big Tech a lost cause.\n\nBut that\u2019s something a number of social media users have been trying to do, especially after Meta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have aligned with President Donald Trump \u2014 foregoing fact-checkers and incorporating two Trump allies into high positions in the company. Many on the left have called for a boycott of Meta products Instagram and Facebook, while others have taken the opportunity to simply re-evaluate their relationship to social media and, by extension, Big Tech.\n\nThe movement to boycott Meta is only the latest iteration of an ongoing cultural shift. In November, following Trump\u2019s election, millions of users joined Bluesky, a nearly identical app to pre-Elon Musk X, right down to the shade of blue. Their reasoning was largely due to Musk\u2019s own political alliance with Trump, which had turned the once-innovative social website into a campaign platform for the right.\n\nWhich brings us to this moment. While attempting to ditch social media isn\u2019t necessarily a new trend \u2014 the potential dangers of these websites have long been documented, from mental health woes to privacy concerns \u2014 there is now an increasing skepticism around the politics of Big Tech specifically, leading people to find alternatives (i.e. Bluesky) or simply hang it up altogether.\n\nBut in 2025, social media is so ingrained in our society. These websites have woven themselves not only into the fabric of how we socialize, but of how we communicate as a whole. Is unplugging really possible?\n\nI was skeptical. So, at least temporarily, I decided to give it a try.\n\nSocial Media Fast: Day One\n\nIf nothing else, giving up social media \u2014 which for me meant X, Facebook and Instagram, the only three sites I regularly use \u2014 was an embarrassing window into all the ways I lean on the apps as part of my regular routine. It wasn\u2019t just to fill the empty space in my days; I reached for these apps to browse discounted vintage furniture (Facebook Marketplace), to send cringey jokes to friends (X), or to check the hours of a favorite pop-up restaurant (Instagram).\n\nIt was confusing. On one hand, I could recognize the dangerous way endlessly scrolling, searching for another hit of dopamine, was damaging my quality of life. (In place of social media, I began to spend an unnatural amount of time checking email, finally reading all those Substacks I\u2019m subscribed to).\n\nOn the other hand: How else could I get this useful information while also staying in touch with long-distance friends? (Not to mention the ungodly amount of things somehow connected to Facebook/Meta accounts \u2013 Spotify?!)\n\nI turned to my friend Marissa Butler, an independent bookseller who, like me, is an avid social media user in her late 20s. After Meta announced changes to its fact-checking policy, she posted on Instagram Stories asking her circle how they were thinking about their social media use. Were they deleting Meta apps or social media altogether? Were they re-evaluating their usage? Or were they just continuing as normal?\n\nSome people said they were going to give Bluesky a try. Others had already left Instagram, having quit as soon as the news broke. But about 90% of her friends, she said, were just as unsure as she was.\n\n\u201cIt also made me think, if we could quit social media in general \u2014 like we all would honestly probably love to do \u2014 what are we losing connection-wise?\u201d she asked.\n\nThat ability to connect is social media\u2019s great saving grace, the quality that constantly gets named when defending these apps\u2019 existence. For all their faults, how else could we interact with people from around the world? It\u2019s not just discovering that someone you had a single class with in college just had a baby (although it is for that, too). \u201cBuy nothing\u201d groups help locals trade and barter for goods; people fundraise and share mutual aid opportunities; citizen journalists in Palestine even used it to document the war.\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms, in and of themselves, can be seen as intrinsically neutral,\u201d said Daniel Miller, director of University College London\u2019s Centre for Digital Anthropology. While Musk\u2019s intervention in X is a special case, \u201cby and large, what these sites become is determined by users.\u201d\n\nAnd every user\u2019s relationship with social media can be different. Miller, who has worked with terminally ill patients in hospice, pointed out that having access to social media becomes all the more valuable for patients as they become less mobile. Barred from real-life social interaction because of their health, virtual social interaction becomes a saving grace.\n\n\u201cSocial media is used for a thousand different things,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like some of them, not like some of them. But what it is now is all of those things.\u201d\n\nSocial Media Fast: Day Two\n\nMiller\u2019s words echoed in my mind. At this point, my compulsive reaching for my phone had already begun to decline, but I wondered what long-term unplugging would look like, particularly for my long-distance friendships. Sure, I could always give friends a call, but it\u2019s far easier to comment on an Instagram post once in a while than commit to a 30-minute catch up.\n\nMy circle would inevitably shrink. Was that a consequence I was ready to accept?\n\nJennifer Oaks, a 48-year-old nurse, was one of the thousands who created a Bluesky account the day after the election. Ideally, she told me, she would go ahead and get off all social media. It\u2019s just not good for her mental health, she said. Every time she opened X, she felt like she was being bombarded with things that made her angry or upset. The constant scrolling, she said, was getting to her.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m just wasting my life on this social media,\u201d Oaks said. \u201cIt\u2019s just brain rot.\u201d\n\nOaks isn\u2019t alone in her feelings. In the 2019 self-help book \u201cDigital Minimalism,\u201d computer scientist Cal Newport wrote about our increasing reliance on these websites and how to curb our usage.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, (these technologies) dictate how we behave and how we feel, and somehow coerce us to use them more than we think is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable,\u201d Newport wrote.\n\nTherein lies the problem, at least as I saw it just 48 hours into my fast. Social media is both brain rot and a source of connection and information. The difference between the two, it seemed, depended on me.\n\nI found myself wanting to scroll during lengthy phone calls and television commercial breaks. But I also wished I could see what my favorite journalists were talking about on X, or check what sales my favorite small, independent brands were having (a very niche thing I use Instagram for: the abundant temporary sales on Stories).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a centralized place to get a lot of things, which is an improvement on having to go around and find all these things individually or call and just check around,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThere is no real way to substitute that.\u201d\n\nCommunity bulletin boards have diminished, along with most print neighborhood newsletters. Ironically, we\u2019ve replaced them with Facebook community pages and Nextdoor groups (another form of social media, if we\u2019re being honest).\n\nThere\u2019s a growing Luddite movement among some teenagers, choosing \u2014 out of frustration with the grip social media has on society \u2014 to go without those sites and other modern technology. I admire them. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel like that\u2019s an easier choice to make in high school, when your community is largely confined to school. My friends and family live in other states, even other countries. Keeping up takes real work.\n\nFrom left: Jameson Butler, Baruke Watling, Logan Lane, and Sasha Jackson in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, three years after starting a Luddite club in high school, are still holding true to staying unplugged. Ye Fan/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAnd how else do people find their favorite small businesses? Artists? Brands? Without social media, this knowledge can become more elusive.\n\nI discovered At Heart Panader\u00eda, a pop-up bakery in Atlanta that became a mainstay of my diet last year, through Instagram. Chef and owner Teresa Finney, 40, has been on some sort of social media since she was a teen, she said. But today\u2019s social media \u2014 with its rapid acceleration of AI and other concerns \u2014 bums her out. In recent weeks, she\u2019s grappled with her Instagram usage, but leaving social media doesn\u2019t make sense for her, she said, both personally and professionally.\n\nShe\u2019d miss seeing the digital lives of her family and friends. And while she does block Instagram for certain hours of the day, she still enjoys posting updates about her life and the bakery (Finney uses the app almost as an extension of a website, posting updates on menu changes, news about pop-ups and pictures of her cakes).\n\n\u201cLeaving Instagram, though very tempting at times, would leave a big lack that I\u2019m not at this point ready to live with,\u201d Finney said.\n\nSocial Media Fast: Day Three\n\nAs my period of social media abstinence came to an end, I wondered if three days was too short of a time. It certainly isn\u2019t enough time to break a habit, and while my compulsions had plummeted, I still caught myself trying to open the apps.\n\nSocial media is meant to be addictive \u2014 that much is proven. From the constant notifications to the stream of never-ending content, there\u2019s always \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 something new to see.\n\nDid it have to be this way? For years, watchdogs have noted tech companies have the power to control their platforms\u2019 misinformation, hate speech, and other rampant ills that fester on social media. While wellness experts have told us ways to make our specific feeds less toxic (unfollowing people we don\u2019t like; using the mute button), our efforts mean little without systemic changes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear that these apps have intentions beyond just being a tool of connection; one scroll through my redownloaded Instagram, and I was reminded of how much the app has become a breeding ground for brands (ones the algorithm thinks I\u2019ll enjoy) hawking their products.\n\nI knew going without social media would be a sacrifice; I didn\u2019t realize how much engaging with it was, too. I was always going to be fighting the urge to endlessly immerse myself in the brain rotting scroll, probably at the expense of my data. If these big social media apps were truly just a way to stay in touch with people, why do so many people feel compelled to leave? (Few have complained about needing a BeReal break.)\n\nButler has a healthier approach than I do. She told me she tries to make sure she\u2019s using social media intentionally, like to message someone whose number she doesn\u2019t have or to see what a specific person has been up to, rather than just scrolling out of habit. Instead of sending memes back and forth, wouldn\u2019t it be more fulfilling to get a voice note from a friend, or even just a text? She\u2019s been playing with that, seeing how she can replicate the feelings of being on social media while still regulating her use.\n\n\u201cThe solution is going to be uncomfortable,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a little less informed than we were before.\u201d\n\nAre you sure you want to delete? Are you sure? Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nSeventy-two hours in, I felt a little uncomfortable. A little freer, too. Unplugging is possible.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Social media isn\u2019t going away, Miller said. It\u2019s become too much of a part of the way we interact. People (like me) might use social media in detrimental ways, but they also use social media to actually be social. If Miller wanted to announce a conference on X, he has 12,000 followers on the site who might hear about it, he said. How else would he reach those people?\n\n\u201cPeople who have benefitted, in terms of their access to information or the ability to disseminate information, why would they want to leave it?\u201d Miller said.\n\nBut is that access, that potential benefit, worth all of the downsides? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice for my tastes not to be dictated by an algorithm; to find connection not just within these apps, but beyond them?\n\nThe answers will be different for everyone. Figuring out how to engage with social media in a healthy way will be a constant balancing act \u2013 one that may look different at different stages. (Taking a break from some platforms is a common solution: In 2023, 60% of US adults reported taking a hiatus from X, according to the Pew Research Center, although only a quarter said they were likely to stop using it completely.)\n\nAs I logged into my various accounts again, I remembered I meant to follow a friend who was moving in a few weeks to another state. I typed her name into the search bar and hit request, settling in with the knowledge that our current jovial relationship would likely diminish to just this: comments and messages through an app.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s better than nothing. Or maybe I\u2019ll do the seemingly impossible and give her a call.",

            "content": "\u201cDaaaaaaaaad, the Europeans are picking on me again!\u201d\n\nAlright, so that\u2019s not a direct quote from Meta\u2019s chief of global affairs Joel Kaplan, who spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, but it\u2019s not far off.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Kaplan popped over to Europe to let political leaders there know Meta \u201cwon\u2019t shy away\u201d from getting President Donald Trump involved if it continues to face crackdowns at the hands of the European Union. Kaplan reportedly told the audience that it\u2019s up to the Trump administration to decide if EU penalties against American tech companies are unfair, but it won\u2019t be afraid to squeal if needed.\n\n\u201cWhen companies are treated differently and in a way that is discriminatory against them, then that should be highlighted to that company\u2019s home government,\u201d Kaplan said during a panel at the conference, per Bloomberg. \u201cWhile we want to work within the confines of the laws that Europe has passed, and we always will, we will point out when we think we\u2019ve been treated unfairly.\u201d\n\nMeta has certainly been in the EU\u2019s sights, racking up more than $3 million in fines for violations of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) alone, and faces an ongoing investigation that alleges it failed to protect minors on its platform. Earlier this month, Meta announced it would open up its Facebook Marketplace platform to third-party competitors in the EU following an antitrust fine. Then again, Meta could simply stop maintaining monopolistic control over platforms and breaking laws if it doesn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences. Just a free idea for Zuckerberg and the gang.\n\nMost noteworthy is Kaplan signaling a new posture when it comes to international regulators. The company has certainly expressed its displeasure with the penalties it has faced in the past and has gone so far as to dispute some. But now it\u2019s trying a new strategy: threatening to cry to Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most surprising move. Zuckerberg has been cozying up to Trump since he started polling well prior to the 2024 election. Following Trump\u2019s victory, Zuck made a point to go down and visit him at Mar-a-Lago, started changing platform moderation policies to be more favorable to the Trumpian agenda, and promoted Kaplan, a longtime Republican political operative.<\n\nTrump has also given some early signs that he might push back on attempts to punish American firms like Meta. While speaking at the World Economic Forum last month, the President said the EU shouldn\u2019t be fining American companies, calling it \u201ca form of taxation\u201d and saying \u201cWe have some very big complaints with the EU.\u201d\n\nIt seems Meta picked up on that message and is carrying it forward, wielding it as a warning against regulators who might be considering doing their job. Certainly can\u2019t have that, especially not at Meta\u2019s expense.",

These robots could potentially perform tasks such as folding laundry or pushing children on a swing. This new focus comes amidst the companies\u2019 ongoing rivalry in the mixed-reality headsets market.\n\nMeta has reportedly established a new unit within its Reality Labs hardware division specifically for humanoid technology development.\n\nThe company\u2019s immediate goal is to create a software platform that hardware manufacturers can utilize to break into this sector. Meta is confident in its market advantage, thanks to its development of sensors and computing technologies for mixed reality, and its AI model, Llama, which has been gaining industry traction.\n\nAlso Read: Apple\u2019s Revamped iPhone SE To Kickstart Pivotal Year Amid Challenges\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is also venturing into the robotics space, albeit with a distinct approach. The company is renowned for its preference for products where it controls all the inputs \u2013 hardware, software, and more.\n\nIt is said to be exploring a machine that would be a humanoid, showcasing Apple\u2019s AI and tightly integrated technology. Apple\u2019s robotics technologies are being developed by advanced AI research teams within its larger machine-learning group.\n\nAlthough an Apple humanoid is still several years away, it could potentially compete with Tesla Inc.

The stock surged recently after the company reported strong revenue and earnings performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the stock's monster run, it still offers upside. The shares are trading at a reasonable earnings multiple of 30, consistent with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average. Moreover, the latest earnings report revealed a few catalysts that are boosting investor confidence in the social media leader's growth prospects.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nHere are three reasons the stock is a buy.\n\n1. Meta's AI investments are driving higher returns on capital\n\nBig tech companies have accelerated their capital spending over the last year to support the build-out of technology infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). But not all are seeing improving earnings growth and return on capital employed.\n\nConsider that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have roughly doubled their capital expenditures over the last three years, but Microsoft reported earnings growth of just 10% year over year in the most recent quarter, while its return on capital dipped a few percentage points to 30%.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms increased its capital expenditures by 37% to $37 billion in 2024, but its earnings per share grew an impressive 60% year over year. This stellar performance increased its return on capital to a company-record 33.6% last year.\n\nMeta's improving returns on capital and robust earnings growth is boosting investor confidence in its AI strategy.\n\n2. Growing advertising revenue\n\nMeta's primary means of generating revenue from its social media platforms is advertising. The company's revenue grew 22% in 2024, reaching $164 billion, and there are two ways AI could benefit its future growth.\n\nMeta AI is a personalized assistant that could reach more than 1 billion users this year. As the company continues to train its AI models, this assistant will get better at learning about a user's interests and increase their engagement with Meta's family of apps. This could have a significant impact on advertising.\n\nLast year, Meta and AI chip leader Nvidia teamed up to launch Andromeda, a machine learning system that is improving advertising performance. Andromeda filters through tens of millions of ads to find a small number that will be most relevant to someone browsing one of Meta's apps.\n\nMeta has a powerful growth engine working here. Meta AI is helping increase user engagement on one end, and on the other, Andromeda is making it easier for advertisers to connect with more than 3.3 billion daily active users.\n\n3. Hardware innovation\n\nAnother factor that is raising investor sentiment around Meta stock is the potential for a growing number of use cases with AI over the long term. One of those opportunities is Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses that have reportedly sold more than 1 million, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic about future sales.\n\n\"This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path toward many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions, of AI glasses, and glasses being the next computing platform like we've been talking about for some time, or if this is just going to be a longer grind,\" he said during the Q4 earnings call.\n\nIt's possible Meta's Ray-Ban glasses might have hit their ceiling, considering how previous attempts have failed (e.g., Alphabet's Google Glass). But management is clearly not giving up on the potential for this to become a significant revenue contributor over time, and considering the popularity of Ray-Ban, these new glasses could find a growing audience.\n\nImportantly, this product won't hurt Meta's business if it fails, but if they take off, it would further validate Meta Platforms' AI strategy and fuel the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "I am utterly obsessed with all things \u201cAlien.\u201d Ever since watching the 1979 horror classic in my youth \u2014 at a far too young age considering its hard R-rating \u2014 I\u2019ve been eager to consume every single ounce of this iconic dark sci-fi universe I can find. I\u2019ve watched all the movies countless times, I\u2019ve read the Extended Universe books, and I\u2019ve played just about every Alien video game.\n\nBut much as I adore titles like 2014\u2019s Alien: Isolation (it\u2019s a top 10 game of all time for me), I\u2019ve always longed to truly step into the world of Alien via the means of virtual reality. For ages, this felt like a pipedream, but last year when Alien: Rogue Incursion was announced, it looked like my dreams were set to be realized. And after an agonizingly extended wait to play, this week I finally stepped into my favorite cinematic world thanks to Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 (PSVR 2 and SteamVR versions debuted back in December).\n\nAfter playing a handful of hours across several play sessions, I\u2019ve come away a little conflicted. On the one hand, Alien: Rogue Incursion truly is the VR game I\u2019ve wanted pretty much my entire life, allowing me to fulfill my dream of coming face-to-face with a Xenomorph (quite a deadly dream, I know). But on the other hand, the Meta Quest 3 port is disappointingly downgraded.\n\nRogue Incursion is the stuff of dreams for Alien fans\n\n(Image credit: Survios)\n\nAs noted, I\u2019ve had to wait a couple extra months to get access to Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 (my current VR platform of choice), and during that time, I\u2019ve worked hard to avoid pretty much all spoilers from PSVR 2 and SteamVR players. This instantly paid off when I booted up Rogue Incursion as even the opening took me by complete surprise.\n\nWhen you launch the game for the first time, Rogue Incursion recreates the ultra-iconic title sequence from the first \u201cAlien\u201d movie (my favorite film of all time). You know, the part where the title is slowly etched into the screen while Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s pitch-perfect score sets the mood in a way that sends a shiver down your spine.\n\nThis fantastic recreation almost had me tearing up inside my Quest 3 headset. It was a memorable moment years in the making.\n\n(Image credit: Survios)\n\nAnd that was just the flippin' title screen. Actually settling in to play the proper game was a series of \u201cpinch me\u201d moments. From picking up the beeping motion tracker for the first time to firing off a volley of bullets using my trusty plasma rifle, it was heaven for an Alien fanboy like myself. Even a moment when a Xenomorph leaped from the shadows with its claws ready to cut me to ribbons had me at first yelling in fear and then positively cackling with delight.\n\nTo set the stage, in Alien: Rogue Incursion play as Zula Hendricks, an experienced colonial marine answering a distress call on the planet Purdan (also known as LV-354). Naturally, your arrival isn\u2019t a smooth one, and you soon end up stranded on the frozen surface, exploring a facility overrun by xenomorphs. It\u2019s a predictable setup for the franchise, but even this routine narrative feels surprisingly fresh when experienced through virtual reality.\n\n(Image credit: Survios)\n\nDevelopers Survios really deserve huge credit for bringing the Alien universe to life in the VR space. While Rogue Incursion lacks the meticulous attention to detail of Alien: Isolation (the gold standard in this area), its environments are undeniably Alien in nature, and all the sights and sounds franchise fans could want are present. Plus, much as the Xenomorph is a known quantity at this point, seeing a lifesized one charging towards you will spike your heart rate.\n\nAs a VR shooter, Alien: Rogue Incursion doesn\u2019t appear to be bringing a whole lot new to the table (at least based on the few hours I\u2019ve played so far), but just the Alien trappings are enough for it to be among the standout VR titles I\u2019ve played. Granted, I\u2019m hardly objective when rating Alien products, but even if you only have a loose familiarity with the franchise, I still think you\u2019ll find joy in Alien: Rogue Incursion's thrilling sci-fi action and well-worked jump scares.\n\n(Image credit: Survios)\n\nIf there\u2019s one distracting weakness I\u2019ve spotted so far, it\u2019s the ill-judged save system. Much like in Alien: Isolation, you can only save your progress at pre-determined spots (you need to unlock panic rooms). But this system means it\u2019s possible to lose several minutes of progress if you get overwhelmed by Xenos. For a VR title, where many players prefer to play in shorter sessions to avoid the ill effects of playing in virtual reality, it\u2019s too limiting a system. A \u201csave anywhere\u201d option or even just regular autosaves would have been useful.\n\nNevertheless, my grips with the save system are small fry when stacked against everything Alien: Rogue Incursion gets right. Being part of the Alien universe \u2014 but being safe from a grisly fate \u2014 is a dream come true, and I\u2019m having a complete blast slowly making my way through the game\u2019s cinematic campaign. It\u2019s just a shame I\u2019m doing so on the Meta Quest 3 headset\u2026\n\nQuest 3 isn\u2019t the place to play Alien: Rogue Incursion\n\nFor as much as I\u2019m enjoying Alien: Rogue Incursion, I\u2019m a little too aware that I\u2019m currently experiencing the very worst version of the game via Quest 3.\n\nAs you can see in the below comparison video (courtesy of UploadVR), the Quest 3 port is quite significantly downgraded compared to the experience currently available on PSVR 2 and SteamVR platforms.\n\nAlien: Rogue Incursion VR Graphics Comparison - Quest 3 vs PlayStation VR2 & SteamVR - YouTube Watch On\n\nGranted, the Quest 3 is the least powerful headset of the bunch, and unlike the other two doesn\u2019t have the horsepower of a current-generation console, or a beefy PC setup, to help it out. However, I\u2019ve enjoyed VR experiences like Batman: Arkham Shadow and Arizona Sunshine 2 on Quest 3 without feeling like my enjoyment was being impacted by the unit\u2019s less powerful components. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the same about Rogue Incursion.\n\nThe sense of unnerving atmosphere that I can tell Survios was attempting to craft has been significantly dented by the Quest 3\u2019s significantly poor lighting effects. Several interiors near pitch-black on PSVR 2 are instead bathed in harsh blue lighting on Quest 3, which drains the tension from the scene.\n\nBlurry textures are another frequent problem. In fact, texture quality is often so low, that it feels like the walls of the facility you\u2019re exploring have been coated in a thick layer of vaseline. Rogue Incursion is a great VR game, but if you have the option of playing it anywhere else, you really should.\n\n(Image credit: Survios)\n\nTo Survio's credit, they do seem willing to acknowledge the graphical downgrades on Quest 3 and have told UploadVR that a patch to \"address performance and visual issues\" is in the works. It remains to be seen how much of an impact this will have, again Quest 3 is the least powerful platform so some sacrifices are likely necessary, but I really hope a few post-launch patches can get the Quest 3 version a bit closer to parity with PSVR 2.\n\nIf you only have access to a Meta Quest 3 headset then I would still highly recommend Alien: Rogue Incursion, but perhaps with the caveat that it may be worth waiting to see if the promised post-launch patches can smooth out some of the technical blemishes. Either way, even in its current state, it\u2019s an essential title for Alien fans, and I\u2019m personally enjoying every moment.",

            "content": "Mark Zuckerberg recently announced changes to Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook and Threads, addressing past controversies over censorship and misinformation. And although his statements seem to have a calm demeanor and transparent tone, his credibility is questioned.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Zuckerberg announced Meta will end its algorithm-based fact checking process, and instead move to Community Notes, the method currently used by X.\n\nHe states, \u201cIt\u2019s time to get back to our roots of free expression on Facebook and Instagram.\u201d\n\nIn the video, he said government and legacy media have pushed for more and more censorship, both with political bias.\n\nBut the company\u2019s current algorithm-based system is making too many mistakes, and he explains that even if just 1% of users' posts are censored, that\u2019s still one million posts.\n\nBecause of this switch in tackling misinformation, his words versus his actions come into question, as the news came before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThis shift raises questions about whether this change is motivated by principles or political convenience. It also demonstrates unloyal attributes to long term principles of maintaining free expression through meta\u2019s social platforms.\n\n\u201cI started social media to give people a voice,\u201d he said\n\nWhile this is true, as Meta has connected hundreds of millions of users worldwide, we as users should still be cautious about his most recent statements.\n\nIs Zuckerberg noting principles of free speech to receive Trump's approval? Or was the company coerced into such extreme censorship measures during the Biden administration?\n\nDuring the Biden administration, Meta implemented algorithms that could detect any possible misinformation related to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAs Zuckerberg noted in the video, millions of meta user\u2019s posts were detected in this \"complex system\" and flagged and labeled as misinformation.\n\nEnjoy what you're reading? Get content from The Alligator delivered to your inbox Subscribe Now\n\nThe purpose of this new Community Notes method is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"\n\nWhile this method does pose a better outcome for fewer posts censored and more free speech, there is still room for question since Meta establishes whether a post is factual.\n\nThe announcement served as an attention grabber to the Trump administration, as he will be administering policy for the next four years.\n\nBecause Zuckerburg announced this just before President Trump was sworn in, the timing for these statements questions Meta's capability of being true to its word regarding its mission statements of emphasizing free expression and less content moderation.\n\nMuch like during COVID-19, if its statements were accurate today, we could've seen a backlash against the Biden administration making \"complex systems\" that censor users on specific topics. Instead, we saw steadfast cooperation, and Meta had become the forefront of censoring users from topics regarding COVID misinformation.\n\nOverall, we should not forget that Meta is like any other company that pursues more likeness and credibility from its users. Therefore, these statements can be subject to change based on public approval. It\u2019s important to stay cautious of these recent statements since they do not reflect a consistent action pattern from Meta's standpoint.\n\nAbraham Hilu is a UF political science senior.",

            "content": "In 2019, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nMore than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies such as Facebook and Google.\n\nWomen and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers such as Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data.\n\n\u201cThere was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,\u201d said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. \u201cWhat I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Chou and other diversity advocates, the tide has now turned. Facing more political pressure and legal risks during President Trump\u2019s second administration, tech companies that previously championed diversity, including Google, Meta (Facebook\u2019s parent company) and Amazon are scaling back, scrapping or rethinking their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.\n\nBusiness Google ends hiring targets tied to diversity Google is the latest company to roll back DEI efforts amid more political pressure to do so under President Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader retrenchment across the business community. About 20% of companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 100 have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump was elected, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. Those include Target Corp., McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Disney.\n\nTrump and Elon Musk, who spent more than $200 million to help elect the president to a second term, have been vocal critics of DEI programs. In a fact sheet about Trump\u2019s executive order, the White House said many corporations use DEI as \u201can excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices,\u201d sending a message to businesses that they could get sued. Companies such as Google and Amazon also contract with federal agencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re reading the room, especially with Trump and Elon running the country,\u201d said Chou, now the chief executive of Block Party, a tool that helps users combat online harassment.\n\nCorporate pledges to fight racism including from Musk\u2019s company Tesla heightened after the 2020 police murder of George Floyd, sparking massive protests against police brutality.\n\nBut legal threats emerged in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions. As tech companies cut thousands of jobs, the massive cuts also hit DEI teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpending on DEI roles at Standard & Poor\u2019s companies started to fall in 2022 as mass layoffs swept the tech industry, data from Revelio Labs show. In November 2024, these businesses spent an estimated $1.3 billion on DEI roles, down 10% from November 2022.\n\nFrom December 2022 to December 2024, tech companies including Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon spent less on roles that promoted diversity and inclusion.\n\nDuring this period, DEI spending was down by 84% at Tesla and 53% at Meta, according to Revelio Labs, which analyzes data from various sources including online profiles on LinkedIn and Jobcase.\n\nBusiness Once a Trump critic, Mark Zuckerberg pivots toward the president President Trump and Mark Zuckerberg, the leader of the world\u2019s largest social network, have butted heads in the past. Now Zuckerberg is reshaping Meta for the Trump era.\n\nTech companies have pointed to legal risks in internal memos about why they\u2019re rethinking how they approach their DEI programs.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to keep President Trump on their good side, because they don\u2019t want to deal with any legal ramifications from the federal government,\u201d said Jared Slater, partner at Ervin Cohen & Jessup.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, a former Trump critic who said previously that improving diversity in tech is important, has in recent months aligned himself with the president and talked about the benefits of \u201cmasculine energy.\u201d The company told its employees in an internal memo that the legal and policy landscape surrounding DEI has changed and pointed to Supreme Court decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018DEI\u2019 has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others,\u201d Janelle Gale, Meta\u2019s head of human resources, said in an internal memo.\n\nThe company said it wanted to serve everyone and would no longer use its \u201cdiversity slate approach\u201d in which hiring managers consider candidates from underrepresented backgrounds when interviewing for an open role.\n\nMeta also ended representation goals for women and minorities, a program to source supplies from diverse-owned businesses and scrapped its DEI teams. Maxine Williams, Meta\u2019s chief diversity officer, became the vice president of accessibility and engagement.\n\nWebsites for Meta\u2019s unconscious bias training and TechPrep, a resource hub for underrepresented people and their parents to learn about computer science, are no longer online.\n\nMeta declined to comment but confirmed the memo, first published by Axios.\n\nHollywood Inc. Disney softens DEI efforts with Trump back in office Walt Disney Co. said it would change an internal performance standard focused on diversity and inclusion for executive compensation, saying it would focus on how the initiatives helped the business.\n\nGoogle said this month it was reevaluating its DEI programs after \u201crecent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d The company said it would no longer set hiring targets tied to improving diversity after previously setting a goal of increasing by 30% the proportion of \u201cleadership representation of underrepresented groups\u201d by 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Amazon told its employees that it\u2019s \u201cwinding down\u201d certain programs after evaluating their \u201ceffectiveness, impact and ROI [return on investment]\u201d but didn\u2019t specify which ones.\n\nIn a December memo to employees reviewed by The Times, the company\u2019s vice president of inclusive experiences and technology, Candi Castleberry, said the company is focused on \u201cprograms with proven outcomes\u201d while also aiming to \u201cfoster a more truly inclusive culture.\u201d Amazon shared the memo.\n\nAmazon Studios \u2014 which announced a series of ambitious inclusion goals in June 2021 \u2014 also has been making changes. In September, the Culver City-based studio removed a public-facing inclusion playbook from its website along with a goal that films or series with three or more people in above-line roles such as directors and producers included at least 30% women and 30% members of an underrepresented group.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said from the beginning that our efforts to ensure diverse and inclusive storytelling would be fluid and change over time,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in a statement. He added that the company strives to \u201ctell the very best stories, while empowering diverse voices in our storytelling wherever possible.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some tech companies such as Apple are fighting back against anti-DEI proposals from conservative shareholders. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, is asking that Apple consider ending its DEI programs, policies, departments and goals.\n\n\u201cThe risks to the company\u2019s bottom line stem from potentially getting sued by individuals for discrimination, potentially getting legal action from the government for violating civil rights law, and then the market backlash,\u201d said Stefan Padfield, executive director of the center\u2019s Free Enterprise Project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple recommended that shareholders reject the proposal at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 25.\n\nApple didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but the company said in a document to shareholders that the anti-DEI proposal was \u201cunnecessary\u201d partly because its board and management oversee legal and regulatory risks.\n\nNetflix has remained committed to DEI after Trump\u2019s executive order, stating in its annual report that a \u201cmajor focus\u201d is \u201cfostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable\u201d because it wants more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen.\n\nHollywood Inc. Amazon Studios wants half of its creative teams to be diverse by 2024 Amazon Studios announced goals to increase the number of women and members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups on series and films.\n\nThe Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming giant said in its annual report released in January that it educates its recruiters on how to hire more inclusively.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do in this moment in time is to stand up, to speak up, to be strategic and to keep moving forward,\u201d said Vern\u0101 Myers, former Netflix vice president of inclusion strategy and founder of the Vern\u0101 Myers Co., a consultancy on diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this kind of bullying to make us so fearful that we are paralyzed and that we draw back from our core values.\u201d\n\nThe backlash against DEI is affecting not only workplace culture but also nonprofits focused on recruiting more women and minorities into the tech industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Women Who Code , a nonprofit that got its start in California, closed because of a lack of funding. AnitaB.org, which brings together women in tech at its annual Grace Hopper Celebration, cut its workforce in 2024 and pointed to a downturn in corporate DEI investments.\n\nSome diversity advocates such as Freada Kapor Klein, co-chair of the Kapor Center, question whether some tech companies ever took DEI that seriously.\n\nTech giants seemed more open to diversity efforts in times of talent shortages because it helps open up a pool of potential hires, she said. Now they\u2019re rolling back DEI efforts amid layoffs and a political climate in which Republicans hold more power.\n\n\u201cIt is now fashionable to be anti-DEI. It\u2019s now fashionable to talk about masculine energy. It\u2019s now fashionable \u2026 to align oneself with MAGA interests,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you have to kind of ask, what is it that people actually, really and truly believe?\u201d",

            "content": "Meta said it was cutting low performers in its most recent round of cuts. However, some staffers and experts have questioned the company's methods.\n\nOn Monday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially kicked off the company's \"intense year\" by culling 3,600 of the company's \"lowest performers.\"\n\nThe CEO has been warning of the cuts since mid-January, telling staffers via a memo that the company had raised \"the bar on performance management\" and was planning to \"do more extensive performance-based cuts.\"\n\nBut when the cuts hit earlier this week, several workers took to LinkedIn to express their confusion at being laid off in the so-called \"performance-based cuts.\"\n\nOne former Meta employee said she was cut despite receiving an \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d rating on her midyear review.\n\n\u201cI frequently asked for feedback and was always told I was doing a good job,\u201d Kaila Curry, an ex-content manager at Meta, wrote in the LinkedIn post.\n\n\u201cI was never placed on a PIP [performance improvement plan], never given corrective feedback, and never properly mentored or provided clear expectations. I simply put in the work\u2026 I am not a low performer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was let go today\u2014but not because I was a \u2018low performer,\u2019\u201d another LinkedIn user, Steven S., said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: that label is misleading, and for many of us, it\u2019s flat-out wrong.\u201d\n\nMeta has not clarified how it is categorizing the affected employees and did not respond to Fortune's questions on the subject.\n\n'Low performance' label highly subjective and potentially unfair\n\nSeveral workplace experts told Fortune that, intended or not, the \"low performance\" label attached to the laid-off workers was highly subjective and potentially unfair.\n\n\"It\u2019s a terrible way to be labeled and is clearly unhelpful for anyone in a job market,\" Sally Maitlis, a professor of organizational behavior and leadership at Sa\u00efd Business School, said.\n\nBeing called a low performer at Meta may not mean workers will automatically be low performers in other environments, Dan Cable, a professor of organizational behavior at London Business School, said.\n\n\"These people might be superstars elsewhere,\" he said. \"So it feels to me like it's extra punitive because these are people that probably have a really high market value.\"\n\nNot only could this affect a worker's future job prospects, but the label could be misleading.\n\n\"There are a hundred ways of measuring performance at work and challenges caused by capturing individual performance within teams (when there is a risk of free-riding), or creative and innovative work (where performance is not objectively measurable),\" said Thomas Roulet, a professor and organizational sociologist at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHe told Fortune that being a low performer was a \"vague umbrella term\" that was \"a seemingly objective criterion while being entirely subjective.\"\n\n\"Some people might feel they are doing exactly what they are asked to do and more and yet be considered low performers because their work does not contribute to value creation,\" he said.\n\nCompany strategy over individual performance\n\nThe decision on which employees to cut could be more about strategy and general management than about each employee's contribution.\n\n\"If you are not performing, it might be because the activities you are asked to carry are the wrong ones,\" Roulet said. \"Finding opportunities through innovation and creativity takes time and might well translate into low performance in the short run.\"\n\nMeta may also have teams it's more invested in than others.\n\nFor example, the company plans to invest heavily in AI and AI talent, and has expressed interest in automating some coding work.\n\nPeter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton University, said communication about individual performance could also be to blame.\n\n\"Performance management is terrible in most organizations; they don't do a good job at all of telling people how they're doing, and if the extent to which they might do a good job,\" he said.\n\nDecisions may be made on a relative basis in some departments rather than across the organization as a whole.\n\n\"It could very well be that you didn't hit the low performer distribution and your performance appraisals because you are part of a group where everybody is adequately performing, nobody's on a performance improvement plan or anything, but you were the worst performer, and the lowest performer in your group,\" he explained.\n\nTech goes after 'low performers'\n\nMeta is not the only tech company to publicly blame its latest round of cuts on performance issues.\n\nMicrosoft has also said it plans to target low performers in a round of cuts.\n\nThe shift is a tone change from mass tech layoffs in recent years, which have largely been blamed on cost-cutting. Meta has said even it plans to replace workers who have been laid off.\n\n\"It\u2019s not new that a firm lays off people who are performing less well or who seem less able to adapt to changes required of them, but it is unusual to describe performance as the central or sole basis for layoffs, especially when the cuts are so extensive,\" Maitlis said.\n\nGetting tough on performance could be an attempt to send a message of strength to investors.\n\n\"The fact that they are backfilling means it's not that they need fewer people. It's that they felt that they had to\u2026clean house, as it were, and try to get rid of their worst performers,\" Cappelli said. \"Maybe they think the investors like that.\"\n\nThere's also overwhelming research that layoffs negatively affect a company's culture and can impact its reputation with potential applicants.\n\nThe fact that tech companies are OK with cutting and replacing employees may speak to a larger shift in the industry.\n\n\"It highlights the pressure many tech firms currently feel and their willingness in this climate to sacrifice the reputations of their employees in order to sound performance-focused and business-wise to their shareholders and perhaps also to new people they will be looking to recruit,\" Maitlis said.\n\n\"It may also be a reflection of the prevailing shift towards low care and consideration that seems to be sweeping through the U.S. at present.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "Companies are facing increasing pressure from regulatory authorities that are looking into any violations committed and possibly seeking to levy heavy fines as a result. Tech giants have been getting more vigilant and revamping their processes to ensure they do not have to face further scrutiny and do not end up in hot waters. Google's legal battle is still ongoing as it faces multiple investigations and seems trapped in a whirlwind. Similarly, Meta is dealing with an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. as well as the European Union. Amidst the ongoing tension, the social media platform seems to be giving in by taking a major step for its Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMeta is to allow rival classified ad providers to post listings on Facebook Marketplace on account of the regulatory pressure\n\nMeta has been dealing with legal complications where the EU has levied a fine on the tech giant of about \u20ac797 million, roughly translated to around $828 million as per a Reuters report, for favoring its own services and, in turn, pushing against competitors and for violating antitrust laws. As a result, the company has opened up the Marketplace to external parties and would now allow its rival ad providers to list on Facebook's Marketplace.\n\nMeta's Facebook Marketplace Partner Program seems to be a direct response to the EU ruling that the company conducts unfair trading practices that disadvantage its rivals. The company attempts to show compliance with regulatory authorities while still keeping in mind how the ads are integrated with the Marketplace. Mark Zuckerberg earlier suggested that the EU regulations target U.S. tech firms and seem to protect European businesses at the cost of American companies by disproportionately targeting the latter.\n\nThis seems to highlight a broader tension among tech giants, as other companies such as Google, Apple, and Amazon have also been the target of EU regulations. Meta's program is a response to comply with the ruling. Last month, Meta tested its program in Germany, the U.S., and France in collaboration with eBay. While the company is making efforts to fulfill the requirements of the EU's antitrust ruling, the EU is still going to see if Meta is in complete compliance with the November 2023 decision.\n\nMeta taking such initiatives is vital given how the regulatory authorities are getting more aggressive when it comes to violations and imposing heavy fines. Companies should be more vigilant regarding compliance to antitrust laws in order to avoid legal complications.",

            "content": "Alien\u2019s first foray into the realms of virtual reality, Alien: Rogue Incursion, released on Steam VR and PlayStation VR2 back in December 2024. A third version of the game, which runs natively within the headset hardware of the Meta Quest 3, was delayed until yesterday, February 13th 2025. Survios had said they needed some extra time to get this version right.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 headset is the successor to the legacy of the Oculus Rift which Meta acquired back in 2014 before the first generation consumer model of the Oculus Rift even released. I had never used a Meta Quest headset until my visit to developer Survios last November to try a demo of Rogue Incursion. For that demo, the Meta Quest 3 was connected to a PC with a cable, so the game was being run using PC hardware. I was really impressed with what I played of that demo, and when the game did release, we quite enjoyed it!\n\nMore recently, Survios invited us back out to their offices for a press & influencer event to try out the fully untethered version of the game. Being quite curious about this version, I ventured back out to Southern California to give it a shot.\n\nUpon entering the Survios building, it was completely different to how I remembered from my previous visit \u2013 the whole space was transformed into the dark and spooky facility of Castor\u2019s Cradle on Purdan. This themed space and just how well put together the production was ended up being the real highlight of my visit, so I\u2019ll be talking about that after sharing my thoughts on the demo I played.\n\n\n\nSo how does the Meta Quest version stack up? Honestly\u2026 from what I experienced, not very well. Keep in mind this is not a full review of this version, but this was the same segment of Alien: Rogue Incursion I played through during my first visit to Survios, and a section I had become familiar with from playing the game on release. It was just running on different hardware. Right after putting on the headset and entering the demo, I could tell that graphically this was a significantly scaled back version of the game.\n\nThe resolution overall seemed lower, the framerate wasn\u2019t buttery smooth like I was used to from the PSVR2 version, and things even got a bit choppy. I couldn\u2019t really make out the dynamic shadows in the game, it seemed like they had been either reduced or completely cut from this version.\n\nAs I made my way through this corridor sequence with Davis 01, the Xenomorphs attacked. When this activity started happening, I noticed a wave of pixelation which appeared, seemingly to maintain the framerate during this high action sequence.\n\nContinuing down the hallways, there was another differing element I noticed. Everything was very\u2026 blue, much more so than what I was used to. There was a thick draw distance haze which appeared more as a fog of war than anything else. Seemingly gone was the volumetric fog that so impressed me in the PSVR2 version.\n\nHere are some examples of exactly how the game looked during this demo sequence:\n\nSo much of the immersive experience of Alien: Rogue Incursion relies on the incredible atmosphere. It\u2019s a huge part of the game\u2019s appeal for me as an Alien fan, and the Meta Quest 3 version unfortunately just doesn\u2019t measure up to how the game should be experienced.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad, though. I will say, though I consider the PSVR2 version to be the best way to experience the game, given its impressive graphics, and that it\u2019s the only version with haptic vibration in the headset itself, the Meta Quest 3 is the most comfortable VR headset I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s also an incredibly crisp image when playing with the headset while it\u2019s tethered.\n\nIf you have a gaming PC that meets the recommended specs, I\u2019d highly recommend using your Meta Quest 3 headset to play the PCVR version of the game, as you\u2019ll be getting a much more visually impressive experience.\n\nApparently a significant patch is coming next week to address some of these issues with the Quest version.\n\nIf you have a Meta Quest 3 headset and use it natively and without a gaming PC, I imagine you\u2019ll still be able to have a decent experience with Alien: Rogue Incursion. However, after having been completely spoiled from playing the PSVR2 version, I can only really recommend the native Meta Quest 3 version if it\u2019s your only avenue for experiencing VR games, and you really want to play Rogue Incursion.\n\nIt just feels like the hardware is barely hanging on with this game. Hopefully, once Meta eventually releases their next headset, we\u2019ll be able to have a completely untethered experience that is visually on par with PSVR2 and PCVR. Either that or fingers crossed Survios can improve the optimization for this version with further patches.\n\nNow as far as my visit itself goes, I gotta hand it to Survios, they put on a fantastic event for this demo. I\u2019ve always loved Alien attractions and themed spaces, be them Halloween Horror Nights AvP mazes, Madame Tussauds Alien: Covenant experience, the ill-fated Malaysia theme park area, or the now defunct Alien: Descent attraction, they\u2019re the one thing that can be more immersive than VR itself for me.\n\nRight when I entered the building, I passed a black curtain into a dark space. After I was checked in, I had a look around this dark and moody entrance area. The classic Alien alarm siren was blaring, red warning lights were going off, and a gigantic monitor was swaying back and forth as it displayed the Gemini Exoplanet Solutions logo and various other imagery. Tubes were chaotically strewn across the ceiling, and one of the larger ones was dripping neon green (Kenner style) slime.\n\nI continued into a scare hallway set like an industrial space with thick mist covering the floor. Ahead was a monitor displaying camera feeds from the facility. I was surprised by a survivor (scare actor) behind some barrels, scratch marks strewn across his face. He got my attention by telling me:\n\n\u201cIt got loose! Check the monitor! Check the monitor!\u201d\n\nI obliged and examined the screen, then a Facehugger shot out of a mist filled case and gave me a good scare. After exiting this hallway, I passed through some strip curtains flanked by alarm klaxon lights into the main waiting area. This larger room was awesome, really evoking the feel of a facility in the midst of a Xenomorph outbreak.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my timeslot to play through the demo, I enjoyed conversations with some of the folks around. There was a representative from the Walt Disney Archives, who told me that the Alien eggs on display were actual props used in the film Alien: Covenant.\n\n\n\nThere was a bar sporting the Gemini Exoplanet Solutions logo and featuring Alien themed cocktails, as well as some awesome looking Alien-themed hors d\u2019oeuvres. I couldn\u2019t help but think of the \u201cDisney shill\u201d accusations I was putting myself at risk of while I enjoyed these. To be honest, though, I wish there were more themed Alien experiences like this for the public. Predator cosplayer who goes by \u201cozzyhuntress\u201d suggested an Alien-themed nightclub, how cool would that be?! You\u2019ve done it with Star Wars, Disney!\n\nIn the back of this room was a large frosted window which showed the shadows of Xenomorphs, facehuggers, and hapless humans trying (and failing) to survive. These shadows were using the same models from the game. Another facehugger was projected onto the wall, emerging from an egg. It reared up before scurrying away.\n\nIn the center of the room was more dripping slime into an acid-burned drum. One of the tubes even shook as I could hear a facehugger scuttering through. Not even the bathroom was safe. It was filled with red warning lights and after the door closed an air canon gave me another jump scare.\n\nThis was just a top-tier level atmospheric space, and I really have to hand it to Creative Director Steven Petersen and his team at CLOVE for putting this together. We\u2019re planning to have him on the podcast soon to actually discuss this topic of themed spaces.\n\nCheck out some more shots of the event space below:\n\nSo while the demo itself was unfortunately not at the quality I was hoping for, the journey out to LA was totally worth it just to vibe out in this space for a bit. I also had the opportunity to talk a bit more with Eugene Elkin, the game\u2019s director and lead software engineer. We\u2019ll be looking to have some folks from Survios on the podcast soon to discuss Alien: Rogue Incursion in more details. A big thanks to them for the invite out to this really great event.\n\nFrom AvP Galaxy, this is Ridgetop signing off.",

            "content": "Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) isn't a cheap stock anymore, at least on a dollars-per-share basis. Its stock price has reached over $700 per share, a range that many investors begin wondering if a stock split is imminent. Meta has never split its stock before, so this is a bit of uncharted territory for the company.\n\nIs Meta due for a stock split soon? After all, it's near a range where many of its big tech peers have enacted stock splits.\n\nThere is no historical precedent for a Meta Platforms stock split\n\nWith the success of big tech stocks over the past decade, many of them have undergone stock splits. Apple underwent one in 2020 when it split its stock 4-for-1. At that time, Apple was trading over $500 per share, which was not far from where Meta is now. Nvidia has undergone two stock splits in its meteoric rise: one in 2021 and another in 2024. The 2024 one occurred when the stock was trading around $1,200 per share, while the 2021 split occurred when the stock was trading just shy of $800.\n\nSo, there's historical precedent for a company like Meta to split its stock around these price points, but why does it matter?\n\nInvestors get excited for stock splits because they perceive the stock to suddenly be cheaper. This is rooted in psychological thinking, even though not much has changed with the stock.\n\nMost stock splits are purely cosmetic, although they do have some benefits. They are:\n\nStock splits allow companies to give stock grants to employees more easily.\n\nStock splits allow investors without access to fractional shares to purchase the stock more easily.\n\nStock splits open up more option strategies to investors.\n\nI'd argue that only the first point truly matters to the company, so it's clear that stock splits are mostly cosmetic. However, I think that finding companies splitting their stock is a smart idea, as companies only split their stock for one reason: The stock price has risen a lot.\n\nFinding companies with rising stock prices is smart, as it indicates that the business is doing well. While some may shy away from buying a stock that has risen so much, I believe it indicates a high-quality company -- something Meta clearly is.\n\nMeta Platforms has become even more dominant over the past few years\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent company of social media sites Facebook, Threads, Instagram, and WhatsApp. These dominant platforms generate a ton of advertising revenue, which has turned Meta into an absolute financial powerhouse. In Q4 alone, Meta's Family of Apps generated $47.3 billion in revenue and converted $28.3 billion of that into operating income. That's a 61% operating margin, which is nearly unheard of from any company in any industry.\n\nWhile Meta has started to pay dividends and repurchase shares, it's using much of that cash flow to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) offering. In 2025, Meta expects to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures, mostly centered around its AI investments. That's a lot of money, but it's clear that there's a huge market opportunity there.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that 2025 will be the year when an AI agent can create a good mid-level engineer. This would be a massive breakthrough and would multiply the company's engineering power, boosting its resources.\n\nRight now, AI isn't a profit center for Meta; it's a cost. However, there are a few avenues where it could help Meta generate revenue, but those days are still a bit in the future. As a result, we should value the company on its current business.\n\nMeta Platforms trades for 30 times trailing earnings and 28 times forward earnings, indicating that Wall Street isn't as bullish on its 2025 prospects.\n\nThis can be traced back to Meta's massive expenditure plan for 2025, but I still think it is a reasonable price to pay for a company with Meta's dominance in both the social media field and the generative AI sector.\n\nWhile I'm not sure if Meta Platforms will undergo a stock split anytime soon, I don't think it matters, as the stock looks like a great buy now and doesn't need the catalyst of a stock split to send it higher.",

            "content": "The organization Equal Rights Center (ERC) filed a lawsuit against Meta on Tuesday alleging that it unlawfully discriminated against Black Facebook and Instagram users by disproportionately advertising for-profit colleges and universities to Black users, while marketing public colleges and universities to white users.\n\nERC argued in its complaint that Meta\u2019s discriminatory marketing practices were unlawful because they violated both the District of Columbia Human Rights Act (DCHRA) and the DC Consumer Protection Procedures Act (CPPA). The civil rights organization asserted that Meta collected data from third party sites and apps \u2014 including race demographic information from the ACT college entrance exam site\u2014and from its own Facebook and Instagram to analyze user behavior. Meta then used that data to create personalized ads for users based on their website, app, and social media use.\n\nMeta\u2019s marketing strategies have been particularly harmful to Black communities, according to ERC, because Meta denied Black users the chance to explore public college and university opportunities while they promoted such opportunities to white users. The complaint further averred that for-profit colleges and universities often charge higher tuition rates and provide fewer post-graduate job opportunities, which puts Black communities at a disadvantage as compared to their white counterparts. In sum, this has resulted in unlawful discrimination against Black communities in violation of the DCHRA.\n\nIn addition to unlawfully discriminating against Black users, ERC says that Meta has also engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the CPPA. Specifically, the complaint accused Meta of promising to deliver users a \u201cvaluable and relevant personalized\u201d ad experience when it has instead \u201c[made] ad delivery decisions based on race.\u201d Moreover, the ERC argued that Meta claimed to offer users goods and services that would benefit them, but the goods and services had the opposite effect. To that end, ERC asserted that Meta boasted an advertising system that was of a \u201cparticular standard, quality, grade, or style that it [was] not.\u201d ERC demanded in its complaint a jury trial and sought to prevent Meta from engaging in its current marketing practices in violation of the DCHRA and the CPPA.\n\nMeta explains in its marketing policy how it uses tools called Meta Pixel and Facebook SDK to amass user data from businesses. This data supplies Meta with information about user website interactions, purchases, and app usage. Facebook states that it uses that data to cultivate a personalized experience by showing users ads, topics, and events that match their online activity. This is also known as \u201cbehavioral marketing.\u201d\n\nDigital redlining has surged in recent years, causing human rights groups to spearhead projects aimed at combating digital discrimination, such as the Digital Justice Initiative. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has called this practice the \u201cnew frontier of discrimination\u201d in that online ad-targeting has been shown to mirror societal disparities that have historically prevented certain communities from accessing opportunities afforded to other groups. Disparities in housing, employment, education, and legal system access are some of the major issues plaguing modern society, made worse by digital redlining. ACLU states that online and offline discrimination can be equally harmful to marginalized communities because users are being cut off from potentially life-changing opportunities. The ACLU has in the past filed amicus briefs against Meta alongside other rights groups, urging courts to hold social media platforms and online advertisers accountable for their involvement in digital redlining. The groups have emphasized that redlining is illegal both on and offline, and that tech giants should be held to the same Constitutional standards as they would be offline.",

After initial testing with IAS, we have been working with all existing brand safety and suitability Meta Business Partners to give businesses even more control over where their ads appear in Facebook and Instagram Feed and Reels.\u201d\n\nMeta says that advertisers will be able to work directly with IAS, DoubleVerify and Zefr to determine which specific categories they may want to block.\n\n\u201cThese decisions happen directly between businesses and their chosen Meta Business Partner, because businesses should ultimately decide what their own suitability preferences are.\u201d\n\nMeta further notes that approved partners are able to create blocklists for any category, as long as they adhere to the Meta\u2019s Discriminatory Practices policy, and that all reporting remains consistent with its established standards.\n\n\u201cThese content blocklists are intended to provide advertisers with extra peace of mind, ensuring they have more precision in avoiding adjacent content that may not be suitable for their brand. This solution can be layered on top of Meta's existing inventory filter or used independently.\u201d\n\nThe expanded option will give marketers more control over their ad placements, via the additional assurance of Meta\u2019s partner providers who\u2019ll be able to work with them to create more customized, comprehensive block lists.\n\nIt\u2019ll also mean that only approved Meta ads experts are being used to implement these lists, which should ensure better results, both for brands and Meta alike. Because sometimes, blocks and blocklists can go too far, limiting the potential of your ad sets.\n\nThis expanded solution should address these concerns, while still meeting advertiser demands.\n\nYou can read more about Meta\u2019s blocklist changes here.",

December\u2019s monthly job gains also showed an upward revision, highlighting that the US labor market ended 2024 in a better position than previously reported. Economists are thus of the opinion that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in the near future. Consequently, this increases pressure on inflation data to cool down before the central bank considers slashing borrowing costs.\n\nOn January 30, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d to discuss the stock market and the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged. Sticking to the opinion he gave in December, Gundlach was of the view that 2025 would bring a maximum of two rate cuts by the Fed. He reiterated that he was not predicting two cuts but that two would be the maximum number attained in 2025, keeping one rate cut as the base case for the year. The unemployment rate went up for several consecutive months before ticking down, which Gundlach thinks is a matter of deep solace for the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Outlook for the Stock Market Look Like?\n\nOn February 10, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth\u2019s chief investment strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss the 2025 outlook for the stock market. She showed bullish sentiment towards the market, particularly due to strong earnings growth. Comparing the current environment to previous periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and the 1990s, Bartels highlighted the role of robotics, AI, and Web3 in driving long-term growth in the present.\n\nShe noted that companies today fund investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage, unlike the 1990s. Her estimates showed that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the decade\u2019s end, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 growth stocks.

It counts Apple, Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel as customers.\n\nMeta is spending as much as $65 billion this year on capital expenditures for artificial intelligence development.

Ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day and as part of our global anti-scam awareness campaign to protect people online, we\u2019re sharing relevant product tools on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, new research into romance scams across the internet and updates on our enforcements against scammers masquerading as military personnel and others.\n\nWhat Are Romance Scams?\n\nRomance scams are a common scheme in which scammers target people in a variety of ways \u2013 malicious texts or emails, dating apps, social media posts, discussion forums and more \u2013 under romantic pretenses. In these cases, scammers would typically pose as attractive, single and successful individuals, often with a military or business background. They would send cold messages to many targets at once \u2013 in a typical spray and pray scheme \u2013 to initiate contact. If a target were to respond, the scammer would try to build trust over a period of time, ultimately asking for money or suggesting a fraudulent investment opportunity.\n\nAnti-Scam Tips Ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day\n\nHere are some tips on how to spot romance scams and stay safe:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nRomance Scams to Watch For\n\nIn addition to our ongoing detection and enforcement against scams, we worked with open source researchers at Graphika to find and disrupt scams that take advantage of people looking for relationships. Where these scams showed up on our apps, we took action against the scammers behind them, including blocking their websites and taking down their accounts. Here are examples of three common scams to watch out for, according to Graphika\u2019s research.\n\nMilitary Impersonation\n\nWe disrupted romance scammers who posed as US military personnel in an attempt to target people on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube and Quora. They typically posted about \u201cfeeling lonely\u201d and \u201clooking for love.\u201d If someone responded, the scammers would invite them to engage on WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal or Facebook Messenger, often using Nigerian phone numbers. According to public posts online, scammers would also ask for a wire transfer or an online gift card to cover the costs of a long-distance phone call or postage for a romantic gift.\n\nCelebrity Impersonation\n\nWe disrupted scammers posing as celebrities in an attempt to target people in the US, UAE, Japan and other countries on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X, as well as messaging apps and websites. They posted photos or videos of celebrities in fan groups or in comments, claiming they were \u201clooking for love.\u201d If someone responded, the scammers would ask to contact them via messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram or Zangi. The scammers would also ask people to send money via wire transfer, cryptocurrency exchange or gift cards under the pretense of helping the celebrity purchase romantic gifts or escape financial difficulties.\n\nFake Match-Making Agencies\n\nWe disrupted Kenya-linked scammers posing as fake dating agencies in an attempt to target people in Africa on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram, claiming to offer opportunities to meet rich men from Western countries or build relationships with \u201cAfrican women.\u201d The \u201cdating agencies\u201d posted about fictitious bachelors based in or traveling to Africa and looking for love, at times promising relocation to a Western country for a future partner. If someone responded, the scammers would direct them to a Telegram channel or WhatsApp group for more information, including about a fee for a \u201cbachelor\u201d\u2019s contact details.\n\nFinding Love While Avoiding Scams: A PSA from Rachel Tobac\n\nTo help people stay safe this Valentine\u2019s Day, we partnered with a top internet safety expert and ethical hacker, Rachel Tobac, to share how to avoid scammers who target people across the internet with romance scams.\n\nOur Latest Anti-Scam Tools\n\nHere are the anti-scam tools we\u2019ve built to help users stay safe.\n\nAcross our apps, we remove accounts that our automated systems find to be malicious, including those that impersonate others. But because bad actors may not immediately use accounts maliciously, we also show you warnings \u2013 encouraging you to pause and exercise caution \u2013 if we detect suspicious signals, in addition to applying restrictions to suspicious accounts.\n\nOn Facebook Messenger, we rolled out Safety Notices to caution you when you\u2019re chatting with someone whose account shows signals of suspicious activity, and who may be based in a different country. We are testing similar nudges to teens on Instagram and will begin expanding them to more users in the coming months.\n\nOn WhatsApp, people can silence calls from unknown callers to prevent unwanted contact, including from potential scammers.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTaking Action Against Scammers\n\nWe constantly work to find and disrupt romance scams targeting people across the internet, based on the malicious signals we identify and constantly update, as part of our investigations and scaled detection efforts around the world. In 2024, we took down over 408,000 accounts from Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Benin and Cameroon. They posed as military personnel or businessmen to try to trick people in Australia, the UK, EU, US, South Korea, Syria, Japan and Ukraine into engaging with them. This year, we detected and removed over 116,000 Pages and accounts on Facebook and Instagram, primarily in Nigeria, Ghana, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Benin, Kenya and Cameroon, engaged in similar activity.\n\nIn addition to taking down scam networks, we\u2019ve started testing another layer of defense that uses facial recognition technology. If our detection systems or user reports flag a potential imposter account, we\u2019ll compare the profile pictures on the suspicious account against a public figure\u2019s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures. If there\u2019s a match, we\u2019ll take the account down. More details are available here.\n\nWorking With Others to Protect People From Scams\n\nScammers constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection and rarely, if ever, target one single platform. They do so to ensure that any one company can only see a small piece of these scam campaigns. This makes collaboration with law enforcement and within industries, including the financial services industry, even more critical in our anti-scam efforts.\n\nFor example, as part of the Tech Against Scams Coalition, we\u2019re actively working with our peers at crypto and dating apps to bring together technology industry leaders, experts from law enforcement and NGOs from different regions of the world to discuss the latest trends and strategies to prevent, detect and respond to criminal scammers.\n\nRaising Awareness on Online Safety Around the World\n\nWe\u2019re running timely safety education efforts around the globe in partnership with public figures, NGOs, creators, consumer groups and others on an ongoing basis. Here are a few recent examples.\n\nWe partnered with Childhelp, one of the leading child safety non-profits in the US, to develop a free first-of-its kind education curriculum for middle schoolers on how to stay safe online \u2013 including recognizing and avoiding sextortion scams and where to go for help.\n\nIn Japan, we showed in-app tips on spotting romance scams that led people to Meta\u2019s Anti-Scam hub for more information.\n\nIn Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia, we worked with about 50 creators to help us raise awareness about scams, including romance scams.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIn Singapore, in partnership with Eyeyah!, the Singapore Police Force, National Crime Prevention Council and Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore, we published an illustrated guide on how to spot and avoid scams. So far, over 40,000 print copies have been distributed for free to students through primary and secondary schools art clubs.\n\nAs part of our continuous efforts to protect people from scammers, we\u2019ll keep sharing regular updates about our work to counter scams more broadly, including safety tips and product updates rolled out across our apps. Stay safe!",

            "content": "Okay, don\u2019t freak out, but Meta is about to start processing your private DMs through its AI tools.\n\nWell, kind of.\n\nOver the last couple of days, Meta users have reported seeing this new pop-up in the app which alerts them to its last chat AI features.\n\nAs you can read for yourself, Meta\u2019s essentially trying to cover its butt on data privacy by letting you know that, yes, you can now summon Meta AI to answer your questions and queries within any of your chats across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But the cost of doing so is that any information within that chat could then be fed into Meta\u2019s AI black box, and potentially used for AI training.\n\nAs Meta further explains:\n\n\u201cBecause others in your chats can share your messages and photos with Meta AI to use AI features, be mindful before sharing sensitive information in chats that you do not want AIs to use, such as passwords, financial information or other sensitive information. We take steps to try to remove certain personal identifiers from your messages that others share with Meta AI prior to improving AI at Meta.\u201d\n\nI mean, the whole endeavor here seems somewhat flawed, because the value of having Meta AI accessible within your chats (i.e. if you mention @MetaAI, you can ask a question in-stream) is unlikely to be significant enough to have to maintain awareness of everything that you share within that chat, because you could alternatively just have a separate Meta AI chat open, and use that for the same purpose.\n\nBut Meta\u2019s keen to show off its AI tools wherever it can. Which means that it has to now warn you that if there is anything within your DMs that you don\u2019t want to be potentially fed into its AI system, then potentially spat out in some other form, based on another users\u2019 queries, then basically don\u2019t post it in your chats.\n\nOr don\u2019t use Meta AI within your chats.\n\nAnd before you read some post somewhere which says that you have to declare, in a Facebook or IG post, that you don\u2019t give permission for such, I\u2019ll save you the time and effort: That is 100% incorrect.\n\nYou\u2019ve already granted Meta permission to use your info, within that long list of clauses that you skimmed over, before tapping \u201cI agree\u201d when you signed up to the app.\n\nYou can\u2019t opt out of such, the only way to avoid Meta AI potentially accessing your information is to:\n\nNot ask @MetaAI questions in your chats, which seems like the easiest solution\n\nDelete your chat\n\nDelete or edit any messages within a chat that you want to keep out of its AI training set\n\nStop using Meta\u2019s apps entirely\n\nMeta\u2019s within its rights to use your information in this way, if it chooses, and by providing you with this pop-up, it\u2019s letting you know exactly how it could do so, if somebody in your chat uses Meta AI.\n\nIs that a massive overstep of user privacy? Well, no, but it also depends on how you use your DMs, and what you might want to keep private. I mean, the chances of an AI model re-creating your personal info is not very high, but Meta is warning you that this could happen if you ask Meta AI into your chats.\n\nSo again, if in doubt, don\u2019t use Meta AI in your chats. You can always ask Meta AI your question in a separate chat window if you need.\n\nYou can read more about Meta AI and its terms of service here.",

It was a tweak to an accounting formula used to measure the depreciation of its expensive artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe change, disclosed in the social-media giant\u2019s earnings materials on Jan. 29, extends the so-called useful life period of certain servers and networking assets to five and a half years, from the four to five years it previously used. While that may sound trivial, its impact on earnings will be sizable given the heavy spending on these relatively short-lived assets.\n\nBy Meta\u2019s reckoning, the shift is expected to reduce the company\u2019s depreciation expense by $2.9 billion in 2025, which would, on its own, amount to almost 4% of the estimated pre-tax profits for the year. With Meta planning to spend as much as 75% more this year on capital expenditures to build out its AI capabilities, the effect will be even bigger in 2026.\n\nThe changing expectations highlight how companies are grappling with the temporary shelf life of the tens of billions of dollars of new semiconductors and computers servers they are purchasing to power their AI services. Meta is now hoping that the equipment will last longer than they had expected.\n\n\u201cWhile there may be legitimate reasons to extend the server life based on their actual experience, it also decreases the depreciation in the short run and improves the bottom line,\u201d said Ravi Gomatam, partner at tax and accounting firm Zion Research Group.\n\nMeta\u2019s chief financial officer, Susan Li, said on the most recent earnings call that the company is making efficiency gains \u201cby extending the useful lives of our servers and associated networking equipment.\u201d A Meta representative declined to comment.\n\nMeta isn\u2019t alone in changing its timetable on depreciation \u2014 and with it, the financial results. In 2022, Microsoft Corp. extended the useful lives of server and networking equipment to six years from four. In 2023, Oracle Corp. extended its estimate to five years, from four, according to a filing.\n\nOthers, however, have taken the opposite approach. Amazon.com Inc. said this month that the lifespan of the equipment is growing shorter \u2014 from six years to five. The change, which took effect on Jan. 1, will cut operating income by about $700 million, the company said in a filing.",

The AI inference chip has a thermal design power (TDP) of 150W, but the company claims that when compared to Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs \u2013 which has a TDP of 350W \u2013 RNGD offers a 3x better performance per watt.\n\nRNGD is planned to enter mass production in the second half of this year.\n\nIt has long been known that Meta has been looking to develop its own chips in order to reduce its reliance on Nvidia hardware. In February 2024, according to documents seen and reported on by Reuters, the company was planning to deploy the second generation of Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip.\n\nFirst reported to be in development in 2023, the chips, dubbed the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, are based on 7nm nodes and provide 102 Tops of Integer (8-bit) accuracy computation or 51.2 teraflops of FP16 accuracy computation. The chips run at 800 megahertz and are about 370 millimeters square.\n\nMeta was originally expected to roll out its in-house chips in 2022 but scrapped the plan after they failed to meet internal targets, with the shift from CPUs to GPUs for AI training forcing the company to redesign its data centers and cancel multiple projects.\n\nLater that same month, Meta posted job adverts looking for ASIC engineers to help the company build data center accelerators and system-on-a-chips (SoC), although the listings did not make reference to any specific project.\n\nMeta is not the only company looking to reduce its reliance on Nvidia by developing its own chips. Earlier this week, it was reported that OpenAI is finalizing the design for its first custom AI training chip, which will be fabricated by TSMC and made using the chipmaker\u2019s 3nm technology.",

            "content": "Of all of the executives who have cozied up to President Donald Trump over the past two months, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared perhaps the most eager.\n\nIn the weeks before Trump took power, the Meta CEO scrambled to ditch his company\u2019s fact-checking program, rolled back hate speech protections, and took an ax to Meta\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs ( reportedly with the blessing of Trump\u2019s current deputy chief of staff and homeland security advisor Stephen Miller). The billionaire founder has named Joel Kaplan, a former energy executive and a prominent Republican, to the role of vice president of global public policy and, on the night of Trump\u2019s inauguration, Zuckerberg \u2014 who President Trump once said could spend \u201clife in prison\u201d \u2014 wrote on Instagram that he was \u201coptimistic and celebrating.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg has since tried to assure Meta\u2019s left-leaning employees that the company is holding true to its values, but in an all-hands meeting in January, he stated plainly, \u201cWe now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government, and we\u2019re going to take that.\u201d\n\nThe question now is just where Meta\u2019s climate goals will fit in this partnership.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has used executive orders to pause tens of billions of dollars in environmental and energy spending and stop all new wind energy permits from going forward. He has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d designed to speed up approvals for energy projects \u2014 that is, with the exception of renewable energy projects.\n\nThe courts will ultimately decide the fate of these orders. But as Zuckerberg strains to stay in the new president\u2019s good graces, the White House\u2019s fossil fuel boosterism could complicate Meta\u2019s climate commitments. That\u2019s particularly true given that those commitments were already on shaky ground in the midst of the energy-sucking boom in artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has never made climate action his primary cause, in a speech to Harvard graduates in 2017, he did call on the class to join in \u201cstopping climate change before we destroy the planet.\u201d And Meta has worked hard to do its part. Since 2020, the company has achieved net zero emissions throughout its operations, thanks to a combination of renewable energy credits, carbon removal investments, and the direct use of solar and wind energy to reduce its emissions. By 2023, it had the largest renewable energy portfolio of any corporate buyer in the country, and just last year, it struck what it said was a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d partnership to power its data centers with geothermal energy.\n\nBut beyond accounting for its operational emissions, the company has also committed to achieving net zero emissions throughout its value chain, from the copper wires spiraling through these gargantuan data centers to the construction materials used to build them.\n\nThat\u2019s a far more challenging goal, particularly when every AI company is trying to build out their computing capacity as quickly as possible, said one former Meta employee familiar with the company\u2019s climate and energy strategy. (The employee asked to remain anonymous to discuss private matters.) \u201cThe fear in the back of people\u2019s minds is someone is going to say: These are voluntary commitments, and we\u2019re just not going to do it anymore,\u201d the former employee said, noting the \u201cherd mentality\u201d of Big Tech. \u201cIf one domino falls, do others?\u201d\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on how the company\u2019s climate goals may be impacted by the changing political landscape and didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about whether this week\u2019s layoffs have impacted sustainability work. But in its most recent sustainability report, Meta acknowledged that meeting its net zero goals by 2030 \u201cwill be significantly harder\u201d in the age of AI. \u201cThe challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta,\u201d wrote Rachel Peterson, Meta\u2019s vice president of infrastructure for data centers. Indeed, Google and Microsoft have both said they\u2019re falling short of their climate targets, and in 2023 alone, Meta\u2019s own data center energy use spiked 34%. Peterson wrote that this demand \u201cwill require major shifts in how companies like ours operate.\u201d\n\nSome of those shifts are already underway. Shortly after the election, Meta issued a request for proposals for nuclear developers with the goal of adding up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear generation capacity \u2014 enough to power a small city \u2014 by the 2030s.\n\nThough the company has plenty of apolitical reasons to pursue nuclear power and plenty of company among tech giants investing in the space, it doesn\u2019t hurt that nuclear power is also more politically palatable at this moment. Just last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive, promised to \u201cunleash commercial nuclear power,\u201d even as he skewered the pursuit of a net-zero future. Wright\u2019s secretarial order made not a single mention of solar and wind power, which make up the bulk of Meta\u2019s renewable energy mix.\n\nMeta\u2019s push into nuclear by no means indicates it\u2019s giving up on wind and solar. A Meta spokesperson pointed me to a new agreement Meta struck last week to purchase 115 megawatts of power from an Oklahoma wind farm. (Google reportedly struck its own wind deal earlier this month in Virginia.) But it does mean Meta is diversifying its energy mix to keep up with AI demand at a time when the federal government is least likely to get in its way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no repudiation of the climate goals,\u201d Benjamin C. Lee, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who was previously a visiting scientist at Meta AI working on data center energy usage, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there simply isn\u2019t enough wind and solar, and if you\u2019re looking to build another 100 megawatt data center, you have to get the energy.\u201d (Lee is now a visiting scientist at Google.)\n\n\u201cEnergy of any kind trumps no energy,\u201d he added.\n\nThat includes energy from natural gas. A few weeks after the election, Meta said it would build its largest data center yet \u2014 a 4 million square foot behemoth \u2014 in Richland Parish, Louisiana, which will be powered by three new natural gas plants. Meta\u2019s announcement made no mention of the site\u2019s power demands, but instead emphasized how the company planned to offset its impact by investing in community action grants, water stewardship, and adding enough new clean and renewable energy projects to the grid to cover 100% of the data center\u2019s electricity needs.\n\nBut Zuckerberg left all of that out of his post about the project on Threads in January. Instead, just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion AI data center partnership between Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank, Zuckerberg boasted that \u201cMeta is building a 2GW+ datacenter that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.\u201d\n\nThe pandering post signaled a pivot \u2014 not necessarily in Meta\u2019s actual plans for the data center, but in its climate-friendly messaging about it. In Zuckerberg\u2019s telling, the data center\u2019s sheer size, not its attempts at sustainability, were the selling point.\n\nStill, despite these rhetorical moves, three people I spoke with who have previously worked at Meta on energy and sustainability issues are doubtful that the company\u2019s substantial investments in renewable energy \u2014 particularly solar energy \u2014 are going away. That\u2019s largely because solar is still often cheaper than other forms of energy. Even if the political case is diminished, they said, the business case is still there.\n\nBut investing in renewables alone won\u2019t get Meta to its ultimate goal. Achieving net zero emissions throughout the value chain requires relying on materials that often do carry a cost premium. And it requires doing that at a time when AI companies are racing to one-up each other by building bigger data centers faster than ever before.\n\nIt\u2019s those commitments that appear far more vulnerable, particularly when the White House is offering every excuse for corporate America to give them up. \u201cNet zero was always going to fall by the wayside, but that was because of AI,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThe question is whether the gap between what we had hoped to achieve and where we are becomes larger.\u201d",

After all, the company owns some of the most popular apps in the space, from Facebook and Messenger to WhatsApp and Instagram. But Meta isn't just about social media.\n\nThe company has made it clear that it aims to win in the high-potential market of artificial intelligence (AI), too. Over the past few years, Meta has increased its spending in the technology and forged ahead with the development of key innovations, such as large language models (LLMs) and AI assistants.\n\nChief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg recently said the tech giant would invest as much as $65 billion in AI infrastructure this year and expand its AI teams. This is after already calling AI the key investment area in 2024.\n\nOn top of this, during the company's latest earnings report, Zuckerberg made three startling AI predictions. Should you get in on Meta stock before these predictions come true?\n\nMore than 3.3 billion daily Meta users\n\nFirst, here's a quick look at the Meta story so far. The company owns today's top social media apps -- more than 3.3 billion people worldwide use at least one of them every day. This offers Meta a pretty solid moat, or competitive advantage.\n\nIf you drop WhatsApp, for example, and head over to a rival app, you may not find all your contacts on that other platform, which encourages users to stick with Meta's popular offerings. This is Meta's key to revenue.\n\nAdvertisers flock to advertise across Meta's apps -- where they know they'll find consumers -- to tell them about their products and services. This translates into billions of dollars in revenue and profit for the company. Meanwhile, Meta has broadened its research and expertise into other areas such as AI, and this could benefit the social media business and offer the company the possibility of developing other revenue streams down the road.\n\nMeta already had set a goal of bringing on board 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), the high-powered chips for AI, last year. Most recently, the company said it aims to have 1.3 million GPUs by the end of this year. It has used this compute to train Llama, its own LLM, and now has advanced to the fourth generation.\n\nMeta has made Llama open source, so anyone can access it and contribute to its development and use. The advantage of this is that open source software often leads to the creation of an industry standard, which could establish Meta as a leader.\n\nMeta's intelligent and personalized AI assistant\n\nNow let's consider Zuckerberg's three show-stopping AI predictions for the year. The first has to do with Meta AI, the company's AI assistant.\n\nZuckerberg says he expects \"a highly intelligent and personalized\" AI assistant will reach 1 billion users in 2025 and predicts Meta AI will be the one. He also says that this year, Llama will become \"the most advanced and widely used\" LLM.\n\nThe Meta CEO says Llama 4 will have agentic capabilities. This could be key to unlocking significant growth, since AI agents involve applying AI to real-world problems. Agents are able to reason out complex problems and execute solutions, something that could be transformative for users.\n\nFinally, Zuckerberg says that this year, it will be possible to build an AI engineering agent with abilities that rival that of a mid-level engineer. He calls this \"potentially one of the most important innovations in history\" and says the company that accomplishes it first will have a clear advantage. A few weeks ago, Meta said it planned to build an AI engineer to help with coding as it expands its AI research and development efforts.\n\nThe right tools to reach big goals\n\nLet's get back to the question: Should you take Zuckerberg's predictions as a reason to get in on Meta stock now before these goals become a reality?\n\nIt's too early to predict whether Meta will be successful across all three points, but it's fair to say the company is offering itself all of the necessary tools to get there. Meta also is financially sound, so it can afford to invest in AI and continue delivering growth to investors through gains in revenue, as well as share repurchases and dividends.\n\nMeta has said in the past that its major investments always have taken time to bear fruit, and this won't be an exception. But 2025 could be a key moment along the way and a time when investors will start to see signs of Meta's potential in this high-growth area.\n\nFor starters, a widely used AI assistant may spur users to spend even more time on Meta's apps, and that could encourage advertisers to increase their spending there. All of this means that now, after Mark Zuckerberg's big predictions, it's a great time to buy Meta shares and hold on as this growth story unfolds.",

At Meta, we\u2019ve spent years developing safeguards to help prevent these crimes on our apps \u2013 and today, we\u2019re taking this one step further. We\u2019ve partnered with Childhelp, one of the US\u2019s leading child safety non-profits, to develop a first-of-its kind education curriculum to teach middle schoolers about how to stay safe online, including how to recognize grooming, sextortion scams and other types of online exploitation, and what to do if they or someone they know needs help.\n\nThe curriculum has been developed with input and resources from a range of world-leading child safety experts, including from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Thorn, the Department of Homeland Security, Purdue University and the Crimes against Children Research Center. It includes everything parents and educators need \u2013 from detailed guides for facilitators to fully scripted lesson plans, complete with interactive classroom activities and fun, engaging videos that help bring the principles of online safety to life for young people.\n\nImportantly, the lessons also focus on developing the skills young people need to navigate both the online and offline world safely, including understanding what safe relationships look like, personal boundaries and the ability to ask for help.\n\nFully funded by Meta, the curriculum is completely free and available to those who teach, mentor or care for young people, including schools, parents, community or faith-based organizations and after-school programs. It is now part of the Childhelp \u2018Speak Up Be Safe\u2019 program, which is already used to help students of all ages deal with a range of safety issues \u2013 from physical abuse or neglect to online bullying.\n\nTo help reach even more students, we\u2019re also teaming up with LifeSmarts, which will adapt the curriculum to equip high school students with the tools to teach it to middle schoolers nationwide. This helps high schoolers gain knowledge and leadership experience, while younger students will get to learn about these topics directly from older peers they admire.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, educators around the country will have a detailed, expert-backed curriculum \u2013 for free \u2013 to help students feel equipped to avoid sextortion and other forms of online exploitation,\u201d said Antigone Davis, Meta\u2019s Global Head of Safety. \u201cAt Meta, we continue to do all we can to protect young people on our apps, and those protections will be even more effective if teens also feel confident in spotting potential harms and know where to go for help. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited for this curriculum to get into the hands of teachers and parents all over the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful to Meta for its support in launching this crucial prevention module,\u201d said Michael Medoro, Chief of Staff at Childhelp. \u201cWith the increase in online dangers, this partnership will allow facilitators of the lessons to empower millions of young people to speak up and be comfortable in asking for help. Together, we are building a safer future for our children.\u201d\n\nAdele Taylor, Senior Youth Programs and Partnerships Manager at Thorn, added: \u201cYoung people are at the center of the digital world we all live in, and it\u2019s critical that they not only have the resources but also a voice in shaping the solutions designed to keep them safe. By involving the NoFiltr Youth Innovation Council in the development of this curriculum, we\u2019re making sure that the content resonates, is practical and empowers students with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate digital spaces safely.\u201d\n\nThis new curriculum builds on our recent anti-sextortion PSA campaign, where we worked with NCMEC and Thorn to develop an educational video that helps teens recognize signs that someone may be a sextortion scammer. The video was shown directly in the Instagram Feeds of millions of teens and young people in the US, Canada, Australia and the UK.\n\nAt Meta, we\u2019ve developed a range of safety features designed to fight sextortion scammers at every step. We remove these scammers whenever we become aware of them, and we notify people who have been interacting with an account on Instagram we\u2019ve removed for sextortion. We also take precautionary steps to help prevent sextortion in the first place, such as preventing potentially scammy accounts from interacting with teens, and testing letting teens know if they\u2019re chatting to someone who\u2019s based in another country. Our nudity protection feature blurs nude images shared in DMs and warns people about the risks of sending sensitive photos, and we\u2019ve removed the ability to screenshot or screen record \u2018view once\u2019 photos and videos in DM and Messenger, helping prevent those images from being misused.",

            "content": "This blog post is co-written with George Orlin from Meta.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Meta\u2019s Segment Anything Model (SAM) 2.1 vision segmentation model is publicly available through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to deploy and run inference. Meta SAM 2.1 provides state-of-the-art video and image segmentation capabilities in a single model. This cutting-edge model supports long-context processing, complex segmentation scenarios, and fine-grained analysis, making it ideal for automating processes for various industries such as medical imaging in healthcare, satellite imagery for environment monitoring, and object segmentation for autonomous systems. Meta SAM 2.1 is well suited for zero-shot object segmentation and accurate object detection based on simple prompts such as point coordinates and bounding boxes in a frame for video tracking and image masking.\n\nThis model was predominantly trained on AWS, and AWS will also be the first cloud provider to make it available to customers. In this post, we walk through how to discover and deploy the Meta SAM 2.1 model using SageMaker JumpStart.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 overview\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 is a state-of-the-art vision segmentation model designed for high-performance computer vision tasks, enabling advanced object detection and segmentation workflows. Building upon its predecessor, version 2.1 introduces enhanced segmentation accuracy, robust generalization across diverse datasets, and scalability for production-grade applications. These features enable AI researchers and developers in computer vision, image processing, and data-driven research to improve tasks that require detailed analysis segmentation across multiple fields.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 has a streamlined architecture that is optimized for integration with popular model-serving frameworks like TorchServe and can be deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI to power real-time or batch inference pipelines. Meta SAM 2.1 empowers organizations to achieve precise segmentation outcomes in vision-centric workflows with minimal configuration and maximum efficiency.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 offers multiple variants\u2014Tiny, Small, Base Plus, and Large\u2014available now on SageMaker JumpStart, balancing model size, speed, and segmentation performance to cater to diverse application needs.\n\nSageMaker JumpStart overview\n\nSageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch.\n\nWith SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. Models hosted on JumpStart can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia based instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune it using the extensive capabilities of SageMaker AI, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability. With SageMaker AI, you can streamline the entire model deployment process.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the following prerequisites to deploy Meta SAM 2.1 and run inference:\n\nAn AWS account that will contain all your AWS resources.\n\nAn AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to access SageMaker AI. To learn more about how IAM works with SageMaker AI, refer to Identity and Access Management for Amazon SageMaker AI.\n\nAccess to Amazon SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker notebook instance or an interactive development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. We recommend using SageMaker Studio for straightforward deployment and inference.\n\nAccess to accelerated instances (GPUs) for hosting the model.\n\nDiscover Meta SAM 2.1 in SageMaker JumpStart\n\nSageMaker JumpStart provides FMs through two primary interfaces: SageMaker Studio and the SageMaker Python SDK. This provides multiple options to discover and use hundreds of models for your specific use case.\n\nSageMaker Studio is a comprehensive IDE that offers a unified, web-based interface for performing all aspects of the machine learning (ML) development lifecycle. From preparing data to building, training, and deploying models, SageMaker Studio provides purpose-built tools to streamline the entire process. In SageMaker Studio, you can access SageMaker JumpStart to discover and explore the extensive catalog of FMs available for deployment to inference capabilities on SageMaker Inference.\n\nYou can access the SageMaker JumpStart UI through either Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio or SageMaker Studio. To deploy Meta SAM 2.1 using the SageMaker JumpStart UI, complete the following steps:\n\nIn SageMaker Unified Studio, on the Build menu, choose JumpStart models.\n\nIf you\u2019re already on the SageMaker Studio console, choose JumpStart in the navigation pane.\n\nYou will be prompted to create a project, after which you can begin deployment.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the SageMaker Python SDK to programmatically access and use SageMaker JumpStart models. This approach allows for greater flexibility and integration with existing AI/ML workflows and pipelines. By providing multiple access points, SageMaker JumpStart helps you seamlessly incorporate pre-trained models into your AI/ML development efforts, regardless of your preferred interface or workflow.\n\nDeploy Meta SAM 2.1 for inference using SageMaker JumpStart\n\nOn the SageMaker JumpStart landing page, you can discover the public pre-trained models offered by SageMaker AI. You can choose the Meta model provider tab to discover the Meta models available.\n\nIf you\u2019re using SageMaker Studio and don\u2019t see the SAM 2.1 models, update your SageMaker Studio version by shutting down and restarting. For more information about version updates, refer to Shut down and Update Studio Classic Apps.\n\nYou can choose the model card to view details about the model such as license, data used to train, and how to use. You can also find two buttons, Deploy and Open Notebook, which help you use the model.\n\nWhen you choose Deploy, you should be prompted to the next screen to choose an endpoint name and instance type to initiate deployment.\n\nUpon defining your endpoint settings, you can proceed to the next step to use the model.\n\nDeploy Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model for inference using the Python SDK\n\nWhen you choose Deploy, model deployment will start. Alternatively, you can deploy through the example notebook by choosing Open Notebook. The notebook provides end-to-end guidance on how to deploy the model for inference and clean up resources.\n\nTo deploy using a notebook, you start by selecting an appropriate model, specified by the model_id . You can deploy any of the selected models on SageMaker AI.\n\nYou can deploy a Meta SAM 2.1 vision segmentation model using SageMaker JumpStart with the following SageMaker Python SDK code:\n\nfrom sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel model = JumpStartModel(model_id = \"meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tiny\") predictor = model.deploy()\n\nThis deploys the model on SageMaker AI with default configurations, including default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. After it\u2019s deployed, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. There are three tasks that are available with this endpoint: automatic mask generator, image predictor, and video predictor. We provide a code snippet for each later in this post. To use the predictor, a certain payload schema needs to be followed. The endpoint has sticky sessions enabled, so to start inference, you need to send a start_session payload:\n\ndef start_session(asset_type, asset_path): asset_base64 = None with open(image_path, 'rb') as f: asset_base64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('utf-8') response = predictor.invoke_endpoint( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"start_session\", \"input_type\": asset_type, \"path\": asset_base64 }), SessionId=\"NEW_SESSION\", ) session_id = response.headers.get(\"x-amzn-sagemaker-new-session-id\") return session_id\n\nThe start_session invocation needs an input media type of either image or video and the base64 encoded data of the media. This will launch a session with an instance of the model and load the media to be segmented.\n\nTo close a session, send a close_session invocation:\n\ndef close_session(session_id): response = predictor.invoke_endpoint( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"close_session\", \"session_id\": session_id }), SessionId=session_id, ) session_id = response.headers.get(\"x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id\") return session_id\n\nIf x-amzn-sagemaker-closed-session-id exists as a header, then the session has been successfully closed.\n\nTo continue a session and retrieve the session ID of the existing session, the response header will have the x-amzn-sagemaker-session-id key with the current session ID for any operation that is not start_session or close_session . Operations that aren\u2019t start_session or close_session need to be invoked with a response stream. This is due to the size of the resulting payload being larger than what SageMaker real-time endpoints can return.\n\nThis is a basic example of interacting with the SAM 2.1 SageMaker JumpStart endpoint with sticky sessions. The following examples for each of the tasks reference these operations without repeating them. The returned data is of mime type JSONL. For more complete examples, refer to the example notebooks for Meta SAM 2.1 on SageMaker Jumpstart.\n\nRecommended instances and benchmarks\n\nThe following table lists all the Meta SAM 2.1 models available in SageMaker JumpStart along with the model_id , default instance types, and maximum number of total tokens (sum of number of input tokens and number of generated tokens) supported for each of these models. For increased context length, you can modify the default instance type in the SageMaker JumpStart UI.\n\nModel Name Model ID Default Instance Type Supported Instance Types Meta SAM 2.1 Tiny meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-tiny ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Small meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-small ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Base Plus meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-base-plus ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge Meta SAM 2.1 Large meta-vs-sam-2-1-hiera-large ml.g6.24xlarge (5.5 MB total image or video size) ml.g5.24xlarge ml.g5.48xlarge ml.g6.24xlarge ml.g6.48xlarge ml.p4d.24xlarge ml.p4de.24xlarge\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 use cases: Inference and prompt examples\n\nAfter you deploy the model using SageMaker JumpStart, you should be able to see a reference Jupyter notebook that references the parser and helper functions needed to begin using Meta SAM 2.1. After you follow those cells in the notebook, you should be ready to begin using the model\u2019s vision segmentation capabilities.\n\nMeta SAM 2.1 offers support for three different tasks (automatic mask generator, image predictor, video predictor) to generate masks for various objects in images, including object tracking in videos. In the following examples, we demonstrate how to use the automatic mask generator and image predictor on a JPG of a truck. This truck.jpg file is stored in the jumpstart-cache-prod bucket; you can access it with the following code:\n\ns3_bucket = f\"jumpstart-cache-prod-{region}\" key_prefix = \"inference-notebook-assets\" def download_from_s3(key_filenames): for key_filename in key_filenames: s3.download_file(s3_bucket, f\"{key_prefix}/{key_filename}\", key_filename) truck_jpg = \"truck.jpg\" #Download images. download_from_s3(key_filenames=[truck_jpg]) display(Image(filename=truck_jpg))\n\nAfter you have your image and it is encoded, you can create masks for objects in the image. For use cases where you want to generate masks for every object in the image, you can use the automatic mask generator task.\n\nAutomatic mask generator\n\nThe automatic mask generator is great for AI researchers for computer vision tasks and applications such as medical imaging and diagnostics to automatically segment regions of interest like tumors or specific organs to provide more accurate diagnostic support. Additionally, the automatic mask generator can be particularly useful in the autonomous vehicle space, in which it can segment out elements in a camera like pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects. Let\u2019s use the automatic mask generator to generate masks for all the objects in truck.jpg .\n\nThe following code is the prompt to generate masks for your base64 encoded image:\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"image\", truck_jpg) # Generate and visualize masks with basic parameters response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"generate_automatic_masks\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"points_per_side\": 32, \"min_mask_region_area\": 100 }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nImage predictor\n\nAdditionally, you can choose which objects in the provided image you want to create a mask for by adding points within that object for Meta SAM 2.1 to create. A use case for the image predictor can be valuable for tasks related to design and modeling by automating processes that typically require manual efforts. For example, the image predictor can automate turning 2D images into 3D models by analyzing 2D images of blueprints, sketches, or floor plans and generating preliminary 3D models. This is one of many examples of how the image predictor can act as a bridge between 2D and 3D construction across many different tasks. We use the following image with the points that we used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for masking the object.\n\nThe following code is used to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 and plot the coordinates:\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"image\", truck_jpg) points = [ {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [500, 375], \"label\": 1}, {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1125, 625], \"label\": 1} ] # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"points\": [p[\"coordinates\"] for p in points], \"labels\": [p[\"label\"] for p in points], \"clear_old_points\": clear_old_point, }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"predict\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"multimask_output\": True, \"return_logits\": True }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nVideo predictor\n\nWe now demonstrate how to prompt Meta SAM 2.1 for object tracking on video. One use case would be for ergonomic data collection and training purposes. You can use the video predictor to analyze the movement and posture of humans in real time, serving as a way to reduce injury and improve performance by setting alarms for bad posture or movements. Let\u2019s start by accessing the basketball-layup.mp4 file [1] from the jumpstart-cache-prod S3 bucket defined in the following code:\n\nbasketball_mp4 = \"basketball-layup.mp4\" #Download video download_from_s3(key_filenames=[basketball_mp4]) display(Video(filename=basketball_mp4))\n\nVideo:\n\nThe following code shows how you can set up the prompt format to track objects in the video. The first object will use coordinates to track and not track, and the second object will track one coordinate.\n\n# Start session session_id = start_session(\"video\", basketball_mp4) # Object 1 prompts1 = [ {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1478, 649], \"label\": 1}, {\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1433, 689], \"label\": 0}, ] # Extract points and labels points = [] labels = [] for prompt in prompts1: if prompt[\"type\"] == \"point\": points.append(prompt[\"coordinates\"]) labels.append(prompt[\"label\"]) request = { \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"frame_index\": 0, \"object_id\": 1, \"points\": points, \"labels\": labels, \"clear_old_points\": True, } # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps(request), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() # Object 2 prompts2 = [{\"type\": \"point\", \"coordinates\": [1433, 689], \"label\": 1}] # Extract points and labels points = [] labels = [] for prompt in prompts2: if prompt[\"type\"] == \"point\": points.append(prompt[\"coordinates\"]) labels.append(prompt[\"label\"]) request = { \"type\": \"add_points\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"frame_index\": 0, \"object_id\": 2, \"points\": points, \"labels\": labels, \"clear_old_points\": True, } # Add multiple points response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps(request), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) # Intermediate Response masks = parser.get_responses() response = runtime_client.invoke_endpoint_with_response_stream( EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType='application/json', Body=json.dumps({ \"type\": \"propagate_in_video\", \"session_id\": session_id, \"start_frame_index\": 0, }), SessionId=session_id, Accept=\"application/jsonlines\" ) # Parse response stream parser = StreamParser() for event in response['Body']: parser.write(event) masks = parser.get_responses() # End session end_session(session_id)\n\nWe receive the following output (parsed and visualized).\n\nVideo:\n\nHere we can see that Meta SAM 2.1 Tiny was able to successfully track the objects based off the coordinates that were provided in prompt.\n\nClean up\n\nTo avoid incurring unnecessary costs, when you\u2019re done, delete the SageMaker AI endpoints using the following code:\n\npredictor.delete_model() predictor.delete_endpoint()\n\nAlternatively, to use the SageMaker AI console, complete the following steps:\n\nOn the SageMaker AI console, under Inference in the navigation pane, choose Search for the embedding and text generation endpoints. On the endpoint details page, choose Delete. Choose Delete again to confirm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including Meta\u2019s most advanced and capable models to date.

            "content": "Lawsuit Alleges Meta Disproportionately Steers Ads for For-Profit Colleges and Universities to Black Facebook and Instagram Users in Violation of the D.C. Human Rights Act\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 Today a nonprofit advocacy organization, represented by a team of civil rights and tech justice lawyers, filed a groundbreaking lawsuit against the tech giant Meta for engaging in modern-day digital redlining by providing separate and unequal services to Black users on its social media platforms Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Equal Rights Center (ERC), represented by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP, argues that Meta\u2019s advertising system disproportionately steers ads for for-profit colleges and universities to Black people while disproportionately steering ads for public nonprofit colleges and universities to white users. These practices, the suit argues, violate the District of Columbia\u2019s Human Rights Act and its Consumer Protection Procedures Act.\n\nMany for-profit colleges have a documented history of selling students the false promise of upward mobility but instead delivering sub-par education, leading to diminished earning potential and employment opportunities. Research shows that people who attend these schools\u2014especially Black students\u2014are often saddled with high debt and go on to make lower salaries than those who attend nonprofit colleges and universities. From 2017 until March 2019, nearly 24,000 federal fraud complaints were filed against for-profit colleges by students who claimed that the schools either lied about earning potential or employment statistics.\n\n\u201cSeparate and unequal services should be remnants of the past, but they are still a present-day reality for Black users on Meta\u2019s platforms,\u201d said Damon T. Hewitt, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cDigital redlining, especially in today\u2019s higher education market, sends the unmistakable signal that Black people belong in some institutions but not others. This lawsuit aims to make it clear that no corporation\u2014not even a Big Tech company as powerful as Meta\u2014should be allowed to profit from the discriminatory treatment of Black students and consumers. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe Equal Rights Center has a long history of standing up for the rights of people who have been discriminated against in the District, especially when it is hard for individual consumers to recognize that discrimination is happening,\u201d remarks Kate Scott, executive director of the Equal Rights Center. \u201cBy bringing this action today, we are able to extend our fight even further to online racial discrimination in public accommodations.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit cites an academic study published last year, in which researchers submitted pairs of ads with one for a for-profit school and the other for a public nonprofit school. The research found that Black Facebook and Instagram users were more likely to get ads for the for-profit colleges, while white Facebook and Instagram users were more likely to get the ads for the public nonprofit schools.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, by steering ads for for-profit schools disproportionately to Black users of its social media platforms, Meta reinforces historical barriers to economic stability and mobility for Black students. Meta should use its extensive resources to promote equity and opportunity on its social media platforms\u2013not replicate and reinforce systemic discrimination.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that Meta\u2019s marketplace reproduces historic racial discrimination and limits college opportunities for Black residents of the District of Columbia. All students\u2013\n\nregardless of race or zip code\u2013deserve an equal shot at exploring higher education opportunities that will allow them to thrive,\u201d said Joanne Lin, executive director of the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to stop Meta from using race to deny its Facebook and Instagram users equal access to educational information,\u201d said Sam Shapiro of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, LLP, one of the attorneys representing ERC.\n\nThe complaint states:\n\n\u201cMeta also published a report in January 2023 in which it acknowledged that external researchers had identified concerns that Meta\u2019s ad delivery system \u2018may nudge ads to certain groups of people even when the advertisers select extremely broad targeting options.\u2019 Meta\u2019s report discussed \u2018the potential impact of systemic inequity reflected in automated systems\u2019 and admitted that \u2018personalization systems\u2019 (like theirs) \u2018could lead to unfair outcomes.\u2019 For instance, \u2018if models in such systems over- or under-predict the likelihood people from a certain demographic group are interested in a particular type of ads, those models might thus under- or over-deliver those types of ads to different audiences based on those erroneous predictions.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis lawsuit marks a significant step in holding Big Tech companies like Meta accountable for their role in maintaining and exacerbating racial and economic inequities.\n\nFor the latest updates, visit: act.lawyerscommittee.org/ercvsmeta\n\n###\n\nAbout the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, formed in 1963 at the request of President John F.

The previous record rally for Meta was 11 straight days in September 2015. The 17 total days is also the best-ever streak among all Magnificent Seven stocks, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThe rally includes the market reaction to its fourth-quarter results published last Wednesday that beat expectations for earnings and sales. Before that, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would spend $60 billion to $65 billion on capital expenditures this year with a focus on AI infrastructure, well ahead of previous estimates. Investors appear to be forgiving of Meta's big AI spending, as the tech giant's advertising business remains strong.\n\nMeanwhile, Forbes reported Tuesday that Meta was in talks to buy South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI.\n\nMeta also on Monday began a round of layoffs for a reported 3,700 employees. Zuckerberg said in a staff memo last month that the company would cut 5% of its workforce.\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock added a fraction to close at 719.88.

It includes everything parents and educators need \u2013 from detailed guides for facilitators to fully scripted lesson plans, complete with interactive classroom activities and fun, engaging videos that help bring the principles of online safety to life for young people.\u201d\n\nMeta says that the program, which also includes quick links to support resources, will be made available for free to all teachers, and those who care for young people, including schools, parents, community or faith-based organizations and after-school programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now part of the Childhelp \u2018Speak Up Be Safe\u2019 program, which is already used to help students of all ages deal with a range of safety issues \u2013 from physical abuse or neglect to online bullying.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an important expansion of Meta\u2019s existing safety initiatives, providing additional health and safety guidance for youngsters, and addressing some key elements of concern in digital interaction.\n\nIt\u2019s also a valuable push from the associated organizations, utilizing Meta\u2019s reach to boost their messaging, and ensure more parents and kids are aware of the dangers online, and how to both detect and address such.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to safeguard everything, but providing access to more resources, in more places, should help to enhance overall digital literacy, and increase broader awareness of what to be aware of in digital interaction.\n\nAnd as we move into an era of virtual reality, and more immersive connection, that could become even more relevant, in providing guidance for youngsters who may be concerned, while also giving them more guidance to consider in such.\n\nYou can learn more about the new safety initiative here.",

Illustration: Guardian Design\n\nIn 2019, Facebook set a goal for itself: ensure half of its workforce was from diverse or underrepresented backgrounds by 2024.\n\nThe lofty ambition made the company stand out among its Silicon Valley peers. Maxine Williams, a longtime employee and chief diversity officer at the time, wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Facebook was up to the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep working toward these goals regardless of whether we\u2019re able to meet them within five years because progress in representation is critical to serve a global audience,\u201d wrote Williams.\n\nBy 2022, the company said it had doubled its number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US, and women accounted for more than a third of its workforce globally. There was still work to be done, though. Even after that increase, Black workers only made up 4.9% of the overall US workforce, and Hispanic workers made up 6.7%.\n\nBut, as of 10 January 2025, the vast majority of that work has been summarily abandoned. Just days after 2024 had come and gone, Meta (now Facebook\u2019s parent company) announced that instead of forging ahead with diversity goals, it would do away with corporate inclusion efforts entirely. The diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs would be shuttered. The company would end \u201crepresentation goals\u201d. Williams would be relegated to a new role focused on accessibility and engagement.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018DEI\u2019 has \u2026 become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others,\u201d wrote Janelle Gale, the company\u2019s vice-president of human resources, in an internal memo.\n\nThe diktat came directly from Meta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThose changes didn\u2019t come in a vacuum. Earlier this month, Zuckerberg announced Meta was ending its factchecking program in the US and easing content restrictions around immigration and gender identity to focus on \u201cfree expression\u201d. Meta\u2019s \u201chateful conduct\u201d policy was changed to allow users to accuse transgender or gay people of being \u201cmentally ill\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018A lot of the corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,\u2019 Mark Zuckerberg said recently on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, suggesting that modern businesses would benefit from more \u2018masculine energy\u2019. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nZuckerberg himself has also undergone a transformation from the sweaty, gray-hoodie-clad boy of Facebook\u2019s early years. He wears a gold chain and practices mixed martial arts, exuding what he calls \u201cmasculine energy\u201d, which he now preaches American companies need more of. He sat prominently alongside other tech billionaires at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The day after Zuckerberg ended Meta\u2019s DEI programs, Trump issued a similar executive order for the federal government.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the Zuckerberg who once banned Trump from Facebook, founded an organization to help immigrants and marched in a Pride parade. And a steep change for a company that was considered the gold standard for diversity and inclusion work in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFacebook used to be the place to be if you wanted to work on diversity,\u201d said a former recruiter on the DEI team, who asked not to be named for fear of professional reprisal. \u201cEveryone wanted to work with Maxine Williams. Everyone wanted to follow what Facebook was doing. We were the leaders in this.\u201d\n\nSeven former Facebook employees who worked on the company\u2019s DEI and trust and safety teams say the shift had been a long time in the making. As Zuckerberg\u2019s priorities have shifted with political winds, the company\u2019s emphasis on diversity and other policies have followed suit, they said.\n\nThe former employees said it was never clear how personally invested Zuckerberg was in making Meta a more inclusive workplace. Many of the initiatives lacked substance because they were often rolled out in response to external pressure or specific events, including the murder of George Floyd, according to the employees. These efforts rarely went beyond company-wide pronouncements and did little to change or improve the recruitment or retention of employees from under-represented backgrounds.\n\nSome initiatives did make a meaningful difference, such as the diverse slate program that ensured qualified women and people from under-represented backgrounds were considered for open roles. But former employees say executives slowly chipped away at those when they stopped being convenient.\n\nThe decline of diversity goals at Meta began in earnest with the departure of the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, many of the former employees said. She resigned as the company\u2019s second-in-command in 2022 and stepped down from the board in 2024; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO, replaced her.\n\nThe stark contrast between the two illustrates Meta\u2019s about-face. Sandberg authored Lean In, considered by many the playbook for feminism in the workplace, while White leads the Maga movement\u2019s ultra-masculine de facto sports league and was filmed slapping his wife at a party in 2022. Former employees say Sandberg\u2019s exit was a signal that DEI goals would be deprioritized, especially if left to Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder shares his ex-employees\u2019 opinion; he told the Trump adviser Stephen Miller that Meta\u2019s culture of inclusivity was the result of Sandberg\u2019s efforts, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe business case for diversity was only valid as long as Sandberg was around to enforce it,\u201d B\u00e4r\u00ed A Williams (no relation to Maxine), former senior counsel at Facebook, wrote in an op-ed earlier this month. \u201cNow that it\u2019s not politically in vogue, Zuckerberg is abandoning the business use case for diversity and fact-checking.\u201d\n\nMeta declined to comment. Sandberg didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nFacebook\u2019s diversity heyday\n\nFormer employees paint a picture of a former version of Facebook that, while still largely white and male, stood out among its tech industry peers for its innovative approach to diversify its ranks.\n\nHow much personal buy-in they had from company executives wasn\u2019t always clear, they say, but in the beginning, that didn\u2019t seem to matter because Facebook was pouring millions into their efforts. There was the diverse slate program in hiring and a leadership mentor program for underrepresented employees. Facebook also started allowing for more remote roles, which led to an increase in staff from different backgrounds.\n\nWhile Sandberg and Williams led the charge on DEI efforts, Zuckerberg would often follow, former employees say. Mike Rognlien worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017, ultimately landing a job as a head of learning and development. He helped write the company\u2019s DEI training program. He recalled an incident in 2013 when employees were upset that Zuckerberg had fundraised for the re-election campaign of the Republican New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, because Christie had been vocal about not supporting marriage equality. Rognlien said he asked Zuckerberg about the donation during an all-staff Q&A.\n\n\u201cIs that consistent with our company values? Is that consistent with your values?\u201d Rognlien asked. Zuckerberg responded saying he understood the frustration but that he donated to Christie because of an ongoing program the governor had begun with New Jersey schools. Zuckerberg said he also donated to Cory Booker, the Democratic mayor of Newark at the time.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything that you think I should do to kind of neutralize any negative feelings about that, I\u2019m all ears,\u201d Rognlien recalled Zuckerberg saying.\n\nRognlien got together with leaders of employee resource groups about the incident, and they decided to ask Zuckerberg to march with them in San Francisco\u2019s Pride parade. The CEO agreed immediately.\n\nDecked out in a purple T-shirt with a \u201cI [heart with rainbow flag] Facebook\u201d sticker, Zuckerberg joined more than 700 employees for the parade. Company videos show him riding in the float with other executives, dancing and waving his hands in the air. That day, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that he stood with the millions of people marching in Pride parades worldwide.\n\nIn 2013, Mark Zuckerberg (middle) attended San Francisco\u2019s Pride parade. Pictured here with Meta executives Chris Cox (left) and Adam Mosseri (right). \u2018I\u2019m committed to make Facebook a safe place for members of the LGBT community everywhere,\u2019 Zuckerberg said at the time. Photograph: Mike Rognlien\n\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to make Facebook a safe place for members of the LGBT community everywhere,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cBecause as far as we have come in the fight for equality, we have a lot more work to do.\u201d\n\nEleven years later, Zuckerberg, pushing for \u201cmasculine energy\u201d, would allow Facebook and Instagram users to call any non-standard sexual orientation a mental illness, deride a transgender person with the pronoun \u201cit\u201d, and assert that there had only ever been two genders \u2013 that transgender people had never existed at all.\n\nWith Sandberg, Facebook becomes a DEI leader\n\nAround the time of Zuckerberg\u2019s purple Pride ride-along, Sandberg ramped up development of Facebook\u2019s DEI training program. The idea was to create a mandatory employee training that didn\u2019t just check an HR box, Rognlien said, but rather generate genuine reflection and introspection. Gale, who would later write the internal memo dismantling DEI at Meta, was also instrumental in the inception of this program, according to Rognlien.\n\n\u201cIf you can rewind your brain back to 2014, unconscious bias was not in the zeitgeist,\u201d Rognlien said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s what the first iteration of the program really focused on. How do we educate people? \u2026 And when I say educate people, I mean primarily white male software engineers.\u201d\n\nRognlien said Facebook employees seemed to be taking the lessons of anti-bias workshops to heart. He cited an enthusiastic example of their success: a group of male engineers who had taken the training printed posters of Kanye West\u2019s face and hung them in the company\u2019s conference rooms. Captioned with \u201cImma let you finish\u201d in reference to West cutting off Taylor Swift at the Video Music Awards five years earlier, the oversized heads served as reminders not to interrupt women in meetings.\n\nRognlien and Sandberg also conducted the training with Zuckerberg and his leadership team of about 15 people in the fall of 2014. Sandberg often said \u201cmeritocracy is a myth\u201d, according to Rognlien, and during the training she instructed the leaders to think about their biases. Rognlien said the room was receptive.\n\n\u201cThe whole push for this type of education was 1,000% Sheryl,\u201d Rognlien said. \u201cSheryl wanted to do this and was really flying the flag internally.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Facebook\u2019s COO was also working on creating a more diverse staff, Rognlien said. It became integral to Facebook\u2019s mission of \u201cbringing the world closer together\u201d.\n\n\u201cSheryl\u2019s belief was, if we don\u2019t build a company that looks like the population of the world that we\u2019re trying to connect, we\u2019re not going to succeed,\u201d Rognlien said.\n\nIn 2014, Facebook released its first-ever diversity report. In a blogpost, Williams said diversity was \u201cessential to achieving our mission\u201d. The goal was to have a broad range of people from different geographical, age, gender, sexual orientation and cultural backgrounds. While the report showed the vast majority of Facebook employees were white males, Williams said the company was \u201cabsolutely committed to achieving greater diversity\u201d.\n\nThe unraveling\n\nFour years later, the number of women employed by the company had risen by 5%. Asian representation had risen by more than 7%, but the number of Black and Hispanic employees at Facebook had crept up by just one percentage point.\n\nProgress in leadership ranks was also incremental. Diversifying the workforce was challenging because it wasn\u2019t a priority from day one, Williams wrote at the time. \u201cThe later you start taking deliberate action to increase diversity, the harder it becomes,\u201d she said.\n\nBy the end of 2018, an employee memo, first circulated internally, illustrated just how much more work Facebook had to do. In it, Mark Luckie, then a strategic partner manager for global influencers at the company, detailed the racial discrimination he said he and other Black employees faced. The teams that worked on diversity were not given adequate resources, and they felt their efforts served more for public relations than for genuine change, he said.\n\n\u201cFor some, their work devolves into serving as an address book to add a few names of color to projects,\u201d Luckie wrote. \u201cEfforts that promote inclusion, not just diversity, are being halted at the managerial level.\u201d\n\nWhen Luckie didn\u2019t hear back from the executive team, he made the memo public. \u201cFacebook does not make any meaningful change on a company level unless it is being held accountable publicly,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA year later, the company announced its new \u201c50 in 5\u201d diversity goal: in five years, the company aimed to have at least 50% of its workforce be composed of women; people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islanders; people with two or more ethnicities; people with disabilities; and veterans.\n\nThese efforts gained momentum in 2020 amid the US\u2019s wider corporate reckoning. Williams\u2019s role was elevated to report directly to Sandberg; the company announced a goal to increase diverse representation among senior leaders to 30% by 2025; and it committed to spending $1bn with diverse suppliers.\n\nBut the fervor and urgency around these efforts dissipated within a matter of months, said employees who were at the company around that time.\n\nTwo former employees who worked on recruiting and diversity said company executives became increasingly skittish about how they talked about DEI internally. Already in September 2020, Zuckerberg announced new limitations to employee political speech in internal chats and designated specific channels for those discussions. The announcement came after employee debates over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, became so heated that Zuckerberg himself stepped in to end it.\n\nFacebook also created exceptions to its own diversity goals over the course of 2020. Engineering leaders pushed back against the diverse slate approach because they wanted to hire quickly, two former employees who worked on recruiting and DEI said. Before the exceptions were made, hiring managers needed to ensure there was at least one qualified woman and one person from an under-represented background considered for 90% of open roles \u2013 a requirement former DEI employees say already didn\u2019t go far enough. But in response to pushback, the company pared down the requirement for tech roles: now engineering managers only needed to ensure that there was one woman or one person from an under-represented background considered for just 75% of the roles they were hiring.\n\nDEI leaders were also asked to trim the quarterly diversity reports that were once prioritized. The leadership mentor program for underrepresented staff was paused, restructured and eventually scaled down.\n\nMuch of the shift solidified in 2022 when Facebook changed its name to Meta and Sandberg left the company, these employees say. Budgets got slashed, including for teams handling diversity, and Zuckerberg dubbed it the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d. This marked the last year the company published a diversity report. By the end of 2023, more than 11,000 employees had been laid off, including many remote workers and DEI staff. At least one DEI leader was told their budget would be cut in half and to make adjustments to their contracts and team accordingly.\n\nNow, as of last month, the DEI team is gone entirely, with traces of its existence disappearing from the internet. Links to many of the company\u2019s public diversity reports are no longer accessible on the internet, leading to empty webpages with the message \u201cThis content isn\u2019t available right now.\u201d The DEI training video that Rognlien made with Williams has likewise vanished.\n\nEmployees told the Guardian they wondered what would happen in 2029 when a new presidential administration takes office.\n\nFor Rognlien, it\u2019s disappointing, he said, because work on DEI is still far from being done. \u201cFacebook\u2019s market cap is what, one and a half trillion dollars?\u201d he said. \u201cThey have the money and the resources to actually make a significant dent in the universe, and instead, Mark is wearing chains and going to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201d",

The company claims these layoffs are performance-based, targeting underperformers who didn't meet expectations. However, some former employees are disputing this, saying they had a solid track record of performance and were blindsided by the layoffs. One such employee is Elana Reman Safner, a product counsel for MetaWorks, who was laid off after returning from a six-month maternity leave.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Ms Safner shared her shock and disappointment, suggesting that Meta may have targeted employees who had recently taken leaves.\n\n\"Meta laid me off yesterday in its \"performance-based\" layoffs, and I was blindsided. I have never received a review below \"Meets All\" in my 3+ years at Meta, and I was on maternity leave for 6 months until November. It is very hard to believe that \u2013 despite Meta indicating my expectations are prorated \u2013 I did not do enough. Many laid off today have similar stories \u2013 a history of good performance, and a recent leave of absence,\" she wrote.\n\nHere's the post:\n\nMs Safner further reminisced about her time at Meta, expressing gratitude towards her team. \"At Meta, I learned to be nimble and resilient, provide business-focused, risk-calibrated advice, and how to be a great XFN partner. Even when I disagreed with product direction or was disappointed by Meta in the news, my clients and colleagues kept me energized,\" she added.\n\nHowever, she also highlighted several aspects of the company she wouldn't miss, including the uncertainty of her career trajectory and the high-stress nature of her role. Ms Safner also took a swipe at Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership style, criticising his tendency to abruptly shut down products that didn't meet his \"moonshot\" expectations.\n\nShe wrote, \"Here's what I won't miss: my career trajectory being completely at the whim of product decisions I have no control over, mental overload, 34-page one-pagers, having 62 tabs open, deprecating beloved products because they weren't \u201cmoonshot\u201d enough for Zuck, Zuck's newfound \u201cmasculine energy\u201d and becoming its collateral damage.\"\n\nThe layoffs come as Meta shifts its focus towards artificial intelligence and other strategic priorities.",

            "content": "Amid rising competition in AI development, Meta\u2019s re-aligning its workforce to maximize its AI efforts, by cutting around 4,000 jobs, while hiring more AI engineers.\n\nAs reported by Business Insider, Meta\u2019s looking to cull around 5% of its global workforce as it looks to re-shape its business around AI development.\n\nAs per BI:\n\n\u201cIn an internal memo announcing the cuts, the Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg said he \"decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.\" Zuckerberg also said Meta would backfill these roles this year. The company now appears focused on hiring engineers in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nThe main hiring emphasis moving forward will be machine-learning engineers, with Meta now rushing to gather up experts in the field to amplify its AI development progress.\n\nMeta\u2019s urgency on this front has seemingly been exacerbated by the launch of DeepSeek, a faster, and arguably better AI model which was reportedly developed for a lot less than some of the more high-profile AI projects.\n\nAnd while the actual details of the project are not entirely clear, its sudden rise has underlined the need for American companies to keep pace with global AI development, in case competitors are able to innovate faster, and dominate the market.\n\nMeta\u2019s keen to win the AI war, and has invested heavily in its own AI initiatives. Late last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta will spend around $65 billion on AI initiatives in 2025 alone, with the company looking to activate up to 1.3 NVidia H100 GPUs in its AI data centers. Meta also recently switched on its \u201cMesa\u201d data center in Arizona, while it\u2019s also working on another new 2GW datacenter to expand its capacity.\n\nZuckerberg says that he expects this to be \u201ca defining year for AI development,\u201d which will likely see Meta push ahead with a raft of new AI options in its apps. Which is why it\u2019s restructuring its staffing make-up, and it\u2019s interesting to see just how much emphasis Meta is putting on AI, and the expansion of its AI push.\n\nBecause just a couple of years ago, it was all about the metaverse, and building for the VR future. AI has long been a part of Meta\u2019s broader plan, but it didn\u2019t seem to be a major focus for the company till OpenAI upped the ante by launching ChatGPT to broad praise.\n\nSince then, Zuckerberg has seemingly become obsessed with owning the AI space, and the opportunities that it could bring. Though there is also a question as to what exactly those opportunities will be, and whether AI will actually be the transformative tool that some expect.\n\nOf course, the next level of AI, in artificial general intelligence (AGI), or thinking machines, will be a major shift, and could revolutionize the world as we know it. But we\u2019re nowhere close to that yet, despite claims to the contrary from OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman. AGI is well beyond the capacity of the smart machine learning systems we have now, and there\u2019s no true indicator that we\u2019ll ever be able to develop machines that can \u201cthink\u201d like a human.\n\nChatbots that can convincingly answer questions is one thing, but systems that can come up with creative solutions on their own is something else, and it\u2019s going to be some time before we reach that next plane.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s hard to know what can be truly achieved with the current AI systems, though Meta itself is keen to start replacing engineers with AI agents. Maybe that will be of more value to Meta, in providing more and more advanced models that can be structured for specific purpose, which will then create a whole new line of business opportunity for the company.\n\nAnd certainly, there will be opportunity there, but it\u2019s hard to know, at this stage, what the limits of our current AI models might be, and what level of investment they should get.\n\nBut Zuck and Co. are clearly all-in, and see big potential for AI projects. Which will extend far beyond image generation in its apps, and could provide expand Meta\u2019s capacity to power the future.\n\nMeta\u2019s reportedly informing staff impacted by its layoffs early this week.",

If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s an interesting time to enter the CDP market. Since late 2024, a wave of consolidation swept over independent CDP vendors, with Rokt buying mParticle, Contentstack acquiring Lytics and Uniphore picking up ActionIQ.\n\nOf course, Meta didn\u2019t wake up last week and decide building a CDP is a good idea. According to Wayne Tow, a product manager at Meta who wrote about the Signals Gateway launch on LinkedIn, the product took more than two years to develop.\n\nWhat is Signals Gateway?\n\nMeta doesn\u2019t explicitly call Signals Gateway a CDP. It says:\n\nSignals Gateway is a product within your own cloud instance that collects, processes and transmits advertisers\u2019 first-party data to their desired destinations. It offers built-in features and tools for collecting, processing, and transmitting signals from one or more data sources to various data destinations with no pre-defined data purpose.\n\nHere\u2019s what else we know:\n\nMeta says Signals Gateway will help businesses maximize the value of their first-party data while maintaining control and privacy.\n\nSignals Gateway streamlines data connection from any source to any destination, within or outside of Meta.\n\nMeta claims Signals Gateway will help marketers improve performance and save time and resources.\n\nMeta says organizations can run Signals Gateway on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Meta can\u2019t access the data from those platforms. And that\u2019s entirely possible, but they\u2019re also asking marketing teams and the consumers whose data is on those platforms to trust Meta, which might be a big ask for some given past incidents of data sharing involving Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nMarTech and adtech observers are already digging into Signals Gateway to see what it can do. One obvious comparison you can expect to see is how Signals Gateway stacks up to Google Tag Manager (GTM).\n\nDig deeper: 5 principles for a smoother, more successful CDP deployment",

            "content": "Meta (META) stock rose on Monday, leaving intact a record-breaking winning streak for the social media giant.\n\nWith Monday's session, Meta shares have risen for 16 consecutive full sessions, the longest streak of any of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Put another way, Meta stock hasn\u2019t had a down day since Joe Biden was president.\n\nMeta stock has proven resilient to a slew of developments that have shaken other tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares rose nearly 2% the day Chinese start-up DeepSeek sparked a major AI stock sell-off; AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) lost more than $600 billion of market value that day.\n\nMeta employees on Monday were preparing for the beginning of a round of performance-based layoffs that CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced last month. Executives have said they\u2019re aiming to let go of about 5% of the company\u2019s more than 74,000 employees.\n\nMeta dodged the DeepSeek rout in part because the social media company, which generates nearly all of its revenue from advertising, is seen by investors as more of a consumer of AI than a provider of it. It may also have helped that the DeepSeek model that shocked Wall Street was, like Meta\u2019s Llama, open-source.\n\nShares rose 1% the day after Meta topped fourth-quarter earnings estimates, making it the only Magnificent Seven company to see its shares rise after reporting results. (Nvidia is the only Mag Seven company left to report.) On the company's earnings call with analysts, executives emphasized that both users and advertisers are increasingly turning to its AI products: Meta's AI-powered Advantage+ shopping service grew 70% in the quarter and reached a $20 billion annual revenue run rate, according to CFO Susan Li.\n\nEven the company\u2019s plan to increase its AI spending by about 50% this year\u2014the kind of aggressive spending that has spooked investors in tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG)\u2014hasn\u2019t dented Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm for the stock.\n\nUpdate\u2014February 10, 2025: This story has been updated to reflect Meta stock's performance on Monday.",

Bitte aktiviere JavaScript in deinem Browser und lade die Seite neu.\n\nVR tactical shooters offer intense action and realistic battles. We have tested the best current titles and reveal which ones are particularly worthwhile.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nTactical shooters in VR give you a particularly immersive gaming experience. Instead of using a mouse and keyboard, you use your natural movements to aim, take cover or switch magazines. The physical component is a large part of the fascination - for example, when precise reloading under fire becomes a real challenge.\n\nMeta Quest 3 in particular has received some exciting titles in this genre in recent months. From classic team battles to battle royales and tactical extraction shooters, there is something to suit every taste. The following titles will show you what modern tactical shooters feel like in virtual reality and what special features they offer.\n\n1. Ghosts of Tabor\n\nGhosts of Tabor is a realistic VR extraction shooter that is strongly inspired by Escape from Tarkov. In your bunker as a base, you equip yourself, craft items and trade with others. The complex economic system and the permanent loss of your equipment when you die make for intense game moments and tactical decisions.\n\nThe combination of PvP and PvE elements creates a unique atmosphere in which every encounter can potentially end fatally. The game impresses with successful controls, excellent sound design and realistic weapon mechanics. The slower pace of the game in particular allows you to make well-thought-out tactical decisions.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\n2. Contractors Showdown\n\nThe battle royale concept finds its way into virtual reality in Contractors Showdown. With a mixture of PUBG and Call of Duty Warzone 2, you can expect an impressive technical implementation. At the start of each round, you parachute down and quickly find your equipment thanks to the sophisticated looting system.\n\nThe realistic weapon physics and intuitive handling of the various items of equipment allow you to engage in authentic firefights. Special functions such as air strikes further expand your tactical arsenal. Even if some actions such as changing magazines can be challenging in hectic combat, you will be rewarded with high replay value.\n\nWith its new ExfilZone mode, Contractors also offers an extraction mode that comes close to Escape from Tarkov and Ghosts of Tabor. So it's well worth making a purchase here.\n\n3. Breachers\n\nThe gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege has been skillfully transferred to VR in Breachers. Tactical 5v5 battles let you compete as an attacker (Enforcers) or defender (Revolters). As the attacker, you try to defuse bombs, while as the defender you protect your position with barricades and other tools.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nUse the grappling hook to climb buildings and use the sophisticated barricade system to your advantage. The developers provide you with regular content updates and new content. The audiovisual presentation on the Quest 3 is impressive across the board.\n\nPlease leave this field empty\n\nXR Briefing\n\nGet the most important XR news delivered to your email inbox once a week.

Familiar modes such as Search and Destroy and a sophisticated weapon system with realistic reloading mechanics await you here. The detailed graphics on the Quest 3 allow you to get your bearings on all maps.\n\nThe lack of a matchmaking system puts a slight damper on the game - you have to find servers manually. The sometimes unfriendly community can make it difficult to get started. Once you have overcome these hurdles, you can expect a technically solid tactical shooter with a high replay value.\n\n5. Zero Caliber 2\n\nArcade gameplay with a military twist awaits you in Zero Caliber 2, with a large selection of weapons and extensive modification options to experiment with. You can experience the single-player campaign in co-op mode with up to three friends or compete with others in PvP.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nTechnical weaknesses such as a sometimes weak AI and repetitive locations tarnish the overall impression somewhat. Nevertheless, the solid production and action-packed gameplay make Zero Caliber 2 an entertaining option for fans of military shooters.\n\n6. Anomaly\n\nThe developer of Swarm and Swarm 2, Greensky Games, has released its new VR extraction shooter Anomaly in Early Access for Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S. You are immersed in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2050, where you search for valuable artifacts in a devastated city and have to hold your own against other players and monsters.\n\nIn each match, you have to find and activate three keys on the map. This will cause a safe containing a valuable artifact to appear on all player cards. Whoever manages to extract the artifact secures the highest reward in the game.\n\nDo you like tactic-shooters in VR?

            "content": "I\u2019ve yet to meet a pair of KEF speakers I didn\u2019t like. The brand\u2019s penchant for providing rigid and musical bass, a warm and smooth midrange, and effortless treble extension keeps wireless models like the LS50 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and LSX (9/10, WIRED Recommends), and the wired R3 Meta (9/10, WIRED Recommends) among my favorites on the market. These trusty sonic hallmarks are present once more in the new Q Concerto Meta.\n\nAlong with great sound, KEF\u2019s Q Series aims to give you more for your money, which in the Concerto\u2019s case equates to a bounty of drivers. You don\u2019t often see three-way bookshelf speakers at this price, but the Concerto deliver the goods in an efficient configuration. You\u2019ll get a hefty woofer, a midrange driver above, and at its center, KEF\u2019s signature concentric tweeter that has trickled down from some of the brand\u2019s best, including the highfalutin R3.\n\nThe Concerto immediately evoke the R3, from their design aesthetic to support for KEF\u2019s \u201cMeta\u201d absorption tech, aimed at eliminating unwanted cabinet frequencies. The similarities end there; the Concerto\u2019s sound (understandably) can\u2019t approach the R3\u2019s lofty heights, while their vinyl-wrapped facade feels more budget than KEF fans might expect. Still, this is a great package for the money, offering competitive sound with a focus on exemplary tonal balance and potent bass.\n\nLoaded for Bare\n\nI was positively giddy to be unboxing a sparkling new pair of KEF\u2019s latest bookshelves, but my excitement was tempered when I got the Concerto loose from their foam homes. The vinyl cabinets (available in black, white, and walnut) look clean and relatively sharp, but most speakers I\u2019ve tested in their class and even a step below do better. Compared to the posh piano gloss of SVS\u2019 Ultra Evolution (9/10, WIRED Recommends), or the Focal Vestia No1\u2019s funky leather and woodgrain panels, the Concerto have a more bargain basement vibe. Attaching the plain-Jane magnetic grilles further pushes them toward boxy obscurity.\n\nPhotograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nIn fairness, I think these are purposeful corner cuts to invest more on hardware, and the Concerto certainly have it where it counts. Their three-pack of drivers per side includes a 6.5-inch hybrid aluminum cone woofer, a 4-inch aluminum cone midrange driver, and a .75-inch concentric waveguided tweeter bearing KEF\u2019s 12th-gen Uni-Q design (putting the \u201cQ\u201d in Q Series).\n\nThe drivers cross over at 450 Hz in the bass and 2.9 kHz in the treble, with a claimed frequency response of 48 Hz to 20 kHz (more on that later). Behind the drivers is KEF\u2019s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT), which claims to eliminate \u201c99% of unwanted frequencies.\u201d It\u2019s cool to see the tech that has spread across the brand\u2019s top hi-fi speakers in approachable models. MA aside, most unwanted frequencies will likely come from your listening room, so you\u2019ll still want to consider tips from our Audiophile Gear Guide like acoustic panels, which are both effective and relatively affordable.\n\nThe Concerto are rather large for bookshelf speakers, standing 16.3 inches tall, 8.3 inches wide, and 12.4 inches deep, and weighing over 20 pounds each. You\u2019ll want to secure a solid pair of stands suited for their sizable footprint. (KEF will happily sell you a $700 pair designed for the R3.)",

            "content": "THE AD : Following the Super Bowl ad trope, Meta\u2019s two flashy spots lean into celeb power\u2014two Avengers, a Kardashian\u2026 and a $6 million banana. In the first ad, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt perambulate through Kris Jenner\u2019s art collection asking Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses questions like, \u201cHey Meta, what\u2019s this?\u201d while gazing at Maurizio Cattelan\u2019s conceptual artwork Comedian. The smart glasses respond with details about the art piece and follow further commands, like \u201cHey Meta, play my gallery music.\u201d\n\nThe ad takes a chaotic and mildly funny turn when Hemsworth, mistaking the $6 million banana for food, eats it. Pratt exclaims, and I echo a similar question, \u201cDo you eat things stuck to walls?\u201d The duo scrambles to replace the banana by raiding Jenner\u2019s fridge, only to be caught red-handed. The ad ends with Jenner pressing them for answers, and the Hollywood stars emphasizing the importance of leading with \u201cHey Meta\u201d to get things done.\n\nSimilarly, in the second ad, the Marvel heroes ask the smart glasses to snap photos and record videos with a sculpture. However, the glasses become unwitting witnesses to the chaos when Hemsworth and Pratt accidentally break the artwork.\n\nMY HOT TAKE: Beyond the chuckles, Meta\u2019s ad isn\u2019t just about showing off its AI-powered smart glasses\u2014it\u2019s about normalizing an always-listening, always-recording future. The \u2018Hey Meta\u2019 command is strikingly familiar, echoing Apple\u2019s \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and Amazon\u2019s \u2018Hey Alexa.\u2019 But unlike a phone or smart speaker, these glasses don\u2019t sit on a desk\u2014they go everywhere, quietly capturing whatever the wearer sees and hears.\n\nSure, Meta pitches this as hands-free convenience. But here\u2019s the real question: when does convenience become covert surveillance? And how long before people realize these glasses aren\u2019t just a party trick but a privacy nightmare waiting to happen?\n\nIf the ad is any clue, Meta isn\u2019t just selling a product\u2014it\u2019s selling a world where being recorded without knowing it is just part of the game. A Meta spokesperson notes that glasses feature a Capture LED light that lets people know when the camera is in use, if the LED is covered, users are notified to clear it before they can capture.\n\nWith privacy concerns already swirling around AI and surveillance, Meta\u2019s pitch for hands-free convenience could just as easily be a recipe for discomfort.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold play\u2014but only time will tell if it\u2019s more than just a gimmick.\n\nWatch the two Super Bowl ads from Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban Meta, \u201cThe Artist\u201d and its extended version, below.\n\nThis has been updated to include Meta\u2019s comments.",

            "content": "Facebook parent-company Meta is currently fighting a class action lawsuit alleging copyright infringement and unfair competition, among others, with regards to how it trained LLaMA. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by vx-underground, court records reveal that the social media company used pirated torrents to download 81.7TB of data from shadow libraries including Anna\u2019s Archive, Z-Library, and LibGen. It then used this information to train its AI models.\n\nThe evidence, in the form of written communication, shows the researchers\u2019 concerns about Meta\u2019s use of pirated materials. One senior AI researcher said way back in October 2022, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should use pirated material. I really need to draw a line here.\u201d While another one said, \u201cUsing pirated material should be beyond our ethical threshold,\u201d then they added, \u201cSciHub, ResearchGate, LibGen are basically like PirateBay or something like that, they are distributing content that is protected by copyright and they\u2019re infringing it.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\n\"Torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn\u2019t feel right\" - Meta employee\n\nThen, in January 2023, Mark Zuckerberg himself attended a meeting where he said, \u201cWe need to move this stuff forward... we need to find a way to unblock all this.\u201d Some three months later, a Meta employee sent a message to another one saying they were concerned about Meta IP addresses being used \u201cto load through pirate content.\u201d They also added, \u201ctorrenting from a corporate laptop doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d followed by laughing out loud emoji.\n\nAside from those messages, documents also revealed that the company took steps so that its infrastructure wasn\u2019t used in these downloading and seeding operations so that the activity wouldn\u2019t be traced back to Meta. The court documents say that this constitutes evidence of Meta\u2019s unlawful activity, which seems like it\u2019s taking deliberate steps to circumvent copyright laws.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time an AI training model has been accused of stealing information off the internet. OpenAI has been sued by novelists as far back as June 2023 for using their books to train its large language models, with The New York Times following suit in December. Nvidia has also been on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by writers for using 196,640 books to train its NeMo model, which has since been taken down. A former Nvidia employee blew the whistle on the company in August of last year, saying that it scraped more than 426 thousand hours of videos daily for use in AI training. More recently, OpenAI is investigating if DeepSeek illegally obtained data from ChatGPT, which just shows how ironic things can get.\n\nThe case against Meta is still ongoing, so we will have to wait until the court releases its decision to say if the company committed direct infringement. And even if the writers win this case, Meta, with its huge financial war chest, will likely appeal the decision, meaning we will have to wait for several months, if not years, to see the final court judgment.",

Ray-Ban and Meta released separate spots that will not air during the game.\n\nOne features actors Pratt and Hemsworth in a gallery staring at a gold dinosaur and a hammer. Hemsworth says, \"What I am confused about, right, is: dinosaur, hammer. What do those two objects have to do with anything?\" This is a reference to Pratt's role in Jurrasic World and Hemsworth's role as Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nPratt and Hemsworth appear in another 15-second clip and a 30-second ad promoting the glasses, but only one will appear during the big game.\n\nBelow is their Ray-Ban and Meta Super Bowl ad.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is in the Meta Super Bowl commercial?\n\nThe ad features two Chrises and one Kris.\n\nChris Pratt\n\nThe ad begins with Pratt staring at a banana taped to a wall. This is a real piece of art called \"Comedian\" created by Maurizio Cattelan. It was sold at a New York auction for $6.2 million, as Meta tells Pratt. He has the reaction most people would when finding out the ludicrous value of this artwork.\n\nChris Hemsworth\n\nHemsworth joins Pratt at the next display, casually eating a banana. When Pratt looks at him, he notices it is the same fruit from the artwork and says, \"That's a $6.2 million banana.\" Hemsworth shares his reaction, \"Are you kidding?\"\n\nThe pair then go on the hunt for another banana to replace it, scouring through a fridge.\n\nKris Jenner\n\nThat is when Jenner shows up. \"Gentlemen, who eats art?\" Hemsworth replies that she is supposed to preface her question with \"Hey, Meta...\" The Kardashian matriarch quickly shows she knows how the device works replying, \"Hey Meta, call my lawyer.\"\n\nHow much do Meta Ray-Ban glasses cost?\n\nThe Meta Ray-Ban glasses allow users to talk to Meta, an artificial intelligence, and utilize a voice-activated camera while styling in a classic Ray-Ban look. The cheapest pairs cost $299. The Wayfarer, Headliner and Skyler with standard lenses are the cheapest options while some glasses with polarized or \"Transitions\" lenses cost up to $379.\n\nComparatively, some of Ray-Ban's standard sunglasses, without AI capabilities, cost between $150 and $230.\n\nKris Jenner net worth\n\nJenner's net worth is listed as $170 million on Yahoo and other sites and $230 million on Forbes. She has made most of her money from being the manager who runs much of the business side for the Kardashian-Jenner empire. She takes a 10% cut of every dollar her kids bring in from modeling, licensing deals and beauty companies. She was also the mastermind behind the reality TV show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\".\n\nJenner has also penned a cookbook and an autobiography and even hosted a talk show that was canceled after one season.\n\nChris Hemsworth net worth\n\nHemsworth has a net worth of $130 million. The actor is best known for his role as Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nHe has played \"The God of Thunder\" since 2011, appearing in eight movies, commanding up to $15 million for each film. Hemsworth has also starred in films such as Cabin in the Woods, Snow White and the Huntsman and Extraction. He also has seven-figure endorsement deals with Hugo Boss and Tag Huer.\n\nChris Pratt net worth\n\nPratt has a net worth of $100 million. He initially gained fame for his role as Andy Dwyer in the sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\". He then truly burst onto the scene as Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" franchise, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has appeared in six Marvel movies.\n\nHe also starred in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise reboot \"Jurassic World\", which stretched three movies.

            "content": "Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) has been one of the hottest growth stocks to own in recent years. Since the beginning of 2023, it has skyrocketed by around 490%, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $59,000. The social media stock has gone from being the stock seemingly no one wanted to own in 2022 to now becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of close to $1.8 trillion.\n\nThe business has been doing well, and bullishness remains high for the stock. Can Meta Platforms turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million or more?\n\nWhy Meta can continue soaring\n\nMeta has been experiencing some tremendous growth in recent years. Its highly popular social media apps, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, attract billions of users. For marketers, that can make it incredibly enticing to advertise on those apps, as it's easier to reach a specific target audience when potential customers are concentrated on a single platform.\n\nThe demand is evident, with Meta continuing to grow at a high rate. The company recently posted its year-end results for 2024, and revenue totaled $164.5 billion for the entire year, which is an increase of 22% from the previous year. What's even more impressive is that the business grew its profits at an even faster rate of 59%, as net income totaled $62.4 billion.\n\nThose are fantastic numbers for Meta. The company has amassed an impressive collection of social media assets into its organization, which ensures that it will do well as ad spending remains strong. And even though it has generated some mammoth gains in the past couple of years, it's still not a terribly expensive stock, trading at almost 30 times its trailing earnings.\n\nWhy Meta might struggle\n\nMeta has performed exceptionally well, but it's not entirely a result of its own doing. It has benefited from factors outside of its control.\n\nWhile the economy has been strong, many advertisers left X (previously known as Twitter) when Tesla CEO Elon Musk took over and put into place policies that loosened restrictions around the social media app. The U.S. government has also attempted to ban Meta's biggest rival, TikTok. And with uncertainty still weighing over how that may play out, advertisers may be inclined to take the safer route and advertising on one of Meta's apps.\n\nIf TikTok disappears from the U.S. market, a brand presence that a business may have been building up on that platform would effectively become limited in value. Advertising on one of Meta's apps doesn't involve taking on that risk.\n\nThis is why, although Meta has been doing well, I'm not convinced it can do well amid some real competition. In the future, there will inevitably be more options for advertisers to turn to.\n\nMeta's best assets are also arguably the ones it acquired -- WhatsApp and Instagram. The company has relied on growing its business by copying popular features from other apps and making acquisitions. Innovation hasn't been its strength, which is why I believe the social media company may struggle in the years ahead.\n\nMeta doesn't look like a 10x investment, let alone 100x\n\nFor Meta's stock to turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million, it would need to grow to 100 times its original value. That means its market cap would one day need to top $180 trillion. Given its elevated valuation, I don't see that as being a likely scenario. Even getting to 10 times its value, to more than $18 trillion, might be a long shot.\n\nMeta has been a good buy in recent years, but investors may want to temper their expectations moving forward. The company has benefited from the looming TikTok ban and X's controversial policies. However, as it inevitably faces greater competition in the future, I think the business won't be nearly as attractive of an investment as it may appear to be today.",

In particular, graphics processing units have become all the rage given their advanced computing power -- which is needed to train generative AI programs such as large language models.\n\nAt some point, you'd probably expect these investments to hit a peak or begin to plateau. After all, investors want to see a return on these massive infrastructure projects.\n\nWell, apparently there is still more money to be spent for some of AI's biggest players. For example, Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) announced its capital expenditures (capex) could reach $65 billion in 2025, representing over 60% growth from last year. Much of that will go to AI infrastructure investments.\n\nBelow, I'm going to detail what Meta's $60 billion to $65 billion AI-focused passion project entails. Moreover, I'll dig into what happened the last time the company went on a spending spree and what history suggests could happen to Meta shares this year.\n\nWhat is Meta's $65 billion capex plan all about?\n\nDuring the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Jan. 29, Wall Street analysts peppered Meta's executive leadership with questions related to this year's capex roadmap. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li provided a lot of details about the proposed multibillion-dollar infrastructure project.\n\nLi clarified the spending will be going to three main categories: servers, data centers, and networking equipment. This makes sense as Meta plans to double down on data center build-outs equipped with \"large training clusters\" of networking equipment. Specifically, Li mentioned the company will \"further ramp adoption\" of its custom Meta Training and Inference Accelerator chips designed in partnership with Broadcom.\n\nWhile this level of investment is par for the course among the tech industry's biggest companies, investors may want a refresher on what happened the last time the company poured cash into its vision for the future.\n\nWhat happened the last time Meta went on a spending spree?\n\nQuick question: When was the last time you heard about the metaverse?\n\nA few years ago, you may recall virtual worlds and spatial computing were hot topics in the financial world. The metaverse was supposed to change how people interact, and it promised myriad breakthroughs in how businesses across all industries would visualize and build new products.\n\nPerhaps no other company bought into the idea of the metaverse as much as ... Meta Platforms. Up until Oct. 2021, the social media company was still known as Facebook. In 2022, Meta began investing aggressively in its Reality Labs business -- a segment featuring virtual reality headsets for gaming and entertainment.\n\nAs the chart above shows, the company's capex increased significantly. This wouldn't be an issue on its own, but these investments took a major toll on Meta's profitability. Just look at the inverse relationship between the company's capex and earnings per share in 2022.\n\nThe hit to earnings led investors to sour on Meta stock, sending shares down 64% that year.\n\nWhy this time could be different\n\nIf you see the company's metaverse investments as a close parallel to its massive AI spending plan, history suggests the stock could be in trouble. However, there are some important details that explain why things may go differently this time around.\n\nFirst, 2022 was a tough year for most tech companies. Inflation peaked around 9%, and the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to curb rising prices. As such, just about all types of businesses were penny pinching and operating under radically tight spending protocols.\n\nThese dynamics impacted Meta's core business as its advertising revenue declined 1% in 2022. The combination of falling ad sales and rapidly rising costs from the metaverse drastically reduced the company's profitability as earnings per share fell 38% the same year.\n\nAnother reason the AI initiative could be different than the metaverse is due to how Meta is spending its money. The company over-hired in the Reality Labs business, which led to a series of sizable layoffs to right size its cost structure.\n\nBut for the new infrastructure spend, Meta's management noted the company is investing in areas to extend the useful life of its servers. In other words, Meta's $65 billion capex budget could yield a better return on investment down the road.\n\nIt should become pretty clear this year if the company's capex spending is outpacing sales, profits, and cash flow. For the time being, the best way to approach an investment in Meta is to keep an eye out for earnings announcements and any management commentary regarding the push into AI.",

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Strategies of Fisher:\n\nCompared with many other firms, Fisher Investments' most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm\u2019s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market.\n\nFisher\u2019s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity.\n\nDiversified Portfolio and Sector Emphasis:\n\nThe firm\u2019s holdings express Fisher\u2019s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher\u2019s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%).\n\nIn 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion. The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher's long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher's portfolio.",

            "content": "It\u2019s going to be a rough Super Bowl weekend for a lot of Meta employees who have taken to forums to express their frustration and anxiety over the upcoming workforce reduction. In a memo that leaked to BusinessInsider, Meta laid out its plan for this Monday, February 10th, that will impact approximately 3,600 employees \u2013 5% of it\u2019s 72,000 person workforce.\n\nThe tech giant will notify affected staff in the US of their termination via an early morning email at 5:00 AM PT. This marks another significant restructuring effort in a year that could see additional moves to make the company more \u2018lean\u2019 down the road. The reduction comes despite Meta announcing record profits in recent quarters, pledging substantial financial commitments to investing in AI ($60-$65 Billion), and having its stock hovering near all-time highs.\n\nThe situation has raised many questions regarding the decision to proceed with the layoffs, but Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has openly stated that he intends to \u201craise the bar on performance management\u201d and part with employees who rate poorly on company metrics more quickly and routinely.\n\nThe uncertainty of potentially receiving layoff notifications this Monday morning will undoubtedly weigh heavily on the entire staff, especially over a weekend that would typically be filled with celebrations and gatherings with friends and family. The layoffs are anticipated to impact about 5% of Meta\u2019s workforce and will reverberate around the world as Meta maintains offices in several countries.\n\nFrom the memo:\n\nImpacted employees in NORAM and the majority of impacted international employees will be notified by email, through both @meta.com and personal email addresses, and from that point will no longer be expected to work for Meta. Guidance will be provided where different country processes apply. Source: BusinessInsider\n\nEmployees who receive the email will have their access cut off from all Meta systems within an hour after receiving the message. Additionally, Meta did announce that a severance package will be detailed in the email, but nothing has been made public on that front yet. In prior layoffs Meta has offered package in the range of 16 weeks of base pay plus an additional two weeks for every year of service with no cap. At other times, they\u2019ve offered a flat 3-months of pay. It\u2019s difficult to guess what this round will be like because these are \u201cperformance\u201d based eliminations.\n\nThese staff reductions align with Meta\u2019s ongoing strategy to streamline operations and maintain competitiveness in the social media landscape. The company plans to hire new workers to replace some of the terminated positions, suggesting a targeted restructuring rather than purely cost-cutting measures.\n\nSome have suggested that the staff reductions in recent years, along with Meta\u2019s significant investments in research and development, are aimed at preparing the company for Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of using AI agents and automation. In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, he stated that he expects AI to replace mid-level engineers by 2025 and was actively working toward developing that technology for Meta.\n\nUltimately, Zuckerberg believes that AI will take over most coding tasks, allowing human engineers to concentrate on higher-level problem-solving and creativity. As a result, the performance-based job cuts will likely be for positions that may never return and going forward we could see a shift in the makeup of the workforce at Meta.\n\nMeta Employees on Edge\n\nA leaked internal memo from Meta\u2019s VP of Human Resources, Janelle Gale, is causing unease among employees as it outlines the process for upcoming performance-based layoffs. The memo, obtained by Business Insider, details a \u201clayoff by email\u201d plan where affected employees will be notified electronically and lose access to company systems within an hour.\n\nNotification and Timing\n\nEmployees will receive an email at both their work and personal addresses informing them of their termination. This email will also include details about their severance package. For those in the US, this notification will arrive as early as 5:00 AM PT on Monday, February 10th. International employees will receive notifications on a staggered schedule, with some as late as February 18th.\n\nNotification Schedule by Region:\n\nRegion Notification Date & Time APAC (Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore) February 9th, 1:00 PM PT EMEA (Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ireland, Israel, Poland, Switzerland, UAE, UK) February 9th, 9:00 PM PT NORAM and LATAM (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, United States) February 10th, 5:00 AM PT Select International (Czech Republic, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand) February 11th-18th Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) Exempt\n\n\u201cA Difficult Day\u201d\n\nGale acknowledges in the memo that this will be \u201ca difficult day\u201d and that there may be disruptions to workflow. She encourages employees to work from home if possible and assures them that managers will be working with leadership to answer questions and provide clarity.\n\nFocus on AI\n\nThese performance-based layoffs, coupled with Meta\u2019s recent announcement of expedited hiring for AI engineers, suggest a strategic shift within the company. Meta appears to be streamlining its workforce while simultaneously investing in areas crucial for its future, particularly artificial intelligence.\n\nEmployee Concerns\n\nThe abrupt nature of the layoffs and the lack of direct communication are likely contributing to employee anxiety. The memo states that there will be no company-wide communication following the individual notifications, leaving many to speculate about the extent of the cuts and the future direction of the company.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nMeta will reduce its workforce by 3,600 employees through email notifications on Monday morning\n\nThe company uses performance metrics to select affected positions while planning strategic new hires\n\nEmployees will receive immediate notification about their status at 5 a.m. PT on Monday\n\nImpact of Layoffs on Meta\u2019s Operations\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, recently announced that 2025 will focus on \u201cefficiency\u201d for the company. An internal memo detailing layoff plans appears to be the first major move in this direction. While Meta describes these layoffs as based on performance rather than financial reasons, employees feel anxious about their future at the company. The tech industry has been facing many layoffs, and Meta\u2019s actions indicate that this trend may continue.\n\nMeta\u2019s latest round of layoffs aims to boost efficiency and streamline operations through targeted performance-based cuts and strategic reorganization of key business units.\n\nPerformance-Based Cuts and Reviews\n\nLow-performing employees will face the highest risk of job cuts as Meta implements its new workforce reduction strategy. The company plans to remove approximately 5% of staff based on performance metrics and reviews.\n\nMeta will send notifications to affected employees through both work and personal email accounts starting at 5 AM PT on Monday. This systematic approach targets underperforming team members to maintain productivity standards.\n\nThe performance management system evaluates employee contributions, project completion rates, and alignment with company goals. These metrics help identify staff members who fall below expected benchmarks.\n\nStrategic Shifts in Business Divisions\n\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs division may see significant changes as the company refocuses resources on core revenue-generating products. Instagram and other established platforms remain priority areas for maintaining market position.\n\nKey Business Changes:\n\nRedistribution of workload among remaining team members\n\nIncreased focus on AI and machine learning initiatives\n\nEnhanced resource allocation to profitable divisions\n\nThe restructuring aims to create leaner teams while maintaining development speed. Teams will merge where necessary to eliminate redundancies and improve collaboration efficiency.\n\nFuture Outlook for Meta and Employees\n\nMeta faces significant changes in its workforce structure as it adapts to new market realities. The company\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence and the metaverse shapes its employment decisions and future direction.\n\nAdaptation to the Changing Social Media Landscape\n\nMeta plans to intensify its AI development while maintaining its social media platforms. The company will shift resources from traditional roles to AI-focused positions.\n\nRemote work remains central to Meta\u2019s operations. Teams will collaborate across multiple time zones and countries using digital tools.\n\nThe Reality Labs division continues to receive substantial investment despite mixed financial results. This signals Meta\u2019s commitment to virtual and augmented reality technologies.\n\nRemote Work and Employee Support\n\nMeta provides transition support for affected employees. This includes:\n\nCareer counseling services\n\nResume writing assistance\n\nJob placement support\n\nExtended healthcare benefits\n\nSeverance packages based on tenure\n\nDisplaced workers receive access to professional coaching to help with their next career steps.\n\nHiring and Growth Prospects\n\nMeta maintains selective hiring for strategic positions. Priority areas include:\n\nAI engineers\n\nMachine learning specialists\n\nVirtual reality developers\n\nSecurity experts\n\nThe company expects to add roles in European operations centers. This expansion aligns with regional data privacy requirements and market growth.\n\nPerformance-based evaluations will guide future hiring decisions. Meta aims to maintain a smaller but more efficient workforce.",

Local laws in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, will protect employees in these countries from Meta's job cuts.\n\nMore than a dozen other employees in Africa, Europe and Asia, however, will be handed pink slips between February 11-18, the report added.\n\nGale in her post, also noted that unlike previous job cuts, Meta would keep its offices open on February 10.\n\nAlso Read | Jesse Eisenberg no longer wants to be \u2018associated\u2019 with Mark Zuckerberg\n\nHiring for Machine Learning Roles \u2018Expedited\u2019 Further, the report cited a separate memo by Peng Fan, VP of Engineering for Monetization at Meta, which asked employees to \u201cassist with an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers\u201d and other \u201cbusiness critical\u201d engineering roles.\n\nAccording to the memo, the hiring is likely to be conducted from February 11 to March 13, and Fan stated: \u201cThank you for your continued support in helping us achieve our accelerated hiring goals, and better align with our company's priorities for 2025.\u201d\n\nMeta Jobs on the Chopping Block Earlier in January, citing an internal note to employees from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Bloomberg had reported that Meta Platforms is cutting around 5 per cent or 3,600 jobs based on performances and will re-hire for those roles, according to a Bloomberg. It had said that impacted employees would receive notifications by February 10.\n\nThe memo sent to all employees by Zuckerberg said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster\u2026 We typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d\n\nHe added that only employees who have been with the company long enough to be eligible for a performance review will be included and Meta would \u201cprovide generous severance\u201d in line with past cuts. As of September 2024, Meta employed close to 72,000 people, a 5 per cent cut would thus affect at least 3,600 jobs.",

According to Reuters, Meta and attorneys involved in the settlement have defended the agreement as both fair and reasonable, urging the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss challenges questioning its adequacy.\n\nThe settlement stems from allegations that Facebook improperly allowed political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and other third parties access to users\u2019 personal information, a controversy that ignited global privacy concerns. While Meta has denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to settle the case to put the matter to rest, per Reuters.\n\nInitially approved by a lower court in 2023, the settlement has faced objections from some users who argue that Facebook should pay significantly more to affected consumers. Additionally, critics have contested the $181 million legal fee award to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, claiming it is excessive. However, as Reuters reported, lawyers representing the class-action plaintiffs have pushed back against these objections.\n\nRead more: Meta Files Complaint Against Apple with Brazil\u2019s Antitrust Authority\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s hearing, attorney Derek Loeser, representing the plaintiffs, emphasized that the trial judge conducted a rigorous review before approving the settlement.

Developing models that are able to work on multilingual problems and in underserved languages not only promotes linguistic diversity and inclusivity in the digital world, but also helps us create intelligent systems that can adapt to new situations and learn from experience.\n\nToday, we\u2019re excited to share some of our most recent programs, research and models that support that goal, and to offer opportunities for collaborators to contribute to AI translation technologies that incorporate a vast array of global languages and dialects.\n\nLanguage Technology Partner Program\n\nWe\u2019re seeking partners to collaborate with us on advancing and broadening Meta\u2019s open source language technologies, including AI translation technologies. Our efforts are especially focused on underserved languages, in support of UNESCO\u2019s work as part of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages.\n\nWe are looking for partners who can contribute 10+ hours of speech recordings with transcriptions, large amounts of written text (200+ sentences) and sets of translated sentences in diverse languages. Partners will work with our teams to help integrate these languages into AI-driven speech recognition and machine translation models, which when released will be open sourced and made freely available to the community.\n\nAs a partner, you will also gain access to technical workshops led by our research teams, where you\u2019ll learn how to leverage our open source models to build language technologies.

Composed of sentences carefully crafted by linguistic experts, we intend this benchmark to showcase the diversity of human language.\n\nWe invite you to access the benchmark, which is available in seven languages, and contribute translations that will be made open source and available to others.

In 2022, we released the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) project, a groundbreaking open source machine translation engine that was the first neural machine translation model for many languages, and laid the foundation for future research and development.\n\nWe collaborated with UNESCO and Hugging Face to build a language translator based on NLLB, which we announced during United Nations General Assembly week last September.\n\nMost recently, to support digital empowerment, which is a key thematic area of the Global Action Plan of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages, we introduced the Meta Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project, which scales audio transcription to over 1,100 languages. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to improve and expand its capabilities, including the addition of zero-shot speech recognition in 2024, which enables it to transcribe audio in languages it has never seen before without prior training.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to create intelligent systems that can understand and respond to complex human needs, regardless of language or cultural background. As we continue in this direction, we\u2019re excited to collaboratively enhance and expand machine translation and other language technologies.",

That's a smart thing to do right now as the adoption of AI in marketing is expected to increase at an annual rate of 25% through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nHowever, will AI be enough to drive Meta stock higher over the next three years? Let's find out.\n\nMeta Platforms' AI-driven ad revenue has been picking up\n\nMeta Platforms released its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 29. The company ended the year with a 22% jump in revenue to $164.5 billion, while earnings increased an impressive 60% year over year to $23.86 per share. The numbers exceeded Wall Street's expectations.\n\nThe good part is that Meta's AI-focused advertising tools are gaining solid traction among customers. For instance, CFO Susan Li remarked on the company's latest earnings conference call that its Advantage+ platform, which allows advertisers to automate their ad campaigns, witnessed a terrific year-over-year increase of 70% in the fourth quarter. This platform has now exceeded an annual revenue run rate of $20 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta is also witnessing a significant jump in the adoption of its Advantage+ Creative platform, which optimizes the images and video using generative AI to help improve audience interaction. It is worth noting that the adoption of Meta's generative AI-powered ad creation tools has jumped fourfold in a matter of just six months.\n\nMore importantly, Meta has been pushing the envelope to ensure that it can make the most of AI to help increase advertisers' returns on the ad dollars they spend. It launched a new machine learning platform called Andromeda in the second half of last year, developed in partnership with Nvidia. Meta points out that Andromeda's ability to \"narrow down a pool of tens of millions of ads to the few thousand we consider showing someone\" has led to an 8% increase in the quality of ads that are served to the audience.\n\nNot surprisingly, Meta has decided to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditure this year to support its generative AI efforts and the core business. That would be a big increase from last year's outlay of $39.2 billion. However, there have been concerns about the returns that Meta and others, which are spending such big money on AI projects, can generate from these investments. But then, it looks like the money that Meta is spending to bring AI-focused advertising tools to its customers is indeed bearing fruit.\n\nThis is evident from the 14% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad that Meta charged in Q4. That's a huge improvement over the 2% growth in the average price per ad in the fourth quarter of 2023. So, the better quality of ads and the AI-powered ad creation and optimization tools are probably encouraging advertisers to spend more across Meta's family of apps, and this could lead to healthy bottom-line growth over the next three years.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next three years?\n\nWe have already seen that Meta delivered impressive earnings growth in 2024. However, analysts are projecting a single-digit jump in its earnings this year to $25.30 per share.\n\nThis slowdown in Meta's bottom-line growth this year can be attributed to the significant increase in its expenses to support its AI-centric efforts. However, we can see from the chart that Meta's earnings growth is expected to accelerate into the mid-teens from next year. Assuming the company manages to achieve $34.08 per share in earnings for 2027 and trades at 33.5 times earnings at that time (in line with the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple), its stock price could jump to $1,141 in three years.\n\nThat would be a 65% jump from current levels (at the time of this writing). Given that Meta is trading at 28 times earnings right now, a discount to the Nasdaq-100, investors are getting a good deal on this stock right now despite the impressive gains that it has clocked in the past three years. Savvy investors, therefore, can consider adding this AI stock to their portfolios because it seems built for more upside.",

(Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nGLAAD first began working with Meta in 2010, helping the company (then Facebook) launch the Facebook Network of Support to fight anti-LGBTQ bullying and hate. Over the last 15 years, the company has expressed public support for LGBTQ rights and equality. From campaigns supporting marriage equality to initiatives promoting Trans Day of Visibility, Meta proudly expressed its values as an LGBTQ-friendly company. And while it has been far from perfect in its enforcement efforts (and hasn\u2019t posted on its official LGBTQ Facebook page for more than two years), the company has at least maintained policies that aim to protect the safety of LGBTQ users.\n\nWith Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's brash declarations in early January, all of this has changed. In addition to dropping fact-checking in the US and reducing content moderation, the company announced the suspension of its DEI programs, rolled back safety policies protecting LGBTQ people (especially transgender people) and many other marginalized groups, removed trans and nonbinary themes from Messenger, and even adopted anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in its own public-facing policies. In an added symbolic gesture, the company ordered the removal of tampons from men\u2019s restrooms at Meta offices. Journalists also reported on the company\u2019s leaked internal enforcement guidelines, which now state that some extreme anti-LGBTQ slurs and previously mitigated phrases are now permitted.\n\nThese new policy and product changes presage (and very obviously mirror) the relentless deluge of anti-trans and anti-DEI efforts now emanating from the White House. And they send a clear message that Meta and its leadership may actually hold (and espouse) bigoted, homophobic, and transphobic beliefs about LGBTQ people.\n\nSome of Meta\u2019s users, creators, and workers may share these horrible anti-LGBTQ perspectives. Certainly, many of them (hopefully most) don\u2019t. While some of Meta\u2019s advertisers may look the other way and ignore such blatant targeting of the LGBTQ community, I feel confident that many (hopefully most) will not. Just in these past couple of weeks, Meta employees have expressed widespread concern and objections. We\u2019re also seeing growing concerns from brands and advertisers who do not want their ads appearing next to content that uses extreme anti-trans slurs or calls LGBTQ people \u201cabnormal,\u201d both of which are now allowed under the new guidelines.\n\nGiven Meta\u2019s rightward, \u201cMAGA makeover\u201d shift in top leadership, including the elevation of Joel Kaplan to Global Policy Chief and the August 2024 hiring of Project 2025 chapter author Dustin Carmack as Director of Public Policy, it should not be surprising that the company is now making public statements such as this one, employing well-known anti-LGBTQ rhetoric straight out of Project 2025:\n\n\u201cWe do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality [sic]\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Meta Hateful Conduct policy (updated January 7, 2025)\n\nThe purpose of maintaining hate speech policies is to keep all users safe, not to put a target on the backs of one historically marginalized group. Meta enshrining a statement that LGBTQ people are \u201cabnormal\u201d and \u201cmentally ill,\u201d and intentionally employing overtly bigoted anti-LGBTQ dog whistle language, deliberately expressing animus towards one group of people based on their protected characteristics in a hate speech policy \u2014 is unprecedented. (Picture the degrading intent of an equivalent intentionally archaic phrasing such as: \u201cWe do allow allegations of abnormality when based on race/disability, given political discourse about negroes [sic]/the handicapped [sic].\u201d)\n\nFor those who may not be aware, the term \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a well-known right-wing trope intended to falsely assert that being transgender is an ideology rather than an innate identity. (Project 2025 and the many recent, draconian anti-trans White House executive orders employ this trope and the equivalent insidious phrase \u201cgender ideology\u201d as their chief rhetorical strategy). The term \u201chomosexuality\u201d is an outdated, intentionally pathologizing way of referring to gay and lesbian people.\n\nMeta has never previously used these terms or this kind of offensive anti-LGBTQ language in public policies or communications.\n\nThis is not normal.\n\nAnd this is only one sentence. (There\u2019s a long list of other groups Meta is throwing to the curb as well, including immigrants, women, people of color, people with disabilities, and more.)\n\nThis new, extreme right posturing is directly connected to the new administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the very concept of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and to ultimately wipe out anti-discrimination protections for all historically marginalized groups \u2014 in the workplace, in employment, housing, lending, and more. This is an effort that is actively in process right now, with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announcing last week that it has already halted processing of claims of workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn our research at GLAAD, we know that this kind of hate is not in alignment with the pluralistic values of most Americans. Meta\u2019s advertisers, creators, customers, and workers should take heed that Meta\u2019s corporate values have drastically changed from respecting the diversity of all of the people who make up the fabric of American society to a proactive declaration of bigotry and hate attacking its own users.",

Following its landmark $100 billion investment into XR, then in turn metaverse, solutions Bosworth revealed in a leaked memo that 2025 will be a standout year for the once headline and imagination-stealing technology as well as Reality Labs as a whole.\n\nMetaverse solutions were much touted in years past. From meetings to socialisation, marketing groups pushed the Metaverse\u2014i.e. shared virtual spaces and content\u2014as the future, a future that may have become of interest due to the remote isolation of a COVID-peaked world.\n\nHowever, audiences soon lost interest in the idea of the metaverse, with platforms like AltSapce closing down and Horizon news remaining quiet since the metaverse boom. This doesn\u2019t mean virtual shared spaces and content disappeared; consumer-focused platforms like VRChat are still going strong \u2013 even appearing on Apple\u2019s Vision Pro \u2013 and in education online, shared spaces on platforms like Engage are still holding ground for enterprise use cases.\n\nBut the metaverse died somewhat, in part due to technology; the concept boomed and was led by Meta while the Meta Quest 2 VR headset was championing the market. At the time, VRChat and others provided niche examples of the concept, but marketers seemed to believe the Metaverse and its enterprise use cases were ready for broader market appeal \u2013 not too dissimilar to how smartphone applications greatly broadened video game markets, reaching users who do not interact with gaming console/PCs.\n\nSince then, however, the XR device market has matured slowly but greatly. Now, MR headsets are overtaking VR-dedicated devices. Monochrome passthrough was a minor feature on the Meta Quest 2; now, full-colour passthrough is the norm, as are emerging integrated technologies like tracking, XR streaming, and AI that could provide a framework for metaverse services. Moreover, AR smart glasses are on the rise, looking to be the next hot technology, further helping to boost that market.\n\nWith the XR device maturing, Meta seems to think that the Metaverse could have the hardware and software infrastructure to support its lost promises. This doesn\u2019t just include consumer use cases; Meta is storied in its belief that the Metaverse will hold a strong place in the business world also.\n\nWhat Did Boz Say?\n\nAs discovered by Bussiness Insider, Boz noted to Meta employees that 2025 will be \u201cthe most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the metaverse and Horizon Worlds, Boz explained that the service\u2019s mobile application \u201cabsolutely has to break out for our long-term plans to have a chance. \u201d He also remarked that \u201cif you don\u2019t feel the weight of history on you, then you aren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\n\nBoz added:\n\nThis year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.\n\nThese are passionate and strong statements from Boz, who may be feeling the pressure of the current XR space race between Samsung, Apple, Google, and others.\n\n\u201cOn paper 2024 was our most successful year to date but we aren\u2019t sitting around celebrating because know it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d noted Boz, who also in a revealing statement said that \u201cwe haven\u2019t actually made a dent in the world yet.\u201d\n\nSeemingly speaking on the billions Meta has invested in XR, Boz reflected that \u201cwe live in an incredible time of technological achievement and have placed ourselves at the center of it with our investments. There is a very good chance most of us will never get a chance like this again.\u201d\n\nBoz also said:\n\nYou should be doing the best work of your career right now. You should be pushing yourself to grow where needed and doubling down on your strengths. When you look back on this time, I want you to feel like you did everything in your power to make the most of it.\n\n\u201cThe path is clear,\u201d Boz concluded, explaining that for \u201cpeople in the organization\u201d, all they need to do is \u201cexecute on the work laid out before them to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe ended:\n\nIt is about operational excellence. It is about master craftsmanship. It is about filling our products with \u201cGive A Damn\u201d. This is about having pride in our work.\n\nSpeaking with Passion\n\nBoz seems to be speaking with passion first. While no direct moves or goalposts are reflected in the memo, it is clear that Boz wants to push forward with clear leadership in XR, starting with the Quest MR headset and Horiozn metaverse platform.\n\nMeta, as an umbrella corporation, has its hands in many pies, from AI to social media, and also XR-then it\u2019s derivatives. There is a sentiment in his memo that Boz wants the Reality Labs team to be remembered as innovators who changed the world and who will continue to lead an XR revolution in decades to come.\n\nBut competition is fierce with new and veteran firms in the space, and the pressure cooker is boiling over. There have been lessons learnt from mistakes and successes with Meta Reality Labs; for example, its headsets have been the centre of industry-wide leadership via the Quest 2, and setbacks like the Quest Pro come as recent as last month; however, to Reality Labs\u2019 credit, they act upon either side of the coin accordingly.\n\nConnect is not coming up soon; it\u2019ll most likely come in Q3. However, the event is a hotbed for innovation for Meta and its XR ambitions, and every year proves this. This year, more AR smart glasses news will likely hit the headlines following Connect, but based on Boz\u2019s passionate memo, maybe new MR headset and metaverse innovations will also lead the way.\n\nMeta Kicks the Next Immersive Space Race into Motion\n\nMeta\u2019s recent Q1 earnings report revealed that the company is significantly increasing its investments in immersive technology, with ongoing commitments to an ambitious $100 billion spending plan for its extended reality product portfolio, which includes augmented reality smart glasses, virtual reality headsets, mixed reality devices, and metaverse services.\n\nDuring this period, Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the success of the Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses, which feature AR-lite capabilities. These glasses appear to serve as a testing ground for emerging features in AR smart glasses, such as translation visualizations.\n\nZuckerberg noted that smart glasses are \u201cthe perfect form factor for AI,\u201d indicating Meta\u2019s strategic vision for integrating artificial intelligence with XR technology\u2014an area of ongoing interest for his company. He expressed his expectation that this year, a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant will reach over 1 billion users, with Meta AI positioned to be a leading contender in this space. The development of AR-ready smart glasses seems to be a significant step toward that future.\n\nIn addition to the $100 billion allocated for XR, Meta is also investing between $60 billion and $65 billion in AI infrastructure, emphasizing the high stakes for Zuckerberg and his company.\n\nMeta is not yet done with the metaverse, Zuckberg said \u201cThis is also going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse,\u201d he also added:\n\nThe number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing \u2014 and this is the year when a number of long-term investments that we\u2019ve been working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land. I think we\u2019re going to know a lot more about Horizon\u2019s trajectory by the end of this year.\n\nIn closing, Zuckerberg explained that Meta is accelerating its efforts towards building \u201csome awesome things that shape the future of human connection. As always, I\u2019m grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us.\u201d",

Well, for all intents and purposes, Signals Gateway is a customer data platform, although Meta describes it as \u201can easy, low-cost, all-in-one solution.\u201d\n\nAWS and Google \u2013 not to mention Snowflake and Databricks \u2013 have all created their own off-the-shelf versions of CDPs, which in turn has put pressure on CDP category players to justify their cost as a point solution.\n\nIn January, mParticle, a CDP category pioneer, was acquired by Rokt for $300 million, and two other standalone CDP startups \u2013 Lytics and ActionIQ \u2013 were bought over the past couple of months. Last year, CDP BlueConic acquired the CDP-ish first-party data platform Jebbit, and back in 2020, Twilio snapped up Segment.\n\n\u201cNowadays, everyone\u2019s a CDP,\u201d Michael Katz, mParticle\u2019s co-founder and CEO, told AdExchanger after selling to Rokt. The real CDPs have to get \u201ccloser to the value creation layer,\u201d Katz says.\n\nWhich is to say, CDPs are being kludged together with businesses that monetize via ads.\n\nTaking Advantage\n\nAlthough Meta was quiet about Signals Gateway, it was louder about recent new changes to its Advantage+ platform for advertisers.\n\nThat\u2019s probably because all the updates have something to do with AI, which \u201ccontinues to be top of mind for everyone at Meta,\u201d Garrick Tiplady, Meta\u2019s global head of mid-market, told press during a stream on Thursday.\n\nIn addition to streamlining Advantage+ campaign setups, Meta is also introducing a tool that uses AI to optimize toward high-quality leads and also expanding what it calls \u201copportunity scores,\u201d which offer recommendations to improve ad performance on Meta.\n\nIn a nutshell, Meta is going all in on automated ad products, which might set off an alarm bell for marketers who remember the unexplained bug that caused Advantage+ to massively overspend on campaigns last year. Not to mention that some manual targeting capabilities for catalog ads are reportedly being phased out, according to Emarketer.\n\nRegardless, Meta is confident that the performance will speak for itself.\n\nAccording to VP of Product Krassimir Karamfilov, early tests of the Advantage+ updates led to a 5% median decrease in cost per result, 10% lower cost per qualified lead and 14% lower cost per lead.\n\nChain Gang\n\nDeepSee.io recently exposed an ad-supported piracy network hosting copyrighted comics. Now, armed with supply-chain data provided by DSPs, it\u2019s naming which sellers and resellers it found monetizing the stolen content.\n\nThe piracy network is operated by Nakamas Web SL, a company based in Spain. The domains in its shifting roster are able to monetize due to lax vetting by resellers and SSPs, according to DeepSee CEO Rocky Moss.\n\nSince 2024, Netpub and BidGear were the direct sellers most often associated with Nakamas Web domains, while Infolinks and Xapads were common middlemen. However, Infolinks recently cut off Nakamas\u2019 access, Moss notes.\n\nStill, Nakamas Web has been in action for years, and major SSPs have traded this inventory at various times.\n\nFor example, Netpub\u2019s website touts its partnership with Criteo. DeepSee found that Criteo\u2019s Commerce Grid SSP is the most common final seller of Nakamas Web inventory via its connection to Netpub.\n\nOther SSPs implicated include Magnite, OpenX, AppNexus and FreeWheel, via seller connections to Seedtag, Adagio, R2B2 and more.\n\nPlus, some pub tech providers associated with Nakamas Web, like BidGear and PurpleAds, have been named in previous piracy research.\n\nMoss called out many of these companies on LinkedIn, imploring them to clean up their supply chains.\n\nBut Wait!

And many are still reeling from his politically-charged changes to content moderation and DEI programs.\n\nThe disconnect between that group of concerned employees and upper management was on full display during Bosworth\u2019s Q&A earlier this week. At one point, he responded to a question from a female employee on Zuckerberg\u2019s widely-circulated comment to Joe Rogan about wanting more \u201cmasculine energy\u201d in the workplace.\n\nThe employee asked Bosworth to respond to Zuckerberg saying that companies need \u201cless feminine energy.\u201d Zuckerberg never technically said that in the interview with Rogan, though one could easily interpret the \u201cmasculine energy\u201d soundbite to mean that the CEO wants a more specific kind of energy at the expense of the other.\n\nBosworth went off.\n\n\u201cThis really bothered me because it\u2019s evident from your question that you did not actually listen to the thing you are criticizing or asking questions about. And that is not acceptable. I don\u2019t know why people think it\u2019s an okay thing to take something laundered through a biased source construct and bring it here without even bothering to look at anything that is free and online.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants us to be a place that supports all people,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe says that in the interview and then you come in here and you haven\u2019t even bothered to listen to the thing. It\u2019s like three minutes. It wouldn\u2019t take you that long. So, you can tell from your question [that] you didn\u2019t even read it. You didn\u2019t even listen to it. You just read something online and got real mad about it. You\u2019ve been mad about it for weeks, obviously. For weeks, you\u2019ve been mad about it. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nElsewhere\n\nJob board\n\nSome noteworthy job changes in the tech world:\n\nRyan Cairns will become the leader of the Quest product line at Meta now that Mark Rabkin is Loredana Crisan and other leaders of Facebook Messenger are moving to the generative AI org now that Messenger is being folded into Tom Alison\u2019s bigger Facebook org.

These optimizations will be turned on when businesses use Advantage+ audience, placement and campaign budget.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019ll now be able to see where Advantage+ can help, in all aspects, and you\u2019ll be able to more easily choose where to activate it in your process.\n\nMeta\u2019s also renaming Advantage+ shopping campaigns to Advantage+ sales campaigns \u201cto better reflect the full range of advertisers that can benefit from this product.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s also expanding Advantage+ to leads campaigns, providing more ways to utilize its AI-powered targeting insights.\n\n\u201cAdvertisers can now apply full campaign automation to efficiently find high quality leads with the help of AI. The new streamlined Advantage+ setup will also be testing with Advantage+ leads campaigns.\u201d\n\nThat could be a good way to generate more direct connections from your Meta promotions.\n\nIndeed, Meta says that, in early testing, leads campaigns that had Advantage+ turned on resulted in 10% lower cost per qualified lead.\n\nCould be worth considering.\n\nMeta\u2019s also testing out a new \u201cOpportunity Score\u201d display in Ads Manager, which will provide a 0-100 point summary as to how well your campaign is set up to maximize performance.\n\nThe score aims to provide immediate feedback on campaign set-up, which could help you optimize your results.\n\n\u201cThe score is coupled with near real-time recommendations for what an advertiser can do in just a few steps to help improve performance, including tapping our AI-enabled Advantage+ suite. In our early tests, advertisers who adopted opportunity score recommendations saw a 5% median decrease in their cost per result.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s expanding this test to more advertisers, providing simple tips on how to get more out of your campaigns.\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, some advertisers in our test group will also begin to see opportunity score\u2019s recommendations together with the streamlined Meta Advantage+ setup, helping us learn if this gives marketers a more powerful foundation to create, manage and run their campaigns.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Meta\u2019s AI-powered Advantage+ campaigns have become a powerful option to reach the right audience with your promotions, even if you don\u2019t know who the right audience might be.\n\nIndeed, according to Meta:\n\n\u201cAdvantage+ shopping campaigns (ASC+) has been one of our fastest, most consistently growing AI-powered ad products, most recently growing 70% year over year in Q4. And since the launch of Meta Andromeda, we\u2019ve seen an 8% improvement in ads quality, better personalizing the ads we show from Advantage+ campaigns.\u201d\n\nMany marketers have reported seeing better results by putting their trust in Meta\u2019s automated targeting process. Which can feel like you\u2019re putting too much reliance on Meta\u2019s systems, but if it drives results, it could be worth experimenting with.\n\nAnd given the Advantage+ model is built on Meta\u2019s ad performance data, the system should know more than you or I about who\u2019s more likely to respond and what drives better performance.\n\nThese new features could give you more impetus to try out Advantage+ and see if it can help you generate more sales by relying on Meta\u2019s AI ad targeting.\n\nYou can read more about Meta\u2019s latest Advantage+ updates here.",

The social media stock took off after the inauguration, benefiting from a potential TikTok ban, the company's increasingly cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, news of increased investment in artificial intelligence (AI), and even the DeepSeek revelation.\n\nToward the end of the month, the stock also jumped on stellar results in its fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 18%. As you can see from the chart below, the stock took off at the end of the month following the inauguration.\n\nMeta soars again\n\nMeta is coming off an impressive 2024 as its stock surged, its company delivered impressive quarterly results, and it finished the year with the most used AI assistant, Meta AI.\n\nInvestors bet that momentum in January would continue as the tech giant seemed well positioned to benefit from a number of trends in the industry.\n\nFirst, while President Trump temporarily suspended the TikTok ban, the negative attention around the Chinese video-sharing app could benefit Meta, and a sale to an American owner could weaken its algorithm, favoring Meta properties like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nStocks rose broadly following the inauguration, and investors expect Meta to benefit from a friendlier business environment under the Trump administration, which could also include tax cuts.\n\nIn the last week of January, when AI stocks got hammered by the DeepSeek launch, Meta was one of the rare winners in the sector as investors seemed to believe that DeepSeek's open-source model validated Meta's own open-source approach. Additionally, Meta does not have a cloud infrastructure business and is more positioned to benefit from general advances in AI as it grows its social media ecosystem and builds its hardware business. The stock closed up 2% on Jan. 27 even as stocks like Nvidia crashed.\n\nTo wrap up the month, Meta delivered a blowout earnings report, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines as earnings per share jumped 50% to $8.02.\n\nWhat's next for Meta\n\nOn the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he expected Meta AI to become the first AI assistant to have more than 1 billion users by the end of the year, and the company also has green shoots in other areas like its Ray-Ban smart glasses, of which it sold over 1 million units in 2024.\n\nIts first-quarter guidance called for revenue growth to slow to between 8% and 15%, but the business seems well positioned for another strong year as it remains at the forefront of AI and its user and advertising base continues to grow. Even after the surge in 2024 and last month, the stock continues to look like a buy.",

That would bring Amazon's capex over $100 billion for the full year, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of which would go toward AI for Amazon Web Services, he said.\n\nThat comes after Amazon recently rolled out Trainium2, the latest model of its in-house chips. The company is working with Anthropic, the startup behind the Claude large language model, to build a server containing hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips with significantly more computing power than the current Claude models were trained on. Looking ahead, Jassy said Amazon expects to preview even more powerful Trainium3 chips later this year.\n\nAmazon's plans to ramp spending on AI follow similar moves by its Big Tech peers. Just earlier this week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) forecast $75 billion in capital expenditures this year to support expanding its AI capacity. Last week, Meta (META) said it plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year, while Microsoft (MSFT) said it plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in its 2025 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe're all learning from one another,\u201d Jassy said Thursday, nodding to Amazon's U.S. rivals as well as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, adding that Amazon has added DeepSeek models to its Bedrock and SageMaker development platforms. \u201cYou have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us.\u201d\n\nThe rapid rise of DeepSeek, which recently claimed to develop a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost of stateside competitors, has raised concerns about American firms' spending on AI. However, Bank of America analysts said the development could be \"AI's Sputnik moment,\" with growing competition pushing U.S. hyperscalers like Amazon to act with greater urgency and raise their investments rather than pull back.\n\nShares of Amazon slid 4% in extended trading Thursday after the company's earnings call and its outlook missed estimates. The stock was up 40% over the past 12 months through Thursday\u2019s close.\n\n",

Meta Quest, which is its AR/VR headset, was only mentioned once.\n\nThe CTO said in the memo that Meta is getting ready to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearables, but did not give more specifics.\n\nMeta\u2019s AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses sold one million pairs in 2024, but the company still isn\u2019t sure it would be a break-out hit in the long run.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li said in the earnings call that this year\u2019s spending on Reality Labs will be split between the metaverse and wearables products. She noted that there is still \u201ca deep technological set of challenges\u201d the lab needs to solve before it can sell its products at scale.\n\nLi said spending in Reality Labs will increase in 2025 from the year before, and operating losses also will increase.",

But details around the torrenting were murky until yesterday, when Meta's unredacted emails were made public for the first time.

And \"Meta also previously torrented 80.6 terabytes of data from LibGen.\"\n\n\"The magnitude of Meta\u2019s unlawful torrenting scheme is astonishing,\" the authors' filing alleged, insisting that \"vastly smaller acts of data piracy\u2014just .008 percent of the amount of copyrighted works Meta pirated\u2014have resulted in Judges referring the conduct to the US Attorneys\u2019 office for criminal investigation.\"\n\nSeeding expands authors\u2019 distribution theory\n\nBook authors had been pressing Meta for more information on the torrenting because of the obvious copyright concern over Meta seeding, and thus seemingly distributing, the pirated books in the dispute.\n\nBut Meta resisted those discovery attempts after an order denied authors' request to review Meta's torrenting and seeding data. That didn't stop authors from gathering evidence anyway, including a key document that starts with at least one staffer appearing to uncomfortably joke about the possible legal risks, eventually growing more serious about raising his concerns.\n\n\"Torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn\u2019t feel right,\" Nikolay Bashlykov, a Meta research engineer, wrote in an April 2023 message, adding a smiley emoji. In the same message, he expressed \"concern about using Meta IP addresses 'to load through torrents pirate content.'\"\n\nBy September 2023, Bashlykov had seemingly dropped the emojis, consulting the legal team directly and emphasizing in an email that \"using torrents would entail \u2018seeding\u2019 the files\u2014i.e., sharing the content outside, this could be legally not OK.\"",

M.P., present during the shooting in which her father was killed by Roof, concluded that Facebook contributed to Roof\u2019s murder of nine African American worshipers in the June 2015 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThe court disagreed with M.P. on the grounds that Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act immunized Meta from liability because the Act prevents it from being legally responsible for information published by third parties. Specifically, the Act states that \u201c[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d The court concluded that Section 230 bars M.P.\u2019s complaint because it seeks to hold Facebook liable as the publisher of the third-party content that Roof consumed prior to engaging in the shooting.\n\nThe court further reasoned that M.P. did not meet the legal standard to show that Meta was both the actual and legal causes of the shooting, meaning that her state-based claims were not plausible.

            "content": "Meta\u2019s executives are so in on AI wearables, the company plans to unleash six new mixed reality devices this year, according to a leaked memo. The tech industry is still grappling with the massive flop of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d; even as the company\u2019s engineers and execs attempt to sell us on the benefits of AI chatbots on your face, Meta can\u2019t get over its last missteps with Horizon Worlds.\n\nSilicon Valley normally works in waves, and judging by the recent annual Consumer Electronics Show, the tide is dragging us all toward a deep, black ocean of AI wearables. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg already promised investors the moon and more, saying the company\u2019s goal is to ship hundreds of millions and \u201ceventually\u201d sell \u201cbillions\u201d of AI glasses. On Thursday, Business Insider shared a leaked memo from Meta\u2019s Reality Labs head Andrew \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth titled \u201c2025: The Year of Greatness.\u201d In it, Bosworth claims the company is \u201cpushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables.\u201d\n\nThe memo was sent to staff in November, so plans could have changed in the meantime. Six new AI wearables in a single year would smash Meta\u2019s hardware record for any other year. In 2024, the company launched its revamped Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the Meta Quest 3S. Zuckerberg teased \u201cthird-generation\u201d smart glasses technology during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. Recent reports from Bloomberg have hinted Meta is now working on a pair of sports-centric Oakley-styled AR glasses for athletes. These reports further hint the company is developing glasses with a heads-up display, internally dubbed Hypernova.\n\nThe other products could simply be different glasses styles, much like the Ray-Ban smart glasses that come in \u201cWayfarer,\u201d \u201cSkyler,\u201d and \u201cHeadliner\u201d varieties. The more expensive $370 versions include transition lenses. However, Boz further mentioned \u201cwe need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [AKA mixed reality].\u201d This hints that Meta wants to drop more products with displays, akin to Project Orion true AR glasses the company showed off at Meta Connect last year.\n\nWhat this doesn\u2019t suggest is any new VR helmet in the works. Bloomberg previously reported Meta is working on two new Quest headsets, one of which might be a sequel to the short-lived Quest Pro. Either way, the glasses seem more of a shoo-in for 2025. These plans for \u201cGreatness\u201d also include Horizon Worlds, Meta\u2019s first attempt at a \u201cmetaverse\u201d living world that was so dull it made the 2003 game Second Life seem like a roller coaster thrill ride by comparison.\n\n\u201cHorizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance,\u201d Bosworth continued. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel the weight of history on you then you aren\u2019t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.\u201d\n\nThe memo is full of hyperbole and corporate speech so thick Weird Al Yankovich could use it to conceive a sequel to his parody jingle Mission Statement. Nowhere does Bosworth even mention the word \u201cmetaverse,\u201d which is interesting considering the entire company was named after that previous attempt to become \u201cvisionaries\u201d in tech. The weight of history crushed those designs on a shared VR universe, mostly because nobody wants to spend more than an hour or two strapped into a VR device.\n\nSmart glasses make much more sense from a usability standpoint, though we have yet to see a pair that makes good on the promise of wearable computers. Apple was reportedly working on a similar pair of mixed-reality spectacles, though the latest hints from reliable sources suggest the company killed off its planned AR glasses. The company was reportedly stumped by the need for processing power and battery life. Considering Apple\u2019s missteps, Meta needs to prove it can do more than offer an AI chatbot for your face.",

While there are some great ideas behind the thought of a \u201cMetaverse\u201d, the general lack of interest by the public should help Meta figure out where they should be devoting time and energy toward, rather than pushing for a supposed Virtual world that most regular users won\u2019t ever give more than a fleeting glance at.\n\nScreenshot: YouTube/Meta Quest\n\nFocus On What Makes the Meta Quest Stand Out, Rather Than on Play-Dough Avatars and a Failing Metaverse\n\nOriginally reported by Business Insider, the Meta leads believe that 2025 is the \u201cmake-or-break\u201d year for the Metaverse. But here\u2019s the thing; how could it make or break when it\u2019s never taken off in the first place? Even the most staunch supporters of Virtual Reality know that the Metaverse is nothing compared to even singular apps. Why would I choose to go into something like Meta Worlds when VRChat exists, and allows for unparalleled versatility?\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nI would rather see Meta double down on its gaming efforts than focus on trying to save a floundering social aspect. Plenty of apps out there already do what Meta is attempting to do, only\u2026 much better. If I have a chance to be a Crewmate from Among Us and chat with friends, instead of wandering around as a Meta Avatar? I already know which option I\u2019m going to pick. If nothing else, focus on it from a purely business aspect. Rather than trying to make the Metaverse something for \u201cGamers\u201d and \u201cPlayers\u201d, make it into something that could rival Zoom or Teams. That would likely be the wisest aspect at this point, especially for those who work from home.\n\nWatching games like Fortnite continuously evolve while Meta just flops on the ground like a fish out of water when it comes to social aspects is hilarious to me. Find ways to make Virtual Reality more useful in real life, like how I did with making a pie. Nobody wants to hang out in empty spaces with soulless avatars, and it should be rather apparent at this point. Maybe they\u2019ll take the hint and take the Metaverse out back.",

Before that, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would spend $60 billion to $65 billion on capital expenditures this year with a focus on AI infrastructure, well ahead of previous estimates.\n\nThe gains are notable as other big tech firms have been punished by investors for similarly large capex growth.

Following that news, reports came that Dropbox Inc. and Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management are doing the same.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Meta was in talks to move its incorporation to Texas. In response to a social media post about Dropbox moving, Ackman posted social media platform X that his company was doing the same.\n\n\u201cWe are reincorporating our management company in Nevada for the same reason. Top law firms are recommending Nevada and Texas over Delaware,\u201d Ackman posted.\n\nA few big companies leaving Delaware won't register for the average resident, but if it became a larger trend, it could one day have implications for the tax burden on everyday Delawareans.\n\nDebate over Delaware's status\n\nDelaware's status as the incorporation capital moved into the spotlight last year.\n\nMuch of that was stoked by Elon Musk\u2019s decision to reincorporate Tesla and SpaceX to Texas following a Delaware Chancery Court decision that ordered him to give up his $56 billion compensation package through Tesla. After the ruling, he posted \u201cnever incorporate in the state of Delaware\u201d and took his companies elsewhere.\n\nRead more: Tesla to move from Delaware to Texas, reinstate Musk's pay deal voided by judge\n\nThen, the Delaware General Assembly saw uncharacteristically intense debate over changes to Delaware Corporation Law. The state regularly passes changes to the law, but without any debate.\n\nLast year was different with lawmakers debating a bill that came directly in response to rulings by state judges, including one ruling known as Moelis that declared that shareholder agreements that turn over power of a company to a single individual are illegal.\n\nRead more: Despite controversy, Delaware lawmakers OK changes to state's corporate law\n\nProponents said such agreements are common and must be preserved.\n\nCritics, including dozens of law professors across the country, argued that the bill, which ultimately passed, would hurt small investors and help only the biggest money movers in the economy, such as private equity firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk, who now has outsized influence as a close advisor of President Donald Trump, has continued his drumbeat against The First State.\n\n\"Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,\" Musk posted last week on X. \"Texas or Nevada actually respect shareholder rights.\"\n\nWho cares?\n\nAbout two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies call Delaware their legal home. Companies tend to favor Delaware\u2019s business-friendly reputation, tax structure and streamlined legal framework for settling corporate disputes.\n\nBut Delaware\u2019s status as a place to do business largely exists only on paper. Meta, Tesla or any other company moving their incorporation elsewhere won't register in the mind of the average Delawarean.\n\nHowever, it is a fundamental aspect that subsidizes much of Delaware's government function. That's because incorporations bring roughly a third of the state's government revenues each year in the form of taxes and fees related to the incorporation industry. This is part of the reason Delaware has no sales tax and relatively low property taxes.\n\nIt's also the foundation of Delaware's legal industry, a major employer in Wilmington and New Castle County.\n\nA few companies pulling their incorporation from Delaware's roster is also not particularly concerning financially for the state, however lawmakers pointed out the concern could snowball while discussing Musk last year.\n\n\"He'll leave, that's what, a quarter of million? But if he can convince others to do the same thing, eventually a quarter of a million becomes another million becomes 10 million, and then it becomes a problem,\" said a member of the General Assembly's Joint Finance Committee quizzing former Secretary of State Jeffrey Bullock last year.\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for newly elected Governor Matt Meyer pointed at an interview Meyer gave to Business Insider last week.\n\nIn the interview, he acknowledged a \u201ccompetitive environment,\u201d a need to \u201cwork to win back\u201d businesses that relocate their incorporation from Delaware and hinted at coming proposals aimed at that.\n\n\u201cMy role as governor is to look at the system, make sure the corporate law is fair, make sure it\u2019s predictable, make sure it\u2019s clear and consistent, and make sure we\u2019re making whatever changes are necessary\u201d to improve it, Meyer said in the interview.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.",

            "content": "WHAT IT IS\n\nMeta\u2019s Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH) tool is a system for mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation. ACH hardens platforms against regressions by generating undetected faults (mutants) in source code that are specific to a given area of concern and using those same mutants to generate tests. When applied to privacy, for example, ACH automates the process of searching for privacy-related faults and preventing them from entering our systems in the future, ultimately hardening our code bases to reduce risk of any privacy regression.\n\nACH automatically generates unit tests that target a particular kind of fault. We describe the faults we care about to ACH in plain text. The description can be incomplete, and even self-contradictory, yet ACH still generates tests that it proves will catch bugs of the kind described.\n\nTraditionally, automated test generation techniques sought merely to increase code coverage. As every tester knows, this is only part of the solution because increasing coverage doesn\u2019t necessarily find faults.\n\n\n\nACH is a radical departure from this tradition, because it targets specific faults, rather than uncovered code, although it often also increases coverage in the process of targeting faults. Furthermore, because ACH is founded on the principles of Assured LLM-based Software Engineering, it keeps verifiable assurances that its tests do catch the kind of faults described.\n\nOur new research paper, \u201cMutation-Guided LLM-based Test Generation at Meta,\u201d gives details of the underlying scientific foundations for ACH and how we apply ACH to privacy testing, but this approach can be applied to any sort of regression testing.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nMutation testing, where faults (mutants) are deliberately introduced into source code (using version control to keep them away from production) to assess how well an existing testing framework can detect these changes, has been researched for decades. But, despite this, mutation testing has remained difficult to deploy.\n\nIn earlier approaches, mutants themselves would be automatically generated (most often using a rule-based approach). But this method would result in mutants that weren\u2019t particularly realistic in terms of how much of a concern they actually represent.\n\nOn top of that, even with the mutants being automatically generated, humans would still have to manually write the tests that would kill the mutants (catch the faults).\n\nWriting these tests is a painstaking and laborious process. So engineers were faced with a two-pronged issue: Even after doing all of the work to write a test to catch a mutant, there was no guarantee the test would even catch the automatically-generated mutant.\n\nBy leveraging LLMs, we can generate mutants that represent realistic concerns and also save on human labor by generating tests to catch the faults automatically as well. ACH marries automated test generation techniques with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate mutants that are highly relevant to an area of testing concern as well as tests that are guaranteed to catch bugs that really matter.\n\nBroadly, ACH works in three steps:\n\nAn engineer describes the kind of bugs they\u2019re concerned about. ACH uses that description to automatically generate lots of bugs. ACH uses the generated bugs to automatically generate lots of tests that catch them.\n\nAt Meta we\u2019ve applied ACH-assisted testing to several of our platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Based on our own testing, we\u2019ve concluded that engineers found ACH useful for hardening code against specific concerns and found other benefits even when tests generated by ACH don\u2019t directly tackle a specific concern.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nMeta has a very large number of data systems and uses many different programming languages, frameworks, and services to power our family of apps and products. But, how are our thousands of engineers across the world ensuring that their code is reliable and won\u2019t generate bugs that would negatively impact application performance, leading to privacy risk? The answer lies with LLMs.\n\nLLM-based test generation and LLM-based mutant generation are not new, but this is the first time they\u2019ve been combined and deployed in large-scaled industrial systems. Generating mutants and the tests to kill them have been traditionally difficult processes to scale. Since LLMs are probabilistic and don\u2019t need to rely on rigidly defined rules to make decisions, they allow us to tackle both sides of this equation \u2013 generating mutations and tests to kill them \u2013 very efficiently and with a high level of accuracy.\n\nThis new approach significantly modernizes this form of automated test generation and helps software engineers take in concerns from a variety of sources (previous faults, colleagues, user requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) and efficiently convert them from freeform text into actionable tests \u2013 with the guarantee that the test will catch the fault they\u2019re looking for.\n\nACH can be applied to any class of faults and have a significant impact on hardening against future regressions and optimizing testing itself.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nOur novel approach combines LLM-based test generation and mutant generation to help automate complex technical organizational workflows in this space. This innovation has the potential to simplify risk assessments, reduce cognitive load for developers, and ultimately create a safer online ecosystem. We\u2019re committed to expanding deployment areas, developing methods to measure mutant relevance, and detecting existing faults to drive industry-wide adoption of automated test generation in compliance.\n\nWe will be sharing more developments and encourage you to watch this space.\n\nREAD THE PAPER\n\nMutation-Guided LLM-based Test Generation at Meta",

            "content": "Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) is one of the most successful and valuable companies in the world, but it may be known as much for its flops, as well as its wins.\n\nMeta's big bet on the metaverse hasn't gone well, and the company seems to have wasted billions or even tens of billions of dollars trying to make that happen. It likely overpaid for WhatsApp when it dropped $19 billion on the messaging app in 2014, and its biggest product successes in social media recently have been borrowed, like Stories from Snapchat and Reels from TikTok.\n\nNonetheless, the company has built the world's biggest social media platform and an advertising business that is only topped by Google Search, and that's made Meta an unstoppable cash cow. Now, after struggling to take VR headsets mainstream for roughly a decade, Meta now seems to have its best candidate for a legitimate hit product.\n\nAccording to The Verge, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that the company sold more than 1 million Meta AI glasses in 2024, the vision tech it teamed up with Ray-Ban to make.\n\nNow, Zuckerberg thinks glasses sales could go from 1 million to as high as 5 million this year.\n\nWhat smart glasses mean for Meta\n\nAdvertising makes up nearly all of Meta's revenue, and that's been the case for its entire history. In 2024, Meta generated $160.6 billion in ad revenue out of $164.5 billion in total revenue with $2.1 billion coming from Reality Labs, the division that includes AI products like its smart glasses.\n\nZuckerberg talked up the potential of the glasses on the earnings call, saying, \"Our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are a real hit.\" He also set the stakes for the new product, saying that 2025 would be the year that determines if the Meta AI glasses are the kind of product that can eventually sell hundreds of millions of units.\n\nFor years, Zuckerberg has insisted that the company needs to control the next computing platform after having had to play by Apple's rules in mobile and smartphones.\n\nAfter its bet on the metaverse flopped, the Meta AI glasses are now its best bet to own a meaningful hardware platform, whether it becomes the next dominant computing platform, gives Meta its own outlet into a number of other revenue streams, including games and its own version of the App Store, monetizing AI features, selling ads, and expanding the larger ecosystem around its social media platforms and engagement.\n\nZuckerberg is bullish enough on the AI glasses to say, \"It's kind of hard for me to imagine that a decade or more from now, all the glasses aren't going to basically be AI glasses.\"\n\nIs Meta stock a buy?\n\nMost of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have one primary business that makes up the bulk of its revenue, but that's especially true of Meta, given that advertising makes up nearly all of its revenue.\n\nDiversifying its business will make the company more resilient and give it another revenue stream that it can count on when digital advertising, which is a cyclical business, pulls back.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether Meta AI glasses will be the hit product that Zuckerberg hopes it is. Meta doesn't need the glasses to be a hit. The advertising business will continue to dwarf it for years to come, but finding a hardware platform could help take the stock to the next level.\n\nMeta stock is a buy with or without the glasses. The company enjoys a number of competitive advantages, including its massive user base, which drives its advertising business, and it trades at just a modest premium to the S&P 500, even though it's growing much faster than the index. However, building a mainstream hardware platform would justify the company's efforts in Reality Labs, and help drive growth in the business over the next decade. It would be a major win for the company if it can pull it off.",

The machine learning engineering manager at Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, leads Facebook\u2019s video recommendations quality ranking team.\n\nDharwadker\u2019s work focuses on improving the quality and integrity of video recommendations for billions of daily active users globally, balancing technical excellence with strategic vision. The IEEE senior member\u2019s pioneering work addresses the challenges of understanding user interests, optimizing content distribution, and mitigating biases that would otherwise skew recommendations results.\n\nAmey Dharwadker Employer: Meta in Menlo Park, Calif. Title: Machine learning engineering manager Member grade: Senior member Alma maters: National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India; Columbia National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India; Columbia\n\nHe has developed solutions such as the Conformity-Aware Ranking Model, which enhances recommendation accuracy by accounting for individual preferences and the effect that collective influences\u2014 such as a video going viral\u2014have on a single user\u2019s choices. Dharwadker and his team were also behind the Personalized Interest Exploration Framework, meant to broaden users\u2019 experiences by showing them diverse content that generally aligns with their individual preferences.\n\nFor his contributions, Dharwadker was named Search Professional of the Year last year by the Information Retrieval Specialist Group of the British Computer Society.\n\nDharwadker says he is pleased with the recognition but adds, \u201cThe technical complexity of delivering personalized video recommendations to billions of users, combined with the immediate and meaningful impact on how people discover and interact with content, is rewarding in and of itself.\u201d\n\nAn early problem solver\n\nBorn in Goa, India, Dharwadker was inspired by the region\u2019s natural beauty and cultural richness. His father, a surgeon, played a pivotal role in nurturing his interest in mathematics and science, emphasizing logical and analytical problem-solving skills. Dharwadker\u2019s early experiences ignited his passion for engineering and innovation, he says.\n\n\u201cI was always a curious child, constantly fascinated by how things worked,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved experimenting with simple science projects, like building circuits or creating makeshift models to visualize concepts I learned. This curiosity extended to understanding abstract concepts in science and mathematics, where I enjoyed figuring out the \u2018why\u2019 behind the \u2018how.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communication engineering in 2011 from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, in India\u2019s Tamil Nadu state. His undergraduate studies solidified his passion for applying computer vision and machine learning to solve real-world problems. Motivated to deepen his expertise, he pursued a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at Columbia, graduating in 2014.\n\nA pioneer in social media recommendations ranking\n\nDharwadker began his professional journey in 2011 at Analog Devices in Bengaluru, India. During his tenure there as an automotive vision software engineer, he developed real-time computer vision algorithms for advanced driver assistance systems, the technology used in most late-model cars. These systems include adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and automated lane assistance. His role allowed him to see the tangible impact of AI on safety and efficiency, setting the foundation for his future work.\n\nWhile completing his master\u2019s degree in 2014, Dharwadker interned at Facebook in Menlo Park, Calif., focusing on machine learning for Ads Ranking models so that users see the advertisements most relevant to them and advertisers maximize their investment.\n\nImpressed by the challenges and opportunities of building systems capable of analyzing user preferences and delivering personalized content to billions of users. Dharwadker joined Meta full time in January 2015 as a machine learning engineer working on the Facebook news feed ranking team. The group is behind the algorithms that determine the relevance and order of posts appearing on a user\u2019s feed. The team aims to prioritize the most engaging, meaningful, and important content for each user.\n\n\u201cLeadership is more than just a title. It\u2019s about uplifting those around you, amplifying voices that deserve to be heard, breaking down barriers for others to thrive, and multiplying the scale and impact of leaders by creating more of them.\u201d\n\nDharwadker\u2019s contributions to recommendation systems became transformative. He developed Embeddings for Feed and Pages, a patented and widely cited method for turning the content of a social media feed or page into a string of numbers that captures its essence. This innovation allows algorithms to identify similarities among pages for more accurate content grouping and enhanced personalized content recommendations.\n\nLater, as a technical leader, Dharwadker led the Facebook watch ranking team, which works on similar technologies as the news feed ranking team but focuses specifically on video content. The group drove advances in video recommendations for more than 1.25 billion monthly users.\n\nIn 2023 Dharwadker transitioned to his current position. His typical workday includes reviewing key metrics on video recommendation quality and engagement, guiding his team of machine learning engineers through architectural design reviews, and brainstorming solutions to technical challenges.\n\n\u201cAnother important aspect of my job,\u201d Dharwadker says, \u201cis mentoring engineers on my team via regular one-on-ones in which I focus on supporting their career growth.\u201d\n\nLeadership recognition and IEEE involvement\n\nDharwadker\u2019s work has earned global acclaim. In addition to the recognition from the British Computer Society, he was named the India Youth Engineering Icon of the Year by the Institution of Engineering and Technology in 2023. Also that year, he was presented the Outstanding Leadership Award at the Internet 2.0 Conference in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile continuing to advance his career, Dharwadker actively contributes to the engineering community as a passionate mentor. He says he aims to help foster a culture of engineering excellence and develop the next generation of experts in artificial intelligence and recommendation systems.\n\nHis involvement with IEEE began in 2009 during his undergraduate studies.\n\n\u201cI presented my first research paper at the IEEE India Council International Conference in 2010,\u201d he says. \u201cThat experience introduced me to the profound impact of IEEE\u2019s technical platforms and inspired my continued involvement.\u201d\n\nSince then, he says, he has viewed the organization as a platform for collaboration, learning, and professional growth.\n\nHe participates in the IEEE Computer Society and reviews research papers for the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence and IEEE Access journals.\n\nThe experience he\u2019s gained by mentoring up-and-coming professionals in his field through IEEE, he says, has helped him become a more effective manager at Meta.\n\nDharwadker\u2019s career is driven by curiosity, innovation, and a commitment to make a positive impact. He sums up his leadership philosophy this way: \u201cLeadership is more than just a title. It\u2019s about uplifting those around you, amplifying voices that deserve to be heard, breaking down barriers for others to thrive, and multiplying the scale and impact of leaders by creating more of them.\u201d",

When an image or video is created or significantly edited with our generative AI creative features in our advertiser marketing tools, a label will appear in the three-dot menu or next to the \u201cSponsored\u201d label.\u201d\n\nAs noted, Meta\u2019s working to improve these labels over time, with its current approach only applying to ads that have been \u201csignificantly\u201d edited using its own AI tools.\n\n\u201cIf an advertiser is using our in-house generative AI creative features and these tools do not result in significant edits to the image or video and do not include a photorealistic human, then we will not apply any AI labels.\u201d\n\nMeta doesn\u2019t define what qualifies as \u201csignificant\u201d in this respect, but the process adds an extra level of transparency to Meta-originated AI works.\n\nWell, ads at least. Meta\u2019s rules here don\u2019t apply in the same way to regular posts, which have become a source of confusion for many Facebook users.\n\nAs you can see, posts like this are generating big engagement in the app, with many users seemingly unaware, or unsuspecting of AI creation tools.\n\nThough many of these are also not created via Meta\u2019s own AI generators, which do come with a custom watermark.\n\nAnd Meta says that it\u2019s working on a solution for images created in other AI apps as well:\n\n\u201cProviding transparency around our home-grown generative AI tools is a first step on our ads generative AI transparency journey. This year, we also plan to share more information on our approach to labeling ad images made or edited with non-Meta generative AI tools. We will continue to evolve our approach to labeling AI-generated content in partnership with experts, advertisers, policy stakeholders and industry partners as people\u2019s expectations and the technology change.\u201d\n\nThat could be a big step in dispelling misinformation, and ensuring transparency with such images.\n\nOf course, Meta\u2019s specifically talking about paid promotions here, and it\u2019s not clear that the same qualifiers will be applied to regular posts. But hopefully, Meta\u2019s exploring solutions that will ensure greater transparency across all post types, where possible.\n\nGenerative AI tools are creating a lot of confusion, though not necessarily in the ways that many expected. The big concern, heading into last year\u2019s election cycle at least, was that AI deepfakes would be weaponized by political parties to sway voter opinions.\n\nAnd that has happened, but not to the degree that many anticipated, with most of the AI misrepresentation coming via trashy, like-bait images like the example above on FB, with users fishing for engagement, with a view, potentially, to onselling their Facebook Pages at a later stage.\n\nThat\u2019s less harmful, but it\u2019s still misleading, and it still degrades the broader Facebook experience.\n\nYet, at the same time, Meta continues to double down on its own AI creation tools, with prompts like this in your main feed.\n\nWhy anyone would want to create images like this, I don\u2019t know, but Meta seems determined to get more people using its Meta AI chatbot, as it seeks to make it the most used AI chatbot tool in the world.\n\nYet, at the same time, it\u2019s trying to provide more explainers on the legitimacy of images, because unlabeled AI pictures are misleading.\n\nAnd really, Meta could probably reduce the impact of such by not boosting these in-feed prompts at all, but the need to be the best seemingly outweighs the concern in this respect.\n\nWhich is one of the most confusing aspects of the AI push, that people have complained for years about the impact of bots in social apps, and how they negatively impact the human experience. Yet, now Meta wants to add more and more bots, and more fake content into the mix.\n\nIt seems confusing, and more a showcase of what can be done, as opposed to what\u2019s valuable. But as long as AI is the tech trend of the moment, that, I guess, will remain Meta\u2019s focus as well.",

CEO Mark Zuckerburg lifted sentiment during the earnings call when he said that the early success of DeepSeek\u2019s AI model had strengthened the company\u2019s conviction in its own open-source AI large language model, Llama.\n\nMeta shares have gained 20% since the start of 2025, making the stock the top performer over that stretch among the Magnificent Seven group of large-cap tech companies. The stock was up 0.9% at around $704 in recent trading and on pace to close at another record high Tuesday.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta's chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching out for.\n\nRising Wedge Breakout\n\nMeta shares trended higher within a six-month rising wedge before breaking out above the pattern\u2019s upper trendline last month on above-average volume.\n\nMoreover, the breakout has coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving above the 70 threshold, confirming bullish price momentum, but also cautioning overbought conditions in the stock.\n\nLet\u2019s apply technical analysis to forecast two potential bullish targets and also identify major support levels where the shares may encounter buying interest during pullbacks.\n\nBullish Price Targets to Watch\n\nMeasuring Principle\n\nTo project a short-term bullish target, investors can use the measuring principle, also known by chart watchers as a measured move.\n\nWhen applying the technique to Meta\u2019s chart, we calculate the distance between the rising wedge\u2019s two trendlines near their widest section and add that amount to the initial breakout point. For instance, we add $100 to $655, which forecasts a target of $755, a location where the shares could see profit-taking.\n\nBars Pattern Analysis\n\nBars pattern analysis helps investors project a longer-term upside target by studying prior trends to predict how a future directional move may play out.\n\nTo apply the tool, we take the stock\u2019s trending move from January to March last year and overlay it from last month\u2019s breakout point. This projects a target of around $935, a region on the chart sitting about 33% above current levels where investors may look to lock in profits.\n\nWe selected this trending period as it immediately followed a breakout from an earlier rising wedge pattern on the chart, potentially setting a playbook for how a similar directional move may play out.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Monitor\n\nThe first lower level to watch during pullbacks sits around $632. This location on the chart may provide support near the rising wedge pattern\u2019s lower trendline and the early-December and early- January peaks.\n\nFinally, selling below this level could see Meta shares revisit lower support around the psychological $600 level. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near a horizontal line that links a range of comparable price points on the chart between October and last month.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Instead, Meta will use a crowd-sourced system like X\u2019s Community Notes\u2014where approved users can add notes to posts to add context or correct mis- and disinformation. At the same time as the announcement, disinformation about wildfires in Los Angeles ran rampant on social media. It isn\u2019t just natural disasters and public health crises that are subject to online disinformation\u2014elections are also targeted. What happens on widely-used social media platforms matters, and it\u2019s worth asking what effect it will have, immediately and in the longer term, for Meta to cast aside its modest fact-checking efforts.\n\nWhat does science say about social media fact-checking and community notes?\n\nAccording to Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge who advised Facebook on its fact-checking program in 2022, \u201cStudies provide very consistent evidence that fact-checking does at least partially reduce misperceptions about false claims.\u201d However, another expert on misinformation, Jay Van Bavel from New York University, says that fact-checking is less effective when an event or issue is extremely polarizing. A 2019 meta-analysis that compared results of fact-checking across 30 individual studies found that while it has a positive overall influence on political beliefs, fact-checking\u2019s effectiveness depends on a person\u2019s preexisting ideology, beliefs, and knowledge. Overall, the science of fact-checking is complicated, but says that it can be effective in combatting the spread of misinformation.\n\nWhat about community notes? Are they effective? A 2024 study analyzed X\u2019s Community Notes program to see whether it lowered engagement with misinformation on the social media platform. While researchers did observe an increase in the number of fact-checks through Community Notes, they didn\u2019t find any evidence that Community Notes significantly reduced engagement with misleading posts. The study concluded that Community Notes \u201cmight be too slow to effectively reduce engagement with misinformation in the early (and most viral) stage of diffusion.\u201d Another study of X\u2019s Community Notes found that they were not effective in combating false narratives about the US election, and a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of accurate notes dispelling misleading election claims were never shown to users.\n\nWhile it is clear that mis- and disinformation interventions on social media platforms need improvement, abandoning fact-checking for Community Notes doesn\u2019t seem to be the answer.\n\nWhy is Meta back-pedaling?\n\nPolitical actors like President Trump and X owner Elon Musk have attacked social media fact-checking programs, claiming that these programs are biased and suppress free speech. Coming just ahead of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement has been described as an obvious capitulation to long-time political pressure from Trump and his supporters. After Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement, then-President-elect Donald Trump heralded the decision and said \u201cMeta, Facebook, I think they\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d For his part, Trump agrees that his criticism of social media platforms was \u201cprobably\u201d the reason for Meta\u2019s changes.\n\nMeta donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, recently appointed Trump supporter Dana White to its board of directors, and selected Republican lobbyist and longtime Facebook executive Joel Kaplan as its chief global affairs officer. In November, Zukerberg met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort after the election. In January, Zuckerberg\u2014alongside other tech CEOs and founders\u2014sat podium-side at President Trump\u2019s inauguration. As a side note: Elon Musk, owner of X and a member of the Trump administration, also scaled back the platform\u2019s moderation policies, and the company\u2019s approach is the template Meta platforms will use in implementing Community Notes.\n\nWhat does this mean for election mis- and disinformation?\n\nMeta started its fact-checking program in the wake of broad criticism about the level of mis- and disinformation about the 2016 election on its platforms. Following the attempted insurrection in 2021, Facebook suspended thousands of accounts and removed posts that supported the attack on the Capitol. Yet, after the deluge of mis- and disinformation concerning the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, social media platforms were largely unresponsive. Alongside his announcement about fact-checking, Zuckerberg also said that Meta is going to push more political content on its platforms, a reversal of prior moves to disincentivize politics.\n\nTech watchdog groups warn that Meta\u2019s decision to end its fact-checking program may result in a \u201csurge in disinformation.\u201d Valeria Wirtschafter of The Brookings Institution said the change was \u201clikely to make the information environment worse.\u201d One of the areas where mis- and disinformation thrives most is electoral politics. The Brookings Institution also argues that disinformation defined the 2024 election landscape by affecting how people perceived candidates and informing their views on issues such as immigration, crime, and the economy. In addition to \u201ctraditional\u201d mis- and disinformation content, new technological advances, such as AI, made creating and distributing this content easier than ever. Moreover, Brookings argues that misleading and false claims were effective in shaping public perceptions of the candidates and campaign issues. The 2024 election\u2019s intentional disinformation campaigns were so successful partly because they were widely shared on social media sites.\n\nUsers are wary of social media\u2014but millions rely on it for news\n\nThe public was not unaware of the role social media played in helping spread election disinformation. According to one poll, 65% of respondents said they thought the problem of election misinformation had gotten worse since 2020. And 71% said social media platforms should prioritize working to prevent false and misleading claims over unrestricted speech.\n\nRecent research by the Pew Research Center found that a little over half of US adults at least sometimes got their news from social media platform in 2024, a number that has risen in recent years. About one-third of American adults claimed to have regularly gotten news from either YouTube or from Facebook, a Meta platform covered by Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement.\n\nDisinformation also affects certain communities more than others. A 2024 Free Press poll found that Black and Latino respondents were more likely to access news on Facebook and YouTube. According to research by Onyx Impact, a nonprofit organization studying how disinformation targets Black Americans, at least 40 million Americans are targeted by disinformation in Black online spaces. Another study on disinformation online found that Black Americans are \u201cdisproportionately encountering misinformation.\u201d\n\nDisinformation is a danger to democracy\n\nDisinformation is critical to the election denial movement and is also at the heart of threats against election officials and administrators and high turnover in these positions. With Meta\u2019s (and potentially other social media companies) back-tracking, we should expect mis- and disinformation, including election-related content. Moreover, as I discussed in a previous blog, if President Trump follows the plans proposed by Project 2025, he could encourage Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to use anti-discrimination policies to penalize social media companies that do restrict or limit content related to \u201ccore political viewpoints.\u201d Project 2025 also supports civil suits against social media platforms that remove user-generated election disinformation from their platforms.\n\nWhat can you do?

            "content": "In Meta's CTO's leaked memo, he referenced the company's plan to launch \"half a dozen more AI powered wearables\".\n\nAndrew Bosworth's memo, which was leaked to Business Insider after apparently being shared with all Reality Labs staff back in November, was a rallying cry for 2025. In it, he told staff that this year will determine whether its hardware & metaverse division is \"the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure\".\n\nBut buried within the memo is also the mention of Meta's plan to launch half a dozen, six, more \"AI powered wearables\", seemingly referencing this year. So what could these be?\n\nOakley Meta Glasses\n\nTwo weeks ago, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to expand their smart glasses product lineup later this year with Oakley Meta glasses.\n\nGurman has a fairly strong track record of reporting Meta's moves in advance.\n\nWhile the Ray-Ban glasses have a camera on one side and are aimed towards all consumers, the Oakley glasses would have the camera in the center and be intended for \"cyclists and other athletes\", Gurman said.\n\nHUD Glasses\n\nThe Verge, The Information, The Financial Times, and Gurman have all previously reported that Meta intends to release smart glasses with a heads-up display (HUD), codenamed Hypernova, later this year.\n\nIt's still unclear whether or not these glasses will carry the Ray-Ban brand, but what is known is that they will include a small waveguide display on one of the lenses to show notifications, output text instead of audio from the Meta AI assistant, and to help frame photos before taking them.\n\nIn the same report in which he described the Oakley Meta glasses, Gurman says that Meta employees are telling him to expect Hypernova to cost around $1000. Further, he says Meta \"has discussed\" including the EMG wristband (demoed with the Orion prototype) in the box of Hypernova, with a backup plan of using touch controls on the temple like its other smart glasses.\n\nThe Neural Wristband\n\nAs mentioned, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Meta's HUD glasses may come with Meta's neural wristband.\n\nMeta has been working on this wristband since at least 2019, when it acquired a startup called CTRL Labs, and at Meta Connect 2024 it demoed its latest version of the band as the input device for the Orion AR glasses to select press and influencers.\n\nThe neural wristband leverages a technology called electromyography (EMG) that can track subtle finger movements by sensing muscle activation in your wrist.\n\nIn practice, this lets the wearer use their thumb as a virtual D-pad, without the need to be in view of any camera, letting you \"swipe, click, and scroll while keeping your arm resting comfortably by your side\". This would even work if your hand was in a jacket pocket, or any other scenario where it's completely occluded from the glasses.\n\nAround a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg said the neural wristband would ship as a product \"in the next few years\".\n\nMeta Buds?\n\nIn the same report in which Gurman described the Oakley Meta glasses and the apparent price and input device for Meta's HUD glasses, Gurman said Meta is also working on an AirPods competitor.\n\nGurman claims these Camera Buds, as they're called internally, would \"built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI\".\n\nHowever, he also says there have been \"snags\" with the device's development. \"It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device\", he writes, and Meta is still unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras. For these reasons, and because development is still early, Gurman expects Meta's earbuds \"likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years\".\n\nA Smartwatch?\n\nBack in 2021, The Verge's Alex Heath reported that Meta was working on a smartwatch. The device was said to have two cameras: one on the front for video calling, and one on the rear to be used as an action camera, as the main watch body would have been easily detachable from its frame.\n\nHeath's report said Meta planned to launch the watch in summer 2022 with a price of around $350. But just as that summer arrived, Bloomberg reported that Meta had canceled the watch, in a report that included apparent images of it.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the reason behind the cancelation was that the company discovered that the rear camera would have made it impossible to add neural sensing, electromyography (EMG), in future versions, which was its long-term plan.\n\nImages of the canceled Meta smartwatch, leaked to Bloomberg.\n\nTwo and a half years later, in the same report in which Mark Gurman described the Oakley Meta glasses and the apparent price and input device for Meta's HUD glasses, Gurman said that Meta had restarted work on a smartwatch.\n\n\"Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses\", Gurman wrote.\n\nWhat Else?\n\nSo far we've listed five likely candidates for hardware Bosworth was referring to. It's possible his mention of \"half a dozen\" was rough, rather than meaning precisely six, and these are all\n\nBut could there be something else on Meta's hardware roadmap that no one has yet predicted? We'll keep a close eye on the company for any hints or leaks at its hardware roadmap for 2025.",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a child, I felt different, but I didn't know why.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I found out I had ADHD \u2014 my mom took me for an evaluation after my teachers gave her feedback that I was sometimes disruptive.\n\nLater in my life, one of my wife's relatives suggested I had some autistic behaviors. As time went on, I read more about autism and became interested in getting an evaluation.\n\nFinding someone who evaluated adults was difficult, but I managed to get an evaluation in my late 30s. It confirmed I was autistic and also had sensory processing disorder. At the time, I was an engineer at Meta.\n\nI've worked in tech my entire career, including for Big Tech companies: Amazon, Meta, and Google. Though I haven't always known I'm autistic, looking back, I can see that it's impacted my ability to handle office politics and communicate in the workplace. However, my neuro differences have also come with superpowers that help me stand out as an employee.\n\nI've struggled to navigate the workplace because of my neuro differences\n\nI got my first full-time job in 2004, shortly after finishing a computer science degree. Multitasking can be difficult for autistic people, and unlike in school, where I had to manage multiple classes and tests, I found it relieving to enter the workforce and have one focus. I showed up, did my job, and went home.\n\nHowever, it wasn't clear to me how to approach job searching. I didn't know about salary expectations and didn't negotiate my first offer. I'm generally uncomfortable with conflict and wasn't willing to ask questions or look foolish. I feel like this is part of social differences related to autism.\n\nOnce I was in the workplace, I found navigating office politics challenging. Early on, I didn't know how to ask for more money or get promoted. I thought that if I kept working, things would go fine, which I now realize is naive.\n\nI joined Amazon in 2012 after a recruiter reached out to me. I hadn't worked at large tech companies in the past and wasn't used to rigorous processes around promotions.\n\nAt one point, I was trying to get promoted as an engineer, but there was always some reason it didn't work out. I think some of those gaps were about salespersonship \u2014 self-advocacy and visibility \u2014 and knowing the right people. I struggled with these things because of a lack of social and situational awareness.\n\nI felt I was doing good technical work and that if I solved senior engineer-worthy problems, then I was succeeding. However, I was often doing this in isolation, and I didn't understand the importance of showing other people or getting their input.\n\nIn 2021, I joined Meta as an engineer. They had a team-matching process, which I really struggled with. It took me months to find a team to join. I didn't know how to approach a new work environment. I'd been at Amazon for almost nine years. I knew how things worked and how to join a team there, whereas now I felt the expectations of me weren't very clear.\n\nI've been working at Google for the last 2 \u00bd years. Last year, I was in discussions with managers about improving my performance, and I felt like I was at risk of losing my job.\n\nWith autism, I notice that my performance ebbs and changes, and I can get tired quickly. Sometimes, this is because of autistic burnout, but outside this, if I'm struggling with a problem and don't know how to get help, it quickly exhausts me. I worked with a psychiatrist to try to build up my capacity, which I think helped me to overcome some of my challenges.\n\nI struggle to understand some requests. Like when asked to \"pull something out\" of a document, I wonder whether I'm meant to put that content in a new document or just remove it.\n\nI can be very verbose, thinking that if I provide a lot of extra detail when communicating, I won't be misunderstood. However, this can be distracting for others. One manager suggested I write a TLDR above my message, which has been helpful, but it's still a work in progress for me.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMy neuro differences have also helped me stand out in positive ways\n\nHyperfocus is one of the superpowers that comes with my neuro differences. Where other people might give up investigating a problem, I'll keep digging until I solve it because of my curiosity.\n\nI spend days digging into issues. If it's not high-priority, people can think I'm \"wasting\" time, but at times when I'd get all my tasks done and solve something additional, it would impress people. It's distinguished me from others during my career.\n\nSince I see things differently when it comes to problem-solving, I often make suggestions when reviewing other people's work. Being able to identify unseen problems is a very valuable skill in my line of work.\n\nHowever, I've had to learn to get better at communicating those suggestions in a way that can be heard since I've been told I'm too blunt or inflexible when giving feedback.\n\nGetting support is crucial for people with neuro differences\n\nI'm part of a group for autistic individuals at Google. Having support and asking if others have experienced similar problems to me is helpful. You don't have to have an official diagnosis to be a part of groups like this, but getting an evaluation was empowering for me to feel I belonged.\n\nI also use other resources like occupational therapy and psychiatry for support with different aspects of my neuro differences.\n\nIf you have neuro differences, finding support is critical. Learning about yourself and how to support yourself can be really powerful.\n\nIt's exhausting to think you just need to work harder and be like everyone else to succeed.\n\nDo you have a Big Tech career story you'd like to share?

It levels the playing field, giving people access to powerful and often expensive technology for free, which enables competition and innovation that produce tools that benefit individuals, society and the economy. Open sourcing AI is not optional; it is essential for cementing America\u2019s position as a leader in technological innovation, economic growth and national security. In this fiercely competitive global landscape, the race to develop robust AI ecosystems is intensifying, driving rapid innovation and superior solutions. By championing a balanced approach to risk assessment that encourages innovation, the U.S. can ensure that its AI development remains competitive, thereby securing the transformative benefits of AI for the future.\n\nThe Framework\n\nOur Frontier AI Framework focuses on the most critical risks in the areas of cybersecurity threats and risks from chemical and biological weapons. By prioritizing these areas, we can work to protect national security while promoting innovation. Our framework outlines a number of processes we follow to anticipate and mitigate risk when developing frontier AI systems, for example:\n\nIdentifying catastrophic outcomes to prevent: Our framework identifies potential catastrophic outcomes related to cyber, chemical and biological risks that we strive to prevent. It focuses on evaluating whether these catastrophic outcomes are enabled by technological advances and, if so, identifying ways to mitigate those risks.\n\nThreat modeling exercises : We conduct threat modeling exercises to anticipate how different actors might seek to misuse frontier AI to produce those catastrophic outcomes, working with external experts as necessary. These exercises are fundamental to our outcomes-led approach.\n\nEstablishing risk thresholds: We define risk thresholds based on the extent to which our models facilitate the threat scenarios. We have processes in place to keep risks within acceptable levels, including applying mitigations.\n\nOur open source approach also helps us to better anticipate and mitigate risk because it enables us to learn from the broader community\u2019s independent assessments of our models\u2019 capabilities. This process improves the efficacy and trustworthiness of our models and contributes to better risk evaluation in the field. In addition to evaluating catastrophic risk, our framework takes into account the benefits of the technology we\u2019re developing.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile the focus of this framework is to help mitigate severe risks, it\u2019s important to remember that the primary reason we\u2019re developing these technologies is because they have the potential to greatly benefit society.\n\nWe hope that by sharing our current approach to responsible development of advanced AI systems, we can provide insight into our decision-making processes and advance discussions and research about how to improve AI evaluation, with regards to both risks and benefits. As AI technology progresses, we will continue to evolve and refine our approach.\n\n",

The organization was also locked out of Facebook and briefly suspended from Instagram.\n\nThe experience mirrors that of other medication abortion organizations, such as telehealth clinic Hey Jane, whose spokesperson told the Guardian that Instagram made its posts harder to find. Other groups, Women Help Women and Just the Pill, told the New York Times their accounts were suspended and restored.\n\n\u201cI am also troubled by the timing of these events,\u201d said Gallego, in the letter. \u201cTaken together, Meta\u2019s decision to end fact-checking, while simultaneously restricting access to content related to abortion, looks like a calculated move to avoid the ire of President Trump, a well-known opponent of both abortion and attempts to limit mis- and disinformation.\u201d\n\nGallego asks Meta for its \u201crationale\u201d for removing content related to abortion; why it was removed \u201cspecifically in the weeks\u201d following Trump\u2019s election victory, and whether the removals were in \u201cspecific states\u201d or nationally.\n\nIn a statement, a Meta spokesperson told the Guardian when the removals were first reported: \u201cThese groups encountered both correct enforcement and a variety of issues, including over enforcement and a technical bug, that resulted in the blurring of some posts. But we\u2019ve been quite clear in recent weeks that we want to allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes \u2013 and we\u2019re committed to doing that.\u201d",

            "content": "Following its recent Q1 earnings report, news emerged highlighting how Meta is again doubling down investments in immersive technology highlighting its ongoing $100 billion spending plan for its XR product portfolio, which includes augmented reality smart glasses, virtual reality headsets, mixed reality Quest, and metaverse services.\n\nThe news comes as Samsung drops an increasing amount of Moohan information, an XR headset due to release this year. Last year, Meta debuted Quest 3s, a low-cost MR headset, and the Ray-Ban AR-lite smart glasses, with the latter proving a massive sales success for the firm, according to reports from last year. So, it appears the competition is continuing to rise.\n\nNow, following a busy January for XR, which also included Samsung\u2019s continued unveiling of Moohan and CES XR announcements, Meta is claiming its stakes in the XR world \u2013 a space Meta has had a tentpole in for years.\n\nThe second half of the decade may prove fruitful for XR and the companies leading it as AR smart glasses and other related technologies continue incubating in the workplace and consumer market. Moreover, this is only supercharged by the AI landscape, which is helping to create XR content, use cases, and democratization \u2013 another technology market Meta is investing in.\n\nWhat Did Zuckerberg Say About AI Smart Glasses?\n\nIn addition to the reported $100 billion XR investment, Mark Zuckerberg spoke on the past year\u2019s success at distributing Ray Ban Meta AI smart glasses, which include AR-lite features and appear to be a testbed for emerging AR smart glasses features like translation visualizations.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, noted:\n\nOur Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are a real hit, and this will be the year when we understand the trajectory for AI glasses as a category. Many breakout products in the history of consumer electronics have sold 5-10 million units in their third generation. This will be a defining year that determines if we\u2019re on a path towards many hundreds of millions and eventually billions of AI glasses \u2014 and glasses being the next computing platform like we\u2019ve been talking about for some time \u2014 or if this is just going to be a longer grind.\n\nMoreover, Zuckerberg explained that smart glasses are \u201cthe perfect form factor for AI,\u201d a revealing quote as this may indicate Meta\u2019s view of the marriage between AI and XR, which is a continued combined interest of Zuckerberg\u2019s firm.\n\n\u201cI expect this to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,\u201d Zuckerberg added. AR-ready smart glasses look to be an entry to that future.\n\nZuckerberg explained:\n\nWe have a really exciting roadmap for this year with a unique vision focused on personalization. We believe that people don\u2019t all want to use the same AI \u2014 people want their AI to be personalized to their context, their interests, their personality, their culture, and how they think about the world. \u2013 People will get to choose how AI works and looks like for them. I continue to think that this is going to be one of the most transformative products that we\u2019ve made.\n\nThe road towards personalized, agentic AI systems will be a busy one. Many firms are jumping into the market from many angles. As mentioned, Samsung is also combining AI and AR with the Moohan device, and Apple is looming in the background with Vision Pro\u2014but not AR smart glasses, as reports recently revealed.\n\nMeta is investing $60-65 billion into AI infrastructure alongside the massive $100 billion XR investment, so the stakes are high for Zuckerberg. As also shown by the DeepSeek effect on NVIDIA stocks, the future is not sown, and the market can change dramatically.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put together a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years,\u201d remarked Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg of Broader XR Investments\n\nThe investments in Meta\u2019s XR portfolio are not just due to the success of its smart glasses; the firm made this investment to boost its MR headset products and metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe metaverse was once the hottest technology topic in a post-COVID landscape, where immersive shared spaces were posied by hopefuls as the future of work and socialisation- a promise perhaps inflated due to the remote working boom and isolation of many. Therefore, leading emerging technology providers to market an exciting new way for dispersed individuals to connect.\n\nWhile online shared virtual applications\u2014hence metaverse solutions\u2014still have traction for specific use cases, the first hype wave no doubt slowed down as AR and AI took their place in the emerging technology space.\n\nHowever, Meta is not yet done with the metaverse. \u201cThis is also going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse,\u201d proclaimed Zuckerberg, who also added:\n\nThe number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing \u2014 and this is the year when a number of long-term investments that we\u2019ve been working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land. I think we\u2019re going to know a lot more about Horizon\u2019s trajectory by the end of this year.\n\nIn closing, Zuckerberg explained that Meta is accelerating its efforts towards building \u201csome awesome things that shape the future of human connection. As always, I\u2019m grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us.\u201d",

She told Business Insider she'd initially focus on creators who develop inside its virtual-reality game Horizon Worlds and other metaverse apps.\n\nShe plans to hire a team of developer advocates, community leaders, and program managers to host hackathons, attend third-party events, and run competitions and other community programs. Nayyer said that over time the work would expand into other parts of the division, such as augmented reality.\n\n\"A lot of what my focus is going to be on is essentially growing our developer creator ecosystem,\" she said. \"Bringing on creators, builders, developers onto the Meta platform. Helping them learn about our products, about our tools, and just getting them into our various creator programs.\"\n\nNayyer was previously TikTok's head of creator programs.\n\nA recent internal memo from Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, viewed by BI indicates that Meta sees 2025 as a critical year for its metaverse work. Bosworth called out Horizon Worlds as an area of focus, saying that platform would need to \"break out\" for the company's long-term plans to come to fruition.\n\nHorizon Worlds offers a mix of games, live events, and social features for Meta's Quest VR headsets as well as mobile and desktop devices. In September, Aigerim Shorman, a vice president of product, said that usage of the Horizon platform was up \"5x compared to last year\" and that Horizon Worlds was a top-five app on the Quest 3 as measured by weekly users.\n\nThe company told investors during last week's fourth-quarter earnings that its Reality Labs unit hit $1.08 billion in revenue in the period. It expects operating losses in the division to increase in 2025, as they did in 2024.\n\nNayyer, who joined Meta last month, said her team would focus on driving up engagement from the metaverse developer community.\n\nAt TikTok, Nayyer worked on creator product marketing, partnerships, and community development, as well as its diversity, equity, and inclusion programming. Before that, Nayyer worked on community marketing at Twitch.\n\nMeta and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

            "content": "Jan. 27 was a wild day in the stock market as investors reacted to Chinese start-up DeepSeek's R1 \"reasoning\" model that competes with OpenAI's o1 model.\n\nSemiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA -0.14%), Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- which constitute over $5 trillion in combined market cap -- fell between 13% and 17% in a single session.\n\nBut outside of chip stocks and some artificial intelligence (AI)-focused companies, the rest of the market largely held up. In fact, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) jumped 3%. And Meta Platforms (META -4.67%), which is one of the largest investors in AI, gained 2%.\n\nHere's a look at how markets are reacting to DeepSeek's impact on AI and why Meta Platforms stands out as a top AI stock to buy now.\n\nAI efficiency improvements\n\nReports indicate that DeepSeek was able to build its model at a far lower cost than OpenAI's solution, which led to fears of slowing demand for AI infrastructure like Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) or Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits. The news marks a potential step change in the way AI investments are viewed.\n\nThe Donald Trump-backed $500 billion Stargate AI project is tasked with building out data centers to support AI workflows. Microsoft is on track to spend around $80 billion on AI in fiscal 2025. If highly sophisticated AI tools can be built fairly inexpensively, more scrutiny may be warranted on AI spending. And investors won't applaud a company just because it is throwing money at AI.\n\nHowever, a subsequent 9% rebound in Nvidia the following day on Jan. 28 came as some investors and analysts viewed efficiency improvements as a net positive, arguing that overall compute demand could increase if AI became more affordable for smaller companies.\n\nA similar comparison would be the price of an iPhone over time. When the iPhone first came out in 2007, it cost $499 for the 4 GB version and $599 for the 8 GB model. Inflation-adjusted, that cost is closer to $780 for the 4 GB and $930 for the 8 GB. But the new iPhone 16 starts at just $799, so the cost of an iPhone has stayed about the same since its release despite product innovation and exponential storage increases. Rather, Apple has grown by several folds since then, both in terms of earnings and the stock price, because the iPhone became a consumer staple and Apple expanded its ecosystem across accessories and services. The same could occur with Nvidia. If the market for its products grows, Nvidia won't need to rely so much on pricing power, which could benefit the company long-term.\n\nAs of market close on Jan. 24, Apple was the worst-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average year to date. So a rebound in Apple, which may be viewed as less of a pure AI play than companies like Nvidia, makes some sense. But what may come as a surprise is Meta, which blasted to a new all-time high on Tuesday.\n\nMeta is a compelling AI play\n\nIn October, I predicted that Meta would be worth more than Alphabet and Amazon by 2026, which I still think will happen.\n\nMeta is one of the clearest examples of AI fueling rapid growth and margin expansion. AI is instrumental in Meta's algorithms for delivering engaging content to users so they stay on the platform longer and, therefore, see more ads. Meta AI is also helpful for creators to customize content, engage with their audiences, and more.\n\nSo although Meta is spending a substantial amount of money on research and development (R&D), it is still growing its revenue and operating income at a breakneck pace. Meta has operating margins around 40%, even considering around 27 cents for every dollar in revenue goes toward R&D.\n\nThe results are even more impressive once factoring in steep (and growing) losses from Meta's Reality Labs division, which makes hardware and metaverse software, and invests in AI.\n\nMeta has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 31.8 and a forward P/E of 26.5, which is a reasonable valuation for a high-octane growth stock. But again, the valuation is even more attractive once considering Reality Labs' impact on earnings.\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2024, Meta lost $12.76 billion on Reality Labs and reported net income of $41.52 billion. So if you take out Reality Labs, the amount that investors are paying for the rest of Meta (the advertising business) is actually dirt cheap.\n\nInvesting in AI stocks\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia is a painful reminder of the importance of knowing what you own and why you own it, and aligning your investments with your risk tolerance.\n\nNvidia is a phenomenal, highly innovative company. But its value is also based on continued rapid earnings growth. Meta isn't expected to grow earnings as quickly as Nvidia and is a better value.\n\nStill, Nvidia could be worth owning if you have a high risk tolerance and believe in the long-term investment thesis. But the stock could continue to be highly volatile while investors re-evaluate Nvidia's role in the future of AI.",

And as a little cherry on top, Meta announced it\u2019s creating a limited edition Super Bowl version of the glasses that won\u2019t be for sale to the general public.\n\nYou can already watch the first of the two Super Bowl ads, which features Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt causing chaos in Kris Jenner\u2019s personal art collection. The actors are shown asking the Meta AI to identify art pieces, as well as translate foreign languages. Jenner, meanwhile, is shown asking the AI glasses to ring up her lawyer after an incident with a $6.2 million banana.\n\nThis is the second time Meta has created a limited edition pair tied to an event. Image: Meta\n\nIn a blog about the ads, Meta says the limited edition glasses will be a pair of matte black Wayfarers with either gold, mirror-like lenses or lenses featuring the team colors of the Super Bowl finalists. The glasses will also come with a custom-etched case. However, they won\u2019t be available for purchase, hinting that these will likely be seeded to celebrities and influencers to drum up buzz.\n\nThere are a couple things at play here. For starters, smart glasses have come a long way with the public from the debacle that was Google Glass. Meta announced last week that the Ray-Bans have sold over 1 million units in 2024. That\u2019s the type of success for an emerging gadget category that could justify an expensive Super Bowl ad. Second, Meta has recently shown it\u2019s keen on pushing that success further using new styles and limited edition versions, not unlike how Nike or other sneaker companies create hype. Meta will purportedly release Oakley-branded smart glasses later this year for athletes, and last year, it also had a limited-edition translucent model of the Ray-Bans for its Meta Connect event.",

But again, Threads is adding new stuff every week, and as such, there may well be functions that you\u2019re not clear on, or didn\u2019t even know existed.\n\nLike, did you know that you can share custom feeds in the app?\n\nThe guide also includes some basic algorithm notes, and an explainer of the most influential actions that you can take:\n\n\u201cYour \u2018like\u2019 activity is used to provide similar content to match what you like or are interested in, and what you see in your For You feed is personalized to you based on a number of signals, such as accounts and posts you have interacted with in the past on both Threads and Instagram.\u201d\n\nI still don\u2019t like the fact that your Threads experience is linked to your IG activity, as I think most people use both apps very differently, though the Threads team is working to separate the two over time.\n\nThreads also has a more in-depth algorithm overview available on its creator tips page, which notes the key algorithm factors in more detail:\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to ensure that you\u2019re across all of the latest Threads elements, and that you\u2019re making best use of the app, it\u2019s worth taking a look at these resources, and refining your strategy accordingly.\n\nAnd with 320 million active users, and rising, it is worth considering. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg remains confident that Threads will become the next billion-user app, and if that ends up being the case, you will want to be involved.\n\nCould be worth taking the time to set yourself up for success now.\n\nYou can check out Meta\u2019s various Threads guides and usage tips here.",

            "content": "Meta Platforms' (META -4.67%) share price rose after the social media company released strong fourth-quarter results, once again showing that its social media sites are top destinations for both users and advertisers. The company also remained committed to spending big on artificial intelligence (AI). The stock has been off to a fast start in 2025, with its shares already up 17% as of this writing.\n\nLet's examine Meta's Q4 earnings and guidance to see if its stock is still a good investment.\n\nAI is helping power results\n\nMeta turned in another great quarter to close out 2024, with revenue climbing 21% year over year to $48.4 billion. Advertising revenue was also up 21%, coming in at $46.8 billion. Revenue at Reality Labs, which is home to Meta's metaverse efforts and its augmented reality headsets and smart glasses, edged up 1% to $1.1 billion. Operating income from its social media apps surged 35% to $28.3 billion, though Reality Labs generated a loss of $5 billion.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) soared 50% year over year to $8.02. The results easily topped the analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG, for revenue of $47 billion and EPS of $6.77.\n\nFamily daily active people (DAP), a measurement of registered users who log in to one of Meta's apps on a daily basis, rose 5% year over year to 3.35 billion in December; that was just above analyst expectations for 3.32 billion. Family average revenue per person (ARPP), meanwhile, jumped nearly 16% to $14.25.\n\nAd impressions increased 6% year over year, while the average price per ad jumped 14%. This shows that Meta is continuing to add more users and continuing to better monetize its user base, by serving them more ads and being able to charge more to advertisers. This stems from increasing advertiser demand driven by ad performance.\n\nMeta's newest app Threads reached 320 million monthly active users at year-end, and the platform continues to add about 1 million users a day. The company plans to introduce ads gradually to the platform, but it won't be a meaningful contributor this year.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta forecasts first-quarter revenue to be between $39.5 billion and $41.8 billion, for growth of 8% to 15% year over year. The midpoint of $40.7 billion was below the $41.7 billion analyst consensus. Meta forecast full-year 2025 capital expenditures to range from $60 billion to $65 billion, which is a big jump from the $39.2 billion it spent in 2024. Much of this will be directed toward increasing AI capacity and data center expansion; the company believes that building out its own AI infrastructure will be a strategic advantage. Currently, 700 million people actively use Meta AI each month, and it expects this to reach 1 billion users this year.\n\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg expects Meta AI to become the world's leading AI assistant. He noted that the Llama large language model (LLM) is reaching scale; he sees the newest version, Llama 4, as being transformative, having both agentic AI and multimodal features. In addition, the company is investing in custom AI chips for specific workloads to improve efficiency.\n\nIs it time to buy Meta stock?\n\nDespite the news regarding DeepSeek and what it might mean for spending on AI and advanced semiconductor chips, Zuckerberg has said Meta is not backing down from its AI spending plans. He thinks investing in AI infrastructure will be a big advantage, both in the quality of the service and in being able to achieve the scale it wants to reach. He said that everyone could learn that this investing isn't an advantage after all, but that it's way too early to say that now. Meanwhile, the company seems to have some pretty big plans with Llama 4.\n\nAt the same time, Meta's core platforms are humming along, with both increased engagement for users and improved monetization. This quarter once again showed that Meta is one of the best companies at monetizing its user base through advertising. Just as important, it looks like it's in the process of building its next big platform with Threads. Zuckerberg has been a master of building audiences and then later monetizing them, so this is a big opportunity down the road.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Meta stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 24, based on 2025 analyst estimates. Given its revenue growth of over 20% and its strong business model, that's a pretty attractive valuation.\n\nAs one of the leading digital advertising companies in the world and one with big investments in AI, Meta Platforms is likely to remain a solid long-term winner. The company also continues to invest in the metaverse, which adds some optionality should that ever live up to Zuckerberg's vision.\n\nAt current levels, I think the stock is a buy.",

In response, Riot Games, the creator of League, did what any professional sports governance body would obviously do, and made sweeping changes to the game itself. Not only did they make changes affecting all online players like overhauling the game\u2019s map (effectively the playing field), it\u2019s gold generation mechanisms (somewhat of a scoring analog), but they also created a completely new champion drafting structure for competitive play. It was like they decided to change the dimensions of a basketball court, add a 2.5-point line, and change how teams can field a set of players in one go.\n\nIt\u2019s insane how big LoL is in China. It\u2019s also wild a professional esport can garner similar championship viewership numbers to the NBA, NHL, and (almost) the MLB across the rest of the world. Source: LoL Esports\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, changes of this magnitude happen to League nearly every other year, and it\u2019s a cycle that is relatively common among esports like League, Fortnite, and Overwatch. The frequent changes (in theory) help the game itself stay fresh and maintain popularity despite a highly dynamic backdrop of fandom and attention. Like most sports, every season of League generates new storylines for individual players and teams, but each season also ushers in new storylines related to the underlying game (or esport) itself, the combination of which dramatically shift the overarching strategies and styles of play that teams employ to win, collectively known as the \u201cmeta,\u201d short for \u201cmetagame.\u201d\n\nIn somewhat of a roundabout way, it\u2019s useful to think about the concept of the meta by focusing on what alters it\u2014 what forces lead to changes in the way that teams deploy strategies and play styles, either rapidly, or slowly over time. There may be some additional facets that fall on the edges or outside these buckets, but I think most changes in the meta for a given sport are driven by five distinct factors:\n\nThe Rules of the Game. Scoring system, playing field dimensions, ball type, penalties, rewards, obstacles, race distance, number of players, communication modes, etc. Effectively all the facets that define the sport either globally or within a specific league. The Rules of the League. Number of teams/competitors, season structure, financial incentives, talent acquisition mechanisms, TV rights, etc. In essence, how the governing body organizes individual instances of the game into a formal structure to determine winners and losers and manage the teams and athletes. The Active Players. What are the active players capable of doing, how many are there, what\u2019s their skill distribution, how much money they demand, etc. Including advances in available technology through equipment and gear, what are individual athletes and the collective capable of achieving? The Active Strategists. How strategic, creative, adaptive, disciplined, calculating, and insightful are the active strategists, in relation to both the rules of the game, and the rules of the league (i.e. coaches and GMs). Similar to active players, the tools that strategists have change over time. Pure Innovation. At some point, someone was the first person to look at a narrow piece of paper and think \u201cI\u2019m going to use this to mark a page in my book,\u201d and someone also thought \u201cwhat if we threw the football\u201d for the first time. Breakthroughs and inventions happen with the same set of constraints and tools all the time, and it\u2019s no different in sports.\n\nIf you look at this list, you might notice that the rate of change in some of these areas is more dramatic in certain sports, which plays to their strengths and weaknesses as entertainment properties. For instance, the NFL has very short average careers, so the set of active players changes more quickly than a league like the PGA Tour, and European soccer can be quite exciting because teams can play in multiple leagues that each deploy different overarching rules and formats like the EPL, FA Cup, and Champion\u2019s League. Even pure innovation can be more easily generated in certain sports. To reuse a previous example, I think the sport of football promotes much more novelty in-game plays than a golf tournament does.\n\nIn the process of trying to create a meta that retains fans and drives entertainment, leagues can take a very active or a passive role. In general, I think the more a league relies on the passive approach for changes to come from Pure Innovation within the same set of confines over time, the more stale a game can feel in the long run. On the flip side, leagues with active, dynamic rule changes and higher turnover of star athletes and coaches can feel constantly fresher.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s interesting about most traditional pro sports leagues is that they often eschew the prospect of major rule changes from the list of options to change the meta of the game. We\u2019ll loop back to why this might be, and why that might change in the near future, but I first want to dig into some examples of both intentional and unintentional examples of decisions that lead to the current meta in modern sports.\n\nPerhaps one of the most publicized recent examples, the NBA\u2019s meta has been completely overwhelmed by the rise of the three-point shot, a shift driven by both the Rules of the Game and the Active Strategists, in particular through advancements in analytics. The three point line wasn\u2019t introduced to the NBA until 1979, and admittedly it took a long time for the three-pointer to become the cornerstone of strategy in the league. Teams like the Golden State Warriors really only started to employ a three-point-first strategy in the 2010\u2019s, and additional rules like more stringent hand check and landing zone foul calls have added fuel to the fire.\n\nI wonder what this chart would look like for 2023-2024. I have to imagine even fewer shots are taken inside the paint now! Source: Kirk Goldsberry.\n\nThe rise of three-point-centric teams has prompted some other changes to the league as a result, and created a positive feedback loop centered on the three. You see a lot more smaller, more agile players in the game, and even dominant interior players like Nikola Jokic are proficient three-point shooters now (even if it looks ugly sometimes)\u2014 the Active Players are reinforcing the current meta. It\u2019s to the point now where fans and media pundits are starting to decry the entertainment level of the sport. The NBA is now considering how to reduce the amount of time players spend taking three pointers in a game, to speed up games, and it will be interesting to see how quickly they act\u2014 I for one would highly recommend swift action, especially with some waning popularity for the league.\n\nPerhaps in contrast to the NBA, I think the NFL has done an extremely good job maintaining general parity in its product, in part due to the Rules of the League. The NFL introduced the salary cap in 1994, which has redefined team-building strategies multiple times over at this point as different positions become more and less valuable. With a hard cap in place, franchises are more heavily reliant on strong rookie contracts and quarterback value. The quarterback already might have been the singular most impactful position in all of sports due to football\u2019s rules, and as the set of high-quality Active Players at positions like running back and on defense increases, it means that emphasis is placed on roles with less equality like the quarterback.\n\nIn addition, the modern NFL has nurtured the rise of the passing game through rule changes that protect receivers and QB\u2019s (often times contentiously) relative to the past when players like Marvin Harrison were reaping souls. Mobile quarterbacks and offensive schemes that employ the run-pass option (RPO) have also been furthered by the rise of QB protections while running in the open field, but are certainly the result of the Active Players today too. QB\u2019s like Donavan McNabb and Michael Vick were precursors for a now common rushing QB profile with athletes like Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, and Jayden Daniels adding mobility to the position\u2014 which in turn has implications on the defensive strategies. In general, I am impressed with the NFL\u2019s ability to have a game whose meta shifts without significant rule changes (aside from safety-related tweaks like the new kick-off rules introduced this season)!\n\nOn the ice, the NHL\u2019s meta has shifted most teams away from big bruising players towards smaller players with higher speed and skill, driven by changes in both the Active Players and the Rules of the Game. Post-2005 adjustments, such as eliminating the two-line pass rule and enforcing stricter penalties for hooking, opened up the ice for faster, more agile players. Even changes to icing rules and players\u2019 own ability to flip pucks out of the zone in the air have changed the style of play in the league! Coupled with advancements in skate and stick technology, the modern NHL favors players like Connor McDavid and Cale Makar, who thrive on explosive speed and finesse. Of course there are still bruisers on lower offensive and defensive lines, but it\u2019s much rarer to have a full teams of goons up and down the roster.\n\nDespite all my conjecture, I\u2019m not sure how you encourage a meta in the NHL where players are jumping into the stands to fight fans again. Source .\n\nPerhaps the biggest, most broad impact in hockey has been the evolution of goalie equipment and the rules governing it, though. If you watch footage of a goalie in small rudimentary pads from the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s trying to play, it looks comical. They are all over the place trying to close the gap between the offensive player and themselves because their surface area coverage was so much lower than it is today, almost like a soccer goalie. Modern advances in pad, helmet, and even skate tech have made goalies able to physically wear more gear, and the NHL allows larger pads and sticks than in the past as well. In this instance the Rules of the Game hold a lot of power. It\u2019s pretty wild to think about how much the game would change if goalie pads were restricted to 75% the size they are now.\n\nSimilar to the recent decrying of the current meta in the NBA, the MLB\u2019s current strategic landscape is often panned. Of course, Active Strategists changed the game with \u201cMoney Ball\u201d analytics that revolutionized strategic thinking and minimized traditional practices like the sacrifice bunt and increased the use of shifts (until they were banned). Moneyball\u2019s data-driven approach has led to the current meta where teams to prioritize home runs, walks, and strikeouts. This \"Three True Outcomes\" (TTO) philosophy now dominates, and it has led to a very different play style with fewer runners on base throughout the course of a game.\n\nDespite some recent plateauing due to intentional changes in the baseball itself and enforcing tacky substance inspections, TTO and strikeout outcomes have risen dramatically since 2000. Source: The Ringer .\n\nWhen this philosophy is paired with the landscape of Active Players, namely pitchers throwing the ball better than any time in history, its impact on the meta is amplified\u2014 on the rare chance you make contact with the ball well, it might as well be a swing for the fences. As a result, launch-angle hitting and player strength batting have become somewhat prioritized over other facets like fielding. Of course, players trying hit for home runs more specifically has changed the way pitchers play in return, so they have developed new pitch arsenals to counter these trends, and teams even manage bull pens completely differently than they did five years ago. This interplay mirrors the constant \"meta-breaking,\u201d or \u201ccountering\u201d efforts seen in esports, where strategies are developed to exploit the dominant play-style of the moment. These types of changes are often the result of Pure Innovation or brought on by the rise of a single new dominant player (like Shohei Ohtani).\n\nOutside the world of team sports, the set of Active Players (riders), and technological advances they wield in terms of nutrition and aerodynamics have changed the sport of cycling completely. Nowadays, even major races are won by one dominant rider going out on a solo effort for over half an hour in front of a large pack of riders\u2014 something rarely even dreamed about even 15 years ago. Riders like Pogacar, Van der Poel, Evenepoel, and many others are peaking for specific races at such a high level that they can leverage modern bike technology to effectively ride as fast as the peloton for an extended period of time. Of course, a coach or director did need to craft this go-it-alone strategy, but its pervasiveness is likely more so the result of the talent in the sport right now. If you ever have a free 60 minutes, I recommend watching this video of Filippo Ganna setting the world record for most distance covered on a bike in an hour to see the technology and athletic strength modern riders use:\n\nIf there\u2019s one extremely clear takeaway from all these examples, it\u2019s that the concept of the \"meta\" and its change over time are certainly not confined to esports but is a universal aspect of competitive activities. Whether in League of Legends or the NFL, the pursuit of optimized strategies within the constraints of rules and resources underscores the dynamic nature of the competition itself. By recognizing, adapting, and creating shifting metas, both esports and traditional sports continue to evolve, ideally ensuring both popularity and longevity for the games and leagues themselves.\n\nWhich brings us all the way back to one of the underlying questions in this article\u2014 what the end goal in trying to establish a meta for a sport or league? It\u2019s a question that you could likely write an entire dissertation about. However, at the highest level, I think any sport and league need to maintain two things at all times: familiarity and novelty (which are often diametrically opposed). This can be achieve through a system with actively changing game and league rules to intentionally drive changes in the meta, or one can try to craft a system with relatively static rules that naturally promotes novelty within it\u2014 high turnover in players and which teams win the championship, or moments of innovation and excitement (which are often amplified through modern social media platforms).\n\nDepending on how you look at it, I think the good news is that either of these course of action can work, as it\u2019s nearly impossible to keep a meta for a sport the same in perpetuity (hell, even modern classical chess breeds novelties from time to time). However, I do think that most leagues could benefit from a more active approach to meta crafting and I think the five major knobs highlights above provide the basis for a basic tool kit to do so. Especially in an attention economy becoming much more frenetic with shortening trend duration, I do think leagues will need to figure out ways to both hone in on more exciting meta states, while ensuring they are constantly changing in order to keep fans engaged. This can happen naturally, as mentioned throughout the article with the turnover of players and coaches and technology and through pure inspiration, but leagues need to be prepared to make more dramatic shifts in rules of the game and their league moving forward if they want to stay dominant.\n\nWe take for granted that popular sports generally remain popular, when their engagement will inevitably ebb and flow over time like everything else. This is why the NBA is considering shortening games, and why the MLB is toying with the idea of the \u201cGolden At-Bat\u201d (which it sounds like they won\u2019t enact sadly). I think these types of changes, and perhaps more dramatic ones are likely to become more prevalent moving forward. However, it is still critical that sports and leagues maintain some level of familiarity to maintain some consistent engagement over time, unless they want to become the ship of Theseus of sports. If leagues reach the natural conclusion of their evolution over the years, maybe they will all end up looking like Calvinball!",

Bitte aktiviere JavaScript in deinem Browser und lade die Seite neu.\n\nFrom YouTube to WhatsApp: Spatial Phone brings your phone apps to virtual reality. Getting started is tricky, but the payoff might be worth it.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nThe new \u201cSpatial Phone: Mirror & Control\u201d app lets you view and control your Android phone's screen directly in your VR headset. Whether you want to check WhatsApp messages in mixed reality or stream YouTube music during a game of Eleven Table Tennis, it's now possible without removing your headset.\n\nCreated by solo developer \u201cbutter chicken pizza,\u201d this practical solution aims to keep you immersed in VR. Here's how it performs in real-world testing.\n\nNote: Spatial Phone currently works only with Android 8 and newer devices, with an iPhone version coming soon. The app costs $5.\n\nEntry hurdle: Companion app\n\nGetting the app up and running takes some effort. You'll need to install a companion app on your phone through Google Play. While Spatial Phone opens the Quest browser to help you find it, the Google login process has issues, and finding the app directly in the Play Store on my Smartphone didn't work either.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nThe hand-tracking controls work just as precisely in Spatial Phone as they do in the Quest menu. | Picture: butter chicken pizzaI found a workaround by sending myself the Play Store link through WhatsApp for Meta Quest. It's not the smoothest process, but it gets the job done. The real frustration comes from the pairing process.\n\nTo connect your headset and phone, you need to enter a ten-digit code mixing numbers with upper and lowercase letters. Typing in passwords in VR is already tedious, but distinguishing between similar characters like the letter O and the number 0, or capital I and lowercase l, makes it even more challenging. The developer has acknowledged this issue on Discord and plans to streamline the process in a future update.\n\nI'm in!\n\nOnce you clear these initial hurdles, your phone screen appears as a window in your VR environment within seconds. Before you can control your phone using Quest controllers or hand tracking, you'll need to enable an accessibility setting on your Android device. The app helpfully guides you to the right menu with a single tap.\n\nThe control scheme works smoothly \u2014 whether using hand tracking or VR controllers, I could easily navigate between screens, scroll through websites, and play YouTube videos without touching my phone.\n\nPlease leave this field empty\n\nXR Briefing\n\nGet the most important XR news delivered to your email inbox once a week.

The app stops working if your phone screen goes to sleep, requiring both the companion app and phone display to stay active. You also need to repeat the pairing process and enter that lengthy code every time you launch the VR app.\n\nTesting with a Samsung Galaxy S24 revealed some issues \u2014 occasional black screens, frozen images, and problems with audio transfer to the headset. While apps like YouTube, WhatsApp, and web browsers display clearly in VR, mirroring the Netflix app on Quest 3 currently doesn't work.\n\nMy verdict on Spatial Phone: Exciting app with room for improvement\n\nDespite its rough edges, Spatial Phone shows promise. The image quality is sharp, and the frame rate is generally smooth, with only occasional stuttering. Once configured, the controls feel precise and responsive.\n\nTechnical issues vary by phone model, ranging from connection issues to app crashes. The required re-pairing at each launch currently makes it less convenient than simply switching to mixed reality for a quick phone check.\n\nAd\n\nAd\n\nHowever, given the developer's active community engagement and frequent updates, this affordable tool could soon become essential for Quest users wanting seamless phone access in VR. The foundation is solid \u2014 it just needs some polishing to reach its full potential.\n\nWhat do you think of Spatial Phone?

            "content": "On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump made his grand return to the Oval Office with his second presidential inauguration. While the 47th president rattled on about renaming the Gulf of Mexico and Mount Denali, many viewers of the event scanned the background and focused on the long list of billionaires poking their heads out throughout the Capitol rotunda. However, out of all the billionaires and personalities, none stood out quite as much as Meta CEO and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s victory last November, the Meta CEO has undergone a complete transformation. Once a scrawny, self-proclaimed \u201cnerd,\u201d Zuckerberg has rebranded himself, seemingly in an attempt to appease Trump after years of threats and accusations. This \u201cZuck 2.0\u201d has reversed many of the initiatives that had once made him one of the president\u2019s biggest enemies. Among them is the end of Meta\u2019s fact-checking system, a program which contracted third parties to annotate or remove content they deem to be false or lacking in context. Instead, Zuckerberg announced that Meta will employ a system similar to the one used by his rival turned fellow technocrat: Elon Musk. After his purchase of Twitter in 2022, Musk rolled out Community Notes on the app and now \u2014 two years and an election later \u2014 Zuckerberg is following suit.\n\nMany Meta users criticized the decision, claiming that this critical function mitigates the spread of misinformation and encourages accountability online. While there is some merit to these critiques \u2014 as misinformation has long been an issue on social media \u2014 after years of implementation, fact-checking has done little to reduce the overwhelming amount of fake news that plagues Meta\u2019s platforms. Implementing user-generated Community Notes will democratize fact-checking and rid the app of a tool that has long become synonymous with big tech\u2019s arrogance and self-righteousness with regards to politics.\n\nEver since fact-checking became widespread online, people have raised concerns about the efficacy and impartiality of the practice. In fact, many \u2014 including Zuckerberg himself \u2014 have claimed that the tool has shown to be \u201ctoo politically biased,\u201d oftentimes showing partiality to left-leaning concepts or ideals.\n\nIn 2019, one of Facebook\u2019s sanctioned fact-checkers, Checkyourfact, came under fire for failing to fact-check content questioning the effects of climate change. It was later revealed that the site was founded as an offshoot of Tucker Carlson\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Caller,\u201d a right-wing news site famous for pushing conspiracies and inflammatory headlines. While many expected Facebook to remove the company\u2019s credentials after the incident, Meta never addressed the allegations and the site still remains as one of Facebook\u2019s sanctioned fact-checkers to this day.\n\nThe partisan slant found in fact-checking has manifested itself in more ways than just biased reporting. Many have accused fact-checkers of selectively assessing claims, being more likely to fact-check conservative authors and politicians rather than liberal ones. These claims are not unfounded, and many have taken to social media to criticize fact-checkers for missing some glaringly misleading comments.\n\nFact-checking alone is not robust enough to mitigate the many fake articles and stories that plague each of Meta\u2019s platforms. Meta only employs 10 U.S.-based fact-checking organizations, who are tasked with vetting one billion stories posted every day across all platforms. There is no realistic way for a system relying on for-profit companies to assess such vast amounts of content. Instead, Community Notes offer a more realistic alternative by individually certifying users, this ensures that more stories are checked and certified.\n\nIn Meta\u2019s original system, fact-checks are conducted by a small selection of companies approved by Meta. This is different from the Community Notes system, where users interested in participating are individually vetted and are allowed to give anonymous context to stories that might be misleading or false.\n\nCommunity Notes decentralizes the fact-checking process, allowing users to directly participate, encouraging a culture of grassroots participation rather than 10 single organizations fact-checking. While critics argue that the function can lead to unchecked behavior, this issue isn\u2019t unique to Community Notes: The same could be said for the various fact-checking organizations that work behind the scenes, away from the purview of the people and impervious to any public criticism.\n\nAs the transition into Community Notes begins, it could serve as a great opportunity to remind users to do their own research and verify information with reputable sources. Ever since the internet\u2019s inception, people have been taught to be cautious, especially in regard to trusting what they read online. Rather than relying on other users or companies, it might be good to be your own fact-checker.\n\nAs Zuckerberg unveils this new persona, it is important for the public to question the decisions and changes that come with it, especially as they relate to misinformation and politics across his platforms. However, gutting fact-checking on his platforms is a step toward a more transparent and community-minded culture across Meta. After years of being implemented across Meta\u2019s platforms, various controversies and no sign of correction has proven that fact-checking isn\u2019t the answer to social media\u2019s fake news crisis. Instead, Community Notes will serve as an opportunity to allow the public to engage directly with fact-checking, and do so on a wider scale.\n\nMateo Alvarez is an Opinion columnist studying political science.

            "content": "Ever since hearing about Microsoft's Mixed Reality Link app that allows Meta Quest VR headsets to connect to a Windows 11 PC, I've been stoked about trying it out. I mean, being able to see three virtual monitors in mixed reality? That's a big ol' upgrade to my PC setup.\n\nI've been burned by Meta in the past, though. From trying to play PCVR via the Quest 2 but never managing to get a decent connection on my gaming laptop to trying to set up work meetings in the Metaverse (I wouldn't recommend that), using Meta's VR headset for anything other than gaming was a struggle.\n\nBut that changed with the Meta Quest 3. With its mixed-reality capabilities, faster Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and smoother visuals, this headset paved the way for Meta to deliver more worthwhile experiences. Even better, the Quest 3S made it all more accessible to consumers.\n\nCase and point: Meta Quest VR headsets linking up to a Windows 11 PC. I finally tried out the Mixed Reality Link app and couldn't believe how easy it was to expand my PC setup with three huge virtual displays that I could move and resize at will \u2014 all with a wireless connection to a Quest 3.\n\nThere are still some quirks to iron out (the app is still in preview), but anyone with a Quest 3 or Quest 3S and a Windows 11 PC should give this new feature a whirl.\n\nA (semi) easy setup\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nSince the Mixed Reality Link app is still in preview, setting up the link with a Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to a Windows 11 PC may not be as straightforward. As an example, when following the steps to get it working via Meta's support page, I found it fell short in a couple of steps.\n\nFor one, when it states that I should see a \"prompt to pair your PC\" above my keyboard, there was none in sight. Secondly, when told to scan the QR code on my laptop's display using my Meta Quest 3 to pair the device via the Mixed Reality Link app, the headset wouldn't recognize it (although this is apparently still an experimental \"Advanced\" feature on the Quest).\n\nLuckily, this was quickly remedied with another step noted in the setup guide. Simply pair the device by opening Quick Settings (the clock on the universal menu) on the Quest, selecting Remote Desktop and then Add new device.\n\nFrom there, I followed the prompts to connect the Quest to my Windows 11 PC and Huzzah! I was up and running. Even better, I was greeted by a massive virtual screen of my PC.\n\nYou can give this a whirl yourself if you meet the following requirements:\n\nHave a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset\n\nUse Windows 11 (22H2 or newer) on your PC\n\nRun Horizon OS v72 or newer on your headset\n\nBe on the same Wi-Fi network on your PC and Quest headset (5Ghz or 6Ghz)\n\nHave at least a Radeon RX 5000 series, GTX 1000 or Ryzen 3000 series GPU or newer\n\nFor more, check out Microsoft's requirements. To note, you'll need to switch on the Pair to PC with Mixed Reality Link feature in Advanced settings on your Meta Quest in order for this to work.\n\n3 virtual monitors at your whim\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nRemember Tank in \"The Matrix\" sitting in front of an array of stacked displays? Well, I didn't. I completely forgot about him until now, but that's who I felt like once I had full control of the virtual monitors available on the Quest 3.\n\nDespite having a full-blown display that could have easily measured over 50 inches right in front of my eyes, the first thing I noticed was the lack of lag. Latency felt virtually seamless even with a wireless connection; I moved my cursor and it reacted immediately on my headset's virtual monitor.\n\nQuite honestly, this caught me off guard, as I thought, \"wait, I can actually really use this.\" Not to say that I went in thinking the feature would be a dud, but I didn't think I would want to use it on a regular basis.\n\nUsing the Quest's Touch plus controller or just my hands via hand-tracking (which can be sketchy at times), I was able to move the virtual display wherever I wanted: right up to my face, far off in the distance, to the side, over my head; anywhere.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nWhat made this better was being able to easily resize the screen to whatever I saw fit. It could be a super-sized 16:9 display, a vertical-type monitor for scrolling, more of an ultra-wide look and more. That said, this could only go so far, as my gaming laptop's display couldn't mimic these differently sized monitor sizes.\n\nThen I added the other virtual monitors. This was as simple as selecting that \"add\" option at the bottom right corner of the Quest headset. A total of three virtual monitors can be used at once, and you can mix and match how they're placed. All spaced horizontally? Sure. Stacked vertically? No problem. Spaced in an L shape so I could see them all at once? You know it.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nI was scrolling through websites while watching a YouTube video and writing in a document all at once. And if one monitor was too far out of sight, I could easily pick it up and rearrange its placement. I believe this is what Meta should have had in mind when trying to bring the workforce over to virtual reality through the Meta Quest Pro.\n\nNow, this isn't a bad deal for anyone looking for a multi-monitor setup. It sure beats buying three whole displays, even if they are the best monitors around. It's a more affordable way to build upon your PC setup. Of course, it's not without its caveats.\n\nNot a complete game-changer\n\nWhile it's a blast to use my Quest 3 to expand on how I use my laptop, it's unlikely I'd be using this feature as an everyday essential. Especially for work, as Meta is still working out how to get video calls, like in Microsoft Teams, while the connection is active.\n\nMore importantly, it isn't as if I don't notice I'm wearing a VR headset while using my PC as I normally would. Meta made strides with the design of the Quest 3, making it more comfortable to wear over longer periods of time. But yes, my face still feels like it's been pressed against after an hour or two, and the imprints are evidence.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nThen there's the battery. Unless you're using one of the best Quest 3 accessories, such as the Elite Strap with battery, you'll only get about two hours of juice before the headset needs a charge. A wireless connection is great and all, but my Quest 3 will need to be plugged in if I were to use it for extended sessions on my laptop.\n\nFinally, the VR headset's full-color passthrough isn't quite sharp enough for me to see my keyboard. I know, not everyone needs to actually see their keyboard while typing, but I'm the kind of typist who has a gander every once in a while to find specific keys. Quest's pass-through to the real world doesn't make that easy, especially in low-light settings.\n\nIn the grand scheme of what the Mixed Reality Link app offers, these are only minor snags. But with rumors of a Meta Quest 4 swirling, another VR headset down the line could fix these issues, and dare I say, bring even more virtual monitors. In the meantime, though, there's another way this feature came in handy.\n\nLarge-screen gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nAnything I do on my laptop will be seen through the virtual monitors on my Quest 3. So, I decided to give my PC games the real big-screen treatment and booted up Steam and Xbox Game Pass \u2014 and it was a mixed treat.\n\nI first tried Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and everything looked on point. With the gorgeous graphics my RTX 3080-equipped laptop could push out, I was thrilled seeing the lush landscapes of the Vatican City over a moonlit sky on a massive virtual display. However, I noticed slight stutters when moving around, despite my inputs registering near-instantly. It may be because my laptop can't keep up with the connectivity, but it's still not the ideal way to play.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide)\n\nWhile not unplayable, I wondered if a less demanding game would fare better. I started playing Carrion, the pixel-like horror game where you play a \"The Thing\"-type monster, and had a far better time. Gameplay was smooth, and I enjoyed having a large screen to cruelly crawl around stalking unsuspecting scientists.\n\nThe link was better at offering solid streams of games that didn't require intense processing power, for me at least. Still, will I continue to play such games through a Quest 3 headset? You better believe it.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere are other apps on the Meta Store that let you use your PC as a remote display, such as the popular Virtual Desktop app. But that costs $24/\u00a318, and with Microsoft's Mixed Reality Link, it's free. It's a major step in the company's push to make its VR headsets more than just a gaming outlet for many, even if it still has a few faults in the tank.\n\nStill, I'll be using my Quest 3 with a PC far more often thanks to the Mixed Reality Link app, and once it's fully out of preview, it will be far more viable. Plus, who wouldn't want adjustable monitors for a more affordable price? While using a VR headset for general tasks on my laptop is still far away, it's much closer than I think it is \u2014 even if I'll mainly use it for big-screen gaming.\n\nIf you're looking to see how virtual reality has progressed yourself, try out one of the best VR headsets (spolier: you'll want the Meta Quest 3).",

            "content": "Meta\u2019s Subscription: A Strategic Shift Beyond Ads\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) reported $48.39 billion in Q4 2024 revenue, a 21% increase year-over-year. For the full year, revenue climbed 22% to $164.5 billion. While advertising remains Meta\u2019s core business, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li emphasized long-term investments in subscription-based models, monetized AI services, and alternative revenue streams.\n\nReality Labs: Meta\u2019s VR and AR division posted $2.15 billion in 2024 revenue , up from $1.9 billion in 2023 . However, it remains a costly bet , with a $17.73 billion operating loss for the year .

This suggests as a non-advertising revenue stream. AI-Powered Monetization: Meta AI saw 700 million monthly active users, yet remains in an investment phase rather than immediate monetization. However, Susan Li hinted at future paid models, saying, \u201cThere will be pretty clear monetization opportunities, including paid recommendations and a premium offering.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory Pressures Fuel Subscription Growth\n\nMeta\u2019s expansion into subscriptions is not just strategic\u2014it\u2019s necessary. Increasing regulatory scrutiny in the EU and U.S. has forced Meta to explore non-advertising revenue streams, including its ad-free subscription tiers in Europe.\n\nZuckerberg also acknowledged regulatory challenges, noting, \u201cWe continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape that could significantly impact our business.\u201d If restrictions on ad targeting intensify, Meta\u2019s subscription models may become a global standard rather than a regional test.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta projects Q1 2025 revenue of $39.5\u2013$41.8 billion (an 8\u201315% increase YoY), with a growing emphasis on infrastructure, AI, and Reality Labs.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSIDER TAKE:\n\nMeta\u2019s 2024 earnings highlight a company in transition\u2014one that remains ad-dominant but is aggressively exploring new revenue streams.\n\nReality Labs losses remain high, but Meta is playing the long game on VR/AR monetization.\n\nWhatsApp Business growth signals subscription potential in messaging and commerce.\n\nAI-powered monetization will take time, but Meta AI could eventually introduce paid features.\n\nRegulatory pressure is a driving force behind Meta\u2019s subscription expansion.\n\nFor subscription executives, Meta\u2019s shift reinforces key industry trends:\n\nDiversification is crucial\u2014ad models alone are vulnerable to regulatory risks. AI-driven monetization is emerging, though direct revenue may take years. The subscription economy is expanding beyond media and software\u2014business messaging, digital experiences, and AI tools are the next frontier.\n\nWhile Meta is not yet a subscription-first company, its 2024 results confirm a growing reliance on alternative revenue streams\u2014something subscription leaders should watch closely.",

            "content": "Meta-owned WhatsApp on Friday said it disrupted a campaign that involved the use of spyware to target journalists and civil society members.\n\nThe campaign, which targeted around 90 members, involved the use of spyware from an Israeli company known as Paragon Solutions. The attackers were neutralized in December 2024.\n\nIn a statement to The Guardian, the encrypted messaging app said it has reached out to affected users, stating it had \"high confidence\" that the users were targeted and \"possibly compromised.\" It's currently not known who is behind the campaign and for how long it took place.\n\nThe attack chain is said to be zero-click, meaning the deployment of the spyware occurs without requiring any user interaction. It's suspected to involve the distribution of a specially-crafted PDF file sent to individuals who were added to group chats on WhatsApp.\n\nThe company noted the targets were spread across over two dozen countries, including several in Europe, adding it notified the affected parties and provided them information on how to protect themselves.\n\n\"This is the latest example of why spyware companies must be held accountable for their unlawful actions,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson told The Hacker News. \"WhatsApp will continue to protect peoples' ability to communicate privately.\"\n\nThe company also revealed that it had sent Paragon a \"cease and desist\" letter and that it was considering other options. The development marks the first time the company has been linked to cases where its technology has been misused.\n\nLike NSO Group, Paragon is the maker of surveillance software called Graphite that's offered to government clients in order to combat digital threats. It was acquired by a U.S.-based investment group AE Industrial Partners in December in a deal worth $500 million.\n\nOn its barebones website, the company claims it provides customers with \"ethically based tools\" to \"disrupt intractable threats,\" as well as offer \"cyber and forensic capabilities to locate and analyze digital data.\"\n\nIn late 2022, it came to light that Graphite was used by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for counternarcotics operations. Last year, the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) called on the Department of Homeland Security to release details about its $2 million contract with Paragon.\n\nNews of the campaign comes weeks after a judge in California ruled in WhatsApp's favor in a landmark case against NSO Group for using its infrastructure to deliver the Pegasus spyware to 1,400 devices in May 2019.\n\nMeta's disclosure also coincided with the arrest of former Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro over allegations that he sanctioned the use of Pegasus spyware to surveil opposition leaders and oversaw cases where the technology was used.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe Italian government, on February 5, 2025, said the spyware campaign carried out with spyware made by Paragon Solutions, targeted individuals across several countries in Europe. This included seven Italian citizens, it added.\n\nThe people targeted own phones with numbers tied to Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, per the statement. The government has denied any involvement in the activity.\n\nSo far, three identified victims include an Italian investigative journalist, a co-founder of the Mediterranea Saving Humans charity, and a Sweden-based Libyan activist. It's currently not known who is behind the spying campaign.\n\nEarlier this week, Paragon Solutions told TechCrunch that the company counts the U.S. government and its allies as clients, but did not disclose who they were. It also said it licenses its technology to a \"select group of global democracies\" and that it has \"zero-tolerance policy\" against illicit use of its tools.\n\nAnother Paragon Spyware Target Revealed\n\nAnother co-founder of Mediterranea Saving Humans has also come forward as one of the alleged targets of the campaign that leveraged spyware made by Paragon, TechCrunch reported on February 11, 2025.\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include a statement from Meta/WhatsApp.)",

            "content": "Meta's artificial intelligence plans will break new ground in 2025.\n\nBig tech companies are spending heavily to stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Budgets for building AI data centers filled with GPUs and network switches jumped higher in 2024. And a recent update from Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg says 2025 could see an even bigger jump in spending.\n\nZuckerberg said in a Facebook post that Meta will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025. That's up from $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024, a 60% jump at the midpoint of each forecast. Despite previous comments from Zuckerberg hinting at a big increase in spending for 2025, analysts had expected Meta's capital investments to come in around $51 billion this year.\n\nZuckerberg's comments suggest big tech isn't even close to being done with spending on AI development as the arms race continues into 2025. That's great news for a few important Meta suppliers: Nvidia (NVDA -0.14%), Broadcom (AVGO -1.48%), and Arista Networks (ANET -0.14%).\n\nThe building blocks of a data center\n\nAt the core of data centers focused on large language model training and inference are GPUs. In Zuckerberg's post, he said Meta will have 1.3 million GPUs by the end of the year. That's an increase from the 600,000 estimate Meta gave for the end of 2024.\n\nNvidia is the largest supplier of GPUs to Meta, and it's likely to stay that way in 2025. Nvidia's latest chips based on its Blackwell architecture promise 30 times the performance of its previous generation, with 25 times less cost and energy consumption. No competitor currently comes close to that level of performance out of the box like Nvidia's chips. And in a market where big tech companies are racing to stay ahead of one another, paying up for Nvidia's chips is the fastest path to stay ahead.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only company Meta relies on for AI chips. Meta designs its own silicon, working closely with Broadcom, to handle specific tasks related to Meta's AI development and deployment. For example, the ranking and recommendation models that power Facebook and Instagram's feeds, Stories, Reels, video, and more are built on Meta's own AI accelerator chips. These custom-built chips are faster and more power-efficient than general-purpose GPUs.\n\nMeta is working to expand the scope of its own chips to include generative AI, and it'll likely continue taking steps toward that goal in 2025. That's great news for Broadcom, which is a key technology provider for Meta in that endeavor.\n\nAll those GPUs and AI accelerators need an efficient way to communicate with one another and make sure data gets from one place to another quickly. That requires Ethernet switches. Ethernet switches are like traffic controllers for data centers. They route data from one server to another and make sure there's no congestion on the network slowing everything down.\n\nMeta partners with Arista Networks to create hardware and software solutions for its data centers. With plans to open a massive data center full of GPUs in 2025, Arista will see a strong step-up in orders from Meta as well.\n\nInside those Arista Ethernet switches are more Broadcom chips. Broadcom makes the logic chips that allow the hardware to route data efficiently. So, the company plays both a supporting role for Nvidia's chips while offering a competing product to some degree.\n\nAre these stocks a buy?\n\nZuckerberg's announcement is certainly great news for the continued demand for AI infrastructure, such as that provided by Nvidia, Broadcom, and Arista Networks. All three should see strong revenue growth in 2025, which should translate into a nice bump in earnings for investors.\n\nBut just because a company is poised to grow in 2025 doesn't make its stock an automatic buy. Valuation still matters. All three of these stocks saw their prices climb significantly higher as excitement around the increased demand for their products permeated the market. As a result, their stocks became priced for perfection.\n\nWe saw the impact of that pricing recently following the realization of what High-Flyer's LLM DeepSeek has been working on and the potential long-term implications. While Nvidia, Broadcom, and Arista Networks could still show great financial results in 2025, DeepSeek's innovations call into question how long big tech will sustain its spending on hardware before focusing on making its software more efficient.\n\nAll three stocks come with considerable risks and uncertainty. Nvidia stock looks attractive based on forward earnings estimates for fiscal 2026 (ending next January), but the potential for declining market share and pressure on pricing power are long-term challenges.\n\nBroadcom has a lot of upside as a designer of custom AI accelerators for Meta and other big tech companies, as well as creating essential chips for network switches. Its business is more diversified than Nvidia's, with some slower-growing segments outside AI-related chips. Still, it trades for a higher forward earnings multiple than Nvidia, based on Wall Street estimates.\n\nArista Networks is seeing great revenue growth, but its stock now trades for over 40 times forward earnings as of this writing. And that's after the impact of the DeepSeek news. Despite the strong demand for its hardware, the company isn't growing nearly fast enough to justify its current stock price.\n\nWhile the comments from Zuckerberg may have provided some confidence in 2025 results for all three companies, the long-term questions and stock valuations make all three stocks risky to own. It may be worth it for some to add exposure to AI data center spending through these stocks, as long as investors remain mindful of the risks each poses and the constant changes happening in AI development.",

RoschetzkyIstockPhoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp that may soon become a Texas company, struck a deal this week to get its Lone Star State data centers powered. The agreement with Spanish-based renewable energy company Zelestra calls for four solar projects, totalling 595 megawatts (MW), to be constructed in Texas.\n\nSome project details including costs were not revealed in the announcement made Thursday. However, the four projects will bring additional solar power to the main Texas grid, which is maintained by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The solar plants will be located in Henderson, Hopkins and Lamar counties, which are each east of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and Lampasas County north of Austin.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"We are excited to announce these solar projects with Zelestra,\" said Meta Head of Global Energy Urvi Parekh. \"The renewable energy from these projects will support our data center operations, as well as our ongoing efforts to match our electricity usage with 100 percent clean and renewable energy.\"\n\nMeta has struck a deal with a Spanish-based energy development company to power the tech company's data centers in Texas. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta has been in talks with Texas officials about potentially moving its address of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Elon Musk's SpaceX very publicly moved its incorporation address from Delaware to Texas last year; after a First State judge struck down his multi-billion-dollar pay package, Musk told other executives he recommends they move \"to another state as soon as possible.\"\n\nBut that isn't all Meta has done to inch closer to the Lone Star State. As the year kicked off, Meta announced it was moving its trust and safety teams from California to Texas and other U.S. locations. According to Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the move to Republican-led states helps their case for increased neutrality.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"As we work to promote free expression, I think that it will help us build trust to do this work in places where there's less concern about the bias of our teams,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nMeta has several data centers sprinkled throughout the U.S. In Texas, it operates a $1.5 billion, 2.5 million-square-foot center in Fort Worth and an $800 million, approximately 900,000-square-foot facility in Temple. The Lone Star State is becoming a hotspot for data centers, where massive computer systems store everything from servers to network equipment, and from cloud-based to AI data. In October, SB Energy announced its 875-MW operation north of Austin to power Google's data centers were ready to go. Earlier this month, internet provider Gigabit Fiber announced a 540-MW data center and tech space south of Dallas.\n\nBecause these data centers are so large and house complex computer systems, they typically require a substantial amount of energy to power. The 595 MW of solar power created by Zelestra's plants to power Meta's facilities is enough to energize approximately 150,000 homes during peak demand.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been a shareholder of Meta Platforms since September of 2022, when I decided to invest, as I believed the company was undervalued and had a lot of growth potential due to its exceptional organizational properties. I vividly remember seeing the company trading at a 60% below its all-time high at the time I bought my shares. As of this writing, my original investment is worth almost 5X.\n\nInvestors always say to buy businesses when they\u2019re cheap. However, most of the time, when stock prices drop as much as Meta did in 2022 (75% from ATH at the lowest point) is usually for a fundamentally sound reason. In meta\u2019s case, along a complex macroeconomic environment, was due to TikTok explosive growth, its revenue stagnation, and its significant spending on new projects such as the metaverse, whose returns were completely uncertain.\n\nAs depicted in the chart below, 2022 ended with revenue declining a bit more than $1B, capex increased by 70%, and net profit margin and free cash flow per share declined from 33.4% to 19.9%, and from 13.6 to 7, respectively. Fundamentally speaking, the company was going through a tough time, which resulted in the significant stock price decline. By the way, this is a great example that shows that stock prices ultimately track fundamentals.\n\nFundamentals\n\nStock Price\n\nThis times of uncertainty made most investors skeptical about the company\u2019s growth potential and its management ability to allocate capital to new projects. What I saw, however, was an organization with exceptional organizational properties that was going through a short term crisis, and that sooner or later (in this case sooner) was going to recover. What happened to Meta in 2022, although not usual in exceptional organizations, happens to almost every organization that is trying to innovate and make the greatest products on earth. Amazon\u2019s stock dropped by over 90% during the dot-com crash and Netflix dropped almost 75% in 2022, as they reported its first loss of subscribers in over a decade. You just have to take a look at where they are now.\n\nThe goal of this post is to understand Meta\u2019s organizational properties, which were the reason why the company was able to 7X its value in 2 years after losing 75% of its value in one year. Furthermore, I\u2019ll also analyse its fundamentals. These are the two main things I look for when investing into a company. The former can essentially guide us on how the company can evolve over the future, while the latter is a reflection of the former, and shows how the company has evolved since its IPO and what is its current situation.\n\nWithin organizational properties, the goal is to understand Meta\u2019s culture, management, leadership, hierarchy and systems and policies. This, I believe, will give investors a solid overview of how the organization runs internally and how they think when operating it, which is ultimately the thesis of any investment. The KPIs found within the organizational properties will help investors determine whether they believe the organization is bound to grow over the coming decades or not.\n\nWithin fundamentals, the goal is to understand Meta\u2019s business segments, MOAT and financials. Key KPIs found within the income statement, free cash flow statement and balance sheet, such as debt levels, profit margins, and return on investment capital, among others, will give a solid overview of how well the company is currently doing financially. At the end of the day, stock prices track free cash flow per share. If the company is not able to grow this metric, investors won't be able to make the type of return on investment they\u2019re looking for. Although this alone won't tell investors how the company will evolve over time, it is essential to understand its growth potential.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nMeta Platforms operates through two primary business segments, each contributing to its dominance in the digital ecosystem. While the company is primarily known for its social media platforms, its ambitions extend beyond traditional advertising, venturing into artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other frontier technologies. Meta's business segments can be categorized into Family of Apps (FoA), and Reality Labs (RL), as depicted in the image below.\n\nSegments Revenue\n\nThe Family of Apps segment includes Meta\u2019s core social networking platforms: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. This division is the company\u2019s primary revenue driver, generating, as of today, approximately 97% of Meta\u2019s revenue through digital advertising. Meta\u2019s ad ecosystem is powered by an advanced data-driven algorithm, leveraging artificial intelligence to deliver highly targeted ads across its platforms. Despite more regulations and growing competition, Meta\u2019s advertising business is still one of the most profitable in the industry, thanks to its huge user base of over 3.35 billion daily active users across all platforms, as of Q4 2024.\n\nFamily of Apps\n\nAdditionally, within Family of Apps (FoA), Meta has been expanding into financial services and digital commerce, generating $519 million in revenue from payments and other growth initiatives such as Meta Pay, a payment processing system formerly known as Facebook Pay. This service allows users to send money, purchase goods, and make in-app transactions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. I believe the company aims to create a seamless cross-platform payment system by integrating shopping experiences directly into its apps. While still a small fraction of its total revenue, this segment represents Meta\u2019s ambition to diversify its income streams beyond digital advertising.\n\nOn the other hand, Reality Labs represents the high-cost, high-risk investments in future technologies. It is Meta\u2019s long-term bet on the metaverse, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). This division is responsible for hardware, including Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and other AR/VR devices. They are expensive investments that, as of today, are recording multi-billion-dollar losses as Meta works to scale the technology and drive adoption. However, Zuckerberg remains committed to this vision.\n\nCulture and Leadership\n\nThe ultimate thesis of any investment comes down to the culture and the people that work within the organization. Without the right group of individuals, no business can keep growing over decades, which is what I look for when investing into a business.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has created one of the greatest organizations precisely because he has been able to build a culture in which competent individuals have the freedom to innovate and iterate at a faster rate than their competitors. In fact, one of their mottos is to move fast. He, as the leader, wants individuals that work within Meta to learn as much as possible so that they end up building the greatest products on earth. Not only that, but he is also extremely client focused, which is also a trait of high quality leaders and management.\n\nAn interesting system that he has built within the organization is that there\u2019s thousands of versions running of the apps, so that engineers can test new features by trial and error. By doing so, engineers can also see how the inputs affect the outputs, which include sharing, time spent, engagement, amount of friends that users have, amount of money that they make, \u2026 .\n\nAs he mentions in the following interview, made eleven years ago, this way of working is extremely empowering for engineers, as they can directly see the impact of their work without having to ask for approval from someone above them. In other words, Zuckerberg has created an organization that empowers engineers to build the best products and that lacks the bureaucracy that many other companies have, and which are responsible for not making them innovate and move fast enough.\n\nNot only that, but he has also proved to be a fantastic capital allocator, which is one of the key traits that I look for in a leader when investing in a company. He has not only made some of the greatest acquisitions in business history, but has also proved that he understands the direction in which the world is going by investing a lot of capital into the required hardware to build the AI infrastructure that he believes will be essential to make the company grow over the future, while remaining as efficient as possible.\n\nRegarding acquisitions, probably one of the most, if not the most remarkable one was the one he made in 2012, when he bought Instagram for $1B. Although the data is not publicly available, Instagram\u2019s estimated revenue in 2024 was $71B, and analysts and industry experts have estimated Instagram\u2019s current valuation to range between $250 billion and $300 billion based on its user base, advertising power, and role in Meta's ecosystem. That\u2019s a 250X in terms of valuation in less than 15 years.\n\nAnother significant acquisition was Whatsapp, which he paid $19B in 2014. Although many believed that he paid a high price for it, it has shown to be a great one, as it now serves over 2 billion users globally. Although Meta has not been able to monetize Whatsapp in the same way it has done with instagram (its revenue is estimated to be $10b as of 2024), by owning whatsapp, they are able to collect more data, which is one of their primary goals and one of the reasons why the company is valued at approximately $100B.\n\nMoreover, In 2023, Zuckerberg announced that the company was going to have a strong emphasis on efficiency going forward, meaning that those employees that were not efficient enough to the company would be terminated. In 2023, a year in which companies had to cut costs due to a complex macroeconomic environment, Meta cut almost 20,000 jobs and now, in 2025, they have announced that they will lay off around 5% of its workforce, or around 3,600 employees.\n\nIn the two charts above, you can see the evolution of the number of meta\u2019s employees and its change over time. In the one below, you can see the revenue per employee in millions, which is a key metric that I take a look at when determining the efficiency of businesses. As you can see, there\u2019s clearly a turning point in 2023, when meta decided to focus on efficiency. This reduction of employees who were not efficient for Meta\u2019s standards translated into revenue per employee growing from 1.5 million at the end of 2022 to 2.3 million at the end of 2024. As the company becomes increasingly more operationally efficient due to technological advancements, I expect the two charts above to continue declining, while the one below continues to rise over time.\n\nLastly, Zuckerberg is also, in my opinion, the greatest example of how a leader is able to understand the market in which he is playing and adapt to new challenges, which are quite common in the fast evolving tech industry. A recent example that shows this is the recent announcement of its discontinuation of its third party fact checking program in the United states, which is an initiative to foster freedom of expression within its platforms, as Elon Musk is doing with X. He has taken this decision just after president elect Donald Trump has been reelected, which has expressed several times its support for freedom of speech.\n\nI believe that he has realized that the woke culture that the US was experiencing over the last decade no longer entices citizens and that the world is slowly shifting towards a culture in which traditional values, freedom of speech and meritocracy are respected and valued again. Although it is unknown whether he has taken this decision because of the electoral change or because he actually supports it, it goes to show that he is extremely capable of identifying the ever evolving cultural shifts that take place in the globe almost immediately, and that he is consistently making decisions based on the best interest of his company.\n\nAI Infrastructure\n\nZuckerberg is intentionally investing a lot of capital in AI infrastructure because he believes that the outcome of this significant investment not only will translate into a strong ROI but also lower the company\u2019s operating expenses, which will help his goal of making his company as efficient and lean as possible. These are some words from Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Q4 2024 conference call:\n\n\u201cThese are all big investments -- especially the hundreds of billions of dollars that we will invest in AI infrastructure over the long term. I announced last week that we expect to bring online almost 1GW of capacity this year, and we're building a 2GW and potentially bigger AI datacenter that is so big that it\u2019ll cover a significant part of Manhattan if it were placed there.\u201d\n\nHowever, he has been doing so in a different way compared to its competitors. Instead of just acquiring Nvidia's H100 GPUs chips, which are specifically built for training LLMs (large language models), he has recently been also acquiring more AMD's MI300 chips, which are more focused on inference. By doing so, he is betting that inference costs, which are the operating costs to run the AI models, will keep growing over time as the amount of users increases, while training costs, which are the initial costs to train models, will decline over time, as companies find ways to train models in a more efficient and cheap way.\n\nThis is exactly what DeepSeek might just have proved. If you\u2019re not familiarized with this chinese AI startup, just a few day ago, on January 20, they released an AI model called DeepSeek-R1, which they say they have trained at a far lower cost than American companies such as Open AI or Perplexity have been able to do over the past years. The way in that they have achieved this is by employing reinforcement learning, which is a technique in which the model learns by trial and error to improve its behavior based on the incentives provided, instead of using the traditional process of fine tuning, in which you take a pre-trained machine learning model and adapt it to a specific task or dataset.\n\nIf true, this goes to show that Zuckerberg might be right and that LLMs training costs going forward might be reduced significantly without having to sacrifice quality on the outcome of models. Additionally, it would also mean that those companies which are part of the supply chain of designing and producing the hardware required to build the models, such as Nvidia, TSMC or ASML, will suffer the consequences, as companies will no longer need the amount of hardware that we all thought they were originally going to need.\n\nBy acquiring more AMD chips, and open sourcing Lama 4, Meta\u2019s AI model, one can assess that Zuckerberg's strategic move is to let competitors, external developers and researchers experiment, innovate, and contribute to its advancement, so that Meta can then learn from these innovations or even adopt the best ideas. In fact, without Meta open sourcing its model, Deepseek would have not been able to build its DeepSeek-R1 model. In short, while others are focused on training the best models, Zuckerberg is focused on building the required infrastructure to then adopt all the innovations that competitors are developing by spending millions or even billions of dollars in training AI models. On the contrary to what everyone originally thought, LLMs might become commodities rather than assets.\n\nInterestingly, while investing billions in Capex on Nvidia and AMD hardware, among others, Meta is also developing its own chips. The initiative began several years ago, in 2020, but it was not until 2023 that Meta introduced Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), a custom-designed chip aimed at improving the efficiency of AI workloads across its platforms. As you can imagine, this chip is specifically tailored for Meta\u2019s AI-driven applications, particularly in ranking and recommendation systems used in Meta\u2019s apps. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, which are optimized for a broad range of AI tasks, MTIA is designed to handle Meta\u2019s unique AI workloads more efficiently.\n\nThese are some words from Susan Li, CFO, Q4 2024 conference call:\n\n\u201cFinally, we\u2019re pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA silicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads. In 2024 we started deploying MTIA to our ranking and recommendation inference workloads for ads and organic content. We expect to further ramp adoption of MTIA for these use cases throughout 7 2025 before extending our custom silicon efforts to training workloads for ranking and recommendations next year.\u201d\n\nOne can only think that Meta is starting to develop its own chips because they want to stop fully relying on third party chip suppliers and start being self-sufficient. The reasons are quite obvious. The rising demand for hardware produced by NVIDIA and AMD has led to significantly higher prices and extended waiting times for their products. By developing in-house chips, Meta gains two things. First, they can design them for their specific needs, and second, they gain greater control over its AI infrastructure, ensuring that it can scale its machine learning and generative AI capabilities without bottlenecks caused by supply chain constraints or competition for high-performance GPUs.\n\nWhether or not they will be able to build what companies such as NVIDIA or AMD have been building for decades is a topic for another day. What is crystal clear is that they want to stop fully relying on external chip providers, and that they aim to gradually transition towards a model where they can design and manufacture chips tailored specifically to their unique requirements.\n\nMOAT\n\nAlthough Meta is not an advertising monopoly, as there are other major players in the digital advertising landscape such as Google, Amazon, and even smaller platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, it undeniably operates as a social interaction monopoly. Meta's dominance stems from its unparalleled ability to centralize and facilitate human interaction through its platforms, which, as of today, collectively serve more than 3.35 billion people out of the 8.2 on a daily basis, representing approximately 40% of the total population.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that approximately 2.6 billion people, or about 32% of the global population, don\u2019t have access to internet connection. Therefore, if we just account for those people that have access to internet connection (5.6 billion), Meta\u2019s apps are actually being used by a little over 57% of the connected population.\n\nAlthough it is unrealistic to say that there will be a time where the entire population will have access to internet connection, it is realistic to say that the percentage of connected people is increasing at an exponential rate and will keep doing so due to technological advancements such as Starlink, which its satellite internet service lets people access the internet from anywhere in the world.\n\nAs of today, Meta is one of the companies with the strongest network effects. As more users join their apps, it becomes increasingly harder for competitors to build apps whose primary goal is to connect people among each other. Not only that, but Meta has created an ecosystem in which users and businesses have their apps integrated between each other, making it extremely hard for them to leave their apps. This centralization of communication gives Meta a unique position as a hub for social interaction in the digital age.\n\nIn addition, Meta's algorithms and data-driven insights significantly influence how people consume information, form opinions, and interact with content. Through personalized feeds and targeted recommendations, Meta shapes user experiences in ways that often reinforce its ecosystem, making it challenging for competitors to offer a similar level of integration and reach.\n\nThis near-monopoly on social interaction provides Meta with a steady stream of user data, fueling its advertising model and reinforcing its market position. While other platforms may compete in specific niches, TikTok in short-form video, LinkedIn in professional networking, or Reddit in community-driven forums, Meta\u2019s ecosystem remains unmatched in its scope, making it a de facto monopoly for social connectivity in many parts of the world.\n\nUser Addiction\n\nMany consider Meta to be tobacco 2.0. The comparison comes from the fact that, like previously mentioned, Meta\u2019s algorithms are intentionally designed to make users addicted to its content. Their goal, like many other tech platforms, is to maximize user engagement and time spent on their platforms. This is a strategic decision tied to the company\u2019s primary revenue model: advertising. The more time users spend on their platforms, the more ads they see, and the more data Meta collects to improve ad targeting, which results in revenue increase over time.\n\nThese are some of the most essential features responsible for making metas products so addictive:\n\nMeta\u2019s apps are designed to maximize user engagement through a combination of sophisticated algorithms and psychologically addictive mechanisms. Personalized content delivery is a cornerstone of this strategy. Meta's algorithms analyze vast amounts of user data, including likes, shares, comments, watch history, and the time spent viewing specific posts. By tailoring content to align with a user\u2019s interests and behaviors, the platform ensures that users are consistently exposed to highly relevant and engaging material. This creates a feedback loop, where user interaction fuels further customization, making the experience increasingly compelling over time. In other words, the more you use their products, the more data Meta can analyze, and the better the algorithm becomes.\n\nAnother critical aspect of user retention is the deployment of dopamine loops. Features such as likes, reactions, comments, and notifications are specifically designed to trigger small bursts of dopamine, the brain\u2019s reward chemical. The anticipation of social validation or the discovery of new information becomes a powerful motivator, keeping users coming back for more. This mechanism operates similarly to gambling, where the promise of a reward is irresistible, even if the timing and nature of that reward are unpredictable.\n\nThe infinite scrolling feature further reinforces this engagement. By removing natural stopping points, the design allows users to consume content endlessly, often resulting in losing track of time. Without clear cues to take a break, users are drawn into prolonged sessions, consuming far more content than they may have initially intended.\n\nFinally, algorithmic prioritization of engagement plays a pivotal role in sustaining user interest. Meta\u2019s algorithms are fine-tuned to highlight content that elicits strong emotional reactions, such as outrage, joy, or curiosity. Emotionally charged content is inherently more engaging, prompting users to spend longer periods interacting with the platform. This prioritization ensures that users remain emotionally invested, further deepening their reliance on the platform.\n\nAlthough true, I strongly disagree with the original statement. While tobacco does not provide any type of benefit to any end consumer, Meta does. Let me explain. Within Meta\u2019s apps, users have a very important decision to make: Either to be a consumer or a creator. As a consumer, individuals engage with content passively, scrolling through posts, watching videos, or reacting to others' creations. This mode of use can often lead to mindless consumption, with users spending hours on the platform without a clear purpose, potentially fostering dependency or wasting time. This is where Meta\u2019s apps can resemble the addictive qualities of tobacco, offering dopamine hits without delivering substantial long-term benefits. However, as with any other thing in life, you, as the consumer, have the choice to make good use of Meta\u2019s apps. Because of them, you can instantly communicate with family and friends globally, you have the opportunity to connect with new people, and you can learn basically anything you want by accessing the vast amount of information uploaded by other users. It can therefore have a positive impact in your life.\n\nThe story changes entirely for those who choose to be creators. Meta's apps empower users to create and share content, build businesses, educate others, and form communities. Entrepreneurs can sell products through Facebook Marketplace or Instagram Shops, small businesses can reach global audiences with targeted ads, and educators can spread knowledge through engaging content. These tools essentially enable creators to leverage the platform for either personal or business purposes. Many people have experienced their lives improve significantly because of Meta\u2019s apps.\n\nUltimately, the difference lies in how the apps are used. While Meta provides the infrastructure, the choice to consume passively or produce actively rests with the individual. Unlike tobacco, which offers no pathway to growth or improvement, Meta's apps contain immense potential for those who want to use them productively.\n\nFinancials\n\n\u201cOur primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities.\u201d - Susan Li, CFO, Q4 2024 conference call.\n\nIncome Statement\n\nMeta is one of the greatest examples of what I like to see in a company when investing. Their capital allocation philosophy is top notch. They have proved time and time and again that they are able to successfully allocate capital to the projects with the strongest ROI and their acquisitions over their trajectory have been nothing but outstanding.\n\nAs previously mentioned, most of Meta\u2019s revenue comes from its main business segment, the advertising from its Family of Apps. In Q4 2024, it generated $46.8B in revenue, accounting for approximately 97% of its total revenue. This goes to show that although they are significantly investing into its reality labs business segment, as of today, Meta is an advertising company.\n\nThe company\u2019s expenses are not distributed in the same way as its revenue. In Q4 2024, total expenses were $25B. Family of Apps incurred expenses totalling $19.0 billion, accounting for 76% of Meta's overall expenses, while Reality Labs reported expenses of $6.0 billion, accounting for 24% of total expenses for the quarter. Therefore, Family of Apps had an operating income of $28.3B, and Reality Labs had an operating loss of $5B.\n\nTheir business model allows them to have broad profit margins, which are one of the first financial metrics that I look at when analyzing a company. In my opinion, in Meta\u2019s case, they are just getting started. The company is now focused on building the required infrastructure to be able to build the greatest products on earth, and that means a significant increase in Capex, which reduces profit margins. Having this in mind, Meta\u2019s profit margin during the last six quarters have ranged from 30% to 45%, which is extraordinary.\n\nCash Flow Statement\n\nIn 2024, Meta has generated $54,072B in free cash flow, which after dividing by Meta\u2019s $164,501B total revenue for the year gives a free cash flow margin of 32.9%, which means that for every dollar the business generates, it produces 32.9 cents in cash. This cash can be very beneficial as it can then be reinvested into the business or used for stock buybacks. The average free cash flow margin over the last four years is 28.44%, which goes to show that the company is actually highly efficient at converting revenue into actual cash.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nThe balance sheet is strong, ending Q4 2024 with total assets of $276,054B and total liabilities of $93,417B. It seems like liquidity issues are not a concern as the current ratio, which is current assets/current liabilities, is close to 3 (the higher this ratio the lower the probabilities of the company facing liquidity issues). Solvency issues won\u2019t be a concern either, as the debt to assets ratio, which is the total debts/total assets is 0.33 (the lower this ratio, the lower the probabilities of the company facing solvency issues).\n\nFurthermore, Meta\u2019s cash and cash equivalents position is also strong, totalling almost $44B as of December 31, 2024. The company is also quite efficient at using its capital resources, as reflected by its ROIC (Return On Invested Capital) of 35.35%, which indicates that Meta generates a return of 35 cents for every dollar invested.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMeta is one of the greatest organizations I\u2019ve come across as an investor. Its organizationals properties have been nothing but extraordinary since inception, and its fundamentals, although suffered a few times along the way, as of today, are fantastic.\n\nThe company\u2019s culture, which is one of the key things that I look for when analyzing a company\u2019s organizational properties, is top notch. This is mainly due to Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership traits, which, along with the management team, goes to show the importance of people within an organization.\n\nAdditionally, the company is extremely focused on long term growth. Their significant investments in AI infrastructure prove that they are willing to sacrifice short-term gains in order to make even bigger long-term gains by creating the best products on earth. This is not an easy decision to make as a public company. What is crystal clear is that their goal is to operate as efficiently and leanly as possible, and this requires a significant amount of investments in the necessary technology, which is exactly what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAlthough I believe Meta is no longer an asymmetrical bet, I do believe that its exceptional organizational properties, such as its culture, leadership and systems, along its strong fundamentals, will be a catalyst for the company to keep growing over the coming decades. As long as this remains, I will keep holding my shares.\n\nHope I provided some value.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nAlfonso",

Business Insider verified his previous employment and financial claims with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI didn't expect my career path to take me from working on virtual reality at Meta to leading tour groups around New York, but I'm enjoying taking the risk and betting on myself.\n\nIn 2011, I moved from Los Angeles to New York, where I worked at We Are Plus making corporate videos. In 2016, I started at Edelman, a major PR and marketing firm, and climbed the ranks to executive producer, pioneering their augmented- and virtual-reality initiatives.\n\nWorking at Meta was my dream job\n\nI wanted to pivot my skills into tech, so I started applying for jobs in 2022. I landed a job at Meta in July 2022. Working as an augmented-reality producer with a $215,000 salary felt like the crowning achievement in my career.\n\nI was handed the reins on Meta's \"real-time avatar\" feature, where I ran the project's operations. I integrated workflow, managed the 3D design, and helped the team meet deadlines. Despite being a remote employee bridging both coasts, I thrived in a fast-paced, elite environment.\n\nThe sense of purpose I felt working at Meta was remarkable. We were pushing the boundaries of what was possible in the digital realm, and every day brought new challenges.\n\nBut Silicon Valley's volatility showed its face in November 2022 with mass layoffs. I thought I was safe working in a cutting-edge space like AR, but my role was eliminated, and I was placed on an internal redeployment plan. In February 2023, I was laid off, just eight months into what I thought would be a long-term journey.\n\nMy culinary side hustle was a saving grace\n\nFortunately, I was still making an income via my side hustle, Ultimate Food Tours. Since I moved to New York, I'd created and researched various food tours and would take groups of friends to the hidden gems I'd found. In November 2019, on a whim, I posted my first food tour on Airbnb.\n\nBetween November 2019 and the beginning of COVID-19 in March 2020, I received around four bookings. At the time, I charged $60 per person per tour, which included food and non-alcoholic drinks but excluded tips.\n\nThese tours, limited to 10 people, are a journey through time and culture. I wanted it to feel like exploring a city with a knowledgeable friend.\n\nAll of my prior supervisors, both at Meta and Edelman, encouraged my side hustle. I made $30,000 in 2022 doing food tours while employed at Meta.\n\nAfter getting laid off, I received another offer at a tech job. The idea of having a stable income was enticing. I struggled with my decision, but after speaking to my parents and mentors, I knew it was time for a change.\n\nI always kept my money from my food tours separate from my corporate salary. When I was laid off, I had roughly $20,000 from my food tour business to fall back on. I didn't have to touch my severance money at the time.\n\nBeing single, with savings in the bank, I turned my layoff crisis into an opportunity. Years of running tours as a side gig meant I had the experience and financial runway to take this leap. I already had deep relationships with my vendors and knew how to build relationships with other food personnel to promote my business.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGiving up a cushy tech salary was difficult\n\nTrading the security of Big Tech for the unpredictability of entrepreneurship wasn't an easy choice. I miss the cushy corporate perks and a steady paycheck, but the thrill of building something meaningful feeds my soul in ways technology never could.\n\nLosing my tech salary was a personal test. Spontaneous vacations and casual dinners out were replaced with budgeting and home-cooked meals. However, working in Big Tech taught me financial forecasting and operational management, which I now apply to my business.\n\nI haven't matched my Meta salary yet, but the business made $145,000 in revenue this past year, and running costs are minimal. The tour guides I hire are all freelancers who get paid between $30 and $60 per hour per tour, excluding tips.\n\nI don't draw a traditional salary and use the business funds to cover my essentials and the business's expansion. The freedom of building something makes up for the financial juggling act.\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is demanding but worth it\n\nMy days are split between understanding accounting software, coordinating with global affiliates for our expansion into Japan, and crafting tours that show a deep knowledge of local communities.\n\nI have a team of four freelance tour guides that I work with in New York, two in Vegas, and one in Tokyo. I ensure that each tour is tailored to the group. On average, I work 60 hours a week. I do tours on top of running the marketing and business operations and ensuring my finances are in order.\n\nThe corporate world, with its predictable rhythms and clear career ladders, still appeals to me. But unless an extraordinary opportunity presents itself, I'm committed to Ultimate Food Tours.\n\nI've learned I'll feel afraid whether I'm launching a business or taking on increased responsibility in a corporate role. The key is recognizing that every career path has its uncertainties, and the bigger risks will have greater payoffs.",

This policy shift comes ahead of the Trump administration.\n\nThis story was updated because it contained an inaccuracy.\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms is reportedly in talks to reincorporate in Texas. Like many large U.S. corporations, the social media giant is incorporated in Delaware, but it might soon be migrating south, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report comes just weeks after Meta announced it would move its key content policy team to Texas. In a video announcement, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized content censorship and moderation and said he wanted to promote free speech and expression. He also said that Texas was one of the best places to do that.\n\n\u201cAs we work to promote free expression, I think that it will help us build trust to do this work in places where there\u2019s less concern about the bias of our teams,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the company reportedly won't be moving their corporate headquarters from California, Meta already has a significant presence in Austin, recently expanding its space downtown to accommodate more than 1,500 employees.\n\nMore: Meta hosts Llama Hackathon at their downtown Austin office on Friday night\n\nIf Meta did relocate to Texas, it would not be the first Silicon Valley company to pull up stakes for the Lone Star State.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise relocated its headquarters from California to Houston in 2020. Oracle also moved from California to Austin in 2020, though it is reportedly considering a move to Nashville in the near future.\n\nElon Musk moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin a few years ago. Then late last year, he announced he would relocate all his remaining companies to Texas after a public dispute with California Gov. Gavin Newsom over a law changing parental notification rules for transgender students.\n\nMusk\u2019s social media platform X \u2014 formerly known as Twitter \u2014 has moved its headquarters to Bastrop, just outside of Austin. His Boring Co.\u2019s headquarters and some SpaceX offices also are now in Bastrop, while SpaceX\u2019s Starbase launch site is in South Texas.\n\nSeveral other tech companies have opened offices in Austin in recent years, including Google, Amazon and Apple.\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.",

The results topped expectations while the company outlined a year ahead that will carry heavy infrastructure costs related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAd impressions delivered across Meta\u2019s portfolio of apps, which include Facebook and Instagram, increased 6% over the end-of-year period while the average price per ad was up 14%. CFO Susan Li said that CPMs, or cost per 1,000 impressions, will continue to lift over time as Meta\u2019s advertising gets more precise and drives more conversions.\n\nWhile the drivers of Meta\u2019s advertising growth were familiar in Q4, much of the discussion centered on newer bets in generative AI. More than 4 million Meta advertisers are now using at least one of the tech firm\u2019s generative AI tools, Li said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPricing growth continued to propel Meta\u2019s core advertising business in Q4 2024, with the average price per ad up 14% around the period that includes the holiday shopping window. The social media giant for some time has tried to balance the ramp up of newer, lower-monetizing surfaces that are popular with users, such as short-form video Reels, with improved precision for mature advertising formats. Meta also recently introduced ads to Threads, a micro-blogging app that competes with Elon Musk\u2019s X, but doesn\u2019t expect Threads advertising will meaningfully contribute to revenue in 2025.\n\nStrong earnings results followed a whirl of media attention around Meta, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s chummier relationship with President Donald Trump, a pullback on fact-checking initiatives and the fast rise of a generative AI platform from China called DeepSeek that has threatened U.S. rivals like OpenAI. The fact-checking retreat has raised some alarms in the advertising community but has not appeared to deliver a material impact on advertiser demand.\n\n\u201cFrom an ad revenue perspective, Meta dominated Q4 by pulling in considerably more revenue than any other quarter in the last two years,\u201d said Forrester Vice President and Research Director Mike Proulx in emailed comments. \u201cThe big question is whether advertisers will stick with Meta in Q1 against a backdrop of heightened brand safety concerns. While they might not like it, they will continue to spend given Meta\u2019s reach and effectiveness.\u201d\n\nMeta has focused its generative AI efforts around open-source technology that other developers can draw on when building their own models. That\u2019s exactly what DeepSeek did, as reported in The New York Times, and Meta sees potential upsides for its own business as AI dominates the agenda.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a number of novel things that [DeepSeek] did that I think we\u2019re still digesting \u2026 they have advances that we will hope to implement in our systems,\u201d said Zuckerberg, who has called 2025 a \u201cdefining\u201d year for AI, on a call discussing the earnings with analysts. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works, whether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nMeta plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on its AI infrastructure bets and hiring this year. Meta AI, its personal assistant, currently reaches about 700 million monthly active users, with leadership projecting that number could reach 1 billion this year.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Assessing AI\u2019s Role in Marketing for 2025, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Go deeper with an exclusive virtual event,, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Learn more \u2794\n\nContinuing to advance generative AI could also convince more advertisers to try out the technology. Meta has steadily rolled out generative AI advertising tools, including image, video and text generators, that are now used by more than 4 million advertisers versus 1 million six months ago.\n\n\u201cThere has been significant early adoption of our first video generation tool that we rolled out in October, Image Animation, with hundreds of thousands of advertisers already using it monthly,\u201d said CFO Li.\n\nAdvantage+ shopping campaigns, part of a larger suite of AI-powered ad products, saw 70% year-over-year growth in Q4, indicating strong demand around the holidays. Advantage+ shopping campaigns have surpassed an annual revenue run-rate of $20 billion, according to Li. Meta is working to streamline access to Advantage+ so advertisers no longer need to choose between running a manual campaign or one powered by the AI offering.",

            "content": "The company broke ground on the initially-$800 million data center back in 2021, and announced that the site's scope would be expanded back in 2022 .\n\nThe Mesa data center was originally planned to come online in 2023, but was likely delayed as part of a broader Meta building pause as it redesigned facilities for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAt the time, Meta said that the facility would span more than 2.5 million square feet (232,300 sq m) across five buildings. Meta told DCD that two of the buildings are currently online.\n\nAround 20,000 tons of steel were erected, including structural steel and joists, and 375,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured. The company said 78 percent of construction waste was diverted to recycling centers, keeping almost 28,474 tons out of landfills.\n\n\"Construction of the Mesa Data Center has resulted in an average of 2,000 skilled trade workers on site at peak, and the facility currently supports more than 200 operational jobs,\" Meta said. \"Once fully built out, this facility will represent an investment of more than $1 billion in the state of Arizona.\"\n\nThe site is expected to support 200 operational jobs.\n\nThe company said that it would provide a $225,000 grant to help cover the cost of college attendance for Mesa residents pursuing STEM certificates and degrees, as part of the Mesa College Promise program. It also put $75,000 towards a multimedia center at The Official Gilbert Public Schools District\u2019s Desert Ridge Junior High.\n\nIt will also support 12 regional water conservation and restoration projects.\n\n\"Arizona is the premier destination for high-tech companies like Meta and we look forward to supporting their success in Mesa,\" Allison Grigg, SVP of Economic Development, Arizona Commerce Authority, said.\n\nMeta plans to spend some $60-65 billion on data centers and broader capex this year, and is developing a 2GW facility in Louisiana. This week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company plans to spend \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" on AI infrastructure over the long term.",

The company increased earnings per share for the quarter by 50% year over year, reaching $8.02. The figure well exceeded Wall Street's expectations of $6.76 per share. Sales for the company hit $48.4 billion, beating the expected $47 billion.\n\nHowever, it wasn't all roses. Meta's VR play Reality Labs is still losing cash, operating at a loss of $5 billion. Guidance for Q1 2025 also disappointed; the midpoint of the company's projected revenue comes in about $1 billion short of expectations.\n\nMeta settles a key lawsuit\n\nThe stock also received a bump from the news that Meta has settled a lawsuit from President Trump. The Facebook parent agreed to pay just $25 million, a drop in the bucket for a company that nets more than 600 times that every quarter.\n\nWhat's next for Meta\n\nDespite the recent DeepSeek news, the company didn't alter course in its quest to build AI infrastructure at an incredible rate. Meta is expecting to spend more than $60 billion in 2025, up roughly 60% from 2024. Time will tell whether this spend will look bloated in retrospect, but in my opinion, any efficiency gains from DeepSeek's technology will only lead to Meta's AI products delivering more value and the bet will pay off.",

Overall, Meta said it grew its daily active users by 5 percent to 3.35 billion in 2024, while sales increased by 22 percent to over $164 billion.\n\nTwo current Meta employees told WIRED they are still upset about the DEI rollbacks announced earlier this month and believe many of their colleagues share the same sentiments. Janelle Gale, the company\u2019s vice president for human resources, said at the time that Meta was eliminating a program that aimed to ensure candidates from underrepresented groups in the tech industry weren\u2019t overlooked in its hiring practices. Cuts were also announced to efforts that promoted Meta working with a diverse slate of outside vendors, such as businesses owned by military veterans or women, as well as to training programs designed to engender respect in the workplace among people with different backgrounds and abilities.\n\nMeta spokesperson Tracy Clayton declined to comment on the revisions to its SEC filing. The company did not immediately respond to a separate request for comment on the concerns raised by some employees.\n\nIn a note to staff earlier this month, Gale cited the changing US legal landscape that is \u201csignaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI.\u201d She added that the term had \u201cbecome charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\"\n\nSome Meta employees say they have yet to notice any impacts internally. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced they are going to do anything at all. Could just remove mention of it and move on,\u201d one staffer says.

But the year after that will be all about monetizing it.\n\nThe company is currently training Llama 4, the next iteration of its large language model, which it expects to release this year. Even though Llama is a free, open-source product, it sits right at the center of Meta\u2019s plans for growth.\n\nUnlike its competitors in the AI horserace, like OpenAI and Anthropic, Meta can pour tens of billions of profits from its other businesses into this effort (and the infrastructure needed to run it), and has lots of ways that it can turn the free product into a revenue firehose.\n\nOn yesterday\u2019s Q4 earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said:\n\n\u201cWe have a really exciting roadmap for this year with a unique vision focused on personalization. We believe that people don \u2019 t all want to use the same AI \u2014 people want their AI to be personalized to their context, their interests, their personality, their culture, and how they think about the world.\u201d\n\nAnytime you hear the word \u201cpersonalization\u201d in a Big Tech product, that means it will be used for ads. None of the big AI players have integrated ads into their chatbot products, but if anyone is prepared for this, it\u2019s Meta.\n\nMeta is an advertising company, after all. For all of FY 2024, the company pulled in over $160 billion in ad revenue, growing 21% year over year.\n\nZuckerberg regularly says that Meta\u2019s pattern is to grow a product to 1 billion users, then monetize:\n\n\u201cWe try to scale them to reach usually a billion people or more. And it\u2019s at that point once they\u2019re at scale that we really start focusing on monetization. So sometimes we\u2019ll experiment with monetization before \u2014 we\u2019re running some experiments with Threads now for example.\u201d\n\nBut Zuckerberg cautioned that the \u201cactual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI Studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs\u201d won\u2019t show up until after 2025.\n\nAnd if Meta\u2019s plans for monetizing AI look anything like its current ad business, you might not even have to use Meta\u2019s chatbot to help fuel the new business.\n\nThe Meta tracking \u201cpixel\u201d has turned billions of internet users into targets for Meta advertising, even if they aren\u2019t users of Meta platforms. The Meta pixel has become such a built-in default on billions of websites that it has caused sensitive data collection from suicide hotlines, hospitals, tax-filing companies, and federal student loan providers. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed due to the ad technology\u2019s misuse.\n\nNobody really knows exactly how the \u201cpersonalization\u201d of AI services will be monetized, but after spending hundreds of billions to build all this fancy, city-sized AI infrastructure, you better believe they will want a return on their investment.",

The company official said about $22 million of the settlement will be directed to Trump's presidential library, with the rest going toward legal fees and the other plaintiffs that joined Trump in suing.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement. \"After Meta pays to play, what does Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?\"\n\nThe settlement amount was not revealed in a letter to the court written on Wednesday by Zuckerberg lawyer K. Winn Allen, who told a judge in Northern California that \"parties have reached an agreement\" in the case, saying that both sides will soon ask for the suit to be dismissed.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe payment represents a significant victory for Trump, and another step in Zuckerberg's efforts to court him.\n\nThe Journal reported that at a November Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump told Zuckerberg that resolving the lawsuit was required for the tech mogul to be \"brought into the tent.\"\n\nZuckerberg was among a number of Silicon Valley executives and companies who contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund . Earlier this month, he ended Meta's fact-checking program, which had long been criticized by Trump supporters. And Zuckerberg promoted Joel Kaplan, a Republican lobbyist, to head the company's global affairs. In addition, Meta tapped Trump ally Dana White for the company's board of directors.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nZuckerberg's embrace of Trump comes after years of tension.\n\nIn a book Trump published before he was elected, he lamented the more than $400 million Zuckerberg donated in 2020 to support local election offices during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump then wrote he is watching Zuckerberg closely, threatening to throw the tech billionaire in prison for \"the rest of his life.\"\n\nUntil recently, lawyers for Meta had been fighting the suit, which they said in court papers was baseless, since \"Meta and its CEOs are private parties\" and the First Amendment applies only to the government's censorship of speech.\n\nTrump's suit claimed Meta only suspended Trump's accounts after being pressured to do so by elected officials, arguing that Meta was then acting at the behest of the government.\n\nIn response, Meta's legal team said Trump was suspended for violating policies against inciting violence, not because of any statement made by a member of Congress.\n\nMeta's attorneys wrote in a legal submission that it made \"little sense to attribute a private party's action to the government based on a handful of statements from individual members of Congress.\"",

Our search was intentionally broad and followed established preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocols as closely as possible37,38. The online search was conducted on 18 January 2019 using keywords targeting population genetic measurements, regardless of the direction of change (for example, \u2018increase\u2019 and \u2018decrease\u2019 were both included as search terms) (Supplementary Information 2.1 and Supplementary Data 4). A total of 80,271 records were retrieved, 78,727 after duplicate removal. We obtained full texts for 70,069 of these records. The remaining records were screened manually via their titles, abstracts and keywords, of which 8,596 were excluded against our inclusion criteria; 62 full texts could not be obtained (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information 2.1). We then performed full text mining in R v.3.5.239, using the packages pdfsearch v.0.2.340, dplyr v.0.8.041, and stringi v.1.3.142 to remove records that did not contain population genetic keywords (Supplementary Information 2.2). This resulted in 34,346 putatively includable studies of genetic diversity change, which were classified into thematic clusters using the package revtools v.0.4.043 (Supplementary Information 2.2).\n\nWe performed initial screening and data extraction for all 34,346 works, followed by a series of re-extraction and data validation steps. Manual screening of studies against inclusion criteria, and extraction of genetic diversity measurements and metadata took place simultaneously by members of the authorship team, via multiple workshops using shared written guidelines (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Information 2.3\u20132.6). Studies were suitable for inclusion in our analysis only if they satisfied all of the following criteria:\n\nThe research must report primary, quantitative, empirical data from a multicellular nonhuman organism.\n\nLaboratory and experimentally manipulated populations were excluded, where these experimental manipulations were for the purpose of testing a hypothesis related to population demography or genetics (note that populations established in controlled conditions for supportive breeding or propagation were potentially includable, such as \u2018captive\u2019 or \u2018agricultural\u2019 populations),\n\nThe time frame of the study plausibly took place over timescales likely to have been impacted by human activities, regardless of whether the study organism was actually impacted by human activities (in general, we targeted genetic diversity changes in the last few hundred years and excluded studies on ancient admixture or expansion in response to events on \u2018geological\u2019 timescales; further detail in Supplementary Information 2.4),\n\nThe study design enabled a temporal comparison of population genetic measurements (for example, samples collected over multiple years) or inference (for example, coalescent genetic studies),\n\nThe study reports a quantitative measurement of within-population \u2018genetic diversity\u2019 (broadly defined), and an associated measurement error and sample size. Genetic diversity statistics were obtained from main texts (including tables and figures) and supplementary materials, but no re-analysis of published datasets was conducted. Summary statistics (mean and s.d.) were calculated from tabulated data where available.\n\nIn addition to recording bibliographic data for each record, we extracted data that would enable us to calculate our effect sizes (see below and Supplementary Information 2.4), as well as corresponding metadata for meta-regression (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Information 2.5 and 2.6). Our dataset included many studies for which the main goal was not an assessment of genetic diversity or change in genetic diversity per se, but which nevertheless reported temporal measures of genetic diversity that otherwise met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis.\n\nWe captured genetic diversity statistics aligned with three possible study designs (see Supplementary Information 2.4): (1) linear measure of change (for example, regression of two or more time points), yielding primarily statistical measurements, such as regression coefficients or t statistics; (2) two timepoint comparison (for example, comparison of two means), yielding primarily pairs of mean diversity estimates; or (3) coalescent analysis, yielding either statistical or genetic measurements, obtained by probabilistic modelling of past effective population sizes using a single sample in time44,45. The latter were uniquely identified in our analysis due to important differences in the underpinning theoretical framework for coalescent analyses. That is, \u2018early\u2019 measures of genetic diversity are not taken from real biological samples, but instead inferred from recent data and principles of genetic inheritance. Further, early time points in coalescent analyses may be identified by authors a priori based on environmental or other non-genetic hypotheses, or post hoc on the basis of substantive patterns in the data.\n\nGenetic diversity change data were recorded alongside corresponding error estimates and sample sizes; all were extracted using the same level of precision as reported in the paper. We also recorded the time frame of the study (early and recent years, used to calculate study duration and study midpoint), plus amount and type of genetic data used (for example, number of loci, genetic marker type, genome). We classified genetic diversity change data into four metric types, aligned with \u2018essential biodiversity variables\u2019 for genetic composition28: (1) variant counts (for example, allelic richness); (2) evenness of variant frequencies (for example, expected heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity); (3) population means of individual-level variation (for example, observed heterozygosity and pedigree inbreeding); and (4) integrated statistics (for example, effective population size; see below).\n\nWe were particularly interested in associations between genetic diversity change and ecological disturbance or conservation management action, so these \u2018impact metadata\u2019 were collected where threats and/or conservation management actions were reported in a paper as plausibly impacting the study population between the sampling time points of the study. In principle, we categorized ecological disturbances as events with potential to impair conditions for the focal species or its habitat, and conservation management actions as human activities intended to improve conditions for the focal species or its habitat. For the latter, we also considered the intensity of conservation management actions (that is, the magnitude of conservation intervention as probably experienced by the focal species). We also collected additional metadata, as the objectives of ecological disturbances are likely to vary across species. For example, disturbance is often intentional for pests and pathogens (for example, population reduction), whereas disturbance of threatened species can include indirect or unintentional consequences of human activity (for example, habitat loss and fragmentation). Brief definitions of the categories that we used for each of these variables are in Extended Data Table 1 and 2 and full definitions are provided in Supplementary Information 2.5.\n\nAdditional moderators that were collected included (Supplementary Information 2.6): taxonomic identity of study species (nomenclature standardized by literature review to align with Open Tree of Life46), country and terrestrial and/or marine realm of the locality where samples were collected, following refs. 36,47,48, along with unique site identifiers in the case of multiple populations reported in a publication. We also collected the threat status of the study species30; generation length of the study species (Supplementary Data 5); and classification of domesticated species or populations considered as pathogens or pests (based on description in the source publication, relevant databases or other published sources).\n\nMany studies reported multiple measurements of genetic diversity that were suitable for inclusion in our analysis. We extracted independent measures of genetic diversity change per publication taking into consideration the sampling scheme of the reported study and analysis of data subsets (Supplementary Information 2.4). Procedures for controlling non-independent data, missing data, infinite confidence intervals (in estimates of effective population size), zero variances, and unconventional study designs are described at Supplementary Information 2.7\u20132.9. After initial extraction, all included studies were re-processed by at least two additional members of a small validation group from the authorship team, to ensure consistency in the collection of genetic and metadata (Supplementary Information 2.10).\n\nSystematic review\n\nFull bibliographic details for each included study were automatically downloaded from the WOS during the original search (see also Supplementary Data 1\u20133). Additional bibliographic metadata were also collected from the WOS, including journal title abbreviations, WOS subject categories for which each journal ranked highest, and the impact factor percentile ranking for each journal within its WOS category for 2020. Publication trends and the characteristics of studies included in our final dataset were summarized visually using the R packages ggplot2 v.3.4.349, treemapify v.2.5.550 and ggridges v.0.5.451. We also explored patterns of co-occurrence and characterized the variation of ecological disturbance and conservation management actions reported across our full dataset, and data subsets of the five most data-rich taxonomic classes. We calculated pairwise Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients (r) among ecological disturbance categories, and conservation management actions, and visualized results in R using corrplot v.0.9252. We also examined relationships among these variables using principal component analysis, visualized with the package factoextra v.1.0.753.\n\nPhylogeny\n\nTo visualize the taxonomic diversity of species in our dataset and their evolutionary relationships, we generated a phylogenetic tree using the R package rotl v.3.0.1254 using Open Tree of Life IDs as described above. Saccharomyces cf. cerevisiae (ott id 7511391) was used as the outgroup. Six species could not be placed in the phylogeny due to unresolved taxonomy: the Japanese mud snail (Batillaria attramentaria), white seabream (Diplodus sargus), a fruit fly (Drosophila pseudoobscura), a sea snail (Euparthenia bulinea), fourfinger threadfin (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and the bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus). The phylogeny was visualized using the R packages ggtree v.3.8.255, ggtreeExtra v.1.10.056, ggimage v.0.3.357 and rphylopic v.1.2.158. Silhouettes of representative organisms for each taxonomic class were downloaded from PhyloPic (https://www.phylopic.org; see Supplementary Information 2.6 for credits). Owing to the taxonomic diversity of species in our study, obtaining a dated tree across all species was not possible and so the topology of the tree was used in modelling.\n\nEffect size extraction and calculation\n\nFor each comparison that satisfied our inclusion criteria, we calculated Hedges\u2019 g* (sometimes referred to as Hedges\u2019 d59 with sample size correction J) as our measure of effect size. Hedges\u2019 g* was selected as the effect size measure as it is based on the standardized mean difference between two values, in our case the \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018recent\u2019 time points, minimizes over-inflation of effect size estimation in studies with sample sizes <20, and outperforms other common effect size measures such as Cohen\u2019s d and Glass\u2019 \u0394 when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated60. All formulae used to evaluate Hedges\u2019 g* and its error are reported in Supplementary Information 2.11.\n\nCalculation of Hedges\u2019 g* requires the sample size and error associated with the measure of genetic diversity change. Depending on the way in which genetic diversity metrics or their summary statistics are calculated, the associated sample size for effect size calculation may be for example, the number of loci, the number of samples, the number of populations or a rarefied sample size. For comparisons based on linear measures of genetic diversity change, which varied in the methods used to determine genetic change, each paper was manually checked to retrieve the appropriate sample size and error. For two timepoint comparisons and comparisons based on coalescent analyses, we followed a hierarchical procedure to establish the sample size to use for each effect size (Supplementary Information 2.11). Multiple error types were reported (for example, s.d. or confidence intervals), and so Hedges\u2019 g* was calculated using published formulae for interconversion of these data types (Supplementary Information 2.11).\n\nFor comparisons where an effect size was calculated, the direction of the effect was determined. We ensured consistent directionality among the following measures of genetic diversity (note that many metrics were recorded in our dataset, and so the abbreviations reported below are summaries only):\n\n(1) Variant counts were all positively associated with genetic diversity: mean of alleles across loci (A), standardized by sample size (A R ), sum of alleles across loci (T A ), total number of private alleles (pA) and number of polymorphic loci (NPL). (2) Variant frequencies: a. Positive: expected heterozygosity (H E ), nucleotide diversity (\u03c0), haplotype diversity (h), Shannon diversity index (H), polymorphic information content (PIC), number of effective alleles (NEA), frequency of an allele of interest (Freq) and mean individual nucleotide p-distance (NPD, occasionally seen in major histocompatibility complex and similar studies). b. Negative: population-level inbreeding coefficient or selfing/outcrossing rate (F IS ), mean relatedness or kinship among individuals (R), band sharing score (BS) and among-population F ST (apF ST ). (3) Individual-level diversity measures: a. Positive: observed heterozygosity (H O ), standardized observed heterozygosity (SH) and mean number of alleles per individual (A i ). b. Negative: individual-level inbreeding coefficient or coancestry (F). (4) Integrated statistics were all positively correlated with genetic diversity: effective population size (N e ), effective number of breeders (N b ), female effective population size (N f ), effective population size estimated from demographic data (N d ), effective population size estimated from a population census, and calculated based on an assumption about the ratio between effective and census population sizes (N c ).\n\nFor comparisons where genetic diversity metric type was recorded as \u2018other\u2019, each paper was manually checked to determine the correct direction of the effect given the context of the metric within the publication and the authors\u2019 interpretation of genetic diversity change as a loss or gain. For negatively correlated metrics, we multiplied the Hedges\u2019 g* effect size by \u22121 to reverse the direction of the effect\u2014that is, across our dataset a positive Hedges\u2019 g* represents an increase in genetic diversity and a negative Hedges\u2019 g* represents a loss of genetic diversity.\n\nAll calculated effect sizes >|4| were manually examined as potential outliers by a single member of the research team, to confirm absence of data entry errors. Considering our wide diversity of statistics, these data were also checked for possible calculation errors, misinterpretation of statistical error (for example, standard error versus s.d.), or other discrepancies. Results of screening of extreme values can be found in Supplementary Information 1.4.\n\nMeta-analysis\n\nWe fitted multi-level Bayesian hierarchical models in the R package MCMCglmm v.2.3461, with paper ID as a random effect for all models to account for non-independence introduced by studies that report multiple, includable effect sizes. Genetic diversity change was modelled per generation by including the z-standardized number of generations for that species (that is, number of years passed between the early and recent time points, divided by generation length) as a fixed effect in all meta-regressions. Unless otherwise stated in Supplementary Information 2.12, all meta-regressions also included a fixed effect of the z-standardized study midpoint (year).\n\nEach model was run for 6,000,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 200,000 and a thinning interval of 5,000, using the weakly informative inverse-gamma prior. We report the posterior mean and the 95% HPD credible intervals for each model set. Estimates with a 95% HPD credible interval excluding zero were considered statistically significant at \u03b1 = 0.05. Model diagnostics were visually checked for no pattern in the trace plots; effective size >1,000 and autocorrelation <0.1 between lag points were both checked using coda v.0.19.462. Chain convergence was confirmed by passing the Heidelberger and Welch\u2019s half-width and stationarity tests in coda. Additionally, each model was independently run three times to calculate a Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic of <1.1 using the potential scale reduction factor. The deviance information criterion (DIC) was obtained for each of the three models, and the model with the lowest DIC was selected for interpretation.\n\nOur base model included fixed and random effects described above (that is, fixed effects = z-standardized midpoint, z-standardized number of generations; random effect = paper ID), although variations of this model underwent sensitivity testing to determine the influence of including phylogeny as an additional random effect, and including extreme values in the dataset (described in Supplementary Information 2.11). The extended heterogeneity statistic63 was calculated for both the base model and the sensitivity testing model that included phylogeny. Extended heterogeneity statistics partition total heterogeneity (I2 total ) into phylogenetic variance (in the phylogenetic model, I2 phylogeny ), study ID variance (I2 study ) and residual variance63,64 (I2 residual ). For the phylogenetic model, we also obtained lambda (phylogenetic signal (H2)) as the variance of the random effect of phylogeny divided by the total variance of all random effects (phylogeny, study ID and residual variance). Total heterogeneity was high, but phylogenetic signal only explained 5.48% of overall variance, so was excluded from further modelling (see also Supplementary Information 1.5); this also allowed for simplification of the model structure. Based on the results of the sensitivity testing (Supplementary Information 1.5), we excluded phylogeny and extreme values from subsequent meta-analytic modelling.\n\nWe assessed publication bias in our meta-analysis using two methods. First, we investigated time-lag bias, where different patterns in genetic diversity change may be reported over the years of publication. Such bias may plausibly occur given that methods for measuring genetic diversity have advanced substantially in recent decades. Therefore, we fitted the final base model with the addition of a z-standardized year of publication fixed effect. Evidence of time-lag bias is inferred if the 95% HPD credible interval of the slope estimate excludes zero. Second, we plotted Hedges\u2019 g* precision against Hedges\u2019 g* in a funnel plot to visualize possible publication bias that can occur if, for example, smaller studies without statistically significant results are not published. We did not observe time-lag bias nor funnel plot asymmetry (Supplementary Information 1.5). Given the high heterogeneity and lack of detectable publication bias in our dataset, we proceeded with meta-regression modelling.\n\nMeta-regressions were conducted to assess the impact of different moderator variables on genetic diversity change. These were broadly categorized into moderators related to: (1) how genetic diversity change is measured (that is, study design); (2) where genetic diversity change is measured and in what species (that is, population context); (3) ecological disturbances (that is, threats); and (4) conservation interventions (that is, conservation management). In meta-regression, the coefficients estimate how each category differs from the nominated reference group, represented by the intercept65. As all moderator variables were categorical, we performed separate meta-regressions for each moderator to avoid the confounding effects of correlations and allow for biologically meaningful interpretation of categorical variables relative to the intercept. For all models, moderator variables were only included if there were 10 or more effect sizes contributing to a category65. All models were run with the weakly informative inverse-gamma prior, the paper ID random effect and the standardized year midpoint and the number of generations over which the study took place (as a measure of study length) as fixed effects (unless otherwise specified), and additional fixed effects described in Supplementary Information 2.12.\n\nInclusion and ethics statement\n\nNo ethical approval or guidance was required as data were collected only from previous studies.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",

This reflects 8-15% year-over-year growth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we are making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025.\n\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation(1). We expect employee compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\n\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\n________________________ (1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\n\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\n\nContacts\n\nInvestors:\n\nKenneth Dorell\n\n[email protected] / investor.atmeta.com\n\nPress:\n\nAshley Zandy\n\n[email protected] / about.fb.com/news/\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is January 29, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone separately confirmed the terms: a $25 million payment from the company, with $22 million going toward a fund for Trump\u2019s presidential library and the balance dedicated to legal fees and other plaintiffs in the case.\n\nThe settlement does not require Meta to admit wrongdoing, Stone said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the settlement.\n\nThe settlement was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeta is at least the second major corporation to pay to settle a Trump lawsuit since he won a second term in the November election. In December, ABC said it would pay $15 million to close out a dispute in which Trump alleged that anchor George Stephanopoulos had defamed him.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol rotunda on Jan. 20. Kenny Holston / Pool via Getty Images\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has worked aggressively to court Trump since the election. He had a prime seat for Trump\u2019s swearing-in this month and hours later hosted a party in Trump\u2019s honor. Meta has overhauled its content moderation policies to more closely align with the Trump administration, including allowing insults against transgender people and ending its independent fact-checking program in the United States. Zuckerberg also promoted a longtime Republican, Joel Kaplan, to be the company's chief of global policy.\n\nTrump has previously been critical of Zuckerberg and Meta. In late August, Trump published a book of photographs in which he said Zuckerberg \u201cwill spend the rest of his life in prison\u201d if he did \u201canything illegal\u201d to influence the presidential election. At the time, Meta declined to comment on the statement.\n\nAfter Trump won the Nov. 5 election, Zuckerberg wished Trump well and donated to his inaugural fund.\n\nMeta, along with nearly every other major tech company, suspended Trump\u2019s social media accounts after the Capitol riot by Trump\u2019s supporters, limiting Trump\u2019s presence online for the final two weeks of his first term.\n\nZuckerberg said in a Jan. 7, 2021, post on Facebook that Trump\u2019s refusal to condemn his supporters who stormed and occupied the Capitol showed that he \u201cintends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s accounts remained locked on Facebook and Instagram until February 2023.",

            "content": "For the past few years at Meta, we\u2019ve marked Data Privacy Day with a recap of our privacy highlights from the prior year. As we look back at our 2024 technology innovations, the common denominator across all of them is a strong privacy foundation. This foundation was only made possible by the profound progress we\u2019ve made as a company during the last six years. In this post, I\u2019d like to reflect on Meta\u2019s privacy evolution during this time.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the wise words of computer scientist Alan Kay: \u201cThe best way to predict the future is to invent it.\u201d This principle captures Meta\u2019s tenacious product culture \u2013 one that pushes us to solve hard problems and build experiences that once seemed like science fiction. Our approach to privacy is no different.\n\nToday, as we work to build for the future of human connection, nearly four billion people across the globe use our products and services. We are keenly aware of the incredible opportunity and deep responsibility we have to manage privacy risk for our community; we\u2019re upholding that by investing our vast engineering capabilities into building cutting-edge privacy technology. We are committed to this work as we help shape the future of data protection.\n\nThe last six years are a testament to this commitment. And they also represent the story of the more than 3,000 Meta employees and countless external experts who continue to support a world class privacy program that underlies each of our products and services and keeps people\u2019s information safe.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Catalyst for Change\n\nThe privacy infrastructure we have today is due, in large part, to the landmark agreement we reached with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2019. As part of that settlement, we agreed to pay a historic $5 billion fine, but even more importantly, it set us on a path to make major structural changes to our operating model and how we build products.\n\nWith a 180-day deadline, we established a new organization within the company to overhaul our privacy program. We seized the opportunity and worked with the best in the business to build a system that would set a new standard for data protection in our industry.\n\nWe had to get this right. That meant rebuilding trust with people and ensuring we embedded the right systems and the right levels of accountability into our product development and data handling processes. This includes oversight by an independent Assessor that is required to identify any gaps or weaknesses in our privacy program design and implementation. The Assessor\u2019s feedback has been instrumental in accelerating our progress and demonstrating that our program is maturing and scaling as intended.\n\nInnovating Amid Rapid Change\n\nFrom the rollout of Oculus Go, our first standalone headset, to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the introduction of the metaverse, or wearables like Ray-Ban Stories (and eventually Orion), the pace of change has been breathtaking. And with it, we\u2019ve rapidly and fundamentally shifted how we approach privacy.\n\nAt the same time, new technology gives rise to new regulations. Today, there are hundreds of data protection laws around the world. Our ability to compete and innovate hinges on how fast we adapt to the everchanging mosaic of legal requirements. That\u2019s why we continue to work closely with regulators, policymakers and other experts to make sure our practices uphold the highest standards of data protection globally.\n\nOne example is Meta\u2019s Reality Labs Policy Advisory Council. This group includes global experts\u2013across a range of areas like privacy, youth, safety and accessibility \u2013 who advise and guide our product and policy development teams within Reality Labs.\n\nAnd yet, despite these advances, the fundamental questions at the heart of privacy remain the same: How do we balance the benefits of technology with the need to protect personal information? How do we create a digital ecosystem that is both innovative and responsible?\n\nThese are the questions that have driven me throughout my tenure, and they are the questions that will continue to shape the future of our industry.\n\nProfound Progress and Gratitude\n\nWe have made profound progress on privacy in a relatively short time. More importantly, our efforts have helped protect billions of people\u2019s personal data.\n\nSince 2019, we\u2019ve invested more than $8 billion in rebuilding Meta\u2019s privacy program and implementing sweeping changes to our data practices. We\u2019ve also strengthened our privacy policies and built new tools to give people even more control of their experiences. Along the way, we\u2019ve created a culture of rigor \u2013 one that leads us to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible and find more effective ways to protect user data.\n\nAnd our product culture and privacy technology have evolved to make us faster, better and more agile. Today, privacy considerations are at the heart of our product development process, and privacy protections are built into each new innovation from the start.\n\nHere are some highlights, some of which are explained in greater depth in this year\u2019s annual Privacy Progress Update:\n\nWe introduced Instagram Teen Accounts , a new experience for teens, guided by parents. Teen Accounts have built-in protections which limit who can contact teens and the content they see and provide new ways for teens to explore their interests.\n\nWe have rolled out default end-to-end encryption for personal messages to the vast majority of our global users on Messenger, bringing additional privacy and security protections to billions of messages. We also introduced view-once functionality to Messenger, giving people the ability to send photos and videos that can only be viewed or replayed once and cannot be saved or screenshotted, ensuring additional privacy for in-the-moment messages.\n\nWe launched a number of privacy features in our Quest line of mixed reality headsets. Beginning with Quest 3S, we introduced a privacy indicator that lets you know when privacy-related features are in use \u2013 and which apps in your library are using them.\n\nWe continued to advance our Privacy Aware Infrastructure , which is crucial to enforcing end-user privacy protections with speed and accuracy at our scale. With this technology, we embed privacy rules directly into code to automate adherence to privacy requirements, which enables us to protect hundreds of millions of pieces of data.\n\nWe made updates to Download Your Information to include data logs, giving people even more data about how they use Facebook. Data Logs include information about how and when you\u2019ve viewed Facebook and recommendations we\u2019ve made based on their activity.\n\nImportantly, we\u2019ve continued to enhance the rigor and speed of our Privacy Review efforts. Privacy Review helps us evaluate new features or data practices for potential privacy risks and develop mitigations to address those risks. Our Privacy Review efforts cover an average of 1,400 products, features and data practices every month. Building on this foundation, we\u2019re leveraging the lessons we learned in building our privacy program to inform how we approach all product compliance efforts across Meta.\n\nLooking Ahead with Optimism\n\nRealizing our company\u2019s mission requires trust \u2013 and we can achieve that only by meeting people\u2019s expectations of how our products work and how we use their data, consistently and without making mistakes. The privacy program we\u2019ve built helps us do just that.\n\nWe\u2019ve made incredible advancements, but I\u2019m proudest of the way we\u2019ve approached these challenges as a team. We\u2019ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry \u2013 engineers, lawyers, privacy experts, policy professionals and product designers \u2013 to build and scale solutions to the most complex privacy and regulatory compliance challenges, preparing us for tomorrow\u2019s inventions.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s still much work to be done. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and new technologies will continue to present both new opportunities and challenges for privacy. I\u2019m more confident than ever that we\u2019re on the right path, and that the progress we\u2019ve made over the past six years will serve as a foundation for even greater achievements in the years to come.",

We are keenly aware of the incredible opportunity and deep responsibility we have to manage privacy risk for our community; we\u2019re upholding that by investing our vast engineering capabilities into building cutting-edge privacy technology. We are committed to this work as we help shape the future of data protection.\u201d\n\nMeta says that its current privacy infrastructure is due in large part to an agreement that it reached with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in 2019. Meta was fined $5 billion for breaches stemming from the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which the CA team posed initially as academic researchers in order to then access and utilize Facebook audience data for targeted political campaigning.\n\nThat forced Meta to implement enhanced data protections, and since then, Meta has been much more cautious about how people\u2019s information can be accessed, and who exactly is able to do so.\n\nMeta\u2019s also been forced to align with evolving data protections in Europe, with the EU Commission looking to get ahead of data misuse, and ensure that EU citizens remain in control of how their personal information is used.\n\nThe combined enforcement and response efforts have seen Meta greatly improve its data protections, and that, hopefully, will also extend to its newer projects, including AI, AR, and VR initiatives.\n\nAnd there are concerns here. Just this week, Meta launched a new initiative that will see your Facebook and Instagram information incorporated into its AI chatbot to personalize its responses.\n\nWhich makes sense, in terms of capitalizing on Meta\u2019s key market advantage, and providing a better user experience. Meta\u2019s also building massive new data centers to store more and more information to power its next-level pushes, and it does seem concerning that a single corporation can gather and maintain this level of data, on billions of people around the world.\n\nThe potential power of that data trove is significant, which is why Meta needs to keep a tight leash on its permissions. But even then, Meta itself has all that information, to use as it sees fit.\n\nIt\u2019s good that others can\u2019t access it as freely as they once could, but still, Meta can, and Meta\u2019s also a big business.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot we can do about that, as that\u2019s the advantage of creating such popular platforms, that so many people use. But while Data Privacy Day is a reminder of these initiatives, it\u2019s also a prompt that social apps do have all this data, and that it can be used to influence you, in various ways.",

The social media giant, then named Facebook after its flagship site, grew to become the leading social media stock.\n\nAdditionally, sites it acquired or created, such as Instagram, Messenger, and Threads, helped cement its dominance. While it has contended with challenges such as its misstep into the metaverse and the rise of TikTok, its stock has generated massive returns in nearly 13 years of trading.\n\nMeta since its IPO\n\nThe stock, now known as Meta Platforms, launched its IPO on May 18, 2012, when the Facebook parent introduced it at a price of $38 per share. At that time, $1,000 would have bought 26 shares, leaving that investor with a little over $17,000 worth of stock today.\n\nHowever, its growth path was not always a smooth journey. The IPO was unusual, as the stock was well into large-cap territory at the time of its launch, attaining a market cap of more than $80 billion on its first day of trading.\n\nMoreover, the company botched the IPO, with both regulators and investors taking legal action against Meta and the IPO's underwriter amid the poor performance.\n\nStill, after more than a year of struggle, Meta stock began moving higher, as it better leveraged its social media leadership to sell ads and grow its daily user base to 3.3 billion, a level moving toward global saturation.\n\nThe only major pullback was in 2021 and 2022, when it attempted to address global saturation by changing the company's name and pivoting into the metaverse. That strategy failed to attract interest, and the stock plunged.\n\nToday, its metaverse segment, Reality Labs, has shifted its focus to artificial intelligence (AI), and with that, investors have bid the stock to record highs.\n\nIndeed, with Meta starting its trading history as a large-cap, it may not earn returns as massive as other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that started trading as small-cap stocks. Still, its growth could continue as it leverages its social media and AI dominance.",

Not only is the stock price ripping to all-time highs ahead of the announcement, but revenue estimates are over 15% higher than last quarter and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates are significantly higher as well. Meta has exceeded earnings expectations four quarters in a row, and the market seems to expect another strong report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta is expected to report an EPS of $6.74 on $46.99 billion in revenue.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO, is fully invested in the AI transformation sweeping through tech. Just last week, he stated that Meta plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion in artificial intelligence projects, including but not limited to a massive new data center in Manhattan.\n\nIn the previous earnings call, Meta chief financial officrer Susan Li offered words of encouragement for the future: \u201cWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38 billion to $40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025.\u201d\n\nAfter the announcement of China's DeepSeek AI, which sent companies like NVIDIA (NVDA) plummeting, two notable standouts moved in the opposite direction and surged to the upside\u2014Meta Platforms (META) and Apple (AAPL). Whether or not this was a liquidity rotation into big tech that was less tightly tied to the actual AI chip space, the market clearly favored Meta into the initial sell-off and beyond. In just over 24 hours, we will get a better picture of Meta's quarterly figures and hopefully more commentary around 2025 plans as well.\n\nLooking at the implied volatility of the options cycle for this week, we can see a pretty large expected stock price move relative to the notional value of the stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, we're seeing a +/- $48.27 expected stock price move against the current price of $676. This is about 7% of the stock price, which puts Meta Platforms on the higher end of the typical 5%-10% stock price range we typically see for earnings announcements. Looking to the March expiration cycle, we can see a +/- $75.71 expected move. That means this week's announcement makes up for about two-thirds of the implied volatility priced into the next few months.\n\n\n\nBullish on META stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on META stock for earnings, it feels almost certain that you'd need to see a big earnings beat from both an EPS and revenue perspective. Both figures are higher, but the stock price is surging to all-time highs as I type. It appears the stock market is very bullish on the tech giant ahead of earnings, but numbers don't lie\u2014we'll need to see a big earnings beat to see this thing really take off to the upside.\n\n\n\n\n\nBearish on META stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bearish on META stock for earnings, any sort of EPS or revenue blunder, or a weak outlook for 2025, could stifle the rally we're seeing this week. If there is a big surprise miss, we could see a big stock price sell-off, considering the highs the stock has reached this week already.

You probably already know that Meta is one of the most successful XR vendors worldwide. In fact, in 2024, the company captured more than 70% of the VR/AR market share. But what makes Meta\u2019s ecosystem a great choice for businesses?\n\nLately, Meta, like many other XR innovators, has increased its focus on the enterprise space, recognizing a growing demand for virtual, mixed, and augmented reality solutions that enhance training, collaboration and product design.\n\nHere, we\u2019re going to introduce you to the top Meta Quest enterprise features, capabilities and use cases that make Meta an incredible partner for evolving companies.\n\nNeed more help deciding if Meta is the right partner for your VR journey? Check out our complete Guide to Meta Quest for enterprise users here , or use our comparison guide for insights into how Meta stacks up against the top VR competitors.\n\nEvaluating Meta Quest: Enterprise-Focused Features\n\nLet\u2019s start by evaluating Meta Quest device features, and key ecosystem components that make Meta such a great choice for companies exploring VR workplace solutions. First, if you\u2019re looking for the ultimate VR headset for corporate environments, Meta offers a range of high-quality AR/VR headsets, delivering exceptional comfort and ease of use, for a fraction of the price of other vendors.\n\nProducts like the Meta Quest 3 and even the Quest 3S make business-wide adoption of VR solutions simple and cost-effective. In fact, you\u2019ll struggle to find cheaper headsets anywhere with the same features. Beyond that, Meta\u2019s headsets support:\n\nWireless, standalone capabilities\n\nUnlike other companies such as Varjo and HTC VIVE, which primarily offer \u201ctethered\u201d devices, Meta focuses on convenient, standalone functionality. The Quest Pro, Quest 3, and Quest 3S all work without a connection to a computer, thanks to powerful built-in technology like the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor.\n\nAlthough this means you need to watch your headset\u2019s battery life, employees can enjoy unrestricted movement during collaboration and training sessions. Plus, with a Meta Quest headset, you don\u2019t have to worry about investing in top-of-the-line computer systems.\n\nStrong Tracking Capabilities\n\nAll Meta Quest devices feature inside-out tracking capabilities, which means they can identify the movements of your hands, your body, your head, and your position in a room. This feature is excellent if you\u2019re planning on using Meta Quest VR for corporate training or product design.\n\nUnfortunately, the only Quest headset to offer eye tracking is the Quest Pro \u2013 which is now discontinued, but there\u2019s a good chance Meta will add eye tracking capabilities to future products. Already, it\u2019s experimenting with advanced tracking solutions, like EMG wrist bands \u2013 introduced with the Meta Orion prototype.\n\nSpatial Audio and Immersive Environments\n\nWhen you\u2019re evaluating Meta Quest devices, you\u2019ll notice they all support spatial audio technology \u2013 allowing them to deliver 3D soundscapes that boost your immersion in virtual environments. For training simulations, and those using Meta VR for office collaboration, spatial audio boosts the realism of virtual experiences.\n\nBeyond that, Meta makes it easy to create unique immersive environments for countless Meta Quest business applications. You can design meeting rooms in apps like Horizon Workrooms and take advantage of exceptional visuals, audio capabilities, and even haptic feedback.\n\nIntegration with Existing Systems: The Quest Software Ecosystem\n\nOne thing that really stands out to most business users when they\u2019re evaluating Meta Quest for enterprise use cases \u2013 is the Meta software ecosystem. Although countless other companies are working on developing robust \u201capp markets\u201d for headsets \u2013 (Google even announced its own Android XR system in 2024), Meta still has the most variety to offer.\n\nThe Horizon marketplace offers access to a huge range of intuitive tools for productivity, product design (CAD development), and collaboration. There are pre-built Meta Quest productivity tools, like Horizon Workrooms (though they lack extensive collaboration features). However, you can also access apps like Zoom, and Microsoft Teams for immersive meetings.\n\nMeta even recently updated its partnership with Microsoft, to introduce new, simpler ways for enterprise users to access office apps on their Quest 3 or Quest 3S headset.\n\nThe open nature of the Meta Horizon OS system also means that you can easily extend Meta Quest enterprise functions with custom-built apps and tools. Meta makes it easy to create VR experiences with existing platforms like Unity and Unreal. Plus, it offers the comprehensive Meta Quest for Business subscription package, which allows companies to streamline VR deployment, track device health, install custom apps on devices, and more.\n\nEvaluating Meta Quest: Security and Data Management\n\nAs companies continue to embrace extended reality for collaboration, corporate training, product development, and even customer experience, evaluating Meta Quest solutions for security and data management is becoming increasingly crucial.\n\nFortunately, Meta understands its customers\u2019 security and compliance concerns. The Meta Quest for Business subscription plan comes with various tools companies can use to implement privacy protocols, use access controls, and even remotely wipe devices.\n\nManagers can restrict access to certain apps, deploy standardized settings across multiple devices remotely with bulk configuration, and even apply passwords to headsets. Plus, they can push or remove applications across devices as necessary, all from a centralized environment.\n\nMeta\u2019s Quest for Business service also allows for integrations with third-party MDM providers, such as Invanti, Microsoft Intune, and VMware Workspace One. Plus, Meta promises to keep all data collected and stored by businesses safe, with SOC 2-compliant security and privacy standards.\n\nThe Versatility of Meta Quest: Applications by Industry\n\nFinally, one of the main reasons you might choose Meta\u2019s Quest ecosystem as your enterprise VR solution is that it\u2019s highly versatile. Meta\u2019s hardware and software solutions can adapt to a wide range of applications and specific industry needs. Just some of the Meta Quest use cases for enterprise users worth considering include:\n\nMeta Quest for Healthcare\n\nCompanies in the healthcare industry have been using Meta Quest devices and applications for some time now for everything from training to enhancing patient care and drug development. In 2024, a celebrity doctor even said that the Meta Quest 3 is revolutionizing NHS upskilling.\n\nMeta gives medical professionals flexible, easy-to-use headsets and versatile software applications that can allow medical professionals to practice complex procedures with minimal risk. Plus, Meta Quest supports a range of mental health applications, such as virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for treating anxiety, PTSD, and phobias.\n\nMeta Quest for Retail and E-commerce\n\nIn retail and ecommerce, companies can leverage Meta Quest devices and custom virtual environments to create product showcases, onboarding experiences, and online shopping spaces. Retailers can create immersive environments where customers explore virtual stores or test products without leaving their homes.\n\nWith Meta\u2019s pass-through capabilities, companies could even allow customers to view what certain products might look like in their homes. Training retail staff is another valuable application. Employees can practice customer interactions or learn about product details and troubleshooting strategies through interactive VR modules.\n\nMeta Quest VR for Corporate Training, Meetings, and More\n\nIn corporate environments, the Meta Quest ecosystem of headsets and flexible software options gives businesses an incredible way to enhance collaboration, productivity, and training. Teams can host VR meetings in Horizon Workrooms or Microsoft Teams, or use dedicated apps for brainstorming, presentations, and even product design.\n\nCompanies can use VR for virtual onboarding, creating digital twins of office environments and the tools teams use every day. They can even build comprehensive VR training sessions, with simulations that boost soft and hard skills. For instance, Johnson and Johnson\u2019s VR training efforts led to employees scoring 233% higher on tests than their colleagues using traditional training tools.\n\nEvaluating Meta Quest: Is it Right for your Business?\n\nSo, is the Meta Quest ecosystem right for your company? With powerful yet affordable headsets, flexible software options, and even a dedicated MDM solution for security and compliance, Meta makes it easy for enterprises to dive into the world of extended reality.\n\nFor those who want flexible, scalable, and secure solutions for collaboration, productivity, and virtual training, evaluating Meta Quest devices and tools makes a lot of sense.",

One of the areas we\u2019re starting to focus on is new features that provide information and recommendations tailored to individuals.\n\nMemory Boost\n\nAt the close of last year, we began to gradually roll out a new feature that lets Meta AI remember certain details that you share with it in 1:1 chats on WhatsApp and Messenger, which may help it personalize future responses so they\u2019re more useful and relevant to you.\n\nYou can tell Meta AI to remember certain things about you (like that you love to travel and learn new language), and it can also pick up important details based on context. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re hungry for breakfast and ask Meta AI for some ideas. It suggests an omelette or a fancy frittata, and you respond in the chat to let Meta AI know that you\u2019re a vegan. Meta AI can remember that information and use it to inform future recipe recommendations.\n\nWe\u2019re rolling this out to Meta AI on Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp for iOS and Android in the US and Canada. Meta AI will only remember certain things you tell it in 1:1 conversations (not group chats), and you can delete its memories at any time.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nA More Personal Touch\n\nWe\u2019re also rolling out a greater level of personalization for Meta AI on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. Delivering great content recommendations is an important part of what makes Facebook and Instagram valuable for people around the globe \u2013 and it\u2019s been driven by AI for a while. Now, we\u2019re extending this level of personalization to Meta AI so that your assistant can respond with information that\u2019s relevant for you.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for something fun to do with your family this weekend and you ask Meta AI to suggest something. Based on the home location you\u2019ve listed as part of your Facebook profile, recent views of reels featuring live performances by various country artists and its memory that you have a partner and two young kids, Meta AI might suggest tickets for that weekend\u2019s country music show at your local arena and reservations at a local brunch spot.\n\nWe\u2019re rolling out this feature on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram in the US and Canada.\n\nWe regularly introduce new features for all of our products to find out what works and what doesn\u2019t for our communities.

            "content": "Mariana Olaizola Rosenblat /\n\nJan 27, 2025\n\nComposite: Mark Zuckerberg announces changes to Meta's policies. Source\n\nMeta has never been a paragon of principle. From its careless handling of users\u2019 personal data to its acquiescence in the face of foreign authoritarian governments\u2019 censorship demands, Meta has provided many reasons to doubt its commitment to human rights. But for a time, the company made what seemed like a good-faith effort to improve its track record. Now, instead of continuing to lead his company on the path to progress, Meta\u2019s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has chosen to disregard longstanding human rights norms in favor of a simplistic \u2014 and politically expedient \u2014 approach to free speech.\n\nWhy human rights are relevant\n\nHuman rights are minimum standards meant to protect individuals against egregious treatment \u2014 actions that violate people\u2019s ingrained sense of basic fairness. Those who live in democratic societies tend to take these rights for granted. We expect that those who intentionally inflict harm on others will face consequences, but only after being afforded due process, including an opportunity to contest the charges against them.\n\nHuman rights standards don\u2019t guarantee a perfect world, as it is common for some rights to come into conflict. Rather, they comprise a system of norms for balancing different rights and interests in a way that respects the fundamental dignity of every human being.\n\nWith this focus on basic protections, these norms have gained wide acceptance \u2014 most countries, including the United States, have ratified the core international treaties that form the backbone of the human rights system. Many businesses, including Meta, have also embraced these norms. On its website the company expresses its commitment to \u201cchampion respect for human rights in every action we take and every product we build.\u201d\n\nHow Meta is breaching its commitment\n\nBut last week, Zuckerberg announced that his company will no longer work to detect abuses of its platforms other than \u201chigh-severity violations\u201d of content policy, such as those involving illicit drugs, terrorism, and child sexual exploitation. The clear implication is that the company will no longer strive to police its platform against other harmful content, including hate speech and targeted harassment. Zuckerberg\u2019s rationale is that trying to root out such content at scale led to \u201ctoo many mistakes and too much censorship.\u201d He added that Meta needed to \u201cget back to [its] roots\u201d of protecting free speech. But this justification, even though it alludes to the fundamental right of freedom of expression, does not actually stand up to scrutiny under human rights standards.\n\nWhile freedom of expression is a widely recognized human right, it is subject to certain limitations that protect other rights or societal interests, such as protecting people against imminent violence. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a legally binding treaty, everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including seeking, receiving, and imparting information and ideas. But the treaty acknowledges that the exercise of this right may be limited if it is necessary to protect \u201cthe rights or reputations of others.\u201d Further, limitations on expression are actually required when the speech constitutes \u201cadvocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence.\u201d\n\nThe US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment sets a different limit on free speech, preventing the government from restricting many kinds of speech, including those that incite discrimination or hostility. This is why the US government entered a reservation to Article 20 of the ICCPR. But the First Amendment binds the government rather than private entities, which have greater latitude to protect their customers against hate speech and targeted harassment.\n\nIndeed, corporations can and should respect human rights norms. Meta, in particular, has explicitly vowed to uphold those norms and use this international legal framework to develop its operating principles. Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to prioritize free speech at the expense of countering hate speech and incitement to discrimination is therefore out of step with human rights standards and a breach of his public-facing commitments.\n\nThe need for nuance\n\nHuman rights law makes a distinction between hate speech and merely offensive speech. The prohibition of hate speech is meant to protect individuals against targeted discrimination and hostility, not to prevent the discussion of controversial topics or shield belief systems and institutions from criticism. Thus, statements like \u201cdemocracy is a worthless system\u201d or \u201call religion is garbage\u201d are arguably allowed under human rights doctrine, while threats against people based on their sexual orientation (e.g., \u201cif you are gay, you don\u2019t deserve to live\u201d) or dehumanizing slurs meant to incite hatred against a racial group (e.g., let\u2019s deport all Jews to concentration camps\u201d) are not.\n\nMeta elides this distinction, now reportedly allowing certain hate speech when it relates to a controversial topic such as transgender rights. The company deleted a line in its content policies that stated hate speech \u201ccreates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.\u201d Yet removing that language from its policies doesn\u2019t erase the evidence \u2014 from Myanmar, Ethiopia, and elsewhere \u2014 that hate speech is often a precursor to massive violations, including genocide.\n\nInstead of challenging the company\u2019s unfortunate retreat on human rights, Meta\u2019s Oversight Board, an advisory body the company created to guide it in applying human rights norms, issued an ill-considered quasi-endorsement of Meta\u2019s recent announcement. Rather than being quick to \u201cwelcome\u201d Meta\u2019s \u201crenewed push for free speech in 2025\u201d and its new approach to fact-checking, the Board should have taken the time to thoroughly analyze all the new changes under human rights law.\n\nReturning to fundamental principles\n\nIt\u2019s not too late for members of the Oversight Board and others within the company to challenge Meta\u2019s ill-advised change of course and urge it to redouble its commitment to fundamental human rights principles. Zuckerberg was right to point out that translating human rights norms into scalable content moderation algorithms is very challenging and will almost certainly remain imperfect. But Meta previously vowed to try, and we should hold the company to its word.",

Similarly, while I do my best to cook and eat as ethically as I can, I could still do better when it comes to consuming meat and other factory-farmed, climate-change-hastening food goods; and while I try to shop small, vintage, and sustainably as often as I can, I also own an iPhone, among various other capitalist-hellscape-hewn products (never mind that I can\u2019t seem to avoid putting money into Jeff Bezos\u2019s pocket every time my toothpaste runs out or my dog needs kibble).\n\nWhen it comes to social media, though, seeing the men who made the apps that helped me build my out, queer life flanking our country\u2019s most powerful bigot at his inauguration was simply a bridge too far.

This included ending Meta\u2019s \u201cDiverse Slate Approach,\u201d its practice of considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups for open jobs, the news outlet explained.\n\nMeta will also disband its DEI team, eliminate its equity and inclusion training programs and end its supplier diversity efforts, the memo said.\n\nThe term DEI has \u201cbecome charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others,\u201d Gale wrote.\n\nWhile Meta previously ended its representational goals for women and ethnic minorities, \u201cwe want to eliminate any impression\u201d that Meta decisions are based on race and gender, the memo added.\n\nOn the day the announcement was made, Blind posted an initial poll asking employees whether they thought the decision was the right one. In that survey, which had more than 4,700 participants, around 60% responded in favor of the decision, Blind said.\n\nA week later, in this survey, respondents were clearly split on whether DEI had a positive or negative impact: 44% agreed DEI increased diversity, fostered innovation and/or improved brand image, while 38% believed DEI led to reverse discrimination against majority workers and/or hindered a performance-driven work environment. Seventeen percent said they were unsure.\n\nThe memo came three days after Meta ended its third-party fact-checking. According to the Blind survey, employees were similarly polarized on this decision: 42% opposed it, while 36% supported it.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s actions follow a parade of high-powered corporations \u2014 Walmart, Ford, Lowes, Harley-Davidson and John Deere, among them \u2014 that shifted their DEI efforts last year.\n\nOn Friday, Target joined the group, announcing it would be ending its DEI programs.\n\nTarget\u2019s announcement came in the wake of a flurry of executive orders President Donald Trump signed during his first week in office, including orders aimed at suppressing public- and private-sector DEI initiatives.",

            "content": "\u201cSociable\u201d is the latest commentary on important social media developments and trends from industry expert Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media Today.\n\nIt may not have reached a billion users just yet, but Meta has decided to launch ads on Threads anyway, with initial testing to begin with selected users/brands in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nAs explained by Meta:\n\n\u201cStarting today, a small number of advertisers will test ads in Threads to help campaigns go further by reaching the growing Threads community. Businesses will be able to extend their existing Meta ad campaigns to Threads - without the need for bespoke creative or additional resourcing - by simply checking a box in Ads Manager. This can help businesses reach more people in more places across Meta\u2019s family of apps and can improve advertiser outcomes.\u201d\n\nI mean, no one is actually that surprised though, right?\n\nMeta did initially suggest that it wouldn\u2019t look to launch ads in Threads until the app reached a billion users, though initial Threads ad formats were spotted in testing in August last year. Some advertisers have also noticed that Threads has appeared as a placement option in Ads Manager, so it has seemed like Meta\u2019s been moving in this direction for a little bit.\n\nAnd with Threads now up to 300 million monthly active users, and gaining momentum, it seemed inevitable that the ads would be coming.\n\nIt might be a little sooner than some had expected/hoped, but ads were always coming. We\u2019re all pretty attuned to sponsored posts like this in social feeds by now either way. Right?\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m not sure Meta needs to angle their messaging in such a hopefully enthusiastic way:\n\n\u201cPeople come to Meta for a personalized experience that helps them discover businesses and content they love - ads are an essential part of enabling this.\u201d\n\nYeah, that sounds like something that a Meta sales chief would declare in a motivational push to the ad sales team, while Threads chief Adam Mosseri has also remarked that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll closely monitoring this test before scaling it more broadly, with the goal of getting ads on Threads to a place where they are as interesting as organic content.\u201d\n\nThe reception Mosseri envisions probably is not going to happen, though I respect the endeavor, and the ethos with which you\u2019re trying to sell this to users. I don\u2019t think that anyone will buy it, but cool that you\u2019re looking to lean into the concept that ads are actually good, and people will actually like them more this time.\n\nThough again, we are all attuned to promotions, and we all know that they\u2019re a part of the modern web experience. So I doubt there\u2019ll be any significant backlash either way.\n\nMeanwhile, for advertisers, ads on Threads will be \u201cbacked by Meta\u2019s proven ads systems,\u201d and as Meta notes, it\u2019ll be easy to extend your existing Facebook and IG campaigns to Threads via a checkbox in your campaign set-up.\n\nMeta\u2019s also expanding its inventory filter to Threads ads as well, which will enable advertisers \u201cto control the sensitivity level of the organic content that their ads appear next to.\u201d\n\nFinally, users will also be able to control the ads that they see in the app, if they choose, and in combination, these additional measures should enable greater control and audience relevance.\n\nAnd with Threads on track to surpass X as the real-time social app of choice, Threads ads are going to appeal to many brands, and there will be high demand for Meta\u2019s latest ad product. Which will ultimately bring in more money for the company, and with CEO Mark Zuckerberg also pledging $65 billion in spending on AI projects this year, it is going to need it.\n\nThat, in itself, could be the justification for Meta pulling the trigger on Threads ads earlier than expected.\n\nWhatever the logic, it\u2019s another ad consideration for your planning, and you can expect to see Meta moving to make Threads ads available in more regions pretty fast.",

            "content": "Meta\u2019s looking to enhance its AI assistant with new memory features, that will give it more capacity to recall and refine its responses based on your personal preferences.\n\nAs explained by Meta:\n\n\u201cWhile Meta AI is on track to become the most used AI assistant, our vision is to make it one of the most personalized AI assistant experiences ever created. At the close of last year, we began to gradually roll out a new feature that lets Meta AI remember certain details that you share with it in 1:1 chats on WhatsApp and Messenger, which may help it personalize future responses so they\u2019re more useful and relevant to you.\u201d\n\nSo as you can see in the above example, Meta\u2019s building in more personal tracking tools to customize your Meta AI responses. So if you tell the chatbot that you\u2019re, say, vegan, it will remember that in future, and only recommend vegan recipes.\n\nMeta\u2019s also enabling recall from your Facebook and IG profiles for further customization:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for something fun to do with your family this weekend and you ask Meta AI to suggest something. Based on the home location you\u2019ve listed as part of your Facebook profile, recent views of reels featuring live performances by various country artists and its memory that you have a partner and two young kids, Meta AI might suggest tickets for that weekend\u2019s country music show at your local arena and reservations at a local brunch spot.\u201d\n\nWhich is cool, I guess, but also a little creepy, and another reminder that Meta\u2019s tracking everything that you do in its apps, in order to refine and improve its other services.\n\nWhich many people have issues with, which is why Meta now offers explicit controls for ad tracking and preferences. As such, Meta\u2019s also keen to note that Meta AI isn\u2019t tracking everything that you enter into it:\n\n\u201cMeta AI will only remember certain things you tell it in 1:1 conversations (not group chats), and you can delete its memories at any time.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly those \u201ccertain\u201d things are, Meta doesn\u2019t say, but essentially, the system will be geared around refining its responses based on your preferences, so it\u2019ll only be logging details on elements that relate to such.\n\nThough that could be a lot of things.\n\nI mean, theoretically, if Meta wants its AI to be as personalized as possible, it will eventually be tracking your dietary choices, search habits, sexual preference, and basically every other habit you may have, in order to align with exactly what you\u2019re seeking.\n\nAnd Meta probably knows a lot of this about you already, with previous reports suggesting that Facebook knows you better than your closest human relationships. But Meta won\u2019t be building all of that back-end data into Meta AI, so presumably this will be a separate data stack, built for Meta AI only.\n\nBut then again, if Meta truly wanted to personalize its systems, and users really want that level of customization\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Meta\u2019s building huge AI data centers to power this effort, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently committing to $65 billion in capital spending on AI this year.\n\nThat\u2019s, uh, a lot of data that Meta\u2019s tracking, which could be a concern?\n\nI don\u2019t know, it seems like all of the previous worries about Meta taking in vast amounts of data, and using that for whatever purpose it sees fit, have gone out the window now that it\u2019s doubling down on AI, and there\u2019s a market demand to build AI systems as fast as possible, to ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of the tech.\n\nWhich may not even be true now, given the sudden rise of Chinese AI assistant app DeepSeek, which uses a totally different approach to AI training and data usage, and arguably produces better, faster results.\n\nMeta undoubtedly has the lead in terms of user data, with more information on more people than any other company in history, and that could be a major market advantage for the company. But that would also put Meta at risk of further regulation, given past investigations related to how it uses people\u2019s data, and what responsibilities it has in protecting and responsibly utilizing such.\n\nIf Meta goes too far, regulators could sound the alarm, particularly in Europe, which is already restricting Meta\u2019s AI roll out in order to assess the privacy implications.\n\nAnnouncing these new personalization elements is unlikely to ease those concerns. But then again, maybe that\u2019s why Zuck is so keen to get in the Trump Administration\u2019s good graces.\n\nMeta says that it\u2019s currently rolling this out to Meta AI on Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp in the U.S. and Canada.",

Supply chain security firm Snyk, on the other hand, has assigned it a critical severity rating of 9.3.\n\n\"Affected versions of meta-llama are vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data, meaning that an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending malicious data that is deserialized,\" Oligo Security researcher Avi Lumelsky said in an analysis earlier this week.\n\nThe shortcoming, per the cloud security company, resides in a component called Llama Stack, which defines a set of API interfaces for artificial intelligence (AI) application development, including using Meta's own Llama models.\n\nSpecifically, it has to do with a remote code execution flaw in the reference Python Inference API implementation, was found to automatically deserialize Python objects using pickle, a format that has been deemed risky due to the possibility of arbitrary code execution when untrusted or malicious data is loaded using the library.\n\n\"In scenarios where the ZeroMQ socket is exposed over the network, attackers could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted malicious objects to the socket,\" Lumelsky said. \"Since recv_pyobj will unpickle these objects, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution (RCE) on the host machine.\"\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure on September 24, 2024, the issue was addressed by Meta on October 10 in version 0.0.41. It has also been remediated in pyzmq, a Python library that provides access to the ZeroMQ messaging library.\n\nIn an advisory issued by Meta, the company said it fixed the remote code execution risk associated with using pickle as a serialization format for socket communication by switching to the JSON format.\n\nThis is not the first time such deserialization vulnerabilities have been discovered in AI frameworks. In August 2024, Oligo detailed a \"shadow vulnerability\" in TensorFlow's Keras framework, a bypass for CVE-2024-3660 (CVSS score: 9.8) that could result in arbitrary code execution due to the use of the unsafe marshal module.\n\nThe development comes as security researcher Benjamin Flesch disclosed a high-severity flaw in OpenAI's ChatGPT crawler, which could be weaponized to initiate a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against arbitrary websites.\n\nThe issue is the result of incorrect handling of HTTP POST requests to the \"chatgpt[.]com/backend-api/attributions\" API, which is designed to accept a list of URLs as input, but neither checks if the same URL appears several times in the list nor enforces a limit on the number of hyperlinks that can be passed as input.\n\nThis opens up a scenario where a bad actor could transmit thousands of hyperlinks within a single HTTP request, causing OpenAI to send all those requests to the victim site without attempting to limit the number of connections or prevent issuing duplicate requests.\n\nDepending on the number of hyperlinks transmitted to OpenAI, it provides a significant amplification factor for potential DDoS attacks, effectively overwhelming the target site's resources. The AI company has since patched the problem.\n\n\"The ChatGPT crawler can be triggered to DDoS a victim website via HTTP request to an unrelated ChatGPT API,\" Flesch said. \"This defect in OpenAI software will spawn a DDoS attack on an unsuspecting victim website, utilizing multiple Microsoft Azure IP address ranges on which ChatGPT crawler is running.\"\n\nThe disclosure also follows a report from Truffle Security that popular AI-powered coding assistants \"recommend\" hard-coding API keys and passwords, a risky piece of advice that could mislead inexperienced programmers into introducing security weaknesses in their projects.\n\n\"LLMs are helping perpetuate it, likely because they were trained on all the insecure coding practices,\" security researcher Joe Leon said.\n\nNews of vulnerabilities in LLM frameworks also follows research into how the models could be abused to empower the cyber attack lifecycle, including installing the final stage stealer payload and command-and-control.\n\n\"The cyber threats posed by LLMs are not a revolution, but an evolution,\" Deep Instinct researcher Mark Vaitzman said. \"There's nothing new there, LLMs are just making cyber threats better, faster, and more accurate on a larger scale. LLMs can be successfully integrated into every phase of the attack lifecycle with the guidance of an experienced driver. These abilities are likely to grow in autonomy as the underlying technology advances.\"\n\nRecent research has also demonstrated a new method called ShadowGenes that can be used for identifying model genealogy, including its architecture, type, and family by leveraging its computational graph. The approach builds on a previously disclosed attack technique dubbed ShadowLogic.\n\n\"The signatures used to detect malicious attacks within a computational graph could be adapted to track and identify recurring patterns, called recurring subgraphs, allowing them to determine a model's architectural genealogy,\" AI security firm HiddenLayer said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\"Understanding the model families in use within your organization increases your overall awareness of your AI infrastructure, allowing for better security posture management.\"",

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nHere\u2019s the scene: I\u2019m wearing Meta\u2019s latest Ray-Ban glasses with a new feature called Live AI, which can answer questions about the world around you. I\u2019m preparing for a four-hour road trip to my in-laws for the Christmas holiday. I\u2019m preplanning the next day\u2019s breakfast because I\u2019m 99.9 percent certain I will have no brain cells to concoct an edible one at 5AM. I don\u2019t even know if I have anything to make a meal with. I open the fridge door and say, \u201cHey Meta, start Live AI.\u201d Suddenly, John Cena\u2019s voice is in my ear telling me that a Live AI session has begun.\n\n\u201cWhat breakfast can I make with the ingredients in my fridge?\u201d I ask.\n\nThe inside is a sad sight with month-old Thanksgiving leftovers, a carton of eggs, soda, condiments, a tub of Greek yogurt, and a big jug of maple syrup. Meta-AI-as-John-Cena replies that I can make a \u201cvariety of breakfast dishes,\u201d such as \u201cscrambled eggs, omelets, or yogurt parfaits.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, there is not a single fresh fruit with which to make a parfait. The egg carton has two eggs in it. My spouse put an empty milk carton back in the fridge, meaning scrambled eggs and omelets are also out. My stomach rumbles, reminding me I skipped lunch. I bail on the breakfast idea and instead open the freezer door and ask what kind of dinner I can make with the ingredients inside. It\u2019s mostly a bunch of frozen pizzas, an assortment of frozen veggies, and hamburger buns. I\u2019m told, \u201cfrozen meals, stir-fries, and casseroles.\u201d\n\nI decide to order in for dinner. It\u2019ll be a drive-through breakfast on the road.\n\nThis is the issue with Live AI. More often than not, I don\u2019t know when to use it. When I do, the answers I get are too obvious to be helpful.\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe pitch for Live AI is it allows you to speak to an AI assistant as you would a friend. While it\u2019s similar in function to the glasses\u2019 multimodal AI feature, you don\u2019t have to constantly prompt the AI. It (supposedly) knows when you\u2019re talking to it. You can also string together multiple queries and follow-up questions. If you\u2019re in a cooking class and something looks a bit off, you\u2019d flag the instructor and they\u2019d look at the mess in your pan and tell you what you did wrong and how to fix it. This is kind of meant to be a version of that but with an incorporeal AI that lives in your glasses. It sees what you see and can help you out in real time.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool concept. But I was stumped when it came time to use Live AI without guardrails. Whenever a question pops into my head, I automatically reach for my phone. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trained to do for over 10 years. The first and biggest hurdle to using Live AI was remembering it was an option.\n\nDamn, I would\u2019ve never thought of reading a book on my TBR list. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThe second problem was knowing when Live AI might be more useful than a quick Google search. Meta suggested I try scenarios involving fashion and cooking. I already told you how my cooking queries went. So, I asked the AI what color combinations I should try with a set of multicolored pastel press-on nails.\n\nThe AI suggested a \u201ccombination of pastel colors\u201d would \u201ccomplement the pink nails nicely.\u201d I asked which of the books on my shelf I should read. The AI reminded me it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have personal preferences or opinions\u201d but that I should \u201cread a book that interests [me] or one that [I\u2019ve] been meaning to read for a while.\u201d Dissatisfied, I asked which of the books was most highly acclaimed. It suggested I look that up online. I tried a few more scenarios and was left wondering: why would I ever talk to AI if all it does is restate the obvious and tell me to Google things myself?\n\nThe most useful experience I had with Live AI was when I asked it how to zhuzh up my home office. At first, I got another milquetoast answer \u2014 add artwork, plants, and rearrange the furniture to create a more cozy atmosphere. Annoyed, I asked it what type of artwork would look good. Again, it told me that \u201ca variety of artwork\u201d could look good \u201cdepending on [my] personal style.\u201d Had I considered adding posters, prints, or paintings that reflected my interests or hobbies? I wanted to scream, but instead, I asked what style of poster would look good based on what was currently in the room. To that, I got my first somewhat useful answer: a colorful and playful poster with a fun design or cute character that would complement the stuffed animals in the room. I asked for artists to look into. It suggested Lisa Congdon, Camille Rose Garcia, and Jen Corace for their \u201cplayful and whimsical styles.\u201d\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 Journey with me as I figure out how to ask Meta AI the right questions to get the answer I wanted.\n\nAnd herein lies the biggest recurring problem I have with AI: you have to know how to ask the right questions to get the answer you want.\n\nI could\u2019ve saved myself some grief if I\u2019d just told Meta AI, \u201cI want to hang artwork in my room. Based on what\u2019s currently here, what artists should I look into?\u201d This skill comes naturally to some folks. My spouse is a whiz at prompting AI. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s a skill that has to be learned \u2014 and few people right now are teaching us AI noobs how to rewire our brains to best make use of this tech.\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAfter Googling the artists Meta AI suggested, I was left back at square one. I liked their art, but none of them felt like my style. I relayed the experience to my best friend, who rolled her eyes and promptly sent me three artists on Instagram. I loved all of them. In a chiding voice, she said I should\u2019ve just asked her and not bothered with a bot. Because, unlike Meta AI, she said, she actually knows me.\n\nLive AI has other issues outside of the philosophical ones. It struggles to differentiate when you\u2019re talking to it versus someone else in the room. At one point, it straight up lied and said it\u2019d witnessed me feed my cat when I hadn\u2019t. (It\u2019d been confused by my spouse saying they\u2019d fed the kitties.) It also only works in 30-minute windows before the battery runs out. That means you have to be intentional in how you use it \u2014 a hard thing to do when there are few obvious use cases.\n\nI\u2019m not against Live AI. The overarching vision is for all of us to be like Tony Stark, wearing cool glasses with their own little Jarvises in them. When you\u2019re being hand-held through controlled demos, that future feels both inevitable and magical. It\u2019s just that the fantasy starts to crack when you\u2019re left to explore on your own. And once that happens, nine out of 10 times, you\u2019re going to reach for your phone.",

            "content": "In Trump\u2019s first term, Meta quietly introduced a slew of Republican-friendly changes behind the scenes. But led by Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan, the company is done playing both sides \u2014 and is going all-in on MAGA.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is working to get into Donald Trump\u2019s good graces. But 10 years ago, the Meta CEO wanted to punish him. In late 2015, Trump called for America to bar Muslims from entering the country in a fiery Facebook post, eliciting an outcry from Facebook employees. Zuckerberg, with other senior executives, argued Trump\u2019s post was offensive and should be removed under the platform\u2019s hate speech rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s top Republican lobbyist, Joel Kaplan, disagreed. A veteran of the George W. Bush administration, Kaplan urged the then-31-year-old CEO to keep Trump\u2019s post up. Privately, the executives reached a decision: Zuckerberg would exempt politicians from the bulk of Meta\u2019s content rules, allowing Trump and some boundary-pushing figures to post virtually anything on the site, even as the CEO publicly condemned \u201chate this week.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, the company and its then left-leaning CEO frequently deferred to Kaplan behind closed doors, instituting policies about content, promotion and fact-checking that favored Republicans. The strategy did little to endear Zuckerberg to the right. So today, the Meta founder is done playing both sides.\n\nWith Trump back in the Oval Office, Zuckerberg is rebranding the company to go all-in on a MAGA-dominated Washington, shelving Meta\u2019s once-lauded fact-checking program, eliminating DEI initiatives and installing Kaplan as the face of the company\u2019s policy division to replace the liberal-leaning former British politician Nick Clegg.\n\nAfter pledging to stay neutral during the election, Zuckerberg has deepened his relationship with Trump, jetting to Mar-a-Lago for private meetings, green-lighting Meta\u2019s $1 million donation to his inauguration fund, and adding a Trump ally, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, to the company\u2019s board.\n\nIn a vivid demonstration of the newfound alliance, Zuckerberg joined Trump\u2019s family, Cabinet picks and fellow billionaire allies on the dais for his inauguration. On Facebook and Instagram, the CEO beamed in a shot of his inaugural ball finery, alongside his wife, Priscilla Chan. \u201cOptimistic and celebrating us,\u201d read the caption, alongside an American flag emoji.\n\nIf Meta\u2019s new political playbook works, the company may avoid attacks from a president known for punishing his opponents and gain an ally to fight a ballooning set of tech regulations around the world. The strategy, however, risks alienating employees, Democrats and users, many of whom have bristled at the company\u2019s dramatic transformation. Meta declined to comment.\n\n\u201cFacebook made some content concessions during the first Trump term but they did them quietly,\u201d said Nu Wexler, a public relations consultant who used to work for Meta. \u201cI think the difference in what you\u2019re seeing now during the second term is that they\u2019re leaning into those changes much harder.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBending the rules\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, it largely fell to Kaplan, then Meta\u2019s vice president for global public policy, to win friends in the administration. The Republican operative had joined Meta in 2011 after eight years in the Bush White House, serving as deputy chief of staff. A former Marine Corps officer, Kaplan had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and served a stint as an energy lobbyist.\n\nHis Republican bona fides were unquestioned, but the Bush-era traditionalist faced a challenge with the unconventional Trump. Kaplan hadn\u2019t backed Trump during the 2016 primaries, giving to the campaigns of former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) instead.\n\nThe Harvard University grad quickly warmed to the administration, making a pilgrimage to Trump Tower in December 2016 to interview for a post overseeing the Office of Management and Budget, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about private company matters.\n\nHis politics stood out at Meta, then Facebook, a company known for its liberal workforce and close relationships with the Obama administration.\n\nKaplan\u2019s 2018 appearance at Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearing sparked outrage among rank-and-file staffers. In a companywide meeting, Kaplan explained he was supporting a longtime friend and did not apologize, according to two other people familiar with the matter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about private company matters.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley at this point in time was very left-leaning,\u201d said Katie Harbath, a former Meta policy official and former chief digital strategist at the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cThe reaction [to the election] and the backlash specifically at Facebook very much shaped what they did\u201d in Washington.\n\nStill, Kaplan tried to deepen Meta\u2019s relationships in Trump\u2019s world. He arranged a private dinner for Zuckerberg and Chan at the White House. Meta\u2019s D.C. office interviewed former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski for a lobbying job and eventually hired Sandra Luff, a former legislative director under Sen. Jeff Sessions (Alabama), who served as Trump\u2019s attorney general. He created an anti-China lobbying group, American Edge, to align Facebook\u2019s messages to the hawkish White House.\n\nBut winning over Trump proved challenging for the seasoned operative. Right-wing influencers had long accused Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm of suppressing conservatives, and Trump added himself to the bevy. The president launched a barrage of attacks on what conservatives were starting to call \u201cBig Tech,\u201d claiming it was responsible for \u201cfake news\u201d and biased against him and his followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaplan tried to stem the assault inside Facebook. He helped block the security team\u2019s efforts to crack down on outlets and pages that peddled false news reports, arguing that doing so would disproportionately impact conservatives and right-wing users and pushed for an overhaul to the news feed algorithm to surface more right-wing voices.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, Zuckerberg touted the company\u2019s plan to register more than 4 million people to vote along with a newly designed election information center promoting mail-in ballots and accurate voter information.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Kaplan\u2019s team found ways to bend its revamped policies to avoid having to take action on the then-president\u2019s misleading claims.\n\nWhen Trump falsely alleged in May 2020 that the Michigan secretary of state had illegally sent absentee ballots to voters, staffers urged Kaplan to remove the post under the company\u2019s voter suppression rules, which barred misleading claims about how to vote. But Kaplan argued users should be able to falsely claim election rules are \u201cillegal\u201d since they might eventually be challenged in court, according to two people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence recently obtained by The Washington Post. Meta left the post \u2014 along with others questioning the legality of mail-in ballots \u2014 untouched.\n\nPolicy staffers urged Kaplan to remove Trump\u2019s post stating that looting could lead to \u201cshooting\u201d during the 2020 George Floyd protests, warning that it could bolster critiques that the company\u2019s content triggered real-world violence, according to two people familiar with the matter and internal correspondence obtained by The Post. Kaplan and other leaders again argued the post should stay up in the name of free expression.\n\nMeta\u2019s strategy of privately appeasing Trump would falter after rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an incident organized, partially, on social media. In response, Meta and other tech companies suspended Trump\u2019s account, effectively depriving him of his social media megaphone.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s decisive 2024 victory has opened the door to many Republican-friendly changes at Meta. The company tapped Dustin Carmack as a lobbyist. Carmack is a former adviser to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign who helped develop the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s agenda known as Project 2025.\n\nAnd while many Republicans, including Trump, have hailed the slew of changes Meta rolled out earlier this month, conservatives\u2019 biggest victory might be its CEO\u2019s public performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZuckerberg described the company\u2019s years-long efforts to police speech as a form of \u201ccensorship,\u201d embracing a Republican characterization that rejects the industry\u2019s preferred phrase, \u201ccontent moderation.\u201d He referred to mainstream news publishers \u2014 whose work his company has relied on for years \u2014 as a \u201clegacy media\u201d he no longer trusts. His new hate speech rules refer to \u201ctransgenderism\u201d and \u201chomosexuality\u201d \u2014 words that some LGBTQ+ activists consider offensive or outdated.\n\nMeanwhile, over the last several years, Meta leaders have worked to insulate the company from unhappy employees and politicians. Rules limiting discussion of contentious topics at work have curtailed the once-freewheeling culture on internal message boards. And amid widespread job cuts, Silicon Valley workers who once staged walkouts are now more scared they could lose their jobs.\n\nOn internal message boards, Meta employees have complained that posts criticizing the company have been removed, while others argued the company\u2019s new free speech ethos seems to apply only to conservatives on its public social networks, according to copies of the messages viewed by The Post.\n\nZuckerberg has shown no signs of backing down. In a video explaining the changes, he argued that rolling back content moderation was necessary because Trump\u2019s victory demonstrated the country had reached a \u201ccultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech.\u201d",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms plans to invest as much as $65 billion on projects related to artificial intelligence in 2025, including building a giant new data center and increasing hiring in AI teams, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Friday.\n\nThe company intends to use the funds to build a data center \u201cso large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Meta plans to bring around a gigawatt of computing power online in 2025 and is projected to end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, he added.\n\n\u201cThis is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in the post.\n\nMeta has invested significantly in AI over the last several years, and recently announced a new $10 billion data center in Louisiana. It has also bought new computer chips to power products like its AI assistant and its Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg added that Meta will be \u201cgrowing our AI teams significantly\u201d in 2025.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement comes days after OpenAI, SoftBank Group and Oracle Corporation announced a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US.\n\nRelated:Opening the Stargate: Tech Giants to Invest $500B in AI Data Center Infrastructure\n\nMeta\u2019s projected capital expenditures for this year represent a roughly 50% increase over the firm\u2019s estimated 2024 spending, and is more than double its capital expenditures from 2023. The company is expected to provide a final 2024 capital expenditure figure when it announces its fourth-quarter financial results on January 29.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Meta and its competitors are overspending on AI, Zuckerberg said last summer, but the risk of losing a few billion dollars is better than missing a major change in computing.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you\u2019ll look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg told Bloomberg\u2019s Emily Chang in July.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you\u2019re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d\n\nWall Street was expecting Meta to allocate $51.3 billion for capital expenditures in 2025, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates. Shares of Meta initially fell on the news during premarket trading, but the stock rose as much as 1.7% after exchanges opened in New York, reflecting optimism from analysts. Broadcom, the main provider of chip design services for companies including Meta, rose as much as 3.9% following Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement.\n\nRelated:The World's Most Unusual and Unique Data Centers\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s sharp increase in 2025 capital spending to as much as $65 billion, rising well above last year\u2019s and consensus, may be its best use of capital, driving future growth and positioning itself as a leader in AI capabilities,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Credit Analyst Robert Schiffman wrote on Friday.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s decision to post Meta\u2019s spending plans on Facebook five days ahead of the firm\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement is an unconventional one. Companies typically issue such projections alongside their financial results, or in formal regulatory filings and press releases.\n\nBut federal regulators have in the past ruled that most social media platforms are suitable for companies to use to publicly disclose material information to investors.",

The creator is also required to share content to their Instagram Story twice a month.\n\nTo meet these requirements, the posts cannot be part of a brand deal, which is an agreement where creators are compensated to post content on their account that promotes a brand.\n\nThe contract reviewed by CNBC is an example of a mid-tier deal that Meta is offering to creators. The social media company is also offering terms varying in amount of deliverables and compensation based on the size of the audience, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Information on Monday reported that Instagram is offering creators with large TikTok followings cash bonuses ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 per month for a creator to shift their videos to Instagram Reels.\n\nMeta said it has also announced several new features for creators, including a video creation app called Edits, the expansion of Reels to three minutes and a new bonus program for creator monetization.",

As the entire American political landscape continues to endlessly freak us all the fuck out, so does it\u2019s impact on social media \u2014 especially for the millions of creative entrepreneurs who\u2019s livelihoods are now fuelled and funded by the Broligarchy.\n\nOur participation on these platforms is so enwrapped with our purpose and profit that we\u2019re grappling with either remaining in a space heavily influenced (if not entirely informed) by essentially, evil \u2014 or choosing not to participate at all, which will risk our careers as we know them.\n\nNow interwoven with our primary revenue stream is a blatant lack of morality, causing us to question of how many of our own morals we\u2019ll have to sacrifice, for the former.\n\nI find myself wondering what it would feel like to be an employee of TikTok or Meta right now, faced with whether to resign on principle or to keep taking the paycheque. As business owners who make most of our income through Instagram, our choice isn\u2019t so different.\n\nIs it ethical to stay?\n\nIs it possible to leave?\n\n\n\n\u2193\n\nI. THE DREAM DIED IN PUBLIX\n\nMost of my fondest memories growing up in Canada involve fetishizing the USA.\n\nMy biological father was born in the States, and while my own American passport never materialized, the possibility of it kept me in chat rooms \u2018til sunrise with strangers living in cities I\u2019d never been to but had to be better than mine, kids who spent their weekends hanging off shopping carts in stores I\u2019d only seen on TV, breezy drives to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts that didn\u2019t require a passport.\n\nIn middle school on a family trip to Fort Lauderdale, I saw paradise: summer year-round, star-spangled banners printed on objects I\u2019d probably never need but immediately had to have, streets littered with tattoo shops offering to brand me permanently with heart-shaped stars and stripes. Had it not required parental consent, I would\u2019ve hopped back on the plane with one, no question.\n\nLast night over tea, my childhood best friend and I were giggling about how desperate I\u2019d been to earn enough Neopoints to copy a paintbrush that would make my Neopet look like an American flag.\n\nMy greatest accomplishment in my first 15 years of life was finally turning my Shoyru red white and blue.\n\nThat triumph would only be outshone by getting to include \u201cbased in Los Angeles\u201d in my business bio, decades later.\n\nI\u2019ve since let go of those rose-coloured glasses (left \u2018em behind in a Florida Publix, somewhere) and I find myself at odds with the childish obsession I had with building a life here and the adult reality of what it means to do so.\n\nThis isn\u2019t so different from the cultural fixation with social media, where we\u2019ve all been striving for accolades that felt SO VERY IMPORTANT before the powers-that-be revealed how much they all fucking suck.\n\nVirality. Followers. Blue Check. Brand Deals.\n\nWe put these platforms on a pedestal because of what we thought they could offer us, and now we\u2019re starting to realize we could be standing for something we don\u2019t believe in just by being here, at all.\n\nII. DIVERSIFYING OUR DISILLUSIONMENT\n\nAlongside last week\u2019s short-lived TikTok ban came an uproar of online marketers hawking programs to help people diversify, reminding them to make sure their online eggs are in a few extra baskets, ads from experts to the tune of don\u2019t you wish you had an email list right now?!?!?!\n\nWe also witnessed declarations of walking away from the Meta platforms all-together, or articles encouraging us to leave TikTok behind, despite it\u2019s back-ness.\n\nClients have been asking me if they should give up on Instagram, trade Threads for Bluesky, pursue YouTube and Substack with more fervor, shift their focus, learn new skills.\n\nMy answer, always, is to do what feels right \u2014 and if they\u2019re ready to GTFO now because they can\u2019t stomach the direction it\u2019s headed, I\u2019ll support them in seeking safer and saner pastures, wherever that may be.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019ve landed, personally:\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with diversification, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for a mass exodus, either.\n\nFocusing all our efforts in the platforms that we know align with our values (which, like, may not even exist) doesn\u2019t solve the problem, it just creates a parallel universe that lets us not look at it, so much.\n\nI\u2019m still in a place where I think I can make more change if I\u2019m looking at it.\n\nThis Thread summed it up well:\n\nI live by a rule not to panic (or over-plan, which is usually a sign that I\u2019m actively panicking) until I have hard evidence. While we can speculate on the way these platforms might feel in a few months, the only evidence we have is what they feel like, today.\n\nAs long as we have the bandwidth to be there, and we\u2019re seeing and connecting with likeminded people when we do, I\u2019m not keen to suggest we voluntarily erase our voices in a space where \u2014 if it does go the direction people fear it will \u2014 they\u2019re going to matter most.\n\nI\u2019m calling for mass disillusionment, instead.\n\nFrom here on out, we have to weigh the cost of our participation against our quality of life, our mental health, our joy, every single time that we arrive to the online arena.\n\nWe have to pay attention to how our platforms are making us feel \u2014 how they\u2019re making our communities feel \u2014 and examine our individual threshold within which it still feels worth it. (Your threshold may come tomorrow. Maybe it already has.)\n\nWe have to stay in relationship with the truth that our participation in these platforms, whether we put a dime into them or not, is filling the pockets of the people in charge.\n\nWe have to know that, even if we migrate to places that make us feel more safe and sane, we are still placing our power in the platform\u2019s hands, and that will always mean the potential of putting it in the hands of the highest bidder.\n\nWe have to accept how political social media on the whole has become, and how implicated every single one of us is, in that.\n\nWe have to start creating community in more rooms but we have to carry the same awareness with us into all of them.\n\nIII. LEAVE BEFORE THE PARTY\u2019S OVER\n\nI\u2019m trying really hard not to react prematurely to what these spaces could become, while also making sure there are a myriad of other places I\u2019m growing and nurturing my community if they do become that.\n\nPreparing an exit strategy, hoping not to have to use it, ready if I have to.\n\nIf it stops feeling fun, I\u2019ll get the fuck out.\n\nI recommend you do the same.\n\n\ud800\udd02\ud800\udd02\n\nThanks for being here.

            "content": "It may not have reached a billion users just yet, but Meta has decided to launch ads on Threads anyway, with initial testing to begin with selected users/brands in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nAs explained by Meta:\n\n\u201cStarting today, a small number of advertisers will test ads in Threads to help campaigns go further by reaching the growing Threads community. Businesses will be able to extend their existing Meta ad campaigns to Threads - without the need for bespoke creative or additional resourcing - by simply checking a box in Ads Manager. This can help businesses reach more people in more places across Meta\u2019s family of apps and can improve advertiser outcomes.\u201d\n\nI mean, no one is actually that surprised though, right?\n\nMeta did initially suggest that it wouldn\u2019t look to launch ads in Threads until the app reached a billion users, though initial Threads ad formats were spotted in testing in August last year. Some advertisers have also noticed that Threads has appeared as a placement option in Ads Manager, so it has seemed like Meta\u2019s been moving in this direction for a little bit.\n\nAnd with Threads now up to 300 million monthly active users, and gaining momentum, it seemed inevitable that the ads would be coming.\n\nIt might be a little sooner than some had expected/hoped, but ads were always coming. We\u2019re all pretty attuned to sponsored posts like this in social feeds by now either way. Right?\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m not sure Meta needs to angle their messaging in such a hopefully enthusiastic way:\n\n\u201cPeople come to Meta for a personalized experience that helps them discover businesses and content they love - ads are an essential part of enabling this.\u201d\n\nYeah, that sounds like something that a Meta sales chief would declare in a motivational push to the ad sales team, while Threads chief Adam Mosseri has also remarked that:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll closely monitoring this test before scaling it more broadly, with the goal of getting ads on Threads to a place where they are as interesting as organic content.\u201d\n\nThe reception Mosseri envisions probably is not going to happen, though I respect the endeavor, and the ethos with which you\u2019re trying to sell this to users. I don\u2019t think that anyone will buy it, but cool that you\u2019re looking to lean into the concept that ads are actually good, and people will actually like them more this time.\n\nThough again, we are all attuned to promotions, and we all know that they\u2019re a part of the modern web experience. So I doubt there\u2019ll be any significant backlash either way.\n\nMeanwhile, for advertisers, ads on Threads will be \u201cbacked by Meta\u2019s proven ads systems,\u201d and as Meta notes, it\u2019ll be easy to extend your existing Facebook and IG campaigns to Threads via a checkbox in your campaign set-up.\n\nMeta\u2019s also expanding its inventory filter to Threads ads as well, which will enable advertisers \u201cto control the sensitivity level of the organic content that their ads appear next to.\u201d\n\nFinally, users will also be able to control the ads that they see in the app, if they choose, and in combination, these additional measures should enable greater control and audience relevance.\n\nAnd with Threads on track to surpass X as the real-time social app of choice, Threads ads are going to appeal to many brands, and there will be high demand for Meta\u2019s latest ad product. Which will ultimately bring in more money for the company, and with CEO Mark Zuckerberg also pledging $65 billion in spending on AI projects this year, it is going to need it.\n\nThat, in itself, could be the justification for Meta pulling the trigger on Threads ads earlier than expected.\n\nWhatever the logic, it\u2019s another ad consideration for your planning, and you can expect to see Meta moving to make Threads ads available in more regions pretty fast.",

            "content": "Meta is ditching fact checkers for X-style community notes. Will they work?\n\n26 January 2025 Share Save Chris Vallance Senior Technology Reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg\n\nAs flames tore through large parts of Los Angeles this month, so did fake news. Social media posts touted wild conspiracies about the fire, with users sharing misleading videos and misidentifying innocent people as looters. It brought into sharp focus a question that has plagued the social media age: what is the best way to contain and correct potentially incendiary sparks of misinformation? It is a debate that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, has been at the centre of. Shortly after the January 6th Capitol riots in 2021, which were fuelled by false claims of a rigged US presidential election, Mr Zuckerberg gave testimony to Congress. The billionaire boasted about Meta's \"industry-leading fact checking program\". It drew, he pointed out, on 80 \"independent third-party fact checkers\" to curb misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. Four years on, that system is no longer something to brag about. \"Fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US,\" Mr Zuckerberg said earlier in January. Taking their place, he said, would be something totally different: a system inspired by X's \"community notes\", where users rather than experts adjudicate on accuracy. Many experts and fact checkers questioned Mr Zuckerberg's motives. \"Mark Zuckerberg was clearly pandering to the incoming administration and to Elon Musk,\" Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, told the BBC. Mr Mantzarlis is also deeply critical of the decision to axe fact checkers. But like many experts, he also makes another point that has perhaps been lost in the firestorm of criticism Meta faces: that, in principle, community-notes-style systems can be part of the solution to misinformation.\n\nBirdwatching\n\nAdopting a fact checking system inspired by an Elon-Musk-owned platform was always going to raise hackles. The world's richest man is regularly accused of using his X account to amplify misinformation and conspiracy theories. But the system predates his ownership. \"Birdwatch\", as it was then known, began in 2021 and drew inspiration from Wikipedia, which is written and edited by volunteers.\n\nMeta Screenshot Mark Zuckerberg announced the changes in an online video\n\nLike Wikipedia, community notes rely on unpaid contributors to correct misinformation. Contributors rate corrective notes under false or misleading posts and, over time, some users earn the ability to write them. According to the platform, this group of contributors is now almost a million strong. Mr Mantzarlis - who himself once ran a \"crowd-sourced\" fact checking project - argues this type of system potentially allows platforms to \"get more fact checks, more contributions, faster\". One of the key attractions of community-notes-style systems are their ability to scale: as a platform's userbase grows, so does the pool of volunteer contributors (if you can persuade them to participate). According to X, community notes produce hundreds of fact checks per day. By contrast, Facebook's expert fact checkers may manage less than 10 per day, suggests an article by Jonathan Stray of the UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI and journalist Eve Sneider. And one study suggests community notes can deliver good quality fact checks: an analysis of 205 notes about Covid found 98% were accurate. A note appended to a misleading post can also organically cut its viral spread by more than half, X maintains, and research suggests they also increase the chance that the original poster will delete the tweet by 80% . Keith Coleman, who oversees community notes for X, argues Meta is switching to a more capable fact checking programme. \"Community notes are already covering a vastly wider range of content than previous systems,\" he told me. \"That is rarely mentioned. I see stories that say 'Meta ends fact checking program',\" he said. \"But I think the real story is, 'Meta replaces existing fact checking program with approach that can scale to cover more content, respond faster and is trusted across the political spectrum'.\"\n\nChecking the fact checkers\n\nBut of course, Mr Zuckerberg did not simply say community notes were a better system - he actively criticised fact checkers, accusing them of \"bias\". In doing so, he was echoing a long-held belief among US conservatives that Big Tech is censoring their views. Others argue fact checking will inevitably censor controversial views. Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch - which ran a campaign against alleged censorship of David Davis MP by YouTube - told the BBC allegations of Big Tech bias have come from across the political spectrum. Centralised fact checking by platforms risks \"stifling valuable reporting on controversial content\", she told the BBC, and also leads users to wrongly believe that all the posts they are reading are the \"vetted truth\". But Baybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, which supplies fact checking services to Meta in the UK, argues professional fact checkers can target the most dangerous misinformation and identify emerging \"harmful narratives\". Community-driven systems alone lack the \"consistency, objectivity and expertise\" to address the most harmful misinformation, he wrote. Professional fact checkers, and many experts and researchers, strongly dispute claims of bias. Some argue fact checkers simply lost the trust of many conservatives. A trust Mr Mantzarlis claims was deliberately undermined. \"Fact checkers started becoming arbiters of truth in a substantial way that upset politically-motivated partisans and people in power and suddenly, weaponised attacks were on them,\" he said.\n\nTrust in the algorithm\n\nThe solution that X uses in an attempt to keep community notes trusted across the political spectrum is to take a key part of the process out of human hands, relying instead on an algorithm. The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users. In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other. The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view. Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\". But this wide acceptance is a high bar to reach. Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used. This means accurate notes may go unused. But according to X, showing more notes would undermine the aim of displaying only notes that will be found helpful by the most users and this would reduce trust in the system.\n\n'More bad stuff'",

Zuckerberg has been an outspoken advocate of open-source models.\n\n\"Part of my goal for the next 10 to 15 years, the next generation of platforms, is to build the next generation of open platforms and have the open platforms win,\" he said in September. \"I think that's going to lead to a much more vibrant tech industry.\"\n\nThose who support open-source say it allows technology to develop rapidly and democratically since anyone can modify and redistribute the code. On the other hand, advocates for closed-source models argue that they're more secure because the code is kept private.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an Ask Me Anything on Reddit in November that the closed-source approach offered his company \"an easier way to hit the safety threshold.\" He added, however, that he \"would like us to open source more stuff in the future.\"",

            "content": "Reuters reports that Meta plans to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025 to enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) and other infrastructure. This marks a significant leap from its estimated $38 billion\u2014$40 billion spending in 2024, citing Mark Zuckerberg's post on Facebook. The company aims to solidify its competitive position in the AI industry against rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Open AI. However, $65 billion is slightly smaller than Microsoft's $80 billion.\n\nThe report says that Meta will construct a 2GW data center using some 1.3 million Nvidia [presumably H100] GPUs as part of the plan. The spending probably includes the company's custom data center-grade processors, too. Yet, we are speculating here.\n\n\"We are planning to invest $60 billion \u2014 $65 billion in CapEx this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead,\" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. \"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amidst escalating competition in AI investments. Microsoft is allocating $80 billion for data centers in fiscal 2025, Amazon expects to exceed $75 billion in spending for the same year, and OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have committed $500 billion to their Stargate initiative (yet it remains to be seen where precisely those Stargate money will come from). According to Reuters, this spending far exceeds analyst estimates of $50.25 billion for Meta\u2019s 2025 capital expenditures.\n\n\"This will be a defining year for AI. In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nUnlike its rivals, Meta offers open access to Llama AI models to end users in the U.S. The company allegedly monetizes this with its primary business, Facebook. Meta has also advanced its AI offerings with products like Ray-Ban smart glasses. By 2025, Meta expects its AI assistant to reach over 1 billion users, up from 600 million monthly active users last year.",

            "content": "is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nI was in middle school the last time I took a Spanish class. I remember enough for toddler talk \u2014 phrases like \u201cDonde est\u00e1 el ba\u00f1o?\u201d and \u201cmi gato es muy gordo\u201d \u2014 but having a meaningful conversation in Spanish without a translator is out of the question. So I was genuinely surprised the other day when, thanks to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, I could have a mostly intelligible conversation with a Spanish speaker about K-pop.\n\nLive translations were added as part of a feature drop last month, alongside live AI and Shazam. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. When you turn the feature on, you can have a conversation with a Spanish, French, or Italian speaker, and the glasses will translate what\u2019s being said directly into your ears in real-time. You can also view a transcript of the conversation on your phone. Whatever you say in English will also be translated into the other language.\n\nMissing is the bit where we both start singing \u201cAPT APT APT!\u201d Screenshot: Meta\n\nFull disclosure, my conversation was part of a Meta-facilitated demo. That\u2019s not truly the same thing as plopping these glasses on, hopping down to Barcelona, and trying it in the wild. That said, I\u2019m a translation tech skeptic and intended to find all the cracks where this tech could fail.\n\nThe glasses were adept at translating a basic conversation about K-pop bands. After my conversation partner was done speaking, the translation would kick in soon after. This worked well if we talked in measured, medium-speed speech, with only a few sentences at a time. But that\u2019s not how people actually speak. In real life, we launch into long-winded tirades, lose our train of thought, and talk much faster when angry or excited.\n\nTo Meta\u2019s credit, it considered the approach to some of these situations. I had my conversation partner speak at a faster speed and a longer duration. It handled the speed decently well, though there was understandably some lag in the real-time transcript. For longer speech, the glasses started translating mid-way through before my partner was done talking. That was a bit jarring and awkward, as you, the listener, have to recognize you\u2019re a bit behind. The experience is similar to how live interpreters do it on international news or broadcasts.\n\nI was most impressed that the glasses could handle a bit of Spanglish. Often, multilingual speakers rarely stick to just one language, especially when in mixed-language company. In my family, we call it Konglish (Korean-English), and people slip in and out of each language, mixing and matching grammar that\u2019s chaotic and functional. For example, my aunt will often speak several sentences in Korean, throw in two sentences in English, do another that\u2019s a mix of Korean and English, and then revert to Korean. I had my conversation partner try something similar in Spanish and... the results were mixed.\n\nYou can see the transcript start to struggle with slang while trying to rapidly switch between Spanish and English. Screenshot: Meta\n\nOn the one hand, the glasses could handle short switches between languages. However, longer forays into English led to the AI repeating the English in my ear. Sometimes, it\u2019d also repeat what I\u2019d said, because it started getting confused. That got so distracting I couldn\u2019t focus on what was being said.\n\nThe glasses struggled with slang. Every language has its dialects, and each dialect can have its unique spin on colloquialisms. You need look no further than how American teens have subjected us all to phrases like skibidi and rizz. In this case, the glasses couldn\u2019t accurately translate \u201cno manches.\u201d That translates to \u201cno stain,\u201d but in Mexican Spanish, it also means \u201cno way\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me!\u201d The glasses chose the literal translation. In that vein, translation is an art. In some instances, the glasses got the correct gist across but failed to capture some nuances of what was being said to me. This is the burden of all translators \u2014 AI and human alike.\n\nYou can\u2019t use these to watch foreign-language movies or TV shows without subtitles. I watched a few clips of Emilia P\u00e9rez, and while it could accurately translate scenes where everyone was speaking loudly and clearly, it quit during a scene where characters were rapidly whispering to each other in hushed tones. Forget about the movie\u2019s musical numbers entirely.\n\nRelated The Humane AI Pin is lost in translation\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily have these issues if you stuck to what Meta intended with this feature. It\u2019s clear these glasses were mostly designed to help people have basic interactions while visiting other countries \u2014 things like asking for directions, ordering food at a restaurant, going to a museum, or completing a transaction. In those instances, you\u2019re more likely to encounter people who speak slower with the understanding that you are not a native speaker.\n\nIt\u2019s a good start, but I still dream of the babel fish from Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy \u2014 a little creature that when plopped in your ear, can instantly and accurately translate any language into your own. For now, that\u2019s still the realm of science fiction.",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWithin seven years, I transitioned from teaching English to working at Google, Uber, YouTube, Meta, DoorDash, and the weight-loss startup Calibrate. I was an individual contributor at Uber and Google, in design leadership roles at Meta and DoorDash, and in senior leadership at Calibrate.\n\nAs a university lecturer at the start of my career, I faced relentless anxiety about job insecurity and low pay. My passion for educating the next generation kept me going.\n\nOnce I moved into tech, my salary rose to seven times what I made as a teacher \u2014 from $30,000 to more than $200,000 a year, plus $150,000 in equity in one of my leadership positions \u2014 but at the cost of my mental health.\n\nIn 2015, I'd been teaching English for 8 years and was burned out\n\nI became so burned out that I developed pneumonia, mainly due to exhaustion. While in the ICU, the university I worked for asked when I would be returning. This was a wake-up call, and I didn't return.\n\nIf I had continued teaching, I would also have had limited career growth. My salary wouldn't have increased much, and I would probably have needed to continue living in my rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco and would never have been able to buy my own place. That wasn't the life I wanted for myself.\n\nI learned web development and graphic design to pivot to a new career\n\nI attended a front-end-coding boot camp called Thinkful and took graphic-design classes at the Academy of Art University to hone a new skill set. I finally shifted to a new job in 2016: a contract position at Google.\n\nRelated stories\n\nA recruiter reached out about the opportunity, and both the recruiter and Google's hiring manager were impressed by my portfolio. My teaching background was also seen as an asset for a role with the customer-education team.\n\nI stepped into a world of innovation and speed. I remember thinking, \"This is it, I've made it,\" but I soon realized the pace at Google was a different beast.\n\nStarting at Google was a rude awakening\n\nBefore I started, I'd seen this video about the resort-like experience Google employees had every day. It looked like heaven, and I dreamed of being a part of it.\n\nI soon learned the resort-like experience I'd dreamed about was only a small part of Google culture. I hadn't considered that transitioning from academia to tech would require a major mindset shift.\n\nThe stress was familiar, but the context was entirely new. In academia, an average project typically lasted two to three months, which allowed time for thorough research and planning. At Google, a similar-sized project needed to be completed within a week. The focus shifted from perfection to effective execution, which was challenging but vital to success in the tech industry.\n\nAlso, before joining, I thought Big Tech companies were innovators not just in their products but also in their operations. When I saw it all up close, I realized that these organizations had many growing pains, like what I experienced in higher education. All of this stressed me out, just like higher education did.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, I moved from Google to Uber to YouTube. From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a learning-design manager at Meta.\n\nI had an epiphany during my time at Meta\n\nAnderson in the Facebook office. Courtesy of Keith Anderson\n\nDuring my time at Meta \u2014 amid the intensity of high-profile speaking opportunities at conferences and strategic planning \u2014 I had an epiphany: No matter what your job is, handling stress and anxiety in the workplace is within your control. The key is how you navigate and tackle it.\n\nThis realization changed everything for me. I began to advocate for myself more strongly at work, understanding that my happiness and mental well-being were in my own hands, not dictated by the prestige of my job or the company.\n\nMy approach to work transformed when I observed successful colleagues' behaviors. They would strategically evaluate requests and weren't afraid to say no when appropriate, always linking their decisions to key business metrics like revenue generation, cost savings, or efficiency improvements. This insight helped me shift from a people pleaser working 60-plus hours weekly to a strategic team player focused on impact.\n\nSuccess isn't just about what you achieve but how you manage the journey\n\nStress is a part of any job, but it doesn't have to define your experience. My teaching and corporate roles taught me the importance of prioritization and built my resilience.\n\nFor those moving into tech, remember your unique background is an asset. You, not the company, can define what you do. Your health is more important than the bottom line of a large tech company like Meta or Google, and you need to prioritize it.\n\nLast February, I left DoorDash and Big Tech entirely to focus on my career-coaching company I started working on part time in May 2022. While launching my business brought new challenges, my varied background equipped me well.\n\nI'm now privileged to support hundreds of professionals through their career journeys. Every step of my journey, including the challenges, has contributed to who I am today.\n\nWant to share your Big Tech experience? Email Lauryn Haas at lhaas@businessinsider.com.",

I felt the room lift behind me as bereaved parents held up photos of their dead kids, lost to suicide or exploitation following exposure to Zuckerberg's online platforms. I realized I was standing by the time I could make out any of his words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was January 31, 2024 and less than a year later, Zuckerberg announced Meta would be abandoning fact-checkers and implementing similar policies to Elon Musk's X.\n\nThis deeply craven and dangerous reversal, ostensibly to reduce \u201ccensorship\u201d from Meta platforms, will make Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp even more unsafe for LGBTQ+ users. That\u2019s why, after 13 years on Instagram, amassing 80,000 followers, and having monetarily benefited from being an influencer, I am finally leaving Instagram.\n\nI initially joined Instagram because it was what all of my friends were doing. As a young dancer featured on television shows, it was a place to build and maintain connections and community. It was also a business, a place where I could earn money for more dance training and raise awareness about causes and issues I cared deeply about. But over time, due to policy and content moderation decisions made \u2014 or not made \u2014 by Meta, it went from something fun and engaging to something that fueled anxiety, took over my childhood, and ultimately caused harm to me and people I love.\n\nAt the end of the day, social media is a product of its environment, and the environment is getting worse. The rise in hate speech on social media has become a significant concern in recent years. Meta's decision to end its fact-checking program and ease content moderation will only add to the increase in harmful behaviors, including harassment and hate speech, especially if Zuckerberg implements something similar to X\u2019s community notes. Giving anyone with a valid phone number and six months of a clean record on the platform the status of \u201capproved moderator,\u201d a status kept anonymous, is not enough to keep harmful disinformation and hate speech from spreading.\n\nMashable Top Stories Stay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.

There are people fighting to hold technology companies accountable and to make online spaces better. It\u2019s important that young LGBTQ+ people know that there are people, like my colleagues at Heat Initiative , fighting for Big Tech to clean up their act, so that isolated members of the LGBTQ+ community aren\u2019t forced to turn to dangerous online experiences when their in-person community fails them. The unfortunate reality is that, right now, the LGBTQ+ community is harmed disproportionally more on these platforms than their peers. Zuckerberg\u2019s actions will only accelerate the risks that young LGBTQ+ people face on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nLennon Torres protesting an an Apple store for the Heat Initiative. Credit: Photo by Johnny Makes\n\nIronically, Meta\u2019s new policies seem likely to hurt their business too. In his announcement, Zuckerberg parroted language that has been used by Musk to justify the elimination of safety measures on X, but those decisions have proven to be terrible for X\u2019s business. When Twitter became X and it immediately shifted away from a place people could connect and keep up to date to a cesspool of illegal and harmful content, users and advertisers fled. Zuckerberg should take note, especially since he said himself that it\u2019s likely we will see a similar uptick in harmful content on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nBut no one in the LGBTQ+ community should be under the illusion that social media or the newest technology will inherently increase connection or belonging. At least not without thorough protections. After I saw that even Apple CEO Tim Cook, a so-called LGBTQ+ advocate, donated $1 million dollars to the Trump Inauguration and sat directly behind the now president as he took the presidential oath, I was reminded again that technology CEOs are focused only on protecting their power. That unsettling realization and Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement left me asking myself if I will keep using these platforms. Our LGBTQ+ community must come to terms with the fact that tech tycoons like Zuckerberg, Musk and Cook don\u2019t have our best interests at heart. Ever.\n\nUltimately, we have to reckon with the fact that Meta\u2019s new policies are just the latest in a long line of decisions that have put LGBTQ+ users at risk on their platforms. To know they have a ton of hate speech on their platforms, are building algorithms meant to addict young users to their products for life, and are actively moving to ensure less content safety, I can't sit idly by and use their platforms. Zuckerberg is taking the company in a fundamentally dangerous direction.\n\nIt is so clear to me that the young and wild toxic relationship of my youth was not with a romantic partner or friend, but with Mark Zuckerberg and the products he has built to imprison and profit off of our attention. And like many exes do, he sticks around uninvited \u2014 and I am certainly done giving him a pass.\n\nJoin me. It\u2019s time to delete your Instagram.",

The company said this move is part of its ongoing infrastructure investments across the country.\n\nMicrosoft said Jan. 3 that it plans to invest $80 billion to build data centers in fiscal 2025 to power the development and use of AI. When making the announcement, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said the company is doing so amid a \u201cgolden opportunity for American AI.\u201d",

            "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced significant changes to how the company will moderate its social media content. The changes could have far-reaching and dire effects for democracy and for people who have historically been targeted by online hate, experts and advocates say.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, revised its \u201chateful conduct\u201d policy to remove the term \u201chate speech\u201d and protections against online hate targeted at LGBTQ+ people, women, immigrants, people of color and other groups. Advocacy group GLAAD cited some examples of language that is now permitted on the platforms, including:\n\nClaims that LGBTQ+ people are \u201cmentally ill\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d\n\nCalling trans and nonbinary people \u201cit.\u201d\n\nReferences to \u201cwomen as household objects or property.\u201d\n\nMeta is also ending its program that enlisted third-party fact-checking partners to flag content that did not pass fact checks. Zuckerberg said in a video announcement that \u201cfact-checkers have been too politically biased\u201d and have \u201cdestroyed more than they created,\u201d echoing language President Donald Trump and other Republicans have used for years to attack fact-checking. The New York Times reported that fact-checking groups who worked with Meta took issue with Zuckerberg\u2019s characterization and said \u201cthey had no role in deciding what the company did with the content that was fact-checked.\u201d\n\nMeta will now employ a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d model that relies on users to submit information about content and does not apply to paid ads. The network X, formerly Twitter, also uses a community notes model.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and other civil and human rights organizations are concerned that Meta\u2019s new approach will endanger democracy and the safety of users.\n\n\u201cFighting misinformation, disinformation and hate speech should be a top priority of both traditional and social media companies,\u201d SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang said. \u201cFailing to do so is undermining our democracy and threatens the safety of their users. Instead of mimicking the moves of other companies that have sadly allowed their platforms to devolve, Meta had an opportunity to lead with their professed values. Unfortunately, it seems that Meta\u2019s leadership prioritizes political access more than organizational values.\u201d\n\nPasha Dashtgard is the director of research for the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. Dashtgard said the effects of Meta\u2019s \u201cexplicit commitment to not countering misinformation\u201d will be felt by everyone.\n\n\u201cThis couldn\u2019t be worse, frankly, for us as a democracy and for all of us,\u201d Dashtgard said, noting that \u201cincreased polarization lays the groundwork for authoritarian undermining of democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad-faith actors, extremist groups and individuals, organizations and institutions that are trying to undermine democracy couldn\u2019t be happier that we are removing the guardrails on our social media platforms and in order to facilitate the creation of fully enclosed online ecosystems that are able to disseminate misinformation and motivate people to actively undermine democracy through participation in antigovernment militias and extremist groups,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Very good news,\u2019 Trump says\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement about Meta\u2019s policy updates came just two weeks before Trump was inaugurated for his second presidential term on Jan. 20. The announcement followed multiple visits by Zuckerberg to Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in recent months. Meta also contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, hired longtime Republican lobbyist Joel Kaplan to lead the company\u2019s global policy team, and appointed UFC president and Trump ally Dana White to the Meta board, according to ABC News.\n\nJust four years ago, Zuckerberg banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram, saying the risks of allowing Trump on the platforms were \u201csimply too great\u201d after he repeatedly used the sites to broadcast election lies and cheer on the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, according to CNN. Shortly after Meta publicized the new policy updates, Trump called the announcement \u201cvery good news\u201d at a press conference and said he thought the changes were \u201cprobably\u201d a direct response to threats he has made to Zuckerberg in the past.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta will now focus on \u201crestoring free expression on our platforms.\u201d The changes seem to effectively end Meta\u2019s years-long attempts at contending with the tension between free expression and civility.\n\nZuckerberg attended the inauguration along with other prominent figures in tech, such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and CEOs that included Sundar Pichai of Google; Tim Cook of Apple; Shou Zi Chew of TikTok; and Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX. Musk, the owner of X, has also been tapped by Trump as a leader for the new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\u2018Flood of propaganda\u2019\n\nPew Research Center statistics show that 68% of U.S. adults use Facebook and 47% use Instagram. Approximately 54% of adults say they at least sometimes get news from social media, up slightly from recent years. Dashtgard said he expects distinguishing between genuine content and misinformation, disinformation and fake content could become even more difficult for users.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is a flood of propaganda, hate speech and extremism in the form of videos, memes, fake AI-generated articles, AI-generated images, videos and audio that are going to be indistinguishable from genuine content,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to lead to an information collapse where, really, what\u2019s going to happen is people are no longer going to be able to adequately determine what is real from not real.\u201d\n\nThe result, Dashtgard said, could be media ecosystems that exist exceedingly to confirm preexisting worldviews, biases and stereotypes regardless of political affiliation.\n\n\u201cBut when we\u2019re talking about oppressed and marginalized communities \u2026 there is a more dangerous implication that \u2026 you\u2019re going to be feeding people information that is going to justify violence and discrimination and hate against marginalized groups,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the argument is often made that reducing content moderation and removing restrictions on hate activities enables \u201cfree speech\u201d and online public forums of ideas, Dashtgard said that is not how it plays out.\n\n\u201cWhat actually happens is that the most extreme, the most negative, the content that elicits hate and fear and anger are the stories that are going to be elevated the most,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed to psychological science and research indicating that people tend to be drawn to more extreme political positions than they hold and that they are more predisposed to negative content. Research shows content that elicits anger spreads faster than content linked to any other emotion on social media networks.\n\n\u2018Check the facts before you believe\u2019\n\nSPLC Intelligence Project Interim Director Rachel Carroll Rivas said Meta had made progress in controlling harmful content related to hard-right extremism and hate and antigovernment activities, notably banning some hard-right public figures and deleting thousands of militia groups and pages. Still, Meta\u2019s content moderation has never adequately addressed harmful content consistently present on the platform, Carroll Rivas said. Particularly concerning now, she said, is whether the lines are blurring between alt-tech platforms like Gab, Rumble and Telegram and mainstream platforms like Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nAlt-tech spaces were set up as purposely unmoderated to cater to users who wanted an unmoderated space, Carroll Rivas said.\n\n\u201cThat has led to a situation where those spaces are being used by people to say and act on really divisive, violent, discriminatory, biased ideas and engage in hard-right organizing,\u201d Carroll Rivas said. \u201cSome of that same activity did happen in mainstream social media spaces, but with some content moderation and setting a higher standard. \u2026 So, the question is, is that line between mainstream social media and alt-tech gone?\u201d\n\nHuang encourages social media users to approach content critically and thoughtfully to avoid spreading or engaging with misinformation and disinformation.\n\n\u201cAs you engage with companies that have abandoned their commitment to ensuring accurate and fact-based information, be mindful of what and who you interact with,\u201d Huang said. \u201cHave healthy skepticism of the individuals you follow and the posts that go viral, so that you don\u2019t unwittingly participate in an ecosystem of misinformation. Check the facts, before you believe or repost.\u201d\n\nYoung people are particularly vulnerable to being targeted by harmful and hateful content on social media. All trusted adults have an important role to play in supporting young people through polarizing times and in developing skills and knowledge to guard against online radicalization, Dashtgard said. SPLC and PERIL offer guides for parents, caregivers, educators and others to help prevent youth radicalization and build resilient, inclusive communities.\n\nThe SPLC\u2019s Learning for Justice (LFJ) K-12 Digital Literacy Framework offers a guide for educators supporting students in developing digital and civic literacy skills. The framework covers seven key areas for learning and includes lessons, classroom-ready videos and a corresponding podcast, The Mind Online. More than ever, supporting young people in becoming responsible digital citizens is critical, LFJ Director Jalaya Liles Dunn said.\n\n\u201cYoung people have the power to shape how we cultivate an environment that centers critical thinking and civic responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nPrevention is the key to helping people of all ages avoid adopting hateful ideologies based on harmful online content, Dashtgard said. Resources from SPLC and PERIL, including the new report Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- and Sexuality-Based Bigotry, can offer knowledge and strategies for approaching conversations.\n\n\u201cPrevention is the silver bullet,\u201d Dashtgard said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much harder to walk somebody back once they have fallen down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and hateful ideologies. It is paramount that we offer knowledge and effective strategies for how to prevent people from being radicalized in the first place.\u201d\n\nPicture at top: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, center, attends the inauguration ceremony for Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025.

Meta says the spectacles are powered with A.I., respond to voice commands and have a built-in camera and open-ear audio.

            "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Should I stay or should I go \u2014 from Meta\u2019s social media platforms?\n\nThat\u2019s what some Facebook, Instagram and Threads users are wondering after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement this month that the company is relaxing rules on harmful content such as hate speech and abandoning its fact checking program and replacing it with crowdsourced notes.\n\nThe changes have renewed interest among some users about deleting their Meta social media accounts. If you want to stop using platforms owned by Meta, here are some pointers:\n\nSave your data\n\nBefore deleting your Facebook account, you should download a copy of all your personal information, which includes details about your activity on the platform, things you\u2019ve shared and data that the company has collected about you.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go to your settings or the accounts center \u2014 the master control panel for all your Meta accounts \u2014 where you can choose to download everything or just items such as your profile, posts, messages, comments and reactions, and list of friends, even the ads you\u2019ve clicked on and IP addresses you\u2019ve used to connect to Facebook.\n\nYou can download information from a certain date range, such as the past month or six months, or for all the time you\u2019ve had an account. If you\u2019re downloading photos, you can select their quality level: low, medium, high.\n\nFor security purposes, you\u2019ll only have four days to download your file. The process is similar for Instagram and Threads users.\n\nInstagram users will need a password to download and access files and it could take up to 30 days to receive a download link by email, the platform says on its help page.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t want to download all your personal information but instead want to get any photos and videos you\u2019ve posted. Facebook provides a separate option to transfer these files to another online service, with options including Google Photos, Dropbox or Photobucket.\n\nStaying in touch\n\nA tip for Facebook users: before you pull the plug, check if you have friends or connections you don\u2019t want to lose complete contact with.\n\nSend them a message asking for their phone, email or other non-Meta contact details. You could also make a final post telling people that you\u2019re leaving, though there\u2019s a chance not everyone will see it.\n\nTake a break\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to go all the way, Facebook allows users to temporarily shut down their accounts in case they just want to take a break from social media.\n\nYou can do this through the account center, where you can click on the Personal details section, and then the Account ownership and control setting.\n\nTemporarily deactivating an account means other users won\u2019t see it anymore, but your posts, photos and videos won\u2019t be deleted and you can still use Facebook Messenger. You can reactivate the account at any time.\n\nDon\u2019t change your mind too often: Instagram and Threads users can only temporarily deactivate their accounts once a week.\n\nDeletion\n\nReady to take the plunge and delete your account permanently?\n\nAfter tying up any loose ends, head back to the accounts center, click the Personal details section, and then Account ownership and control, where you can choose to delete it.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve triggered the deletion process, you\u2019ve got 30 days to change your mind, which you can do by logging back into your account and clicking the Cancel Deletion button.\n\n\u201cAfter 30 days, your account and all your information will be permanently deleted, and you won\u2019t be able to retrieve your information,\u201d Facebook warns on its help center.\n\nTake note: Deleting a Threads account won\u2019t have any effect on your corresponding Instagram account. But deleting an Instagram account will also result in the deletion of the linked Threads account because Instagram accounts are used to manage Threads accounts.\n\nWhat about WhatsApp?\n\nMeta also owns WhatsApp, although Zuckerberg\u2019s content policy changes aren\u2019t likely to affect the chat app.\n\nSimilar to Meta\u2019s social platforms, WhatsApp users can export a copy of their chat history or ask for information on their settings or channels.\n\nIf you decide you want to get rid of WhatsApp and perhaps switch to competing chat services like iMessage or Signal, it\u2019s easy to do through the app\u2019s settings.\n\nDeleting WhatsApp will erase your account info, your chat history backup and your presence from any chat groups as well as any channels you set up where you\u2019re the only admin.\n\n___\n\nIs there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

TechDirt recently described him as a \u201cLebron James/Michael Jordan\u201d-level legal thinker. A professor at Stanford, counsel at an IP-focused law firm in the Bay Area, and one of the 10 most-cited legal scholars of all time, Lemley is exactly the kind of person Silicon Valley heavyweights want on their side. Meta, however, has officially lost him.\n\nEarlier this month, Lemley announced he was no longer going to defend the tech giant in Kadrey v. Meta, a lawsuit filed by a group of authors who allege the tech giant violated copyright law by training its AI tools on their books without their permission. The fact that he quit is a big deal. I wondered if it had something to do with how the case was going\u2014but then I checked social media.\n\nLemley said on LinkedIn and Bluesky that he still believes Meta should win the lawsuit, and he wasn\u2019t bowing out because of the merits of the case. Instead, he\u2019d \u201cfired\u201d Meta because of what he characterized as the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cdescent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.\u201d The move came on the heels of major policy shifts at Meta, including changes to its hateful conduct rules that now allow users to call gay and trans people \u201cmentally ill.\u201d\n\nIn a phone conversation, Lemley explained what motivated his decision to quit, and where he sees the broader legal landscape on AI and copyright going, including his suspicion that OpenAI may settle with The New York Times.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nKate Knibbs: Could you go into more detail about how you arrived at your decision to quit representing Meta? What was the deciding factor?\n\nMark Lemley: I am very troubled by the direction in which the country is going, and I am particularly troubled that a number of folks in the tech industry seem to be willing to go along with it, no matter how extreme it gets. A number of policy changes struck me as things that I would not personally want to be associated with, from the full-throated endorsement of Trump, to the systematic cutting-back on protections for LGBTQ people, to the elimination of DEI programs. All of this is a pattern, I think, that seems to be following what we saw with Elon Musk a couple of years ago. We've seen where that path leads, and it's not somewhere good. Mark Zuckerberg is, of course, free to do whatever he wants to do, but I decided that that wasn't something I wanted to be associated with.\n\nDid Meta make an effort to keep you? Did Zuckerberg say anything to you?\n\nI\u2019ve not had any conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, ever. But any internal conversations that were had is something I probably should not talk about.",

            "content": "Maung Sawyeddollah, a Rohingya human rights activist and atrocity survivor, has filed a whistleblower complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asking the agency to investigate Meta for alleged violations of securities laws stemming from the company\u2019s misrepresentations to shareholders on its substantial contribution to what the US government has classified as genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya in Myanmar in 2017.\n\nAmnesty International, the Open Society Justice Initiative and Victim Advocates International jointly supported the submission.\n\n\u201cThe submission provides information on Meta\u2019s alleged role in the atrocities perpetrated against the Rohingya, and highlights misrepresentations to the SEC and public investors. We hope the SEC will consider the submission and investigate Meta for any potential violations of federal securities laws. Mandi Mudarikwa, Head of Strategic Litigation at Amnesty International.\n\nThe submission to the SEC, an independent US agency responsible for ensuring that shareholders are treated fairly and honestly, details how Meta was repeatedly warned by activists and researchers about the risk of Facebook being used to foment and incite violence against the Rohingya in the lead-up to 2017. The filing argues that, despite this, Meta continued leaving out key information on this risk of real-world violence in statements made to public investors.\n\nA 2022 report by Amnesty International found that Meta contributed to the atrocities in Myanmar against the Rohingya through Facebook\u2019s use of algorithms that amplify harmful content and inadequate moderation of harmful content, which breached its own Community Standards \u2013 rules that define permissible content on the platform.\n\nThe report found that Meta\u2019s business model relied on invasive profiling and targeted advertising, which promoted the spread of harmful content including incitement to violence. Meta\u2019s algorithmic systems are designed to maximize user engagement in order to increase its advertising revenue. As a result, these systems often have the effect of prioritizing inflammatory, divisive, and harmful content.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of horrible things on Facebook, and I just thought that people who posted were bad. I didn\u2019t realize then that Facebook was to blame. One day I saw a post that made me feel so bad. I tried to report that to Facebook. I said it was hate speech but I got a response that said\u2026it does not go against Community Standards,\u201d said Maung Sawyeddollah, recalling his frustration at his futile attempts to alert Meta about the proliferation of harmful content on Facebook.\n\nEven though such content clearly violated Facebook\u2019s Community Standards, which recently changed as part of a new policy shift, Meta did not sufficiently enforce these in Myanmar nor adequately remove anti-Rohingya content in the months and years before the 2017 atrocities in northern Rakhine State. The insufficient number of content moderators with necessary language skills, the result of the company\u2019s budgeting and staffing choices, also contributed to Meta\u2019s shortcomings. This reflects the company\u2019s broader failure to adequately invest in content moderation across many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, notwithstanding its public claims.\n\n\u201cIn Myanmar, where Facebook served as the primary social media platform and news source, the reckless deployment of Meta\u2019s harmful algorithms, with negligible safeguards in place, promoted widespread anti-Rohingya online campaigns which contributed to offline violence,\u201d said Eva Buzo, Executive Director at Victim Advocates International.\n\nThe SEC complaint underscores Meta\u2019s failure to heed multiple civil society warnings from 2013 to 2017 regarding Facebook\u2019s potential role in fueling violence. During that time, civil society repeatedly warned Meta employees that the platform was contributing to a pending \u201cgenocide\u201d, similar to the role radios played in the Rwandan genocide.\n\n\u201cAlthough investors had asked Meta to look into the human rights implications of its business, Meta fell far short of being fully transparent towards them, even though by that time Meta had been warned multiple times about the escalating situation in Myanmar and Facebook\u2019s role in it. James Goldston, Executive Director of the Open Society Justice Initiative.\n\nDespite these warnings, between 2015 to 2017, Meta told investors that Facebook\u2019s algorithms did not result in polarization despite having been warned of Facebook\u2019s role in proliferating anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar. At the same time, Meta did not fully disclose in its financial reporting to shareholders the risks the company\u2019s operations in Myanmar entailed. Instead, in 2015 and 2016 Meta objected to shareholder proposals to conduct a human rights impact assessment and to set up an internal committee to oversee the company\u2019s policies and practices concerning international public issues, including human rights.\n\nPublic pressure in 2018 forced Meta to partially and belatedly acknowledge Facebook\u2019s role in the Rohingya atrocities. However, between November 2020 and November 2022, Meta again failed to adequately curb the spread of content advocating hatred and violence, this time against the Tigrayans in Ethiopia, ultimately contributing to severe offline violence. This is despite the company\u2019s public claims to the contrary. Plainly, Meta has neither learned its lesson nor taken meaningful steps to curb its role in fueling ethnic violence around the world.\n\nRecent policy changes by Meta in the United States abolishing independent fact-checking, which may well be rolled out internationally, risk even further exacerbating Meta\u2019s contributions to human rights harms and offline violence, as egregious as the crimes against the Rohingya.",

Lead analyst Scott Devitt cited \"positive momentum into 2025\" for the social media giant. Meanwhile, BofA Global Securities analysts reiterated a buy call for Meta and upped their price objective to 710, from 660.\n\n\"Meta stock rose 65% in 2024, outperforming broader indices and Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 35%) driven by revenue upside, strong cost discipline, and optimism on AI capabilities,\" BofA analyst Justin Post wrote to clients.\n\n\"With a stable macro backdrop, a growing AI contribution to ad revenues, ramping messaging revenues, and continued cost discipline (recent headcount cuts), we remain positive on the stock in 2025.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock is up a fraction at 627.66 in morning trades.\n\nMeta Q4 Preview: Focus On CapEx\n\nMeta will report its Q4 results late Wednesday, Jan. 29. On average, analysts expect Meta's earnings will increase 27% to $6.75 per share, according to FactSet. Consensus estimates project Meta's revenue will increase 17% year over year to $46.98 billion.\n\nWedbush's Devitt wrote Thursday that advertiser feedback about the December-ended quarter indicates a \"more modest deceleration\" for Meta's year-over-year revenue growth than initially thought. Meta's revenue grew 19% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nBut Meta's fourth quarter results may take a backseat to what the company tells investors about its plans for the coming year.\n\n\"Investor focus has shifted towards 2025 expense/capital expenditure requirements,\" Devitt wrote. \"The cost debate has now shifted to 2025, and alongside 4Q results, Meta will share expense/capex guidance for the year.\"\n\nMeta has hiked its capital expenditures to invest in data centers that can power the company's AI ambitions.\n\nInvestors are expecting Meta to guide for 2025 capital expenditures of about $51.4 billion, according to Devitt. That would mark a 31% increase from the roughly $39 billion Meta is projected to have spent in 2024.\n\nDevitt noted that consensus 2025 capex estimates from Meta analysts have increased 9% since Meta's third quarter results in October and 42% from a year ago.\n\n\"While we anticipate future estimate revisions for 2025 will be less material as capital requirements to support AI investments are better understood, any surprise regarding 2025 expense/capex guidance provided alongside 4Q results could impact shares,\" Devitt wrote.\n\nTikTok Impact For Meta?\n\nPresident Donald Trump used an executive order to delay enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days earlier this week. But analysts are making sense of what the loss of a major competitor could mean for Meta stock.\n\nBofA's Post said there is still uncertainty about Trump's executive order and the president's stated desire for a joint-venture where a U.S. company owns 50% of TikTok. The possibility for a ban still looms over TikTok.\n\n\"At the very least, TikTok is subject to some ad sales disruption if there is a change in ownership of the company,\" Post said. \"In case of any disruption to TikTok operations in the U.S., we see usage and ad spend shift benefit for Meta.\"\n\nMeta Stock In Flat Base\n\nMeanwhile, Meta stock bounced up from its 50-day line in trading last week and has pushed higher so far this week. Shares are approaching a 638.40 flat base buy point, according to MarketSurge.\n\nFurther, Meta is an IBD Leaderboard stock.\n\nThe social media stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

It is a critical and powerful tool for scalable discovery of relevant data and data flows, which supports privacy controls across Meta\u2019s systems. This allows us to verify that our users\u2019 everyday interactions are protected across our family of apps, such as their religious views in the Facebook Dating app, the example we\u2019ll walk through in this post.\n\nIn order to build high-quality data lineage, we developed different techniques to collect data flow signals across different technology stacks: static code analysis for different languages, runtime instrumentation, and input and output data matching, etc. We then built an intuitive UX into our tooling that enables developers to effectively consume all of this lineage data in a systematic way, saving significant engineering time for building privacy controls.\n\nAs we expanded PAI across Meta, we gained valuable insights about the data lineage space. Our understanding of the privacy space evolved, revealing the need for early focus on data lineage, tooling, a cohesive ecosystem of libraries, and more. These initiatives have assisted in accelerating the development of data lineage and implementing purpose limitation controls more quickly and efficiently.\n\nAt Meta, we believe that privacy enables product innovation. This belief has led us to developing Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI), which offers efficient and reliable first-class privacy constructs embedded in Meta infrastructure to address different privacy requirements, such as purpose limitation, which restricts the purposes for which data can be processed and used.\n\nIn this blog, we will delve into an early stage in PAI implementation: data lineage. Data lineage refers to the process of tracing the journey of data as it moves through various systems, illustrating how data transitions from one data asset, such as a database table (the source asset), to another (the sink asset). We\u2019ll also walk through how we track the lineage of users\u2019 \u201creligion\u201d information in our Facebook Dating app.\n\nMillions of data assets are vital for supporting our product ecosystem, ensuring the functionality our users anticipate, maintaining high product quality, and safeguarding user safety and integrity. Data lineage enables us to efficiently navigate these assets and protect user data. It enhances the traceability of data flows within systems, ultimately empowering developers to swiftly implement privacy controls and create innovative products.\n\nNote that data lineage is dependent on having already completed important and complex preliminary steps to inventory, schematize, and annotate data assets into a unified asset catalog. This took Meta multiple years to complete across our millions of disparate data assets, and we\u2019ll cover each of these more deeply in future blog posts:\n\nInventorying involves collecting various code and data assets (e.g., web endpoints, data tables, AI models) used across Meta.\n\ninvolves collecting various code and data assets (e.g., web endpoints, data tables, AI models) used across Meta. Schematization expresses data assets in structural detail (e.g., indicating that a data asset has a field called \u201creligion\u201d).\n\nexpresses data assets in structural detail (e.g., indicating that a data asset has a field called \u201creligion\u201d). Annotation labels data to describe its content (e.g., specifying that the identity column contains religion data).\n\nUnderstanding data lineage at Meta\n\nTo establish robust privacy controls, an essential part of our PAI initiative is to understand how data flows across different systems. Data lineage is part of this discovery step in the PAI workflow, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nData lineage is a key precursor to implementing Policy Zones, our information flow control technology, because it answers the question, \u201cWhere does my data come from and where does it go?\u201d \u2013 helping inform the right places to apply privacy controls. In conjunction with Policy Zones, data lineage provides the following key benefits to thousands of developers at Meta:\n\nScalable data flow discovery : Data lineage answers the question above by providing an end-to-end, scalable graph of relevant data flows. We can leverage the lineage graphs to visualize and explain the flow of relevant data from the point where it is collected to all the places where it is processed.\n\nEfficient rollout of privacy controls : By leveraging data lineage to track data flows, we can easily pinpoint the optimal integration points for privacy controls like Policy Zones within the codebase, streamlining the rollout process. Thus we have developed a powerful flow discovery tool as part of our PAI tool suite, Policy Zone Manager (PZM), based on data lineage. PZM enables developers to rapidly identify multiple downstream assets from a set of sources simultaneously, thereby accelerating the rollout process of privacy controls.\n\nContinuous compliance verification : Once the privacy requirement has been fully implemented, data lineage plays a vital role in monitoring and validating data flows continuously, in addition to the enforcement mechanisms such as Policy Zones.\n\nTraditionally, data lineage has been collected via code inspection using manually authored data flow diagrams and spreadsheets. However, this approach does not scale in large and dynamic environments, such as Meta, with billions of lines of continuously evolving code. To tackle this challenge, we\u2019ve developed a robust and scalable lineage solution that uses static code analysis signals as well as runtime signals.\n\nWalkthrough: Implementing data lineage for religion data\n\nWe\u2019ll share how we have automated lineage tracking to identify religion data flows through our core systems, eventually creating an end-to-end, precise view of downstream religion assets being protected, via the following two key stages:\n\nCollecting data flow signals : a process to capture data flow signals from many processing activities across different systems, not only for religion, but for all other types of data, to create an end-to-end lineage graph. Identifying relevant data flows : a process to identify the specific subset of data flows (\u201csubgraph\u201d) within the lineage graph that pertains to religion.\n\nThese stages propagate through various systems including function-based systems that load, process, and propagate data through stacks of function calls in different programming languages (e.g., Hack, C++, Python, etc.) such as web systems and backend services, and batch-processing systems that process data rows in batch (mainly via SQL) such as data warehouse and AI systems.\n\nFor simplicity, we will demonstrate these for the web, the data warehouse, and AI, per the diagram below.\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the web system\n\nWhen setting up a profile on the Facebook Dating app, people can populate their religious views. This information is then utilized to identify relevant matches with other people who have specified matched values in their dating preferences. On Dating, religious views are subject to purpose limitation requirements, for example, they will not be used to personalize experiences on other Facebook Products.\n\nWe start with someone entering their religion information on their dating media profile using their mobile device, which is then transmitted to a web endpoint. The web endpoint subsequently logs the data into a logging table and stores it in a database, as depicted in the following code snippet:\n\nNow let\u2019s see how we collect lineage signals. To do this, we need to employ both static and runtime analysis tools to effectively discover data flows, particularly focusing on where religion is logged and stored. By combining static and runtime analysis, we enhance our ability to accurately track and manage data flows.\n\nStatic analysis tools simulate code execution to map out data flows within our systems. They also emit quality signals to indicate the confidence of whether a data flow signal is a true positive. However, these tools are limited by their lack of access to runtime data, which can lead to false positives from unexecuted code.\n\nTo address this limitation, we utilize Privacy Probes, a key component of our PAI lineage technologies. Privacy Probes automate data flow discovery by collecting runtime signals. These signals are gathered in real time during the execution of requests, allowing us to trace the flow of data into loggers, databases, and other services.\n\nWe have instrumented Meta\u2019s core data frameworks and libraries at both the data origin points (sources) and their eventual outputs (sinks), such as logging framework, which allows for comprehensive data flow tracking. This approach is exemplified in the following code snippet:\n\n\n\nDuring runtime execution, Privacy Probes does the following:\n\nCapturing payloads : It captures source and sink payloads in memory on a sampled basis, along with supplementary metadata such as event timestamps, asset identifiers, and stack traces as evidence for the data flow. Comparing payloads : It then compares the source and sink payloads within a request to identify data matches, which helps in understanding how data flows through the system. Categorizing results : It categorizes results into two sets. The match-set includes pairs of source and sink assets where data matches exactly or one is contained by another, therefore providing high confidence evidence of data flow between the assets. The full-set includes all source and sink pairs within a request no matter whether the sink is tainted by the source. Full-set is a superset of match-set with some noise but still important to send to human reviewers since it may contain transformed data flows.\n\nThe above procedure is depicted in the diagram below:\n\nLet\u2019s look at the following examples where various religions are received in an endpoint and various values (copied or transformed) being logged in three different loggers:\n\nInput Value (source) Output Value (sink) Data Operation Match Result Flow Confidence \u201cAtheist\u201d \u201cAtheist\u201d Data Copy EXACT_MATCH HIGH \u201cBuddhist\u201d {metadata: {religion: Buddhist}} Substring CONTAINS HIGH {religions:\n\n[\u201cCatholic\u201d, \u201cChristian\u201d]} {count : 2} Transformed NO_MATCH LOW\n\n\n\nIn the examples above, the first two rows show a precise match of religions in the source and the sink values, thus belonging to the high confidence match-set. The third row depicts a transformed data flow where the input string value is transformed to a count of values before being logged, belonging to full-set.\n\nThese signals together are used to construct a lineage graph to understand the flow of data through our web system as shown in the following diagram:\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the data warehouse system\n\nWith the user\u2019s religion logged in our web system, it can propagate to the data warehouse for offline processing. To gather data flow signals, we employ a combination of both runtime instrumentation and static code analysis in a different way from the web system. The involved SQL queries are logged for data processing activities by the Presto and Spark compute engines (among others). Static analysis is then performed for the logged SQL queries and job configs in order to extract data flow signals.\n\nLet\u2019s examine a simple SQL query example that processes data for the data warehouse as the following:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve developed a SQL analyzer to extract data flow signals between the input table, \u201csafety_log_tbl\u201d and the output table, \u201csafety_training_tbl\u201d as shown in the following diagram. In practice, we also collect more granular-level lineage such as at column-level (e.g., \u201cuser_id\u201d -> \u201ctarget_user_id\u201d, \u201creligion\u201d -> \u201ctarget_religion\u201d).\n\nThere are instances where data is not fully processed by SQL queries, resulting in logs that contain data flow signals for either reads or writes, but not both. To ensure we have complete lineage data, we leverage contextual information (such as execution environments; job or trace IDs) collected at runtime to connect these reads and writes together.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how the lineage graph has expanded:\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the AI system\n\nFor our AI systems, we collect lineage signals by tracking relationships between various assets, such as input datasets, features, models, workflows, and inferences. A common approach is to extract data flows from job configurations used for different AI activities such as model training.\n\n\n\nFor instance, in order to improve the relevance of dating matches, we use an AI model to recommend potential matches based on shared religious views from users. Let\u2019s take a look at the following training config example for this model that uses religion data:\n\nBy parsing this config obtained from the model training service, we can track the data flow from the input dataset (with asset ID asset://hive.table/dating_training_tbl) and feature (with asset ID asset://ai.feature/DATING_USER_RELIGION_SCORE) to the model (with asset ID asset://ai.model/dating_ranking_model).\n\nOur AI systems are also instrumented so that asset relationships and data flow signals are captured at various points at runtime, including data-loading layers (e.g., DPP) and libraries (e.g., PyTorch), workflow engines (e.g., FBLearner Flow), training frameworks, inference systems (as backend services), etc. Lineage collection for backend services utilizes the approach for function-based systems described above. By matching the source and sink assets for different data flow signals, we are able to capture a holistic lineage graph at the desired granularities:\n\nIdentifying relevant data flows from a lineage graph\n\nNow that we have the lineage graph at our disposal, how can we effectively distill a subset of data flows pertinent to a specific privacy requirement for religion data? To address this question, we have developed an iterative analysis tool that enables developers to pinpoint precise data flows and systematically filter out irrelevant ones. The tool kicks off a repetitive discovery process aided by the lineage graph and privacy controls from Policy Zones, to narrow down the most relevant flows. This refined data allows developers to make a final determination about the flows they would like to use, producing an optimal path for traversing the lineage graph. The following are the major steps involved, captured holistically in the diagram, below:\n\nDiscover data flows: identify data flows from source assets and stop at downstream assets with low-confidence flows (yellow nodes). Exclude and include candidates: Developers or automated heuristics exclude candidates (red nodes) that don\u2019t have religion data or include remaining ones (green nodes). By excluding the red nodes early on, it helps to exclude all of their downstream in a cascaded manner, and thus saves developer efforts significantly. As an additional safeguard, developers also implement privacy controls via Policy Zones, so all relevant data flows can be captured. Repeat discovery cycle: use the green nodes as new sources and repeat the cycle until no more green nodes are confirmed.\n\nWith the collection and data flow identification steps complete, developers are able to successfully locate granular data flows that contain religion across Meta\u2019s complex systems, allowing them to move forward in the PAI workflow to apply necessary privacy controls to safeguard the data. This once-intimidating task has been completed efficiently.\n\nOur data lineage technology has provided developers with an unprecedented ability to quickly understand and protect religion and similar sensitive data flows. It enables Meta to scalably and efficiently implement privacy controls via PAI to protect our users\u2019 privacy and deliver products safely.\n\nLearnings and challenges\n\nAs we\u2019ve worked to develop and implement lineage as a core PAI technology, we\u2019ve gained valuable insights and overcome significant challenges, yielding some important lessons:\n\nFocus on lineage early and reap the rewards : As we developed privacy technologies like Policy Zones, it became clear that gaining a deep understanding of data flows across various systems is essential for scaling the implementation of privacy controls. By investing in lineage, we not only accelerated the adoption of Policy Zones but also uncovered new opportunities for applying the technology. Lineage can also be extended to other use cases such as security and integrity.\n\nBuild lineage consumption tools to gain engineering efficiency : We initially focused on building a lineage solution but didn\u2019t give sufficient attention to consumption tools for developers. As a result, owners had to use raw lineage signals to discover relevant data flows, which was overwhelmingly complex. We addressed this issue by developing the iterative tooling to guide engineers in discovering relevant data flows, significantly reducing engineering efforts by orders of magnitude.\n\nIntegrate lineage with systems to scale the coverage : Collecting lineage from diverse Meta systems was a significant challenge. Initially, we tried to ask every system to collect lineage signals to ingest into the centralized lineage service, but the progress was slow. We overcame this by developing reliable, computationally efficient, and widely applicable PAI libraries with built-in lineage collection logic in various programming languages (Hack, C++, Python, etc.). This enabled much smoother integration with a broad range of Meta\u2019s systems.\n\nMeasurement improves our outcomes : By incorporating the measurement of coverage, we\u2019ve been able to evolve our data lineage so that we stay ahead of the ever-changing landscape of data and code at Meta. By enhancing our signals and adapting to new technologies, we can maintain a strong focus on privacy outcomes and drive ongoing improvements in lineage coverage across our tech stacks.\n\nThe future of data lineage\n\nData lineage is a vital component of Meta\u2019s PAI initiative, providing a comprehensive view of how data flows across different systems. While we\u2019ve made significant progress in establishing a strong foundation, our journey is ongoing. We\u2019re committed to:\n\nExpanding coverage : continuously enhance the coverage of our data lineage capabilities to ensure a comprehensive understanding of data flows.\n\nImproving consumption experience : streamline the consumption experience to make it easier for developers and stakeholders to access and utilize data lineage information.\n\nExploring new frontiers : investigate new applications and use cases for data lineage, driving innovation and collaboration across the industry.\n\nBy advancing data lineage, we aim to foster a culture of privacy awareness and drive progress in the broader fields of study. Together, we can create a more transparent and accountable data ecosystem.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees who have played a crucial role in developing data lineage technologies over the years.

            "content": "Meta\u2019s AR glasses are set to take another step forward this year, with the latest reports on the company\u2019s moves providing some more insight into its planning around wearables.\n\nAccording to a new report from Bloomberg, Meta\u2019s planning to release a new version of its current smart glasses later this year, aimed specifically at athletes, with the device\u2019s data tracking elements to help improve performance feedback.\n\nMeta\u2019s athletic sunglasses will reportedly be based on Oakley\u2019s \u201cSphaera\u201d style, and will come with a single camera, in the center of the frame, in order to reduce weight.\n\nOakley is owned by EssilorLuxottica, the same company that owns Ray Ban, which Meta has already partnered with on its first smart glasses. Meta also reportedly invested in the company last year, solidifying that partnership, which will give Meta direct access to the company\u2019s most popular frames and styles when developing its glasses models.\n\nThe models will also, eventually, expand into fully functional AR glasses, though that\u2019s still a little way off yet.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s report, Meta next stage on this front will be to release its first smart glasses with a heads-up display, which are scheduled to be made available later this year.\n\nThe next iteration of its Ray Ban Stories glasses (now called \u201cRay Ban Meta\u201d according to Meta\u2019s product site) will be able to deliver notifications and display photos, via the small display, that will be visible to the wearer at the lower portion of their view. It\u2019ll also be able to run \u201csimple\u201d apps, though they won\u2019t be fully AR-enabled, providing digital overlays on real-world scenes.\n\nThat\u2019s the next stage, which Meta is still planning for 2027, in order to give it more time to establish more sustainable, lower-cost production processes, which will bring down the price of the AR device.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was highly critical of Apple\u2019s approach with its AR-enabled VisionPro device, noting that its $3,499 price tag is simply too high to ensure widespread adoption. Meta, instead, has been committed to driving down the costs of its own wearables to expand market reach, and it\u2019s committed to also launching an AR device that aligns with that same principle.\n\nThough its newer smart glasses will be more expensive.\n\nThe model coming later this year is expected to be around double the price of the current Ray Ban Metas, while the company has also predicted that its AR-enabled glasses will eventually cost the same amount as a \"high end laptop or smartphone.\u201d\n\nBut Zuckerberg also expects that smart glasses will surpass smartphones in popularity and practicality within the next decade, so that cost may be easier to swallow if you\u2019re no longer reliant on a phone. Though that will also require a significant habitual and social shift to facilitate such growth.\n\nMeta is now steadily working towards such a shift, while the push to keep the costs down could also be one of the key reasons why Zuckerberg is keen to work with the incoming Trump administration, in order to avoid increased costs for its projects.\n\nMany of Meta\u2019s glasses components are sourced from China, and with Trump pledging tariffs on non-American goods, especially Chinese imports, that could put a dent in Meta\u2019s plans.\n\nBased on these latest insights, Meta is planning to begin its AR push during Trump\u2019s presidency, which means that it will be hugely dependent on the government to ease its path through regulatory processes, in order to maximize this opportunity.\n\nThat alone may be enough to justify Zuckerberg\u2019s kowtowing to Trump, altering the company\u2019s existing content policies to appease the president, among other compromises.\n\nAnd if Zuck\u2019s right, that very well could pay off significantly in the longer term.\n\nIt won\u2019t be popular, and it's unclear whether the negatives of this approach will outweigh the broader benefits. But for Meta itself, the path forward is clear, and it\u2019s going to need a lot of government cooperation to aid its AI, AR and VR expansion.",

For many, this raised alarms about their control over their social media accounts and Meta\u2019s evolving relationship with political power.\n\n\u2018I Didn\u2019t Sign Up for This\u2019: The Backlash\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, social media lit up with frustrated users who claimed their accounts were now following President Trump, Vice President Vance, and First Lady Melania without their consent. The sentiment was clear: users were uneasy, especially as trust in social media platforms continues to be scrutinized.\n\nMeta\u2019s Explanation: Procedural or Problematic?\n\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, quickly responded, attributing the issue to standard procedure. According to the company, users who had previously followed the @POTUS (President of the United States), @vp (Vice President), or @FLOTUS (First Lady of the United States) accounts under the Biden administration were automatically transitioned to follow the same accounts now representing the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThis is how it\u2019s always worked,\u201d a Meta spokesperson explained via the AP News, emphasizing that the transition of these government accounts ensures continuity for followers.\n\nBut confusion remains.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s Moves: A New Alignment With Trump?\n\nThe controversy comes amid significant shifts at Meta under CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership. Observers have noted a growing alignment between Zuckerberg and the Trump administration, pointing to recent decisions that seem to signal a new era for the tech giant.\n\nBefore the inauguration, Meta announced it was discontinuing its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. These programs, long championed as a cornerstone of corporate responsibility, were suddenly deemed nonessential. As AFROTECH\u2122 previously reported, this decision has raised concerns about whether it reflects Trump\u2019s vocal criticism of \u201cwoke\u201d corporate policies.\n\nIn a separate AFROTECH\u2122 report, Meta also announced the end of its fact-checking system, a move that many view as opening the door to unchecked misinformation. Given Trump\u2019s contentious relationship with fact-checkers during his previous term, the timing of this decision feels especially significant. The removal of fact-checking tools and the dissolution of DEI programs have led some to question whether these moves are part of a broader strategy to align Meta\u2019s platform with the priorities of the Trump administration.\n\nWhat This Means for Meta\u2019s Users\n\nThese developments feel like a seismic shift for Meta\u2019s users, particularly its diverse and politically engaged communities. Whether intentional or procedural, the automatic follow-up has sparked deeper concerns about transparency, control, and the platform\u2019s alignment with certain political ideologies.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a follow button,\u201d one user told Yahoo News. \u201cIt\u2019s about whose voices are amplified and whose are silenced. That\u2019s what makes this so unsettling.\u201d\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf users see that they are following accounts, they should double-check their following lists and manually unfollow any accounts they don\u2019t wish to follow. Adjusting account settings can also help manage future recommendations and follows. But for many, these recommendations feel like too little, too late.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Meta\u2019s automatic follows, and recent decisions signal a broader cultural and political shift for one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies. For Black professionals and communities that rely on these platforms for connection, advocacy, and business, the stakes couldn\u2019t be any higher.\n\nAs Meta moves forward under Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, the questions remain: Is the platform becoming a megaphone for political agendas? And where does that leave the diverse audiences that helped build its empire?",

But a Meta spokesperson said the changes were part of standard procedure during administrative turnover.\n\nOthers noted on Instagram that results for the #democrat hashtag weren\u2019t populating Monday and early Tuesday, instead showing a message stating \u201cWe\u2019ve hidden these results,\u201d adding that \u201cResults for the term you searched for may contain sensitive content.\u201d\n\nThe complaints came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have outwardly shifted their policies and political alignments to the right, leading some users to question if the changes they were observing had something to do with Meta\u2019s political changes.\n\nHowever, Meta Communications Director Andy Stone took to social media to suggest that what users were observing was a combination of Meta\u2019s usual practice during presidential transitions and an unfortunate error.\n\nResponding to a post from Distill Social, a nonprofit group that complained that Meta was forcing people to follow Trump, Stone wrote that the \u201cPOTUS\u201d and \u201cWhite House\u201d accounts \u201care managed by the White House and they change when the occupant of the White House changes,\u201d meaning that if you followed those accounts during one administration, you would still be following them as the administration changes over.\n\nIn a post on X made after this article was published, Stone said that the same procedures were used as the last presidential transition, and that \"People were not made to automatically follow any of the official Facebook or Instagram accounts for the President, Vice President or First Lady. Those accounts are managed by the White House so with a new administration, the content on those Pages changes.\"\n\nAs some users have pointed out, though, Meta has seemingly created new accounts dedicated to archiving the previous administration\u2019s content, which users appear to automatically follow as the administration changes over. As that process has gone through, at least some users were notified that they had started to follow accounts that included those of Trump, Vance and first lady Melania Trump.\n\nKatie Harbath, a former Facebook employee, posted on Threads that her former team set up the presidential accounts transition after Trump won in 2016 and that the account rollover worked the same way in 2020, too.\n\nIn his posts Monday, Stone also addressed complaints around the lack of search results for #democrat.\n\nStone said that Meta is experiencing \u201can issue affecting people\u2019s ability to search for a number of different hashtags on Instagram \u2014 not just those on the left. We\u2019re working quickly to resolve this.\u201d\n\nHe did not specify the nature of the issue and Meta declined to add additional comment.\n\nThe confusion has left some users on edge at a time when the social media giant has seemingly veered to the right.\n\nIn a series of policy and practice changes earlier this month, Zuckerberg announced he would replace its fact-checking system \u2014 which has been heavily criticized by Trump and conservatives over the disputed belief that it disproportionately targets right-wing content \u2014 with a user-driven system similar to X\u2019s Community Notes program.\n\nZuckerberg said its fact-checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased,\u201d while Meta also stated its new community-based system would \u201crequire agreement between people with a range of perspectives.\u201d In a Facebook video announcing the change, Zuckerberg noted that the election had a major influence on the company\u2019s decision to end its fact-checking system in favor of \u201cprioritizing speech.\u201d\n\nAlso this month, Meta announced internally that it would end many of its programs designed to facilitate diversity in hiring, including disbanding its diversity, equity and inclusion team, and discarding its \u201cdiverse slate approach.\u201d\n\nAnd Meta has updated its \"hateful conduct\" policy, which now allows for posts that call LGBTQ people mentally ill. Zuckerberg said in his video that the company is \u201csimplifying content policies\u201d around topics such as gender and immigration.\n\n\u201cWhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg, having donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, was also among the major tech billionaires who attended the new president\u2019s inauguration Monday.\n\n\u201cOptimistic and celebrating \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d he posted on Facebook, with a photo of him and his wife, Priscilla Chan, dressed up for the event.",

However, this model will not include a display, the report said.\n\nAt the same time, Meta is reportedly developing a more advanced pair of smart glasses, codenamed \"Hypernova,\" which will feature a built-in display to show notifications from its smart assistant. This model, expected to launch later this year, may also include temple controls on the frame and may ship with a wrist strap that enables additional controls.\n\nThe Bloomberg story also states that Meta is considering launching new wearable devices, including watches and earbuds with built-in cameras that analyze the surrounding environment in real time.

While adding your WhatsApp to Accounts Center is completely optional and off by default, it can help those who want features to work more seamlessly across apps. For example it\u2019ll be easier to reshare updates from your WhatsApp Status to Facebook or Instagram Stories and show your friends what\u2019s happening in your life without having to post multiple times. You\u2019ll also be able to log back in to your WhatsApp account with a single sign-on, so you can get back into your accounts faster and with fewer steps.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOver time we\u2019ll keep adding more features that work across our apps for people who want them, like the ability to manage your avatars, Meta AI stickers and your Imagine Me creations all in one place. When we make these updates, we\u2019ll explain them clearly in our apps so people can make the choice that\u2019s best for them.\n\nWhenever we introduce these new experiences, it\u2019s our responsibility to help people understand how we protect their personal information. Privacy is paramount to WhatsApp and your personal messages and calls are always protected by end-to-end encryption, which means that no one else, not even WhatsApp or Meta, can read or hear them. Adding your WhatsApp to Accounts Center does not change that.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to offer this choice to people globally, though it will take time to roll out everywhere. When available, you\u2019ll see the option in your WhatsApp settings or it will appear when trying to take action across accounts, such as re-sharing your Status to one of our other apps. For now, you can learn more about Accounts Center for WhatsApp check out here and here.",

(image courtesy the artist)\n\nEarlier this month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent five minutes explaining to over 3 billion users that everything was about to change. In ending Meta\u2019s fact-checking program, he ensured that civil society organizations and governments would immediately scramble and miss the subsequent list of reforms that received less attention but are no less significant. Zuckerberg methodically relayed plans to \u201csimplify\u201d policies, roll back content moderation, and \u201cwork with President Trump to push back on governments around the world\u201d that he accused of \u201ccensorship.\u201d Predicated on what he claims as Meta\u2019s \u201croots\u201d of \u201cfree expression,\u201d a fundamentally debatable statement, the announcement set the scene for politically charged debate over whose expression is favored and why. All are changes that will inevitably affect art and expression on Meta platforms, but the question is: How?\n\nAmong the swirling array of opinions in the wake of Meta\u2019s announcement, few have taken into account the unique position that many artists find themselves in, particularly those who have struggled against stringent policies and uneven, punitive content moderation. Projects like the Vienna Strips account on OnlyFans and the project Don\u2019t Delete Art, of which I am the editor-at-large, have long pointed out Meta\u2019s \u201carbitrary and needlessly aggressive gatekeeping,\u201d which has consistently impacted the livelihoods of artists and the public\u2019s access to art online. Until Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement, artists and marginalized communities had faced amped-up restrictions, account removals, and violations that journalists and free expression groups have recently addressed.\n\nOn the one hand, Meta\u2019s admission of \u201cover-enforcing our rules\u201d and \u201csubjecting too many people to frustrating enforcement actions\u201d is a welcome acknowledgment of the censorship and restriction that inhibited many artists on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. In a concurrent blog post, Meta blamed over-enforcement on complicated policies and flawed automation and laid out a new system relying on user reports for most violations, limiting automated systems to solely detect \u201cillegal and high-severity violations.\u201d This could cut down significantly on what the blog referred to as \u201cdemotions,\u201d which artists may know as \u201cdown-ranking\u201d or \u201cshadowbanning,\u201d that cause visibility issues, restrictions, and self-censorship.\n\nWhile these changes may appear to address some concerns about censorship, artists and Meta users as a whole are right to be skeptical. Along with paring back content moderation, Meta is making policy changes that have raised serious concerns among groups like the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), who see the simplification of policies about immigrants, women, and what the company called \u201ctransgenderism\u201d in the name of \u201cmainstream discourse\u201d as revealing its true goal: to open the floodgates for more hate speech directed at marginalized groups across platforms.\n\n\u201cTroublingly, Meta\u2019s new policies permit slurs and insults against marginalized groups, while actually forbidding those groups from using the same language against others,\u201d NCAC Director Lee Rowland told Hyperallergic in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a content moderation policy \u2014 it\u2019s one that picks winners and losers in a culture war, and silences vulnerable voices.\u201d This, along with other recent shifts at Meta \u2014 shuttering their already flawed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, removing tampons from men\u2019s bathrooms, and seeking \u201cmasculine energy\u201d \u2014 reinforces the belief that the policy changes are what Rowland called \u201ca proxy for politics, not principle.\u201d\n\nFor all their supposed reforms for \u201cfree expression,\u201d Woodhull Freedom Foundation President and CEO Ricci Levy told Hyperallergic that Meta runs the risk of \u201cbecoming unsafe spaces filled with unchecked hate speech and harassment\u201d and \u201cpushing vulnerable communities off these important platforms and normalizing discriminatory attitudes.\u201d Despite scaled-back moderation \u2014 and also because of it \u2014 it\u2019s doubtful that artists who already face obstacles could thrive in an environment such as this.\n\nNanette Consovoy, \u201cbody landscape 2 return\u201d (2024), a digital painting that faced downranking and resulted in account suppression of the artist\u2019s account on Instagram. (image courtesy the artist)\n\nNotably, these monumental decisions were made without consulting civil society organizations, which had been general practice at Meta. This signals a stark break with steps toward collaboration and transparency over recent years, instead labeling regulations that require such input and standards as \u201ccensorship,\u201d such as the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\n\u201cCharacterising this legislation as \u2018censorship\u2019 is both concerning and puzzling,\u201d said Barbora Bukovsk\u00e1, senior director for Law and Policy at the British human rights organization Article 19, in an email to Hyperallergic.\n\n\u201cThe DSA enhances transparency and user recourse regarding content moderation, aligning with human rights principles,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe DSA does not dictate what can or cannot be said online; rather, it sets standards for how platforms should manage harmful content while respecting lawful expression [\u2026] Calling this \u2018censorship\u2019 totally misrepresents the intent and impact of EU laws.\u201d\n\nFor artists on Meta platforms, the future is unclear. Less punitive moderation remains a heartening development, but it is unknown whether guidelines that affect artists\u2019 visibility will change and whether or not subjects like nudity will be considered \u201chigh-severity violations.\u201d\n\nLia Holland, communications director at digital advocacy nonprofit Fight For The Future, captured the justified distrust many artists feel, telling Hyperallergic, \u201cWe have to remember that Meta\u2019s previous content moderation system was also deeply broken, and recognize that whatever they do next will inevitably fail us.\u201d\n\nRegardless, artists are among the wave of users who have already begun to emigrate to other platforms, where user choice and decentralization offer what seems closer to free expression than Meta\u2019s top-down systems. Looking ahead to a future in which artists can truly be free without strings attached, Holland added, \u201cWe are very close to having the technology to accomplish this, and with moves like Meta is making, we\u2019re going to increasingly have the will.\u201d",

Meta says that over the coming months, it will also offer some TikTok creators exclusive content deals to help them grow their communities on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIt\u2019s an attractive offer, and again, with TikTok still under a significant cloud, you can imagine that a least some creators will be re-assessing their options, and looking to a more stable deal.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s a smart push from Meta, which has also added a range of new Instagram elements to further align IGs tools with those available on TikTok.\n\nThat could make Instagram the best destination for TikTok creators.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to go as yet, and many will likely wait to hear more about Trump\u2019s plan to save the app. But you could well see a lot more of your TikTok favorites popping up in your IG feeds.",

            "content": "The biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

(Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMark Zuckerberg's Meta just made a bet that could reshape the internet as we know it: What happens when a social media giant decides to step back and let its users fight their own information wars? By dismantling significant aspects of its content moderation system, Meta isn't just changing policy \u2013 it's running a real-world experiment on the limits of digital freedom. For billions of users worldwide, this experiment could reshape how we experience everything from daily social interactions to political discourse.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation lies what philosopher Karl Popper called the \"paradox of tolerance\" \u2013 the notion that unlimited tolerance might ultimately lead to the disappearance of tolerance itself. Meta's bold experiment brings this decades-old philosophical puzzle into sharp contemporary focus.\n\nMeta claims this dramatic pivot\u2014ending its third-party fact-checking program, reducing automated content removal, and loosening restrictions on controversial topics\u2014will correct \"mission creep\" in content moderation. It cites a 10-20% error rate in content removals\u2014a staggering figure when multiplied across billions of daily posts. While Meta will maintain automated enforcement for serious violations like terrorism and child exploitation, it seems that everything else will be left to users to police themselves.\n\nBut this mathematical precision masks a more profound question: in our digital town square, what's more dangerous\u2014potential overreach or systematic under-protection?\n\nThis question isn't theoretical. As Meta loosens its grip, we're simultaneously witnessing the opposite extreme with the recent US TikTok ban. Ironically, while American officials craft legislation with loopholes allowing certain government figures to maintain their TikTok access, millions of users are migrating to China's RedNote \u2013 a platform known for its strict content restrictions, including censorship of historical events like Tiananmen Square. This stark contrast illustrates how the pendulum of digital freedom can swing dramatically in either direction, often with unintended consequences.\n\nWhile appealing in theory, Meta's proposed solution\u2014a community-based fact-checking system modeled after X's Community Notes\u2014has proven dangerously slow in practice. Research by AI Forensics shows that corrective notes often appear hours after misinformation goes viral\u2014an eternity in social media time. The French government has already sounded alarm bells, arguing that freedom of expression shouldn't be confused with a \"right to virality\" that allows unverified content to reach millions without oversight.\n\nAI Forensics director Marc Faddoul also warns that such systems are vulnerable to manipulation, and their requirement for user consensus creates blind spots: while they might work for obvious misinformation, they often fail to address highly polarizing topics where consensus is harder to achieve.\n\nThis brings us back to Popper's paradox of tolerance, formulated in 1945, which warns that unlimited tolerance inevitably leads to its own destruction. As Popper argued, if a society extends unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, tolerant people will eventually be destroyed along with tolerance itself. This tension was further explored by philosopher John Rawls, who argued that a just society must fundamentally tolerate the intolerant \u2013 otherwise, it would become intolerant and thus unjust. However, he acknowledged that when intolerance poses a concrete threat to democratic institutions, society has a right to self-preservation. Meta's experiment will test both philosophers' theories in real time.\n\nBy reducing content moderation and expanding the bounds of acceptable speech, the company behind Facebook and Instagram is essentially betting that more freedom will lead to better outcomes. However, this approach raises several ethical questions:\n\nWill reduced moderation foster better discourse, or might it spread harmful narratives that could eventually threaten the very openness Meta seeks to protect? Can a community-based fact-checking system effectively counter misinformation without falling prey to the same biases Meta criticizes in professional fact-checkers? How will these changes affect marginalized communities who often face disproportionate harassment and hate speech online?\n\nThe philosophical questions that haunted Plato, Jefferson, and many more thinkers \u2013 how to tolerate dissenting opinions and how to protect democracy from its own excesses \u2013 have found new life in our digital age. These age-old debates take on new urgency in the digital setting: how do we protect open dialogue while preventing the spread of harmful content? Can we build systems that promote both freedom and responsibility? And perhaps most importantly, how do we ensure that increased tolerance doesn't paradoxically lead to its own demise? While the platforms and technologies may be new, the underlying challenge remains remarkably consistent with what philosophers have grappled with for millennia: finding the sweet spot between absolute freedom and necessary constraints to preserve the freedoms we cherish.\n\nAs we watch Meta's experiment unfold, Popper's paradox of tolerance will serve as both a warning and a framework for understanding what happens when we push the boundaries of digital freedom to their limits. The results of this experiment won't just determine Meta's future \u2013 they may well shape how democracy functions in the digital landscape.",

With that program, Facebook (it wasn\u2019t Meta yet) committed to integrating diversity into the fabric of the company, not just through improving employee representation, but also by strategically engaging demographics with large spending power to make better products and reflect our user base.\n\nZuckerberg, a guest of President Trump\u2019s inauguration, just deposited Meta\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program in the \u201ccircular file\u201d because it no longer serves him.\n\nNow, I have to change my answer, thanks to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a guest of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, who just deposited Meta\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program in the \u201ccircular file\u201d because it no longer serves him or, in this case, doesn\u2019t please the incoming administration.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised Zuckerberg is getting rid of the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiative I helped create, or that he\u2019s removing fact-checking and letting people from marginalized communities be subjected to more harassment. I\u2019m only surprised that it took him so long. Sheryl Sandberg, who served as Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer between 2008 and 2022, was the company\u2019s champion of content moderation, sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion. When she left in 2022, I started a countdown clock in my head for the inevitable. With Sandberg gone, the buffer was removed. So what might strike outsiders as a change in ethos for the company is really just Zuckerberg showing us who he really is.\n\nThe business case for diversity was only valid as long as Sandberg was around to enforce it. Now that it\u2019s not politically in vogue, Zuckerberg is abandoning the business use case for diversity and fact-checking, and he\u2019s picked for his VP of global policy Joel Kaplan (who sat behind Brett Kavanaugh, his friend from the George W. Bush White House, at his Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court). All are clear signs of Zuckerberg\u2019s conservative philosophy.\n\nDuring the so-called \u201cracial reckoning\u201d of the summer of 2020, which we now can see was a huge demonstration of corporate pandering, companies were bending over backward to demonstrate how inclusive and accommodating they could be. Conglomerate after conglomerate issued saccharine statements about supporting their diverse (read: Black) employees after the murder of George Floyd, while Covid disproportionately ravaged Black and brown communities. Hundreds of millions of dollars were pledged to civic and civil rights organizations to do business with Black companies and to fund training programs and scholarships to ease that pesky and ever-present \u201cpipeline problem.\u201d\n\nIn June 2020, Facebook pledged a $1.1 billion \u201cinvestment in Black and diverse suppliers and communities in the U.S.\u201d In 2022, Meta reported: \u201cIn 2021, we exceeded our diverse supplier commitment, spending $1.26 billion with US certified diverse suppliers and more than $306 million with Black-owned businesses in the US.\u201d Sandberg left the company as COO the year that report was made, and gone with her was the desire to protect DEI initiatives.\n\nZuckerberg, who\u2019s now evangelizing on the virtues of \u201cmasculine energy\u201d in companies, has reportedly blamed Sandberg for the existence of the company's diversity initiatives and said she was the reason why he couldn\u2019t disband them.\n\nMeta abandoning all companywide DEI programs would mean abandoning efforts to recruit at schools typically outside of their funnel \u2014 the Grace Hopper Conference, the AfroTech Conference, historically Black colleges and universities and state schools \u2014 so it\u2019s clear diversity is not an asset to them. Zuckerberg must have seen Elon Musk of X questioning the talent and intellect of HBCU students; by eliminating DEI programs, he\u2019s essentially doing the same.\n\nI spent nights, weekends, and even part of my maternity leave, creating the supplier diversity program. And now it's defunct.\n\nThis is personal for me. From October 2014 to October 2016, I spent nights, weekends and even part of my maternity leave, creating the supplier diversity program. And now it\u2019s defunct. The company went from hosting what's called the Billion Dollar Roundtable with Google three months ago to disbanding the whole program the next quarter, giving me the worst case of whiplash known to man.\n\nWhen political tides change, lobbyists and global affairs teams seek to improve their relationships with the new people in power. That playbook is nothing new. But surely, Zuckerberg could make inroads with the new administration without co-hosting a black-tie gala or sitting on the dais during Trump\u2019s inauguration. Making nice with a new administration definitely doesn\u2019t require a visit to Mar-A-Lago or sharing his planned policy changes with Trump adviser Stephen Miller before announcing them.\n\nWith the end of fact-checking and Meta abandoning diversity, marginalized people are not only unsafe on these platforms, but hate speech is damn near encouraged. If that\u2019s the kind of products and policies being created, I have no faith that our voices will be heard concerning the disparate impact on product changes. Because to get rid of DEI initiatives is to make sure we\u2019re no longer at the table. Even for those still at Meta, their voice will carry less weight as soon as they advocate for those viewpoints, use cases and outcomes.\n\nThe only thing people can do at this point is vote with their engagement. I\u2019m encouraging people I know to delete their accounts or let them sit dormant. We need to move on from platforms that give free rein to people foaming at the mouth to insult and harm us for their pleasure and that create products that don\u2019t consider their disparate impact on us or our communities. All that as they sell our data.\n\nAre these fundamental changes, or are they just for show? Some may be holding out hope that the DEI work Meta says it\u2019s abandoning will still be done, just under a different name, but I don\u2019t believe that.\n\nI believe this is Zuckerberg showing us who he really is.",

I worked at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.\n\nI had a crazy schedule because the launch of the App Store involved a lot of work. I worked 80-hour weeks and reached burnout.\n\nI realized I didn't want my work to be my entire life. I stayed there for two years and then decided to take shorter contracts again and build more breaks into my work.\n\nI reentered the world of contract work in 2010\n\nI got a contract with Google to work on the Google Play store and did the same quality-assurance work I had done at Apple.

For the first year, I lived in an Airbnb, and my expenses were one-third to one-fifth of my living costs in California.\n\nI worried at first about having an issue remote working from another country, but as soon as I got there, I connected to Meta's systems. I didn't have to use a VPN for remote work \u2014 just a regular WiFi connection.\n\nWhile in Mexico, my pets and I survived two hurricanes, and WiFi was pretty good both times \u2014 I didn't lose any data. The streams were great for holding meetings.\n\nI had no issues working remotely internationally, so I stopped worrying about it\n\nWhile still in Mexico, I got a second contract job as an app marketing manager for Avalara, an automated sales tax compliance software company for businesses. I used a family member's address in California to apply for the role and did not tell Avalara I lived in Mexico.\n\nI had to fly back to California to pick up a company laptop but then returned to Mexico. I don't know if they would've fired me for quietly working from another country, but I didn't want to take any chances.\n\nI took my meetings from my villa in Mexico, and I was loving life. I also visited cities near Mexico City, such as Guadalajara, and took mini vacations often.\n\nI worked both jobs until December 2021, when my contract at Meta was completed. Then, I continued to work only in the role at Avalara.\n\nA new job brought me back to the US\n\nIn March 2022, I left Avalara and started a new contract role at TikTok. That October, TikTok ordered me back into the office, and I returned to California to regroup.\n\nI didn't want to leave Mexico but needed the money from the TikTok job. I stayed at TikTok until February 2023.\n\nCurrently, I work in two remote roles focused on content review and AI content from California.\n\nI want to move abroad again\n\nI plan to return to Mexico or explore other countries like Colombia, Japan, or the Philippines.\n\nMy salary averages around $40,000 per six-month contract. I plan to set up a side hustle in addition to my contract positions to make more money and have more flexibility.\n\nI want to leave the US again for a better quality of life. Less expensive, universal healthcare, and opportunities to explore other cultures are important to me.",

            "content": "Meta\u2019s use of fact checkers will reportedly continue, at least outside the U.S.\n\nThe social media giant has decided to phase out fact-checking in the U.S. in favor of a community notes system, but wants to see how that changes goes before determining how to proceed in other regions, Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta\u2019s head of global business, told Bloomberg News in an interview Monday (Jan. 20).\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said recently that he was reserving the company\u2019s almost decade-old fact checking policy as its systems were making \u201ctoo many mistakes\u201d and unfairly censoring users.\n\nThe Bloomberg report noted that this change would be more difficult outside the U.S., where there are tougher laws governing how platforms handle misinformation. For example, the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act requires large platforms to remove deceptive political content and disinformation or face heavy fines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how that goes as we move it out over the years,\u201d Mendelsohn said. \u201cSo nothing changing in the rest of the world at the moment, we are still working with those fact checkers around the world.\u201d\n\nSome parts of the world aren\u2019t happy with Meta\u2019s decision. For example, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva expressed grave concern with the change earlier this month, calling the move \u201cextremely serious.\u201d Lula said he would hold a meeting with government officials to discuss the implications of this decision, which has triggered backlash in Brazil.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brasilia, Lula stressed the importance of holding digital platforms to the same standards as traditional media outlets when it comes to accountability.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely serious that people want digital communication to not have the same responsibility as someone who commits a crime in the written press,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, last week saw reports that the European Commission was reconsidering its investigations into U.S. tech giants such as Meta, conducting a review that could see those cases being scaled back.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Times (FT), the change was brought about by the election of Donald Trump the the U.S. presidency. One EU official told the FT the review had to do with \u201ctech oligarchs\u201d being close to Trump \u2014 Zuckerberg and other tech CEOs attended the inauguration Monday \u2013 a situation that creates \u201ca whole new ballgame.\u201d",

CEO Mark Zuckerberg admits there will be more chaff among the wheat, but he says the change, along with a major loosening of rules to allow more hate speech, is necessary to support free expression.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea, one that a media organization that cared about the harm it causes would have the courage to resist.\n\nWhatever the reasons for Zuckerberg\u2019s self-proclaimed epiphany, Meta\u2019s platforms certainly will become more like X. They will be deeper holes for actual fake news, misogyny, racist rants, crazed conspiracy claims and addictive content harmful to the health of children.\n\nMeta, Google, Google-owned YouTube, X, TikTok and others paint themselves as First Amendment defenders, but none of our rights are limitless. Just as you can\u2019t buy a bazooka despite the Second Amendment, you can\u2019t shout fire in a crowded theater and escape liability. Media outlets also have a First Amendment right to determine what NOT to publish.\n\nWith that in mind, allow me to tell you a story. Warning to younger readers: It\u2019s an \u201cold guy\u201d story, from the time when I was a newspaper editor, but hang in there.\n\nWhen I became the editor and publisher of the York Daily Record in Pennsylvania in 1990, I felt one of my first jobs was to improve our editorial page, especially the letters to the editor, usually one of the best-read parts of any newspaper. I noticed we published letters written by pretty much the same people day after day. Call them local gadflies. The section had become tiresome and boring, except for those enjoying the sounds of their own hands clapping.\n\nWhen I asked others in the community why they didn\u2019t write letters, a typical response was, \u201cWell, I might, but I don\u2019t want to be associated with those folks.\u201d\n\nSo, we initiated a policy that we wouldn\u2019t publish more than one letter a week (as I recall the number) from the same person.\n\nThe \u201cregulars\u201d protested. We were restricting their First Amendment rights. \u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou have plenty of outlets for your thoughts. You just don\u2019t have a right to publish something multiple times a week in this newspaper.\u201d\n\nSome of our angry regulars realized they could game the system by having their neighbors and friends send their letters under different names. Sometimes we caught it, sometimes we didn\u2019t. We knew that could happen. But guess what? The quality of our page and the quantity of letters both improved.\n\nDoes this sound familiar in 2025? No matter your mindset or motivation, you have more outlets than ever for your thoughts. You can even start your own blog or podcast. It\u2019s cheap and easy.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a key legal distinction that makes accountability optional for Internet media outlets. If a traditional media outlet decided to pursue \u201canything goes\u201d as a content strategy, the laws of libel and defamation could readily put it out of business.\n\nLet\u2019s say someone wrote in a newspaper letter that the local high school football coach was a \u201cknown pedophile.\u201d Let\u2019s say that wasn\u2019t true. Let\u2019s agree that\u2019s obviously libelous. If you said that in a printed letter to the editor to the York Daily Record, not only could the coach sue you, but he could also sue the newspaper. In other words, a newspaper or magazine can be liable for any content on its pages, even when the publication didn\u2019t create the content. We had a responsibility to fact-check letters just as we would articles by our own reporters.\n\nBecause of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Internet media platforms get a free pass on user content. This means that no matter how crazy or damaging the assertion; no matter how wrong or destructive the comment someone makes about you on Facebook, you can\u2019t successfully sue the platform. You still can sue whoever posted the defamatory comment, but good luck tracking the person down or collecting much.\n\nMost newspapers and broadcast outlets have websites, of course. When I worked for Enquirer Media in Cincinnati, Gannett lawyers cautioned us not to edit or change any user-posted content at Cincinnati.com. The policy was to run the comment as is or not run it at all. In the early days, when many news websites allowed anonymous commenting, the online comments on any story involving crime and race got so bad, so fast, that we blocked all comments on those stories. We were legally safe, but we felt an ethical responsibility as well as a business imperative not to have our website associated with such garbage. Maybe you call that \u201cwoke.\u201d I call it being responsible.\n\nWe weren\u2019t staffed, even at a large company like Gannett, to police all the comments people were posting. That speaks to what was well-intentioned about the liability waiver in Section 230 to encourage robust free speech. How na\u00efve we all were! We were na\u00efve about how millions of bad actors would seize the loophole. More significantly, no one anticipated the emergence of gigantic, politically powerful social media companies that would exploit this unprecedented exception for reasons that have nothing to do with journalism or their alleged love of the First Amendment.\n\nThey\u2019d like you to think that they\u2019re providing the pipe and users fill it up. It\u2019s how they manipulate the content going through the pipe that allows them to prime the profit pumps. Britney Spears had it right when she said, \u201cI\u2019m not that innocent.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdumb pipe\u201d argument might be more compelling if Facebook\u2019s feed showed your friends\u2019 posts in a simple order from most recent to oldest \u2013 the way your emails and text messages get ordered unless you choose to adjust that. Instead, social media sites use algorithms and now AI to evaluate what you click on, how much time you spend, what you like and how you interact. The algorithm then controls what posts you see, in what order and when.\n\nWe all know the reasons. They make money by keeping you engaged, sometimes to the point of addiction, to push targeted advertising messages and sell info about you to third parties. The key point: Meta exerts editorial control of your feed using modern, high-tech tools, just as old-school editors decided what was and wasn\u2019t fit to print.\n\nIt\u2019s a tightrope for First Amendment advocates, but I think we must find smart ways to hold the giant media platforms more accountable legally. There are ideas emerging, like states \u201cage-gating\u201d sites to prevent access to porn sites by younger users, which of course is being challenged in courts. Perhaps Congress could modify Section 230\u2019s \u201cfree pass\u201d to force more accountability for feeds that are primarily deployed for marketing purposes.\n\nUnfortunately, serious reform is unlikely. The tech giants are among Washington\u2019s biggest lobbying spenders. So far, they\u2019ve made sure they face less regulation than the nail salon down the street.\n\nEven if you accept the notion that too much fact-checking and post-removing has reflected some type of woke, left-wing bias, \u201canything goes\u201d is not a socially responsible solution. It\u2019s time to get creative for the good of our democracy, ourselves, our national security, and our children.\n\nDennis Hetzel worked extensively on First Amendment and open-government issues during his career as a reporter, editor, publisher, executive director of the Ohio News Media Association and president of the Ohio Coalition for Open Government.

            "content": "Last week saw not one but two high-profile AI legal battles under the spotlight, with updates in separate copyright cases against Meta and OpenAI.\n\nCourt documents unsealed in an AI copyright case against Meta raised new questions about the use of e-books from a book piracy site Library Genesis (LibGen). They also raise new questions about how much CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta execs knew about Meta teams\u2019 use of pirated content to help train its Llama models.\n\nCourt documents allege Meta employees sought to remove copyright information \u2014 including headers and other identifiers \u2014 from various materials. One filing shows an internal Meta document with a suggestion to remove lines containing words like \u201cISBN,\u201d \u201ccopyright,\u201d and \u201call rights reserved.\u201d Another filing includes messages between employees talking about the desire to compete with other AI rivals, including beat OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 while also describing French rival Mistral as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d\n\nOther documents include parts of Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony from his December deposition. Zuckerberg said broad characterizations make the use of pirated content seem \u201clike a bad thing\u201d but added that Meta\u2019s teams \u201cthink through this carefully because there are often more nuances than is kind of apparent at first.\u201d (Meta did not reply to Digiday\u2019s request for comment about the court documents.)\n\nBooks in the LibGen dataset include titles by top authors, including Ta-Nehisi Coates and Sarah Silverman, who are among the authors who filed the lawsuit. Zuckerberg claimed not to be familiar with LibGen. However, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney then asked if Meta would do business with a company that brags about using pirated materials.\n\n\u201cIn general, if someone is broadcasting loudly that they\u2019re doing something that is illegal, that would be a pretty big red flag that I\u2019d want us to look at carefully before engaging with them in any way,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nWhen asked by an attorney if Meta should not be downloading materials from websites known to have pirated materials, Zuckerberg said YouTube hosts \u201csome percent\u201d of pirated content even if most of the content is \u201ckind of good and they have the license to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly on, I think that people did make some assertions about YouTube\u2019s intent on this, and they were less mature about developing their IP rights management,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut even then, I don\u2019t think that I would\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t want people at Meta not to use YouTube, at that point. So \u2014 so I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOther documents suggest Meta execs were aware Llama\u2019s training data had LibGen content and other copyrighted materials from sources like CommonCrawl. Documents also suggest Meta teams knew there could be blowback and potential fines under the EU AI Act if the use of LibGen were uncovered. One document mentioned Meta teams suggesting datasets should be red-teamed to filter out potential information about bio-weapons and harmful stereotypes.\n\nNYT v. OpenAI and Microsoft\n\nRevelations in the Meta case come as tech companies face more scrutiny over the types of content used to train large language models. In a separate lawsuit between The New York Times and OpenAI, attorneys gave oral arguments in court that outlined key points both sides are crafting as part of the case. In both cases, plaintiffs allege tech companies stripped copyright information from content used to train AI models.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving people open for massive copyright infringement without the ability to trace it,\u201d said Steven Lieberman, an attorney representing the New York Daily News, which filed a separate case against OpenAI and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s like it causes the alarm system in your house to go down.\u201d\n\nBeyond court \u2014 publishers ink new AI deals\n\nLast week, Axios and OpenAI announced a new partnership that includes funding new local Axios newsrooms in four cities including Pittsburgh, Pa. and Kansas City, Mo. The deal also gives Axios access to OpenAI\u2019s tech to build new AI products, processes and systems. In a blog post about the deal, Axios CEO Jim VanderHei wrote that the three-year deal will also give all Axios staff access to OpenAI\u2019s enterprise version.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the news last week about AI-powered news. The Associated Press and Google also announced a new partnership that includes the AP providing a feed of real-time information to Google\u2019s Gemini app. The companies\u2019 blog posts didn\u2019t disclose the terms of the deal or what it\u2019ll entail, but noted the plan will help \u201cenhance the usefulness of results\u201d within the Gemini app. Kristin Heitmann, the AP\u2019s chief revenue officer, stated the updates are part of the companies\u2019 ongoing relationship and \u201cbased on working together to provide timely, accurate news and information to global audiences.\u201d\n\nBeyond Axios and the AP\u2019s plans to expand AI news, another company starting with \u201cA\u201d took a step back. Last week, Apple suspended its use of AI news alerts, following criticism for generating inaccuracies in AI-summarized notifications. Meanwhile, a new report by DoubleVerify detailed a network of more than 200 websites generating \u201cAI slop\u201d that mimics real publishers while misleading adtech vendors and buyers.\n\nPrompts and Products \u2014 Other AI news and announcements\n\nAnthrologic, a new startup co-founded by former MediaMonks execs, launched with the goal of helping brands create AI agents.\n\nAdobe debuted a new generative AI tool for its Firefly platform that aims to give retailers more ways to scale personalized content.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ban on TikTok unless the company is sold to a U.S. entity.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Competition Markets Authority announced a new investigation into Google\u2019s search and search ads business, which will explore whether the giant has \u201cstrategic market status\u201d under newly enacted competition U.K. law. One of the CMA\u2019s reasons for the investigation is to make sure AI startups are able to fairly compete with Google\u2019s own AI products and services.\n\nThe FTC, which has been investigating Snapchat\u2019s My AI chatbot, announced it has referred the investigation to the U.S. Justice Department. The investigation includes the \u201callegedly resulting risks and harms to young users,\u201d according to the FTC. \u201cAlthough the Commission does not typically make public the fact that it has referred a complaint, we have determined that doing so here is in the public interest.\u201d\n\nOther AI-related stories from across Digiday",

CEO Sam Altman has scheduled a closed-door briefing with the U.S. government in Washington D.C. on January 30, according to the report.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, revealed earlier this month that Meta is working on an AI, likely to arrive this year, that can replace mid-level engineers at the company.\n\n\"Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code,\" Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan.\n\nRelated: 'Masculine Energy Is Good': Mark Zuckerberg Tells Joe Rogan He Thinks Companies Need More Aggression\n\nIn the interview, Zuckerberg said Meta is working towards the moment when \"a lot of the code in our apps and including the AI that we generate, is actually going to be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIs AI Replacing Tech Jobs?\n\nMeta also announced earlier this month, in a note written by Zuckerberg and obtained by Bloomberg, that it would be cutting about 5% of its 72,000-person staff. However, AI won't be replacing those roles just yet. Zuckerberg said Meta intends to backfill the roles affected in 2025 or hire new employees to fill the vacancies left by those let go by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: 'Going to Be an Intense Year': Meta Is Laying Off More Than 3,000 as CEO Mark Zuckerberg Calls for 'Extensive Performance-Based Cuts' \u2014 Read the Memo\n\nStill, Meta isn't the first Big Tech company to tout AI's coding capabilities. On an October earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated that more than a quarter of all new code at Google is \"generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by our engineers.\"\n\n\"This helps our engineers do more and move faster,\" Pichai said.\n\nAnd it's not just tech \u2014 banks are using AI to replace human work too. In March, JPMorgan Chase claimed that its free cash flow intelligence AI tool helped cut manual human work by 90%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated in July that AI would eliminate jobs at the bank, especially in the customer service department, but would add jobs too.\n\nAccording to a June survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond, more than 60% of large U.S. companies plan to use AI within a year to take over tasks previously completed by human workers.",

This involves logging out from all Meta platforms, which includes WhatsApp, Threads, Messenger, Metaquest and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be logged off for the week,\u201d he captioned his post. \u201cPlease consider doing the same so corporations like Meta can imagine there might be consequences for helping advance the far right in America and world wide.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOr are we too addicted we can\u2019t log off even for one week?\u201d\n\n\u201cIts so gross,\u201d he continued in his post\u2019s caption. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to step away for a week as some form of protest - and then I\u2019ll come back and decide what to do from there.\u201d\n\nStipe\u2019s decision to temporarily boycott Meta coincides with Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration today and comes just days after Meta chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company was controversially removing the use of independent fact checkers on its platforms, replacing them with X-style \u201ccommunity notes\u201d. This leaves the accuracy of posts up to users.\n\nZuckerberg said that fact checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased\u201d and declared it was \u201ctime to get back to our roots around free expression\u201d.\n\nThe move has been met with widespread criticism and thought to be an attempt to align with the upcoming Trump administration.\n\nTrump recently said that he was impressed by Zuckerberg\u2019s decision and added that Meta have \u201ccome a long way\u201d. That way seems to head to the spread of further misinformation, according to commentators who join Stipe in saying that it contributes to the spread of far-right ideologies.\n\nTo answer Stipe\u2019s rhetorical question about social media addiction, statistics by California State University suggest that around 10 per cent of Americans are addicted to social media. Elsewhere, recent studies have shown that more than 77 per cent of Internet users (approx. 3.6 billion people worldwide) are active on at least one Meta platform.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an uphill struggle to log off for even a week then, which says plenty about how reliant we are to Meta. And by reliant, please read: enslaved to.\n\nStill, Stipe is leading the charge and is not the only celebrity to announce his departure from social media. While the R.E.M. frontman\u2019s absence is temporary for the time being, The Cure\u2019s Robert Smith announced over the weekend that he is leaving X for good.\n\nHowever, he posted that he will be active on Bluesky and Instagram. \u201cOtherwise I will likely be outside,\u201d added Smith.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"",

But evidently, Meta\u2019s not as willing to take on the associated risk, and the impact that it could have on its key revenue stream.\n\nSo advertisers can breathe a sigh of relief, though influencer marketers may still have some concerns, especially for branded content.\n\nMeta allows advertisers to pay influencers to promote their products, with branded content tags attached for transparency. And Meta hasn\u2019t clarified if these will also be exempt from Community Notes, once Meta implements them.\n\nI suspect that they will be, as this is another key element of Meta\u2019s broader ad business, even if the company doesn\u2019t directly benefit from such campaigns. But if Meta wants to maximize its ad revenue, this is another consideration, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Meta looks to approach this element when its Community Notes are activated, which is expected to happen in the next few weeks.\n\nBut really, not even Meta itself has all the answers as yet. The rushed implementation of Community Notes, in order to appease President Trump, hasn\u2019t been mapped out as yet, and Meta hasn\u2019t even figured out the full details of what it will mean, and how it will initiate an effective community-sourced system for its 3 billion users.\n\nThat\u2019ll be a much bigger undertaking than it was on X, which is still refining its own Community Notes approach.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s all in flux, and we\u2019ll find out the full detail as Meta does.",

He added that the company is working with select creators to gather feedback about the app.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re announcing a new app called \u2018Edits,\u2019 for those of you who are passionate about making videos on your phone. There\u2019s a lot going on right now, but no matter what happens, it\u2019s our job to provide the best possible tools for creators,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMosseri said the app will have a suite of creative tools, including a dedicated tab for inspiration, a tab for keeping track of ideas, and a high-quality camera. Plus, it will have the ability to share draft versions of creations with friends or collaborators. He added that creators would be able to see insights on how videos made through Edits are performing on Instagram after publishing.\n\nIn a separate post, he emphasized that the app is \u201cmore for creators than casual video makers,\u201d which is hard to quantify in measurable terms.\n\nMeta has historically made moves to fill in gaps in the market. When TikTok was banned in India in June 2020, it launched a similar product, Instagram Reels, days later in early July. In 2023, the company also launched Threads, a rival to text-based social networks such as X. The company likely realizes that a lot of video creators will try another tool in the absence of CapCut.

I've made exactly one Facebook post in each of the past two years.\n\nI've been in local journalism long enough \u2014 and at the right time \u2014 to watch social media support, usurp, and ultimately dismantle my profession around me. I've watched with disgust (and that's precisely the right word) as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk padded their pockets by monetizing content exploiting our society's most base desires, all along knowing the harm their platforms have caused.\n\nSocial media is like strong medicine, it turns out. There's always been good to be found, but the side-effects become intolerable over time.\n\nMaybe that's why I was struck Thursday night by a brief section of outgoing President Joe Biden's farewell address. Biden offered a warning about the rise of a \"tech-industrial complex\" as social media billionaires cozy up to our nation's highest seats of political might.\n\n\"The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact-checking,\" Biden said. \"The truth is smothered by lies, told for power and for profit. We must hold the social platforms accountable to protect our children, our families and our very democracy from the abuse of power.\"\n\nBiden went on to say, \"it\u2019s going to be up to the president, the presidency, the Congress, the courts, the free press, and the American people to confront these powerful forces\" while also touching on artificial intelligence's potential for both benefit and harm to democracy.\n\nIt's clear that the tech billionaires see President-elect Donald Trump's second term as an opportunity to exploit. Trump's inauguration donor and attendee list reads like a who's who of Silicon Valley \u2014 Musk, Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sunda Pichai, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among others.\n\nIt's not exactly the \"people over profits\" crowd, so count me among those skeptical about big tech's willingness to police itself. That's where Trump, Congress and the courts will walk the razor's edge of protecting free speech in an era when this most basic American right can be weaponized by bad actors both foreign and domestic and disseminated for maximum harm.\n\nA free press remains vital to helping the American people understand this evolving nexus of big tech and our nation's politics. \"Crumbling\" as it may be, it's the alternative to these powerful platforms monopolizing the flow of information about their own attempts to influence and wield our nation's considerable might.\n\nThankfully, examining these issues isn't the sole purview of those in Washington, D.C. Local lawmakers, local citizens and, yes, local journalists are leading these discussions across the country.\n\nLast week, Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, introduced a bill that would require parental consent before Hoosiers younger than 16 can access social media.\n\nIndyStar senior politics reporter Hayleigh Colombo wrote of the bill: Such policies are gaining traction nationwide as concerns grow about the impacts of social media on minors. For example, Florida residents under age 14 are now banned from accessing social media platforms. And Tennessee also now requires social media companies to verify parental consent for minor users. The Tennessee law resulted in a lawsuit filed by Facebook and Instagram's parent company Meta, alleging free speech violations.\n\nWhile acknowledging that motivated youth have ample ways to get around the bill's provisions, Bohaceck said the safety of children gives the state a \"compelling enough reason to be able to put these restrictions in place.\"\n\nACLU executive director Christopher Daley testified against the bill, stating it would open up Indiana to litigation and infringe on younger Hoosiers' First Amendment rights, Colombo reported.\n\nI don't pretend to be smart enough to know if or where a line can be drawn concerning Americans' open access to and expression of information. But as the father of three children who will grow up in an era when \"is this real or an attempt to mislead me\" will be the question of their time, I'm grateful for the leadership of Bohaceck and Daley in wrestling with the issue.\n\nI'm also grateful that Biden is only half right in his assessment of the free press that's here to bring these discussions to light in the communities we serve. Diminished as the national press corps' headcount may be, Hoosiers don't have to look far for a counterpoint to \"disappearing editors.\"\n\nNot when IndyStar has added 14 journalists since this time last year. Not when Mirror Indy launched in December 2023 with nearly 20 journalists as part of Free Press Indiana's efforts to expand journalism across the state. Not when our peers in numerous other newsrooms in Indy and across the state stand ready to tell Indiana's stories.\n\nJournalists are hypercompetitive. You can expect us to fight for scoops, to compete to hire and retain talented reporters, photographers and editors who are dedicated to telling Indiana's stories. We're not always going to move in unison, but more journalists is a good thing for Indianapolis.\n\nWhy? Because to a person we stand resolute to rise to the challenge Biden set forth. To confront these powerful forces with you, for you.\n\nThank you, as always, for reading IndyStar.\n\nEric Larsen is IndyStar executive editor. Reach him at ericlarsen@indystar.com.",

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other Louis Navellier's top long-term stock picks.\n\nLouis Navellier is a prominent American investor, author, and financial analyst, best known for his quantitative approach to stock selection and his long-standing track record in the investment industry. As the founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, a private investment management firm, he has built a reputation for identifying high-growth stocks with significant upside potential. Navellier\u2019s approach blends rigorous quantitative analysis with a focus on fundamental factors, positioning him as a leading voice in growth investing.\n\nBorn in 1957, Navellier developed an early interest in the stock market. He honed his analytical skills while studying at California State University, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Finance. It was during his college years that Navellier discovered his passion for quantitative analysis, developing a stock-picking system as part of a class project. This project laid the foundation for his career, as he created a system to identify market-beating stocks using specific growth and valuation criteria.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn 1980, Navellier founded Navellier & Associates, which has grown into a respected investment management firm catering to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Over the years, the firm has managed billions of dollars in assets, applying Navellier\u2019s quantitative methodology to identify outperforming stocks. Navellier is also widely known for publishing the Navellier Growth newsletter, where he shares stock recommendations and insights into market trends. In his newsletter-based recommendations, many stocks have achieved annualized returns exceeding 20% during high-growth market periods.\n\nNavellier\u2019s approach focuses on finding stocks that exhibit strong growth characteristics while maintaining sound fundamentals. He relies heavily on quantitative analysis, utilizing algorithms and statistical models to screen for stocks with high revenue and earnings growth, solid profit margins, and favorable valuation metrics. Unlike many value investors who prioritize underpriced securities, Navellier embraces growth investing, emphasizing companies with strong momentum and the potential for rapid expansion. This strategy often leads him to sectors like technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.",

            "content": "The Fool\u2019s Take\n\nYou may know Meta Platforms for its social media services, but it\u2019s also become a major player in artificial intelligence (AI). Meta AI, the company\u2019s chatbot available across its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger properties, has become a leader in generative AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the company\u2019s third quarter, Meta AI had more than 500 million monthly active users. And in early October, Meta said that over 1 million advertisers in the last month had used its generative AI tools to create more than 15 million ads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty around generative AI, but having the biggest user base of any AI chatbot is an advantageous position. And Meta\u2019s advertising business, with the help of its AI infrastructure, continues to deliver strong results.\n\nBusiness Briefing Become a business insider with the latest news. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn the third quarter, its advertising revenue jumped 19% to $39.9 billion, making up nearly all the revenue for the company.\n\nSome recent policy shifts have caused controversy, but Meta Platforms has been growing rapidly and delivering huge profit margins. Its stock is also reasonably priced at a recent price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Meta Platforms. Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.)\n\nAsk The Fool\n\nFrom I.S., Grafton, Vt.: What are \u201cdefined-benefit\u201d and \u201cdefined-contribution\u201d retirement plans?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may know them by different names. A pension, for example, is a defined-benefit plan because the amount you\u2019ll receive from it is fixed in advance. A 401(k) or 403(b) account, in contrast, is a defined-contribution plan because you determine the amount you (and perhaps your employer) contribute to it \u2014 by specifying that, say, 5% or 10% of your paycheck be routed to your 401(k) account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the amounts of each contribution are known, it\u2019s not known how big your account will become over time, as much depends on the performance of the investments you choose.\n\nDefined-benefit pensions were much more common in past decades, and defined-contribution plans are much more prevalent today.\n\nThis has shifted both risks and responsibilities. Employers bear more responsibility with defined-benefit plans, as they have to accumulate funds sufficient to meet their future obligations. With defined-contribution plans, it\u2019s on the employee to decide how much to save and invest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn more about 401(k) plans and other retirement issues at Fool.com/retirement.\n\nFrom R.D., Adrian, Mich.: How should I invest money I\u2019m saving to buy a house in a few years?\n\nStocks are generally best for building wealth, but keep any money you\u2019ll need within five (if not 10) years out of stocks. The stock market can be volatile, and you don\u2019t want to have it crash right before you withdraw funds for your down payment.\n\nKeep your short-term savings in safer places, such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs). You can find good rates for such accounts at Bankrate.com (under \u201cSite map\u201d) or at Fool.com/money (under \u201cBanks\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fool\u2019s School\n\nStock splits tend to get many investors excited. They certainly seem wonderful: One day you own, say, 100 shares of a stock and a few days later, you own 200 or 300 or 700 or more. What\u2019s not to like? That\u2019s less meaningful than it might seem, though.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Imagine that you own 100 shares of Wireless Pie Co. (ticker: WIPIE), which delivers pies electronically. When the shares are trading for around $40 apiece, the stock splits 4-for-1. You will now have 400 shares of Wireless Pie, but there\u2019s a catch: At the same time that your shares multiply in number, their price is adjusted downward proportionately \u2014 in this case to about $10 per share.\n\nSo before the split, you owned 100 shares of a $40 stock, for a total value of $4,000. After the split, you own 400 shares of a $10 stock \u2014 for a total value of $4,000. Not much really changes with stock splits. Note that splits come in a wide variety \u2014 they\u2019re often 2-for-1, but other kinds include 3-for-2, 3-for-1, 7-for-1 or even 50-for-1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2024, for example, Chipotle Mexican Grill executed a 50-for-1 split. Pre-split, the shares were trading for around $3,300 apiece, and post-split for around $66. Companies often split their shares to keep them affordable for most investors.\n\n\u201cReverse splits\u201d exist, too, and work as you might imagine: Your number of shares decreases while the share price increases. Reverse splits are typically executed by struggling companies, in order to make their shares look less like a penny stock or to avoid getting delisted from a stock exchange that has minimum price levels.\n\nDon\u2019t get too excited over stock splits. Yes, it can be fun to suddenly own lots more shares, but the company\u2019s prospects haven\u2019t changed, nor has the total value of your shares.\n\nRemember, too, that a lower price doesn\u2019t suddenly make a stock a bargain, and that a high-priced stock can be on its way to much higher prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy Dumbest Investment\n\nFrom P.K., online: My most regrettable investment moves happened years ago. I invested in both Apple and Netflix. I held on for a while and made a decent amount on both, but I was new to investing and should have held on and never sold. Those two sales probably cost me $1 million in profits I could have had.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 my accounts have done fine, but they could have done a lot better. I learned to try not to pay attention to business news. The news is not built to give you thoughtful guidance; it is to scare you and get eyeballs on it.\n\nThe Fool responds: A lot of headlines are indeed designed to grab eyeballs, and many news stories are not very meaningful for long-term investors. For example, if a company\u2019s factory burns down, its performance can take a hit, but it\u2019s likely to recover and keep growing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou were smart to invest in both Apple and Netflix, as both have been phenomenal performers. The trick about selling is to ask yourself whether you believe your shares will keep growing and become more valuable over time. With great companies, investors who hang on through thick and thin for years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 are often richly rewarded.\n\n(Do you have a smart or regrettable investment move to share with us? Email it to TMFShare@fool.com.)\n\nWho Am I?\n\nI trace my roots to Indianapolis in 1876, when a Civil War veteran launched me, aiming to develop and sell products to ease people\u2019s pains. My staff treated World War I soldiers in France. In 1923, I introduced the first commercially available insulin. I mass-produced penicillin in the 1940s and was among the first to manufacture the Salk polio vaccine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, with a recent market value of over $700 billion, I\u2019m a major pharmaceutical concern, tackling diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, immune system disorders, cancer and more. I recently employed 46,240 people, more than half outside the United States.\n\nWho am I?\n\nForget last week\u2019s question? Find it here.\n\nLast week\u2019s answer: Greyhound",

You stole stories from snap chat and you made threads cus of twitter,\" another wrote.\n\n\"You are hated by 170 million people,\" wrote yet another.\n\nAll these comments from so-called TikTok 'refugees' showed up on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's most recent Instagram post, which was posted shortly after TikTok went dark for American users on Saturday night. The video of a surfing Zuckerberg, which was initially filled with Instagram users lauding his skills, was quickly overrun with angry users.\n\nTheir frustration may be short-lived. TikTok announced Sunday it was 'restoring service' after President-election Donald Trump said he would issue an executive order on Monday delaying the ban.\n\nFor those few hours, however \u2014 and for the days leading up to the potential ban \u2014 TikTok users directed their ire at Meta apps like Instagram and Facebook. A flyer promoting a boycott of the apps \u2014 dubbed \"Lights Out Meta\" and scheduled from January 19 to 26 \u2014 circulated on Reddit.\n\nOthers flocked to RedNote, another Chinese-owned app, and Lemon8, TikTok's sister app, the fate of which appears to be following that of TikTok.\n\nOn X, users said their frustrations stemmed in part from the US government citing national security concerns as a reason to ban TikTok.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court upheld the law on Friday that requires TikTok to divest its US-based operations or effectively cease operations, the justices said it was \"necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nSome X users said that stance is hypocritical because American-based apps like Facebook have also shared user data with foreign entities. Facebook said it had data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese electronics companies \u2014 including Huawei \u2014 in 2018, according to The New York Times. The outlet reported that American intelligence officials had previously flagged Huawei as a national security threat.\n\nMore recently, senators sent a letter to Zuckerberg questioning Meta about documents showing that Facebook developers in China and Russia had access to user data, according to Reuters. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio shared the letter on his website in 2023.\n\n\"It appears from these documents that Facebook has known, since at least September 2018, that hundreds of thousands of developers in countries Facebook characterized as 'high-risk,' including the People's Republic of China (PRC), had access to significant amounts of sensitive user data,\" the letter read.\n\nOne X user cited The New York Times article about Facebook's data-sharing partnerships with Chinese companies.\n\n\"Folks forgot about this with all the focus on TikTok, but Meta/Facebook was selling your data to China for years,\" the user wrote.\n\nAs some American TikTok users regained access to their accounts, they celebrate on competing social media sites.\n\n\"MY TIKTOK IS WORKING ITS BACK EVERYONE,\" one X user wrote.\n\nA representative for Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

            "content": "The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock ). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(META) the Best Machine Learning Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 235\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of favorable factors. Firstly, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, Ad impressions delivered across the Meta apps increased by 7% year-over-year, and the average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year. In addition, revenue was $40.59 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year and total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Secondly, Meta has developed LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), an open-source large language model, which is designed to advance natural language processing capability. Llama 3.1 405B is in a class of its own, with unmatched flexibility, control, and state-of-the-art capabilities that rival the best closed-source models. Meta has also announced Grand Teton, designed with compute capacity to support the demands of memory-bandwidth-bound workloads, such as Meta\u2019s deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), as well as compute-bound workloads like content understanding.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, led by Mark Zuckerberg, has developed an artificial intelligence model called SEAMLESSM4T, which incorporates several innovations and surpasses existing models. This system is capable of performing translations in multiple languages, both from and to text and from and to audio, as well as all their combinations.\n\nThe SEAMLESSM4T model, developed by Meta's AI division, FAIR, is an evolution of its previous model presented in August 2023 and aims to achieve a \"Babel Fish\" by helping to translate speech between any two languages, reported El Faro de Vigo. This advancement brings the concept of instantaneous universal translation closer to reality.\n\nSEAMLESSM4T facilitates voice-to-voice translation, recognizing 101 languages and translating into 36 languages; voice-to-text translation from 101 to 96 languages; text-to-voice translation from 96 to 36 languages; text-to-text translation among 96 languages; and automatic speech recognition for 96 languages. This capability accelerates the translation process by performing translations without intermediate steps.\n\nSEAMLESSM4T achieves between 8% and 23% better results than state-of-the-art translation systems, with a precision that is 8% to 23% higher, according to the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy standard, as reported by Tech Xplore.\n\nFurthermore, SEAMLESSM4T is 50% more resistant to background noise and speaker variations in voice-to-text conversion tasks than previous state-of-the-art systems, with improved background noise filtering by 42% to 66%, according to 20 Minutos. This robustness enhances its performance in real-world scenarios where such challenges are common.\n\nAccording to the journal Nature, the SEAMLESSM4T system promises to revolutionize global communications by imitating the tone and voice of the interlocutors and represents a step forward in improving communication beyond linguistic barriers, as reported by Tech Xplore. Readers of science fiction might be familiar with the Babel Fish from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a small fish that could be inserted into an ear and simultaneously translate from one spoken language to another, as noted by HuffPost Spain.\n\nMeta has made resources related to SEAMLESSM4T publicly available for non-commercial use to assist further research on inclusive speech translation technologies, according to El Peri\u00f3dico. \"All contributions to this work are publicly available for non-commercial use in order to promote further research on inclusive speech translation technologies,\" the company stated, as reported by 20 Minutos.\n\nIn an article published in Nature, Tanel Alum\u00e4e from the Language Technology Laboratory at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) in Estonia highlights that the model is capable of translating directly into 36 languages. Alum\u00e4e describes this capability as \"impressive because it can\u2014for example\u2014translate spoken English to spoken German without having to transcribe it first into English to translate it afterward.\"\n\nAlum\u00e4e points out that although the SEAMLESSM4T model translates around a hundred languages, the number of spoken languages in the world is about 7,000. He notes that the tool still has difficulties in many situations that humans handle with relative ease, such as conversations in noisy places or between people with strong accents, according to Diario de Sevilla. He predicts that \"the authors' methods to leverage real-world data will open a promising path towards speech technology that rivals science fiction,\" as reported by El Peri\u00f3dico.\n\nAllison Koenecke from the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University in New York warns that although speech technologies may be more efficient and cost-effective than humans, \"it is imperative to understand the ways in which these technologies fail disproportionately for some demographic groups,\" especially in sensitive contexts like medicine or the legal field. Koenecke emphasizes that it is essential for future researchers in speech technologies to improve performance disparities, as noted by El Peri\u00f3dico.

            "content": "In news that should surprise no one, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, becomes the latest company to end its DEI programs.\n\nAs reported by CNBC (citing the initial report from Axios), Janelle Gale, Meta\u2019s vice president of people, announced in an internal memo that Meta plans to end several internal programs \u201cdesigned to increase the company\u2019s hiring of diverse candidates,\u201d the latest change ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term.\n\nFor those who have been following Meta\u2019s founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s actions over the past few months, notably his restored relationship with Trump, this should come as no surprise.\n\nGale\u2019s memo, in part, says:\n\nThe legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms long standing principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics. The term \u201cDEI\u201d has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others. At Meta, we have a principle of serving everyone. This can be achieved through cognitively diverse teams, with differences in knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Such teams are better at innovating, solving complex problems and identifying new opportunities which ultimately helps us deliver on our ambition to build products that serve everyone. On top of that, we\u2019ve always believed that no one should be given \u2014 or deprived \u2014 of opportunities because of protective characteristics, and that has not changed.\n\nAmong the changes, Meta is ending its \u201cDiverse Slate Approach\u201d of considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. It is also ending its diversity supplier program and equity & inclusion training programs. Gale also announced the disbanding of Meta\u2019s DEI team, moving Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams into a new role focused on accessibility and engagement.\n\nSeveral Meta employees criticize the new policy. In a comment that got reactions from more than 600 colleagues, one employee wrote, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand by your principles when things get difficult, they aren\u2019t values. They\u2019re hobbies.\u201d\n\nThe DEI policy changes are the latest in a series of policy reversals over the past month. Last week, Meta replaced global affairs head Nick Clegg with longtime colleague Joel Kaplan, who has strong ties to the Republican party. Earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced a new, heavily criticized \u201cfree speech\u201d policy that marks the end of its third-party fact-checking program.\n\nThe news also comes after Meta joined Amazon in donating $1 million to Trump\u2019s Inauguration Fund. Zuckerberg congratulated Trump on his victory in his app, writing, \u201cCongratulations to President Trump on a decisive victory. We have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration.\u201d\n\nWell, looks like Zuckerberg & Trump\u2019s working relationship is only beginning\u2026\n\nREAD THE FULL MEMO HERE",

            "content": "By Suzanne Nossel\n\nThe announcement by Mark Zuckerberg that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Threads, will dramatically overhaul its approach to content moderation on the eve of the second Trump inauguration comes as no surprise. Trump and major social media platforms have been warring for years over perceived anti-conservative bias, including Meta\u2019s decision to shutter Trump\u2019s accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nWhile the latest moves look like corporate self-preservation in a vindictive political environment, they also reflect stubborn realities about stewarding a global public square \u2014 and they will reverberate around the world in ways that could fundamentally reshape the possibilities of a truly global digital platform.\n\nThe changes Zuckerberg announced are sweeping. Meta will do away with the U.S. third-party fact-checking program in favor of mimicking X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d model of crowd-sourced corrections. Except for the most severe types of unlawful or dangerous content, such as \u201cterrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams,\u201d the company will drop reliance on automated systems to flag potential violations, instead leaving it up to users to report objections when they spot a policy breach. Meta will err on the side of leaving up content that does not violate the law or otherwise foster offline harm, and loosen speech restraints on political subjects including immigration and gender identity. Corporate teams that oversee trust and safety will relocate from California to Texas \u201c and other U.S. locations,\u201d presumably to reflect more mainstream \u2014 meaning red state \u2014 political sensibilities.\n\nMeta has wasted no time revamping its rules in keeping with this shift. Updates on Tuesday to the company\u2019s hateful conduct policy, part of its \u201cCommunity Standards,\u201d narrowed its definition of \u201cdehumanizing speech.\u201d They eliminated prior bans on, for example, likening people to feces and on speech denying the existence of protected characteristics such as religious affiliations and gender identities. After years of campaigning for more and updated internet regulations, Meta leadership is now pledging to work with the Trump administration to ward off guardrails around the world, repudiating Biden-era efforts to curtail disinformation and online abuse. Dana White, a Trump ally and the Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive, is joining Meta\u2019s board.\n\nThese latest changes confirm that while Meta claims billions of users worldwide, at least for now the audience that matters most resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The relocation of trust and safety teams to Texas risks trading years of expertise in grappling with global moderation dilemmas for an uncertain bid to have a finger on the pulse of what\u2019s assumed to be middle America.\n\nNarrower hate-speech policies may make sense to enable more debate on hot-button U.S. issues including the border and gender identity. But they will also end up loosening the spigot on ethnic vilification in parts of the world including Myanmar, South Sudan and Ethiopia, where such hatreds can explode into uncontrolled violence. Meta has not explained how the new global standards will apply in other jurisdictions, including not just repressive societies but also liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada that define and prohibit hateful speech more broadly than does the United States.\n\nAlthough the U.S. is rightly proud of its 1st Amendment tradition and wide berth for free speech, it should not force its standards on the world. And we can\u2019t rule out connections between online hate speech and physical violence in the U.S. at a time when the link between online extremism and real-world terror may be intensifying.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement is likely to drive some Meta users off the platform. Those in the U.S. who aren\u2019t interested in seeing more hateful speech or politics can simply abandon their accounts and stay informed and connected to friends via other online alternatives.\n\nBut in the West Bank, Maldives, some 30 countries in Africa, and elsewhere, Meta platforms essentially are the internet. In Africa, Meta invested in a program known as Free Basics to give users free online access through their phones, providing a lifeline \u2014 though a controversial one\u2014 for individuals and businesses that makes them dependent on the platform.\n\nMeta is not wrong to point out that the assertive policing of online speech is riddled with line-drawing exercises that are impossible to carry out at scale across billions of posts every day. Their choice to err on the side of more speech is a defensible, if imperfect, response to a political moment in the U.S. in which a large segment of the population feels constricted by the limits of acceptable public discourse.\n\nAround the world, though, users will have little say over how these changes play out in vastly different contexts, with consequences that may reshape societies and even threaten lives. America first, indeed.\n\nSuzanne Nossel is a member of Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board and the author of \u201cDare to Speak: Defending Free Speech for All.\u201d",

            "content": "LGBTQ+ apps are seeing a surge of interest after Meta's content moderation changes.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with several founders building apps about the influx of users.\n\nThe apps are focused on safety, privacy, and community amid tech industry shifts.\n\nBetween Meta's changes to its content-moderation policies and the TikTok ban, the past week has left many social-media users questioning where to go next.\n\nFor some LGTBQ+ users, that's resulted in a search for platforms specifically designed for their community that offer both connection and safety.\n\nBI spoke with three founders building apps for the LGBTQ+ community who said they'd seen a spike in downloads and new users this month.\n\n\"We've just been trying to stop the product from combusting because we've been having so many people come in,\" said Callum Smith, founder of Collective, a queer community and dating app where users can share photos, songs, GIFs.\n\nOne user on Collective posted this week that they were \"slowly looking for options to shift from Meta.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lex, a queer community and text-based app that was acquired by 9count in September, also noticed a spike beginning in the second week of January. Jennifer Lewis, Lex's CEO, said the app saw a 2x spike in downloads following Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that the company would alter its content-moderation and community standards.\n\nMeta's changes included updating its Hateful Conduct policy, which now allows \"allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like 'weird.'\"\n\n\"This is the most anti-LGBTQ announcement that a social-media platform has made in recent memory,\" Josh Helfgott, an LGBTQ+ advocate and content creator, told BI last week.\n\nMeta told BI that its content-moderation policies had been too far-reaching in years past, and its updates draw a line between offensive speech and potentially dangerous speech. The company also continues to prohibit attacks on protected characteristics, including dehumanizing speech, calls for harm, slurs, and more, as well as maintain its bullying and harassment policies.\n\nIn May 2024, GLAAD, a nonprofit advocacy organization for LGBTQ+ representation in media, published its fourth annual Social Media Safety Index report, which said that anti-LGBTQ \"rhetoric and disinformation on social media translates to real-world offline harms.\"\n\n\"What I felt, time again, is that Big Tech doesn't really cater to us because they don't care about us,\" said Carmen Hernandez, founder of Freddie. The app describes itself as \"for the sapphic and trans community to find friends, events, and lovers.\"\n\nDesigning apps with safety in mind\n\nAs LGBTQ+ apps welcome new users amid changes happening across tech, safety and privacy are top concerns.\n\nFreddie, for example, is integrated with the encrypted messaging service Signal for security and data privacy.\n\n\"That need for safety is really what I think people are coming to Lex for,\" Lewis said. \"What we've been doing since the acquisition by 9count has been building our backend moderation practices, trust and safety, user verification, bad actor banning.\"\n\nOn Collective, one safety measure (in addition to a zero policy for anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric) is its new user review process, which can take up to 24 hours and looks at a user's digital footprint across the web.\n\n\"We are creating a safe space for queer people, which means we have bad actors who want to get in and do bad things,\" Smith said.\n\nMeta apps are still a necessity for visibility\n\nFor these LGBTQ+ apps, Meta platforms like Instagram are likely to remain crucial tools for getting in front of new users, despite the content-moderation changes.\n\nBoyan Golden, founder of Purr, a social app for queer women, nonbinary, and trans people that will launch later this year, said the moment is a double-edged sword.\n\nOn one side, Golden hopes Meta's changes show the need for more queer-led social-networking platforms. At the same time, Meta platforms are still the largest channels Purr has for spreading its brand.\n\n\"You could rely on more traditional advertising methods, but you'd have nowhere the same reach,\" Golden told BI.\n\nCollective, Lex, and Freddie also each have Instagram pages that are used as a marketing tool to direct users to their apps.\n\n\"I'm personally deleting all my Meta accounts on Friday,\" Hernandez said, but the separate account for Freddie will keep posting. \"We're going to keep it as a beacon.\"",

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d. -Starmer said at University College London, noting that the country was already the European leader for AI investment.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d. -US Commerce Department\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d. -The company said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 235\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On January 10, Reuters reported that a group of authors alleged that Meta Platforms used pirated versions of copyrighted books to train its artificial intelligence systems. They also alleged that this has been done with approval from its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, as revealed by newly disclosed court papers. Some of the authors suing Meta for copyright infringement include Ta-Nehisi Coates and comedian Sarah Silverman. The accusations, in filings made public on Wednesday in California federal court, revealed that the authors have claimed that the internal documents produced by Meta during the discovery process showed the company knew the works were pirated. Asking for permission to file an updated complaint, the authors said that the new evidence showed Meta used the AI training dataset LibGen. LibGen allegedly contains millions of pirated works that are distributed through peer-to-peer torrents. Internal communication from Meta showed Zuckerberg \u201capproved Meta\u2019s use of the LibGen dataset notwithstanding concerns within Meta\u2019s AI executive team (and others at Meta) that LibGen is \u2018a dataset we know to be pirated\u201d, the authors further claimed.\n\nOverall, META ranks 1st on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

There\u2019s a lot of sad news in the world right now. Of course, my thoughts are with everyone affected by these LA wildfires. And whenever something bad has happened this month, I just think, I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this to us during dry January.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nDo you know what I mean? I\u2019m doing dry January this year and \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nHow\u2019s it going?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, the unfortunate news is that it\u2019s going fantastic.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nI had assumed that each day I would wake up thinking, oh, it would be nice to crack open a beer with my friends tonight or something. But instead, I\u2019m just like, I feel so incredibly well rested.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAw.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo that has been an interesting learning.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDo you plan to continue it beyond January?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go 100 percent dry, but I have actually been thinking about, what if I did a dry February, too? So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Changes could be on the horizon.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat would happen to your wine tap?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI might have to replace it with seltzer or something dramatic. It could be crazy.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThe horror. [MUSIC PLAYING] I\u2019m Kevin Roose, the tech columnist at \u201cThe New York Times.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m Casey Newton from \u201cPlatformer,\u201d and this is \u201cHard Fork.\u201d This week, TikTok enters its final hours in the United States, and Americans are flocking to a new Chinese app. Then, Hugging Faces\u2019 Sasha Luccioni joins us to help us understand the environmental impact of AI. And finally, my idea is to bring more masculine energy to Meta. It\u2019s time to man up, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s go, bro. Well, Casey, the major, major news in tech this week is that we might actually get a TikTok ban.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt\u2019s true. And I feel like we\u2019ve probably started at least seven segments of the show that way over the years, Kevin. But this really is looking like the final, final, final version of, yes, TikTok could be banned.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. This is TikTok ban v-12, final-final, use this one.docx.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: And we have talked so much about how we came to this point, the law that Congress passed to ban TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nPAFACA.\n\nkevin roose\n\nPAFACA, technically, to force it to sell. That law is supposed to go into effect on January 19th, which is this Sunday, the day before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. And as of this taping, it appears that, barring some last minute intervention, TikTok\u2019s time as one of the most popular social media apps in the United States may be coming to an end.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd you want to talk about a roller coaster, the number of twists and turns this story has taken from when Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok in his administration, to Joe Biden putting the brakes on that and exploring other alternatives, to that process going off the rails, and Congress passing the first piece of tech related legislation in the past decade to make this thing happen. Then, Donald Trump reverses himself, says, I\u2019m going to save the app. Then, that doesn\u2019t work. And finally, last week, it all ends up at the Supreme Court. So yes, if you wonder why we keep doing this segment over and over again, it\u2019s because very few things have changed as much in the past half decade or so as the fate of TikTok.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s truly nuts. So when we started recording this segment on Wednesday, the Supreme Court had not made a decision yet on this case. But as of Friday, the justices did issue an opinion upholding the law and denying ByteDance\u2019s challenge. So, Casey, we\u2019re going to talk about all of this, but let\u2019s start by analyzing a little bit of what happened at the Supreme Court, and then talk about where we go from here. OK, so last Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments in \u201cTikTok v. Merrick Garland.\u201d Merrick Garland, of course, is the attorney general. And this was a lawsuit brought by ByteDance to try to get the Supreme Court to step in at the last minute and overturn this law, and basically say, ByteDance is allowed to own TikTok in the United States, or at least to delay the ban from going into effect. And did you actually listen to the oral arguments? I know you\u2019re a noted Supreme Court watcher.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI did not listen to the Supreme Court arguments live, Kevin, but I did catch up on them later. And I have to say, I was surprised by the tenor of the discussion.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSay more.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I just thought that we would see a bit more deference to the First Amendment that we got. Justices seem to think that the speech issues involved in the case were not relevant. Because the way that the law is written says that as long as ByteDance divests this app, all of the speech on the app remains. So they swept that away. And again, if this is somewhat surprising that we\u2019re talking about, it is only because the court did not have to hear this case. The last time we talked about this potential ban, we said, hey, look, the court could just defer to the lower court, not hear this argument, and just let the law go into effect. But instead, they did take it up, which made some people think, aha, maybe they have something to say about it. But I did predict at the time that really you just had a lot of justices that wanted to give TikTok the finger. And that does seem like what happened last week.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So let\u2019s live in the world right now in which all of this goes as it looks like it\u2019s going to go. ByteDance is forced to comply with this law. What happens next?\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo ByteDance has said that it will block access to the app for Americans beginning on Sunday. So you will open your TikTok app and it will not refresh. It will not be populated with new content. Now under the law, ByteDance doesn\u2019t actually have to do that. The way the law is written, it is actually intended to force Apple and Google, the two big App Store providers, to remove TikTok from the App Store. But ByteDance got ahead of that and said, we\u2019re just going to shut the thing off, which some people have speculated is essentially a move to get some leverage. Because you\u2019re going to make so many Americans so mad that maybe that might generate some political goodwill for the company.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. I\u2019m imagining something like what Uber used to do back in the day when it was fighting with governments, where you\u2019d open your app, and you\u2019d see a little pop up that said, we don\u2019t have Uber in your city. If this makes you mad, here are some numbers to call to contact your local legislators and yell at them about it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And ByteDance has tried stuff like that in the past in the United States, and it has backfired. But at this point, what does it have to lose?\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. So the other possibility for an outcome here, I suppose, is that ByteDance could agree to sell TikTok, that it would divest, as this law was intended to force them to do, and that that would be how TikTok survives. Now, we should say, I think time is running out for any kind of deal like that. But maybe we should run down a few of the possible ways that this could end with a new owner of TikTok in the United States, rather than the app just going dark.\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet\u2019s do it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo one group that has lined up to say that they are interested in possibly acquiring TikTok is a group of investors led by the billionaire Frank McCourt, who is the former owner of the LA Dodgers. He sent ByteDance a letter last week expressing his interest in acquiring TikTok. He said that he would acquire it even without the algorithm that determines what people see in their For You pages. And he said that he would cobble the money together for the sale from private equity funds and other ultra wealthy investors, including Kevin O\u2019Leary, the investor who goes by Mr. Wonderful on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nSharks, I\u2019m coming before you today because I\u2019d like to buy TikTok from the Chinese Communist Party. That would be a great episode. I\u2019d watch it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. It sounds like this is a hastily arranged sale meant to avert a catastrophic legal outcome. And for that reason, I\u2019m out.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m out.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnother potential buyer is the YouTuber celebrity MrBeast, who said that he had had billionaires contacting him about buying TikTok after he posted about it on X. I don\u2019t know how serious this is, but I think we should just say MrBeast would be, I think, a pretty good owner of TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI don\u2019t know. After I heard what happened on his \u201cBeast Games\u201d show on Amazon Prime, where many of the contestants were lucky to survive, I\u2019m not sure we want this man running a large tech platform, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think we have to think about it that hard because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMe either.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut the real wild card here, the one that I actually do take somewhat seriously, is that on Monday, \u201cBloomberg\u201d published a story suggesting that the actual preferred acquirer for TikTok might be Elon Musk. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d shortly afterward, put out their own reporting with largely the same information. According to the \u201cBloomberg\u201d article, senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump\u2019s administration, one of which involves Musk. This is according to anonymous sources who asked not to be identified, revealing confidential discussions.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I bet they did.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: So, Casey, what do you think of this theory that Elon Musk could acquire TikTok?\n\ncasey newton\n\nEvery once in a while, something happens in the universe and I think, was this done to upset me specifically? That\u2019s how I felt when I read the story that said that Elon Musk was going to take over a second beloved social platform in the United States, and presumably apply his signature brand of content moderation, and other fun tricks to the app. So I have to say, Kevin, of everything that has happened in the TikTok story so far, this truly might be the craziest because of the different players here, who we think knows what, what has been said about it. I can absolutely see a world where this is plausible. I can just as easily see a world where this is a nothing burger. And we\u2019re just going to have to get a little bit more information. But what was your reaction?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I was somewhat skeptical when I first saw this, in part because TikTok came out right away and said that this was pure fiction. But it was written in such a way that it felt like the message of the stories that I read was that actually TikTok may not be involved in these discussions. This may be happening at the level of the Chinese government, who is deliberating about what to do. And that\u2019s very telling. Obviously, there\u2019s this theory that I subscribe to, and that I think a lot of people subscribe to, that ByteDance is not really in control of its own destiny here. Because there\u2019s this government control of all Chinese social media platforms, but especially this one, which seems strategically important to the Chinese government.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd under Chinese law, ByteDance would need the government\u2019s permission to divest TikTok. So that\u2019s a very real thing.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. I can also see this making sense for Elon Musk. He\u2019s said before that he wants X to operate more like TikTok. It\u2019s obviously a social network that\u2019s very popular. They\u2019ve obviously cracked the code on algorithmic presentation of content. I also think that he would be a more palatable American acquirer for the Chinese government than any other potential acquirer.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo yeah, so sketch this case out. What would the Chinese government have if Elon owned TikTok?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I think one thing that we know about Elon Musk is that he does a lot of business in China. Tesla has a lot of operations and entanglements in China. Elon Musk has also been very deferential to the Chinese government when it comes to doing things that he needs to do to continue operating his companies in China. And I think if you\u2019re the Chinese government looking at, well, OK, which American acquirer would allow us to continue to exert influence over the user base of TikTok in America? I think they have points of leverage on Elon Musk that they do not have over, say, Frank McCourt.\n\ncasey newton\n\nRight. On one hand, Kevin, it seems a little crazy to me that the Chinese government thinks, essentially, we will turn Elon Musk into a soft Chinese agent to do our bidding in the United States. That seems a little bit far fetched. On the other hand, if you look at Musk\u2019s behavior over the past few years, which I think has been really erratic in a lot of ways, he\u2019s always extremely careful about what he says about China. He truly almost never says anything remotely critical of that government. And if you\u2019re the Chinese government, maybe you look at that and you appreciate it. And you think, yeah, sure, let that guy take it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. So those are the acquisition scenarios. But I think we should say, I don\u2019t believe any of these are likely to happen by the time this deadline hits. I think that no matter what acquirers might be interested in buying TikTok, A, ByteDance does not seem interested in selling it. B, the Chinese government does not seem interested in letting ByteDance sell it. And C, I don\u2019t think anyone could put together a deal quickly enough to actually get this done by the 19th.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right. Also, I just want to acknowledge the American-centricness of this conversation. TikTok is available in many other markets where it is not banned. And while the United States is a very lucrative market and a great place to run an e-commerce operation the way that TikTok is doing, it is operating in many other countries in the world. I read this week that its largest market right now is actually in Indonesia. There are more users in Indonesia than in the United States. And so if you\u2019re ByteDance, just from a pure dollars and cents perspective, you may just look at this and think, we can actually make more money operating in the countries where we already exist, and just give up on America and we\u2019ll be fine. So that\u2019s another scenario here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So now let\u2019s talk about the user response because this has been truly wild. I know you are not a TikTok addict, but presumably \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nDespite my best efforts. Yes, I tried to get addicted to it on this very show.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou did.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut the people on TikTok are starting to, I would say, panic over the impending possible loss of their favorite app, their favorite platform. And a lot of content creators on TikTok are starting to try to bring their audiences over to other platforms, like YouTube or Instagram. Some are saying they\u2019re going to use VPNs to get around this ban. And the most fascinating development to come out of all of this, in my opinion, has been that there is now this new trend of TikTok refugees downloading a Chinese social media app called Xiaohongshu, or RedNote.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes. This is truly one of the funniest and most unexpected stories of the young year so far, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. So as of yesterday, at least when I checked, the Xiaohongshu app was the number one free app on the iOS App Store. It has gotten a ton of downloads from people who are saying, basically, screw the US government. Screw this TikTok ban. I\u2019m going to protest this by going over to this explicitly Chinese app that does not even have an English name in the App Store.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. Now, obviously, I have installed this app, which I\u2019m going to call RedNote, even though I believe that that\u2019s just an American nickname for it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, the literal translation is Little Red Book, which is also not subtle. That is also the name given to the book of quotations from Chairman Mao that was distributed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo tell people what RedNote is, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo RedNote is essentially a TikTok-like app. It is not owned by ByteDance. But if you open it, you see a feed that looks very much like For You feed of trending videos. It basically has the same platform mechanics as TikTok. And until this week, most of the content there was people in China speaking Chinese and talking about China.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAbsolutely. And I downloaded it. I installed it, signed up for an account, and immediately started watching a bunch of videos from refugees, as they\u2019re calling themselves, from TikTok over to RedNote. And they seem like they\u2019re having a great time over there. But in addition to this migration, Kevin, what was truly so funny was there were so many posts on X of people bragging about how they were racing to share all of their data with a new Chinese app. They were posting screenshots of themselves with the Apple AppTrackingTransparency screen. Apple sends you this big, scary warning \u2014 hey, are you sure that you want to share your data? And people are like, hell, yeah, I want to share it, brother. I\u2019ll give you everything. I saw a TikTok from this one girl who was like, I would fly to China and hand my Social Security number to Xi Jinping before I would ever use Instagram Reels. That\u2019s where the user base is at, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. So I also thought I should probably download and install this Xiaohongshu, RedNote app just to see what all the fuss is about. And can I tell you the first three videos that I saw on my feed?\n\ncasey newton\n\nPlease.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNumber one was a clip from \u201cModern Family.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat is the sourdough starter of the modern video-based social network, is just clips of \u201cModern Family.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nNumber two was a Chinese language clip of a dog at the vet having its anal gland expressed.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, perfect. Express yourself.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd number three was someone making latte art of Luigi Mangione, the [LAUGHS]: suspect in the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO.\n\ncasey newton\n\n[SIGHS]: So I think it just goes to show you how quickly you can create an American social network. In just three videos, you\u2019ve captured a shocking amount of the zeitgeist, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut I would say, after I scrolled more and more, I did start to see these so-called TikTok refugee videos, these Americans who are coming over to RedNote from TikTok, and basically trying to make sense of this new thing, and participating in almost a cultural exchange. So why don\u2019t we play a couple videos that have been making the rounds on RedNote?\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet\u2019s do it.\n\narchived recording (speaker 1) Hey, guys. I got sent here from TikTok. And I was hoping that you guys can welcome me. I really like this app, and I love the makeup. I tried to do it today, so thank you. archived recording (speaker 2) Xiaohongshu. archived recording (speaker 3) I\u2019m not going to lie to y\u2019all, bruh. I can\u2019t read shit on this app.\n\ncasey newton\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\narchived recording (speaker 3) Say, somebody help me out. And I need some followers, too. Go ahead and hit that follow button, too. I need that. Say, who else a TikTok refugee? Y\u2019all let me know in the comments or something.\n\ncasey newton\n\nXiaohongshu.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo it inserts the little Xiaohongshu at the end of every video. That\u2019s the watermark.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s great because now I actually feel like I can pronounce it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo, Casey, what do you make of the Xiaohongshu, RedNote trend?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI have to say, this is why I love Americans. The absolute irreverence that they are bringing to this conversation, I find such a refreshing change of pace. So much of the discussion, and certainly I participate in this, is in terms of the rights involved, the equities, speech versus security. What are the national security implications? And Americans are truly just rolling their eyes out of the back of their heads with this discussion. And they\u2019re saying, oh, you want to ban one Chinese app? We are going to flock to another one. And I just think it\u2019s amazing.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. It\u2019s also very interesting to me that the response from American TikTok users is not the response that TikTok had hoped for, which was that Americans get outraged that their favorite social media app is disappearing, and band together to storm the streets, and try to save TikTok, and overturn this law. It\u2019s like, no, we\u2019re just going to pack up and move to another platform. I think it really speaks to the fragility of social media right now, and the fact that these platforms are seen as somewhat interchangeable and commoditized. And so if one of them gets banned by the government, you just pack up and move over to another one.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. Although, of course, there are several American apps that folks could have chosen to move over to. And I think it is extra funny that instead of doing that, Americans were like, no, find us something that looks exactly like TikTok, but is even more Chinese.\n\nkevin roose\n\nEven more Chinese, and even less \u2014 it makes even fewer promises about data privacy.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, exactly. Now some people might ask, doesn\u2019t PAFACA ban RedNote as well? And my understanding is that, no, PAFACA primarily applies to ByteDance and TikTok. But when it comes to other apps that are owned by a company in a country that the United States considers a foreign adversary, it is up to the president to decide that it represents a national security threat. And I imagine it\u2019s going to be some time before RedNote is come to be seen that way.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. So in addition to packing up and moving over to Xiaohongshu, other TikTok users are participating in the Chinese spy meme. Have you seen this one?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI love this meme so much.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, explain what\u2019s going on.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo people are saying goodbye to their Chinese spy. This is another irreverent American joke. Basically, they\u2019re making fun of the fact that members of Congress are constantly saying that the Chinese government is using TikTok to spy on Americans. And the Americans are now just making videos saying, hey, I\u2019m so glad we got to spend this time together, my Chinese spy. I will always remember you. And then you also have Chinese people, and these could be Chinese people from all over the world, but they\u2019re making memes pretending to be the Chinese spy, saying, hey, I really loved spying on you for all these years. And maybe call your mother a little bit. And this message goes out to Laura from New York, and that sort of thing. So yeah, saying goodbye to my Chinese spy, I do think is one of the best TikTok memes of all time. Coming in hot right at the end.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s so good. So we\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about the free speech implications about all this, about whether this is the first of many conflicts between the US and China over emerging platforms. But Casey, where are you right now, days away from the likely end of TikTok as a major presence in US social media? What are you thinking about?\n\ncasey newton\n\nMy feeling has been, and I\u2019ve gone back and forth on this, but where I netted out was I do think there are good reasons for the United States to restrict foreign ownership of these kinds of apps, particularly from its adversaries like China. But I really hate the way that they went about it. And I worry about the implications for other speech platforms in the future. People are saying, well, this one is really easy because of the Chinese control angle, but I don\u2019t know. If this incoming administration decides it doesn\u2019t like a lot of the content on an American-owned app and says, you know what? We\u2019re actually just going to make you change ownership the same way that we did with ByteDance and TikTok. And now the Supreme Court has essentially rubber stamped that argument and said, yeah, there are no speech concerns. Because as long as you sell the app, all that speech can remain. You can imagine a lot of really dark outcomes for that kind of thinking. So I personally, as an older American who tried and failed to get addicted to TikTok, am not going to miss it that much day to day. But TikTok was an engine of culture that we are going to miss out on in this country. Those folks are going to have to find a new home. It really sucks for all of those creators. And so yeah, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of really sad fallout from this. What do you think, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I still think there\u2019s a chance that Donald Trump decides to intervene and try to save TikTok in the United States. This week, we got some news that Shou Chew, the Chief Executive of TikTok, is going to be at Trump\u2019s inauguration, sitting with a bunch of other VIPs. And some people have interpreted that as Trump saying he supports TikTok and might try to save it. He obviously made promises about saving TikTok during his campaign. Obviously, a lot\u2019s changed since then. But I do think that he understands that a lot of young Americans care deeply about the fate of TikTok. And then maybe he can build some goodwill with those young Americans by stepping in at the last minute to heroically save TikTok. Now there are some different ways he could do that. He could instruct the Justice Department in his administration not to enforce the ban on TikTok. He could also try to arrange some kind of deal, potentially selling TikTok to Elon Musk, or someone else who he trusts, and say, that is enough of a divestment for me. That satisfies the requirements of PAFACA.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd he is, after all, Kevin, the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nExactly. So I do think there\u2019s a chance that Donald Trump keeps TikTok around in some form after all. But I\u2019m not sure about that. And I think it\u2019s equally plausible that TikTok actually does go away, and that it becomes this free-for-all in the social media world as different companies race to Hoover up the users who had previously spent hours a day on TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And when TikTok was banned in India, we saw what happened there, which was that YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, which were Google and Meta\u2019s answers to TikTok, exploded in popularity. So one way that you should be thinking about this is, if this goes into effect, this is truly one of the greatest gifts for Google and Meta that you can imagine. And that is just really interesting, given the strong bipartisan feeling in Congress that Google and Meta specifically ought to be reined in and actually even broken up. When you think about who is on TikTok, it is the younger generation of Americans. So if Meta and Google can now go out and further entrench themselves into the lives of Generation Z, they\u2019re going to have essentially monopolies over those folks, at least in terms of short form video consumption, for the foreseeable future.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. I think that\u2019s totally possible. I think there are probably a lot of executives at Meta who are licking their chops about this, who are very excited about the potential. Because their platforms, Facebook and Instagram, are aging. Facebook is for Boomers and Gen X. Instagram is for millennials. And until now, Gen Z has been the TikTok generation. And if Meta can suck up those users, it can extend its dominance for another generation. But I think that the past week has made me less sure that that\u2019s going to be the outcome here. Because what we have seen on TikTok as this ban has approached is not people saying, oh, everyone move over to Instagram Reels. It\u2019s saying, let\u2019s move over to this obscure Chinese language app that no one\u2019s ever heard of. That\u2019s how badly we don\u2019t want to be on Instagram. I think part of the Gen Z identity is about not just embracing TikTok as a platform, but rejecting the platforms that people older than you use. And so I think it\u2019s equally plausible that those younger users do not go to Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts, that they instead go to some new app that may have most of the features of TikTok but is different in some way. Maybe we\u2019re finally going to get a new American social media app.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI would love to believe everything that you\u2019re saying, and I think that it absolutely could come to pass. But I also think it\u2019s true that most members of Gen Z who have TikTok on their phone probably have Instagram as well. And it\u2019s just going to be really hard for them to avoid taking a look at that as they look elsewhere to get their fix. But at the same time, we\u2019re also seeing, separately from all of this, a boom in the Fediverse and people building on protocols. And that is rooted in the exact same frustration with these apps that are controlled by billionaires and giant, faceless corporations. So I agree with you. There is a lot of frustration among all sorts of Americans on that point. And so who knows? Maybe we do get an American owned alternative to TikTok that is not YouTube or Meta. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, we answer one of the most common questions we get from listeners. What is the environmental impact of AI?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, Casey, for basically the entire time we have been making this podcast, we have gotten emails from listeners who want us to talk about the environmental impact of AI.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. This might be the question that we\u2019ve gotten the most that we have not yet devoted a segment to.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I would say my own reluctance to talk about this topic on this show so far has been some insecurity on my part about not being an expert in climate science or the relevant information here. But also, it is very hard to get good and authoritative data about this subject in particular. It is just not something that there is a large body of reliable literature about.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd the companies that have the best data, by and large, are not disclosing any of that data. And so that means that a lot of what we talk about when we talk about the environmental impact of AI is based on estimates that may or may not be close to the mark.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. But I\u2019m sure you have observed, as I have, that the issues around the environment and AI have only gotten more important to people. This really came to a head last week when the wildfires started burning in Los Angeles. I saw so many people posting on social media about what they viewed as a link between AI use and the wildfires. And I\u2019ll just read you one meme I saw in my feed that was liked and shared millions of times. This was posted by a guy named Matt Bernstein. And I\u2019ll just read it to you. It said, \u201cOne search on ChatGPT uses 10 times the amount of energy as a Google search. Training one AI model produces the same amount of carbon dioxide as 300 round-trip flights between New York and San Francisco, and 5 times the lifetime emissions of a car. We don\u2019t need AI art. We don\u2019t need AI grocery lists. We don\u2019t need AI self-driving cars. We don\u2019t need ChatGPT, or Gemini, or Grok, or DALL-E, or whatever revolutionary technology already exists inside our own human brains. We need the Earth.\u201d And then below this meme was a picture of a blazing fire. So clearly this idea has taken root in culture that there is some kind of link between the disasters that we are seeing in places like Los Angeles, and the use of AI for basic, everyday tasks.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And I think today, we want to see what we can find out about how true some of the ideas in that post are.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So to shed some light on this very hot topic of AI and energy use \u2014 I realized that I just used light and heat. That was not intentional.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBut we\u2019re going to hope we shed more light than heat in this discussion, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. Today, we are talking with Dr. Sasha Luccioni. She is an AI Researcher and the Climate Lead at Hugging Face, which is an AI company that offers tools to developers for building AI models. She has been researching and talking about AI\u2019s environmental impact for many years, and also developing tools to help developers understand the impacts of their own systems on the environment.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes. And Kevin, this might be a good time to dust off my shiny, new disclosure. Because when we talk about AI issues, I will sometimes remind people that my boyfriend is a software engineer at an AI company called Anthropic. My full ethics disclosure is that \u201cPlatformer\u201d are not news/ethics.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd my past disclosure is that I work at The New York Times Company, which is suing OpenAI and Microsoft over issues of copyright violations.\n\ncasey newton\n\nPerfect.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. Let\u2019s bring in Sasha Luccioni. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sasha Luccioni, welcome to \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I\u2019m very excited to have this conversation. This is one we\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while, and are frankly overdue in having. And I want to start by reading you an email that we recently got from a listener. This comes from a listener named T. Morris, and it says the following. \u201cAs a tech content marketer, I feel increasingly conflicted about using AI. On the one hand, it\u2019s been an amazing writing partner for big tasks, like brainstorming, and editing tech articles, and smaller copywriting tasks, like drafting social media posts.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, I see climate disasters like the North Carolina floods and LA fires linked with the amount of water and natural resources it takes to sustain AI infrastructure, and feel myself rationing my AI use, questioning whether the time saved is worth the environmental trade-offs. How do I navigate this new world where AI is everywhere while staying true to my environmental values?\u201d So Sasha, we\u2019ll dive into some of the specifics in just a minute, but I want to just start with this question from our listener. What advice would you give T Morris?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nI\u2019m generally very skeptical of individual culpability when it comes to the climate crisis. Yes, of course, we all contributed, but I think that we\u2019re all also part of systems. And we have professions that require usage of technologies. Some people drive for a living and we can\u2019t spend our time feeling bad. I\u2019m much more of a fan of, well, requiring accountability from companies and requiring transparency. Because I think that especially around climate change, but also a lot of aspects of society, we just don\u2019t have the numbers to make informed decisions. And that doesn\u2019t mean you need to care, but you should have the information necessary for caring. So I\u2019m more about ask for accountability, ask for transparency when using these technologies, instead of psyching yourself out about them.\n\nkevin roose\n\nGot it. So I thought one way to frame this discussion would be to split it into, essentially, two parts, the micro and the macro. Micro being this question of, what do we know about the environmental impact of AI at the level of the individual user, the individual question that you might ask to ChatGPT, or Gemini, or Claude, and getting a response to that? And then macro being this larger question of, what is the AI sector\u2019s energy footprint more broadly? What do we know about where all the energy is coming from to run these very powerful models? And what can we do as a society and as big corporations to position ourselves better for the future? And with your permission, Sasha, I want to start with the micro. So one of the statistics that people will often throw out when talking about the energy demands of AI is this figure that a ChatGPT query, or something like it, costs somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 times more energy than a traditional web query on something like Google. Now I asked Google about this figure, and they wouldn\u2019t say exactly how much energy it takes to query Gemini versus to run a traditional web search. But they did say that those numbers are much larger than what they\u2019ve seen internally. But Sasha, where did that figure come from, and what do we know about how accurate it is?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nI think the initial Google search query is actually pretty old, and it was part of a study to greening the web type situation. And they made an estimate. And once again, they didn\u2019t really have the numbers, but they tried to extrapolate. And then for ChatGPT, it was a similar, kind of, assuming that somebody is querying a model that is running on this type of hardware, and assuming that the latency is x, and blah, blah, blah. And they extrapolated that. There are other models that do similar things. So maybe even if you don\u2019t know exactly ChatGPT inherently, you have other models that will do similar tasks. And so you can get a range. And I think that that range is more interesting than trying to chase down the exact number and compare the two. And also, it\u2019s probably not a single number anyway. And so that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to pin down this number. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be always possible for them to say, oh, no, that\u2019s not the number. That\u2019s not the exact number.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd I think that your point earlier that one of the things that we need on this subject is just a lot more transparency is really well taken. I know that Google has folks who work on climate issues. But I\u2019m curious, as you look across the industry, maybe at some of the newer, smaller AI labs, or just, I don\u2019t know, companies other than Google, do you get the sense that people are paying attention to this, that they are taking these sort of measurements, that they even have a sense of the per query energy usage of one of their products?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nDefinitely. Because unlike Google, or Microsoft, or any of the big tech companies, usually smaller companies are a lot more compute restrained. So they\u2019re doing more with less because they have to. They don\u2019t always come at it from a sustainability perspective. They\u2019re not like, oh, yeah, we want to protect the planet, but there is a part of that. It\u2019s like frugality. It\u2019s like, we want to be more efficient because we only have GPUs to work with.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd this seems like maybe one positive thing that I\u2019m hearing so far is that it sounds like the incentives for all of these companies are to get the amount of compute and energy that they are using over time down as quickly as they can.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnother claim that you often hear from people who are worried about the environmental impacts of using AI on a micro or personal level is about water use. There\u2019s this statistic, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it around, that using an LLM is like pouring out a bottle of water, or half a liter of water, I\u2019ve seen going around. Where did that figure come from? And why do these AI models need water? And is that statistic true?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nSo that paper is, once again, an extrapolation. It takes some of the work that I did about an open-source model where we measured how many kilowatt hours of energy were being used to query it. And essentially what happens in data centers is that they have an amount, like a liter of water per kilowatt hour of energy. It\u2019s like a water efficiency. They call it water use efficiency. And essentially, depending on where your data set \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nSorry, why do they need water in the data centers?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nMostly for the cooling. This hardware heats up. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever visited a data center. If you can, I highly recommend it. It is like an overwhelming experience. The noise, the heat, and just the general buzz of electricity is pretty overwhelming. Anyway, so you need a lot of cooling. And essentially how that\u2019s usually done is with water cooling. You pump in cool water and there\u2019s a bunch of pipes. And it goes through all of the hardware, and then it either \u2014 a part of it evaporates completely. And a part of it has to be cooled down before either reused or put back into nature, or whatnot. And so that whole process is hugely water consumptive. And of course, not all the water evaporates, but a fair amount of it does just because the hardware heats up so much. Once again, it\u2019s \u2014 so I go back and forth on this a lot, whether putting out statistics like this that are based on estimates or not is useful for the conversation. Because on one hand, it\u2019s really easy for the companies to say, no, you guys are tripping. That\u2019s not at all the true number, which then it cuts the conversation. And on the other hand, they do become like urban legend. And so now I hear this 500 milliliter per conversation number a lot. And it\u2019s like, well, actually it\u2019ll depend on so many different things. So it\u2019s definitely not systematically 500 milliliters, but it is a non-negligible amount of water. And depending on where the data center is located, that can become an issue. So we\u2019ve seen places where the data centers have put a strain on the towns around them that have water shortages because the water is being pumped into a new data center that has been powered up.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou said earlier, understandably, that you\u2019re not a huge fan of thinking about these issues at the individual level. I\u2019m still curious, when you are considering your own personal use of AI, where water usage fits into things. Is that, for you, a reason to send fewer queries to ChatGPT or an equivalent?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nI\u2019m, in general, such a \u2014 I don\u2019t use AI that often, I mean, generative AI that often. The one use case that I found was really something that actually is useful in my life is when I read an article or a research paper, putting in the abstract and getting a fun title. I\u2019m so bad at generating fun titles, but ChatGPT is really good. And it can come up with puns, and stuff like that. But what really kills me is people who switch to generative AI for things that don\u2019t really need it. My pet peeve example is calculators. People use ChatGPT as a calculator now. And that\u2019s really like, that\u2019s really terrible. You really don\u2019t need it. Not only is it bad at arithmetic, it\u2019s literally not made to do math. But it\u2019s also orders of magnitude more energy, and a crazy amount of water for something that doesn\u2019t need water.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I have to say, I\u2019m going to admit something, which is, I\u2019ve talked before on the show about how I use this app called Raycast, which is plugged into OpenAI\u2019s model. And I can just summon it on my keyboard with command-space. And I do probably ask it four or five questions a day. I am definitely using it for things I can Google. One of my toxic traits is I\u2019m curious how old people are. And so sometimes I\u2019ll just be like, how old is Billy Crystal, or whatever?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nDo you check the answers and they\u2019re all accurate?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt\u2019s not that I check the answers. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t really care that much. So when the LLM says that Billy Crystal is, I don\u2019t know, 70, or whatever he is, I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s the right ballpark. And then I move on. I\u2019m realizing that I sound very silly as I\u2019m saying this, but I\u2019m saying it because I suspect other people may be doing the same thing. And I think there is a case that, you know what? Maybe I should actually Google that, in part for environmental reasons.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI want to just embody the other side of this. Because what I\u2019m hearing from you is, generative AI is not useful enough in many cases to justify the energy costs of engaging with an LLM. And I\u2019m a person who uses AI every day. I generally find it quite useful in my life. I use it to accomplish a lot of tasks that I could not use equivalent tools for. I don\u2019t just run, \u201chow old is Billy Crystal\u201d searches over and over again.\n\ncasey newton\n\nTo be clear, I only ran it once.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: And I would say that my own usage of this is to do new things that I couldn\u2019t do before, mostly. And if people don\u2019t find generative AI useful, they shouldn\u2019t use it. But if people do find it useful but are worried about the environmental costs, I\u2019m just not entirely convinced that we\u2019re thinking about the costs of AI in the sense of energy at the right scale. I recently was reading a Substack post by a guy named Andy Masley, where he basically broke down the best data and estimates we have about the environmental costs of using AI. And he compared it to some other activities, like sending emails, or streaming a video on Netflix, or driving a car a very short distance. And basically, what he found is that compared to all these other activities, the energy required to generate an answer on ChatGPT or a similar system is just infinitesimally small, that if we are worried about our own personal environmental footprint, we could do much more to help the environment by cutting out meat from our diets, or by taking fewer trips in cars or on airplanes. And basically, the argument that he made that I am tempted by is that all of this talk about personal responsibility is just neglecting to look at AI use in the context of all the other things that we do in our lives that require energy. And I\u2019m wondering, Sasha, what you make of that argument.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nIt builds upon what I said at the beginning. But in general, when you talk to people around the issue of climate change and mitigation, it\u2019s like, we\u2019re bound by the structures in which we operate and live, and the constraints that we have. So of course, I\u2019m not going to be like, oh, yeah, don\u2019t take that plane to take a well-deserved vacation, and spend your time worrying about climate change. Because that\u2019s not a productive state of mind. But on the other hand, we can make decisions with the environment in our minds. So for example, nowadays, a lot of people have ChatGPT open as the de facto source of information on the internet. And I do think that, yes, of course, little by little, that the individual energy consumption of each query is not that much. But if we start using it as literally our rubber duck, and our bouncing board, and our companion, and then people also will use ChatGPT to build tools. Nowadays, people are building therapists, and whatnot, companions using, and then that incrementally becomes a deal. Personally, I try to focus on a specific task you want to do, for example, searching the internet, or answering a question, and then comparing what you would use, option A and option B. And then what\u2019s the difference? And then it\u2019s up to you to decide whether that difference is worth it based on the advantage that the technology gives you. But I don\u2019t think it makes sense to compare meat and email, or Netflix and taking your car. Because I feel like they\u2019re incomparable actions.\n\ncasey newton\n\nRight. People aren\u2019t choosing between, well, should I drive to work today, or should I ask ChatGPT that question?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nYeah, exactly. So I feel that I understand where he\u2019s coming from in his argument, but I don\u2019t feel that that helps us make choices any better. It makes us feel bad all around.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo, Sasha, can I try to summarize what I\u2019m hearing from you on the point of individual use, the micro question about the environmental impact of AI? What I\u2019m hearing you say, I believe, is that the individual costs of using LLMs may not move the needle on climate one way or the other, but that people should be conscious of what they are using AI for. And maybe use the smallest model that will allow them to get the task done that they are looking to do. And that maybe we shouldn\u2019t be tearing our hair out over people using ChatGPT if they\u2019re using it to do stuff that is genuinely useful to them.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nExactly.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs that an accurate reflection of your sentiment?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nIt\u2019s a great reflection. And I think that often we forget our power as consumers and users of technology. And I think that putting pressure on companies and being, hey, we care. We want this number. Stop bullshitting us. You have the number somewhere of the average energy. Even if it\u2019s not a single number, if it\u2019s a range, give us the range. And then we\u2019ll make our informed decisions. Because people are more and more aware of relative comparisons, like, a mile driven in a car, or a steak, or whatever. We need to add, even if it\u2019s a range, AI to those options that people have so that they can actually make informed decisions. We should stop just feeding them shit and keeping them in the dark.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, so that is the micro picture of the AI energy story. Now let\u2019s talk about the macro. There was recently a report just last month from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory about the power that is currently needed to run the data centers in this country, and the power that will soon be needed as the AI boom sparks demand for more and more of these data centers. This report said that between 2018 and 2023, the power to run data centers around the US went from 1.9 percent of total annual electricity consumption, to 4.4 percent, more than double. And this report estimated that the energy demands of data centers, of which AI is a major part, will continue to increase over the next few years, and could, by 2028, make up between 6.7 percent and 12 percent of total US electricity consumption. So, Sasha, let\u2019s zoom out a little bit and talk about the energy needs of the AI industry as a whole. Where are we? Do these companies know where they are going to get all this energy to build these incredibly powerful AI models?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nYes and no. We currently have a certain infrastructure. But the problem is the growth of the infrastructure is kicking into high gear. And so what\u2019s interesting is that the big tech companies are the largest purchasers of renewable energy credits, which are like offsets for energy. And also, they make a lot of power purchase agreements, which are essentially ways of promising to buy energy, especially renewable energy, into the future. So they\u2019ve been, I\u2019ll give them that, that they\u2019ve been actually on top of things. But then this year, I mean, this past year, both Google and Microsoft actually put out reports saying that they\u2019re not meeting their own sustainability targets. They dropped the ball on their own energy and carbon goals because of AI. Because they were not ready themselves for the amount of energy that they would need, and where that energy is coming from, the renewable energy offsetting things, weren\u2019t covering. And so I think that the latest and greatest in the trends in terms of energy generation has been nuclear. All the big tech companies have signed nuclear agreements, power purchase agreements in the last couple of months. And the general messaging is that that\u2019s going to solve the issue in terms of energy demand growth.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd when Microsoft and Google said, hey, we\u2019re not going to make our targets, was it nuclear that they were pointing to? Did they say, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to fix this, we have a new strategy? Or did they say, we might just never hit these targets because our values have changed?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nSo they were, like, well, these were very ambitious targets that we set back in 2018 or 2019. And oh, technology moves at such a fast pace. But no, nuclear actually entered the chat relatively recently. I think that the reports came out in around May of last year, of 2024. And then, a couple of months later, it was, Microsoft announced that they are recommissioning Three Mile Island. Google signed a partnership with, I don\u2019t remember what nuclear generator.\n\nkevin roose\n\nKairos.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nYeah, exactly. And so they\u2019re saying that, well, this is the new direction we\u2019re going. Because the thing is, sadly, building out renewable energy infrastructure does take time. And also, the problem with data centers and renewable energy is that data centers need energy 24/7. And the cycles aren\u2019t necessarily predictable as heating and cooling, for example. When the temperature drops, people will turn on their heating systems. You have these models that have worked pretty well historically. But for data centers, they don\u2019t work. And renewable energy tends to vary, if there\u2019s wind, if there\u2019s sun. And so there are a lot of challenges. You can\u2019t just heat a bunch of solar panels and expect them to respond to the demand of your data centers. It\u2019s much more complicated. And so that\u2019s why nuclear has emerged as a potential solution.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo my understanding, Sasha, is that a lot of the big AI companies are now just racing to get as much energy capacity as they can. And that one of the worries is that they are tapping out the infrastructure for clean or renewable energy. And so they are starting to go into these dirtier forms of energy that we have these harmful environmental costs because there just isn\u2019t enough renewable energy. And adding more takes time, as you said.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nYeah. Also, the thing is, with data centers, is that they\u2019re a very concentrated, very intense energy sink. So making that connection, I was talking to some energy grid operators in Paris. And they were saying, even if we did have the capacity, the actual megawatt hours, distributing it in a way that all of that extra capacity goes towards the data center in whatever rural area they build it in is a challenge in itself.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI was talking with someone the other day who works at an AI company. And one of the arguments that they made for why we shouldn\u2019t worry so much about the energy costs associated with AI is that basically our electrical grid in America has been in desperate need of modernization, that we have this creaky, old electrical grid that has not been growing nearly as quickly as it needs to. And that basically, because AI now exists and demands all of this energy, we are starting to do things that we probably should have done a long time ago as far as investing in new sources of energy, in these mini nuclear reactors, in trying to scale up things like solar and wind power. And so, yes, these models are demanding a lot of energy. But they are forcing us to modernize our infrastructure and our energy grid in ways that will benefit us as a country down the line. What do you make of that argument?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nWell, so what\u2019s interesting about the United States, particularly, is that it\u2019s not a single energy grid. There\u2019s a lot of energy providers in the United States. There\u2019s a really nifty website called Electricity Map, and they map out electricity. And what\u2019s interesting, when you zoom in on the US, it\u2019s like patchwork. There\u2019s some states that have 12 different grids. And then there\u2019s some, actually, multiple states have a single grid. And what\u2019s interesting is that, for example, Canada has one per province. In Europe, it might be one per country. France has a single one. And so, yeah, they\u2019re probably right to an extent. But modernizing the US energy system network of grids is actually really difficult because it\u2019s so heterogeneous. And because even if you update one part of the grid, that doesn\u2019t mean, for example, smaller energy grids don\u2019t have that much capacity. And the bigger ones will take time to update. So I think, it\u2019s like, yes, in theory, it would be good to overhaul the US energy grid. But in practice, it\u2019s a lot of small problems that are harder to solve.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOne other thing I\u2019ve heard from people who work in the AI industry, or are not as worried about the environmental impact of AI, is that, yes, this stuff costs energy. Yes, we need to find new sources of energy. But ultimately, AI is going to be more of a help in addressing the climate crisis than it will hurt. What do you make of that argument? Is that just self-serving?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s self-serving, but I think it\u2019s a false dichotomy. Because the AI systems that are the most energy intensive, like large language models, are the ones that have yet to prove their utility in fighting climate change. I think that the issue here is that we\u2019re using these big models for tasks that are not helping the fight against climate change. And compared to that, the models that are helping climate change aren\u2019t the ones that are the issue. And so the problem with AI being an umbrella term makes it very, very hard to have this discussion. But it\u2019s like, essentially, large language models are not solving the climate crisis anytime soon. And the models that are helping are not the ones that are contributing, most of the energy and carbon issues that we\u2019re seeing.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. One more argument that I want to have you address, which is about the efficiency of AI over time. We\u2019ve heard from companies that they are making their models much more efficient because they are creating these algorithmic breakthroughs, doing things like model distillation. The chips themselves are also becoming much more energy efficient. And so there\u2019s this argument that you\u2019ll hear from folks in the industry that, actually, we\u2019re running on outdated information when we say that AI is a risk to the climate. Because the energy needs are scaling down over time per use, and that actually we\u2019re just worried because our information isn\u2019t up to date. So do you think about efficiency in those terms, or how should we think about that?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nSo efficiency is interesting because I think that a lot of what people talk about when they talk about technological progress is some form of efficiency. It\u2019s like, oh, we\u2019re using less time. We\u2019re using less fuel. We\u2019re less using less energy, for example. And I think in AI we are seeing this. But what\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve been really going down the rabbit hole in terms of macroeconomic literature on this. There\u2019s this really interesting paradox that\u2019s called Jevons paradox. What Jevons observed in the 19th century was that we\u2019re actually still using more and more coal, despite using it more efficiently. And so this kind of phenomenon has been observed a lot with different kinds of efficiency gains, whether it be time, whether it be, for example, cars. Now that we can drive farther on the same amount of fuel, we\u2019ll actually go to more places. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing a lot in AI is this rebound effect that, yeah, we can do more AI for the same amount of computer money. But that means we\u2019re going to do even more. We\u2019re going to put AI into even more things. And so those efficiency gains are lost because now we\u2019re using LLMs for things that we didn\u2019t use LLMs for before.\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, do you want to try repeating back what we\u2019ve heard about the macro picture when it comes to AI and energy?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, the macro picture of AI and energy is that the construction of data centers does actually put a strain on the grid. We\u2019re seeing many more of them. And that even as individual usage of AI gets more efficient, it seems likely that we\u2019ll just use a lot more of it. And so this is one that it seems like we do have to watch and take the environmental claims seriously. That\u2019s what I feel like I heard. Does that sound right?\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nYes, it does. I think you summed it up really well.\n\ncasey newton\n\nGot it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I think what we can agree on, whether or not we think that the individual or the macro use of AI across the economy is dangerous for the environment, is that AI companies should be required to disclose a lot more data about the energy use of their models. It just seems like the data we have, a lot of it is based on estimates from the outside. A lot of it is outdated. A lot of it is sort of gone through this game of telephone where, all of a sudden, every time people use ChatGPT, they think they\u2019re burning down a forest. And it seems like this could all be solved by just having much better and more transparent data from the AI companies themselves about how much energy they\u2019re using.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nAgreed, and giving users more agency when it comes to generative AI. And even having a toggle when it comes to, whatever, AI generated summaries in Google. Just giving people a little bit more control over how they use \u2014 we don\u2019t want to stop using Google, or most people don\u2019t. So let us use Google in a way that is coherent with our values or the things that we want to optimize for.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, Sasha, thank you so much for enlightening us on this subject. It is one I imagine we will return to because I don\u2019t think this debate is going away anytime soon. But I really appreciate your expertise and your time.\n\ndr. sasha luccioni\n\nThank you for the great questions. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhen we come back, put on your gold chains, insert your Zyns, and let\u2019s do some jujitsu. We\u2019re talking about masculinity in the tech industry.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, Kevin, did you see the Mark Zuckerberg interview with Joe Rogan?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI did. And I assume that that\u2019s why we\u2019re sitting here in our oversized, baggy t-shirts, and our gold chains.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. Yes. Thank you for agreeing to this costume change. Listeners should know that we are wearing very boxy black t-shirts right now and gold chains to try to get us into the mindset of what I\u2019m hoping we can do today.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. Should we pop a Zyn, too?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIf you have any on you, go for it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019ve got four. I\u2019ve got Upper Deckys here, but if you want one, I\u2019m happy to provide.\n\ncasey newton\n\nUpper Deckys?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou never heard of Upper Deckys?\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDawg. [LAUGHS]\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhat\u2019s an Upper Decky?\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet me teach you something about straight culture.\n\ncasey newton\n\nPlease do.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou\u2019re always enlightening me about gay culture. Upper Deckys are when you put a Zyn nicotine pouch in your upper lip.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat is perfect, Kevin. That is exactly the right spirit that I want to take into this segment. So you watched the Mark Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI did.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd what did you think?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI thought it was very long. That was my main thing, was this meeting could have been an email.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I think that\u2019s a fair point, Kevin. But to me, I was so pleased to hear it. Because finally, someone in Silicon Valley was willing to say what we\u2019ve all been thinking for years now, which is that this town does not have enough masculine energy. You know what I mean? Kevin \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSometimes I will visit a company in Silicon Valley and see as many as one female executive. And finally, people like Mark Zuckerberg are starting to ask, when did things get this out of control? And I know you\u2019ve thought the same thing. You\u2019ve said that to me off mic.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: I don\u2019t think I have, but go on.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow some people get confused. Because the most recent time that Meta shared numbers, it had about two men at the company for every one woman. But this just highlights how powerful feminine energy is, Kevin. What Zuckerberg is saying is that to counteract the presence of even one woman at Meta, at least three men are needed to restore balance. Now just to give listeners a bit more of a sense of what we\u2019re talking about, I think we should play Mark Zuckerberg talking about masculine energy on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s do it.\n\narchived recording (mark zuckerberg) I just think we swung culturally to that part of the spectrum, where it\u2019s all, like, OK, masculinity is toxic. We have to get rid of it completely. It\u2019s like, no. Both of these things are good. It\u2019s like, you want feminine energy. You want masculine energy. You\u2019re going to have parts of society that have more of one or the other. I think that that\u2019s all good. But I do think the corporate culture had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing. And I didn\u2019t really feel that until I got involved in martial arts, which I think is still a much more masculine culture.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThere is something about being punched in the face that makes you think, my culture has been neutered. You know what I mean?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo, yes. I did hear this part of the interview. This went viral. Everyone on my feeds has been talking about these comments that Mark Zuckerberg made about masculine energy being missing from many of our greatest corporations. And this is in the context of all the moves that he\u2019s been making to try to make Meta more palatable to people on the right, including the incoming Trump administration. And this was him saying to Joe Rogan, in a way that people mercilessly mocked, the real problem in corporate America is that we\u2019ve been letting this feminine energy take over. And we need to assert masculine energy, and that\u2019s our path back to greatness.\n\ncasey newton\n\nExactly, Kevin. And so, as we so often try to do on this show, I\u2019ve spent all week thinking, how can we be part of the solution here? And so I have come up with a list of ideas that we can bring to the Meta corporation to help them restore masculine energy to Meta.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, boy.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe\u2019re going to give Meta a masculine makeover, and I would love to share some of the ideas that I have with you right now.\n\nkevin roose\n\nPlease.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNumber one, modify the Facebook Like button to display a bulging vein, reflecting long hours spent in the gym. What do you think?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: I like it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSomething else, whenever you tap it, your phone grunts.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s just say the poke is going to work a little differently now, but I can\u2019t say how on this podcast. Number three, transform every conference room at Meta into an octagon, Kevin. Remind workers at every meeting that work is a combat zone, and Mark Zuckerberg can strike at any time.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI like this.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe\u2019re also changing the name of the finance department to MMA, mixed martial accounting.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]:\n\ncasey newton\n\nNumber four, Meta acquires 4chan. It\u2019s the largest repository of disturbed 17-year-olds in the world, Kevin. And they could be part of the solution, too. Now the obvious thing to do would be to let them run the human resources department. But I\u2019m proposing that Meta goes further and puts them in charge of content moderation. That would be some masculine energy.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt sure would.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNumber five, no more of these beta team building activities, like making pottery and volunteering, Kevin. Instead, we\u2019re going on a wild boar hunt.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAs Mark shared on \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d one of the greatest challenges in his life is that his ranch in Kauai is absolutely beset by an invasive species of wild boars. And for years now, Zuckerberg has been spending his downtime hunting them with bow and arrows. In fact, do we have a clip of that?\n\narchived recording (mark zuckerberg) Well, my favorite is bow, bow and arrow. That\u2019s, I think, the most \u2014 that feels like the most sporting version of it. archived recording (joe rogan) Yeah, if you want to put it that way. Yeah. If you\u2019re just trying to get meat, it\u2019s not the most effective. The most effective is certainly a rifle.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIf you work at Meta, I think this should be your problem, too. Whether you want to use a bow and arrow or a rifle, report to the Zuckerberg ranch for further instructions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNow do we know what happens if you are a Meta employee and you actually bring a hunting bow into the office?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s actually one of the main ways to get promoted now. Number six, replace the water in Meta\u2019s data centers with Mountain Dew Code Red.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, I like this one.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMe too. Number seven, in the 2019 film \u201cJoker,\u201d Kevin, Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character does a famous dance down a set of stairs to signify that he is fully transformed into the Joker. My proposal, we bring those steps to the Meta campus in Menlo Park. You have a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg. Guess what, Kevin? You have to walk up the \u201cJoker\u201d steps.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI like that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBecause Mark is the Joker now. Number eight, in what many people perceived as a cruel and pointless attack on trans people, Meta instructed managers to remove tampons from the male restrooms at their campuses. But this is a half measure, Kevin. Because let\u2019s face it, real men don\u2019t use toilet paper.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTrue.\n\ncasey newton\n\nGet rid of it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. Are we doing bidets, or are we just going rawdog?\n\ncasey newton\n\nBidets, are you kidding me? There will not be one French thing in those restrooms, as long as I\u2019m suggesting ideas. Number nine, employees will now get one extra day off a year to do one of the following three activities \u2014 mow the lawn, watch the game, or hang with the boys. Which one of those would you pick, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nHang with the boys, for sure.\n\ncasey newton\n\nDo you even have any boys?\n\nkevin roose\n\nCome on, I\u2019ve got you.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s true. We can hang together on our day off. Now I have one last suggestion to bring up the masculine energy at Meta, Kevin, and it goes like this. We\u2019re going to have a hackathon for women. Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And at the end, we\u2019re going to take all the best ideas from their hackathon and give them to Meta\u2019s male executives. Because what kind of energy is more masculine than taking credit for a woman\u2019s idea? Anyway, just my thoughts, Kevin. Do you have any ideas as well?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: No, I think that basically covers it. I think with these changes, the Meta corporation will be fully \u2014 what\u2019s the opposite of emasculated?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt will be emanulated.\n\nkevin roose\n\nEmanulated. And we will have a glorious future run by men. There used to be a time at Meta when people like Sheryl Sandberg had a seat at the table, and famously told women there to lean in. What\u2019s happening with that now?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m being given word that they\u2019re being asked to lean out actually, maybe all the way out. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg announced this week that he was going to cut 5 percent of what he called the low performers at the company. And that is the ultimate, lean out is a layoff.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. I did see some Meta employees posting that the way they were going to avoid getting laid off is by getting extremely jacked. So that\u2019s an idea there.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat is now something that we can respect in culture is we can say, if you have visible muscles, maybe you belong around here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, I have to ask. Since we are in the Zuckerberg uniform now, minus the $900,000 watch. This is just my Apple Watch. How do you feel? Do you feel more masculine sitting in the studio today?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI am having an almost uncontrollable desire to just wrestle you to the ground and force you to submit. How are you feeling?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m a little insecure, honestly.\n\ncasey newton\n\nReally?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhy?\n\nkevin roose\n\nBecause I don\u2019t think I can pull this off.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou can absolutely pull it off. Everyone looks good in a black t-shirt and a gold chain.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah? Including me?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m not a big man jewelry guy.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou know what? I haven\u2019t been either. But then for our anniversary, my boyfriend and I got little chains. Isn\u2019t that so cute?\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat is cute.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, and manly in a different way, in, kind of, like, a gay, manly way. This is what I love. You start off, you\u2019re talking about something super manly, but then you get into it in any degree of detail, and you realize, no, it\u2019s masculine and feminine energy together in the same place. And isn\u2019t that beautiful?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNow, Casey, the one serious thing that I do want to say about this is that it clicked for me when I heard Mark Zuckerberg on \u201cJoe Rogan\u201d talking about masculinity and masculine energy that this is what founder mode was.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou can look back at our shows that we did about founder mode last year, and to my recollection, not one of the people in Silicon Valley calling for the return of founder mode was a woman. And I believe that that is because founder mode was an elaborate way of saying, we\u2019re big boys, and we would like to run our companies like big boys.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And look, I don\u2019t want to completely dismiss the idea that people should get in touch with masculine energy. That is a fine thing to do, no matter who you are. I get really concerned when somebody who employs tens of thousands of people starts talking about this in the context of corporate culture, and amid a series of initiatives that includes killing off the DEI program, and firing your, quote, unquote, low performers. A clear message is being sent, and the message is not, women are welcome at Meta.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOne thing that also struck me as I was listening to Mark Zuckerberg is that it also reminded me of a conversation that Jeff Bezos had at the DealBook Conference just a few weeks ago that I heard where I was actually surprised. Jeff Bezos was the original tech founder who got super masculine. He turned from this scrawny nerd into this jacked dude who lifts weights, and has these bulging muscles, and embraced a masculine aesthetic, I think, earlier than a lot of other tech executives. But I was also struck by his comments at DealBook, where he basically talked about his feelings a lot, and how he had started becoming more emotionally open at work about feeling scared or feeling vulnerable. And it just really struck me that that is a person who is actually comfortable with masculinity, when you can talk about emotions in the context of a business meeting. And you could talk about them on stage at a business conference. This LARPing that Mark Zuckerberg is doing, where he is pretending to be super masculine all of a sudden, and enjoy bow hunting, and hanging out with the bros, it just feels very insecure to me, and very, very much like this is a person who has not yet actually become at peace with his own self.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I think that there is something to that. I can\u2019t even make a joke about that because it\u2019s actually kind of terrifying.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nTo be 40 and still be trying to work out, hmm, what are my values? And could I just replace them wholesale almost overnight with a different set? That\u2019s kind of a scary proposition for somebody who runs a set of platforms used by billions of people.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. And I hope that whatever Mark Zuckerberg is looking for, he finds it. And I hope that it does not come at the expense of a lot of boars who might needlessly die.

            "content": "If you\u2019re fed up with Meta right now, you\u2019re not alone. Google searches for deleting Facebook and Instagram spiked last week after Meta announced its latest policy changes. These changes, seemingly designed to appease the incoming Trump administration, included loosening Meta\u2019s hate speech policy to allow for the targeting of LGBTQ+ people and immigrants.\n\nIf these changes\u2014or Meta\u2019s long history of anti-competitive, censorial, and invasive practices\u2014make you want to cut ties with the company, it\u2019s sadly not as simple as deleting your Facebook account or spending less time on Instagram. Meta tracks your activity across millions of websites and apps, regardless of whether you use its platforms, and it profits from that data through targeted ads. If you want to limit Meta\u2019s ability to collect and profit from your personal data, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nMeta\u2019s Business Model Relies on Your Personal Data\n\nYou might think of Meta as a social media company, but its primary business is surveillance advertising. Meta\u2019s business model relies on collecting as much information as possible about people in order to sell highly-targeted ads. That\u2019s why Meta is one of the main companies tracking you across the internet\u2014monitoring your activity far beyond its own platforms. When Apple introduced changes to make tracking harder on iPhones, Meta lost billions in revenue, demonstrating just how valuable your personal data is to its business.\n\nHow Meta Harvests Your Personal Data\n\nMeta\u2019s tracking tools are embedded in millions of websites and apps, so you can\u2019t escape the company\u2019s surveillance just by avoiding or deleting Facebook and Instagram. Meta\u2019s tracking pixel, found on 30% of the world\u2019s most popular websites, monitors people\u2019s behavior across the web and can expose sensitive information, including financial and mental health data. A 2022 investigation by The Markup found that a third of the top U.S. hospitals had sent sensitive patient information to Meta through its tracking pixel.\n\nMeta\u2019s surveillance isn\u2019t limited to your online activity. The company also encourages businesses to send them data about your offline purchases and interactions. Even deleting your Facebook and Instagram accounts won\u2019t stop Meta from harvesting your personal data. Meta in 2018 admitted to collecting information about non-users, including their contact details and browsing history.\n\nTake These Steps to Limit How Meta Profits From Your Personal Data\n\nAlthough Meta\u2019s surveillance systems are pervasive, there are ways to limit how Meta collects and uses your personal data.\n\nUpdate Your Meta Account Settings\n\nOpen your Instagram or Facebook app and navigate to the Accounts Center page.\n\nYou\u2019ll find a link to Accounts Center on the Settings pages of both apps. If you have trouble finding Accounts Center , check Meta\u2019s help pages for Facebook and Instagram .\n\nIf you use a web browser instead of Meta\u2019s apps, visit accountscenter.facebook.com or accountscenter.instagram.com .\n\nIf your Facebook and Instagram accounts are linked on your Accounts Center page, you only have to update the following settings once. If not, you\u2019ll have to update them separately for Facebook and Instagram. Once you find your way to the Accounts Center, the directions below are the same for both platforms.\n\nMeta makes it harder than it should be to find and update these settings. The following steps are accurate at the time of publication, but Meta often changes their settings and adds additional steps. The exact language below may not match what Meta displays in your region, but you should have a setting controlling each of the following permissions.\n\nOnce you\u2019re on the \u201cAccounts Center\u201d page, make the following changes:\n\n1) Stop Meta from targeting ads based on data it collects about you on other apps and websites:\n\nClick the Ad preferences option under Accounts Center, then select the Manage Info tab (this tab may be called Ad settings depending on your location). Click the Activity information from ad partners option, then Review Setting. Select the option for No, don\u2019t make my ads more relevant by using this information and click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button when prompted.\n\n2) Stop Meta from using your data (from Facebook and Instagram) to help advertisers target you on other apps. Meta\u2019s ad network connects advertisers with other apps through privacy-invasive ad auctions\u2014generating more money and data for Meta in the process.\n\nBack on the Ad preferences page, click the Manage info tab again (called Ad settings depending on your location), then select the Ads shown outside of Meta setting, select Not allowed and then click the \u201cX\u201d button to close the pop-up. Depending on your location, this setting will be called Ads from ad partners on the Manage info tab.\n\n3) Disconnect the data that other companies share with Meta about you from your account:\n\nFrom the Accounts Center screen, click the Your information and permissions option, followed by Your activity off Meta technologies, then Manage future activity. On this screen, choose the option to Disconnect future activity, followed by the Continue button, then confirm one more time by clicking the Disconnect future activity button. Note: This may take up to 48 hours to take effect. Note: This will also clear previous activity, which might log you out of apps and websites you\u2019ve signed into through Facebook.\n\nWhile these settings limit how Meta uses your data, they won\u2019t necessarily stop the company from collecting it and potentially using it for other purposes.\n\nInstall Privacy Badger to Block Meta\u2019s Trackers\n\nPrivacy Badger is a free browser extension by EFF that blocks trackers\u2014like Meta\u2019s pixel\u2014from loading on websites you visit. It also replaces embedded Facebook posts, Like buttons, and Share buttons with click-to-activate placeholders, blocking another way that Meta tracks you. The latest version of Privacy Badger extends this protection to embedded Instagram and Threads posts, which also send your data to Meta.\n\nVisit privacybadger.org to install Privacy Badger on your web browser. Currently, Firefox on Android is the only mobile browser that supports Privacy Badger.\n\nLimit Meta\u2019s Tracking on Your Phone\n\nTake these additional steps on your mobile device:\n\nDisable your phone\u2019s advertising ID to make it harder for Meta to track what you do across apps. Follow EFF\u2019s instructions for doing this on your iPhone or Android device.\n\nTurn off location access for Meta\u2019s apps . Meta doesn\u2019t need to know where you are all the time to function, and you can safely disable location access without affecting how the Facebook and Instagram apps work.

TikTok's lawyers said in a Supreme Court hearing that the app could also \"go dark,\" blocking existing users from seeing videos.\n\nThe ban would hobble one of the largest social media companies in the United States, leaving the time users spend on the app and billions of dollars of ad revenue up for grabs, according to an analysis from Business Insider's sister company EMARKETER.\n\n\"Our latest forecast estimates that TikTok generated $12.34 billion in US ad revenues in 2024,\" the analysis said. \"Assuming TikTok could lose between 50% and 70% of ad revenues due to a ban, $6.17 billion to $8.64 billion of ad spending could need a new home.\"\n\nAnd one social media giant's loss could be another social media giant's gain.\n\nThe analysis estimated that Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, could reap anywhere between $2.46 billion to $3.38 billion in ad revenue with a TikTok ban.\n\nSpokespeople for Tiktok and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSimilarly, Morgan Stanley analysts say that Meta will be the \"largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban\" in part due to its existing user base and data set.\n\nThe ban could add 5 to 9 percent in Meta's earnings per share for the 2026 fiscal year, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\n\nInstagram scrolling is also poised to replace some of the time US users spent on TikTok, analysts say.\n\nEMARKETER estimates that TikTok users in the US spent nearly an hour of their day on the app in 2024 and nearly three quarters of those users were also on Instagram.\n\n\"That leaves close to an hour of their daily media time up for grabs,\" eMarketer analysts wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say that Meta would gain around $.30 to $.60 to their 2026 earnings per share estimates for every 10% of TikTok's US time Meta captures.\n\nThe upside of a TikTok ban won't be concentrated to Meta.\n\nAlphabet's YouTube and Snapchat may also see some benefits with TikTok out of the way.\n\nFor advertisers, a looming TikTok ban should serve as a prescient reminder that no platform, however large, is invincible.\n\n\"Although it's difficult to say if the TikTok ban will go ahead, as it's possible TikTok could sell at the last minute, this should serve as a warning not to put all your content eggs in one basket,\" Danielle Dullaghan, social strategy director, at the marketing agency Iris, told Business Insider.\n\nJames Poulter, head of AI and innovation at London-based ad agency House 337, told BI that the brands and creators who will succeed are those diversified across platforms and focused on \"owned assets like websites and email lists.\"\n\n\"The brands and creators who thrive in uncertain times are those who prepare for the unexpected, ensuring their stories can be told regardless of the platform,\" he said.",

It stands alone in the series as the only VR title, so by default, it brings a level of immersion in this world that none of the other titles could ever reach. While certainly not even close to my favorite game in the series, Metro Awakening proves yet again that VR is a growing medium that should and will receive more attention and support as time goes on.\n\nVisually, Metro Awakening nails the doom and gloom that we have come to expect from the series, with VR only enhancing the utter hopelessness of this particular brand of apocalypse. You feel just how claustrophobic the metro tunnels are, contrasted by short trips to a surface that feels endless and endlessly empty. Death and despair surround you from start to finish, but there are pockets of humanity and hope scattered throughout, lending a small breath of life into this otherwise lifeless wasteland. The Metro series is one of my favorites when it comes to worldbuilding, and Awakening feels like a natural evolution for that. I conducted my review on the Quest 3, and while it was certainly a battery drainer, I found the performance to be above what I was expecting.\n\nThe audio design in VR games can arguably be just as important as the visuals as far as immersion goes. Metro Awakening understands this in ways that only Half-Life: Alyx understood prior. Each minute sound is given as much importance as the next, and they all demand your attention as you sneak your way through the metro.\n\nMechanically, Metro Awakening is simply fine. Longtime VR action players will find the way you interact with your inventory and items very familiar but will find the firearm handling to feel average at best. While some games put a great deal of focus on adding great weight and \u201coomph\u201d to your firearms, the weapons in Metro Awakening feel a bit floaty and light. As far as interacting with the world around you, your mileage will vary. I found the quiet moments to be peaceful and explorative, but anytime stealth was required, or I found myself in a tense gunfight, the game seemed to actively fight against me in my goals.\n\nThis is not a game for first-time VR players who do not have their \u201cVR Legs\u201d yet, so to speak. I think that even with proper accessibility settings, Metro Awakening VR is going to test newer players\u2019 stomachs and VR tolerance in a way that they might prefer to build up to. I also found myself coming untethered quite a few times, where my view or \u201chead\u201d would spontaneously fly off into space and leave me disoriented and staring down from an inappropriate height and angle at the ground I was on moments ago. These occurrences were few and far between, but no less jarring.\n\nThe story in Metro Awakening is a good one, although never quite as great as the mainline entries. This is partly because of the massive time difference between the main games and the VR title, and partly because of the way that VR stories have to be told. Cutscenes can\u2019t play out the same way in VR, and interactions need to be briefer and much more observatory, in my experience. This leads to a tighter story overall, which doesn\u2019t allow quite as much depth as you might like. I won\u2019t spoil any of the story here, but you can rest assured that it does live up to the Metro name.\n\nOverall, I think Metro Awakening VR is a worthy VR experience and a good Metro game, but it is not particularly groundbreaking on either front. I am thrilled to see more mainstream AAA titles getting VR releases that are more than just tacked-on afterthoughts. The quality that Metro Awakening manages to display is more than enough to justify other developers looking into making similar games and perhaps even a low-risk way to revive some other dormant franchises in VR (Resistance, please, I\u2019m begging you). I hope to see more of this type of VR title in the future and am happy to see the medium continue to move forward.\n\nNote: Vertigo Games provided us with a Metro Awakening VR code for review purposes.\n\nScore: 7",

            "content": "When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week announced plans to cut 5% of the company\u2019s workforce, citing a need to \u201craise the bar on performance management\u201d in an \u201cintense year\u201d ahead, it was just the latest in a series of jolts in the tech industry as employers navigate the integration of AI and RTO.\n\nThe announcement follows prior layoffs at Meta, including a massive reduction of 11,000 people in November 2023 and another culling last March. It comes on the heels of the company\u2019s controversial axing more recently of third-party moderators in what is largely seen as a nod to conservatives and the incoming Trump administration.\n\nWorkplace experts say the layoffs signal broader trends reshaping tech talent beyond mere performance concerns.\n\n\u201cBig tech will continue layoffs for two reasons: because the Covid tech bubble \u2014 when excessive hiring occurred while money was cheap and demand for tech services was high \u2014 is still bursting, and because AI has companies bullish on the idea of doing more with less,\u201d said Sam Wright, head of operations and partnerships at job search platform Huntr.\n\n\u201cEvery business should strive to eliminate poor performers. There\u2019s nothing more toxic than keeping underperformers alongside high achievers.\u201d Dominic Monkhouse business coach\n\nThe designation of \u201cunderperforming\u201d employees may mask a deeper strategic shift in the company \u2014 like replacing people with AI, said Ben Eubanks, CEO of HR specialists Lighthouse Research & Advisory. In fact, a number of companies have reportedly replaced workers with AI or are suspected of doing so \u2014 among them, Google, Salesforce and Ikea.\n\nThe timing of the latest layoffs at Meta happens to dovetail with the company\u2019s laser focus on AI, with Zuckerberg seen as particularly keen to advance the technology, including via its Llama 3 model.\n\nAs for letting go of subpar producers, some see that as necessary for maintaining a competitive edge. \u201cEvery business should strive to eliminate poor performers,\u201d said business coach Dominic Monkhouse. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more toxic than keeping underperformers alongside high achievers.\u201d\n\nStill, others express a more critical view. \u201cUnderperformance is an excuse made by poor management,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWhat actually happened is these tech companies bet bigger than they were able to return and are now needing to correct their balance sheets.\u201d\n\nOnline game developer Marin Cristian-Ovidiu is also skeptical of Meta\u2019s reasoning. \u201cCalling employees \u2018underperformers\u2019 feels like a corporate breakup text: \u2018It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s us \u2014 but actually, it\u2019s you,\u2019\u201d he said. Employees who may be struggling with performance are an easy target when it comes time to trim, as he sees it \u2014 and colleagues who are left behind end up \u201cwalking on eggshells. It\u2019s stressful and messes with morale big time.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderperformance is an excuse made by poor management.\u201d Sam Wright head of operations and partnerships, Huntr\n\nAs for the health of the tech job market, he points to expanding opportunities in areas including AI and gaming \u2014 even though AI has also been blamed for job losses in the gaming domain.\n\nStill, he remains bullish about prospects for tech jobs this year. \u201cWhen the giants stumble, it shakes the whole playground,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the bold will always bounce back.\u201d\n\nDespite the alarmist headlines, Eubanks provides context for the job market overall, noting that the software business represents less than 4% of the total U.S. workforce, according to government data. Furthermore, he points out, companies across a range of sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, financial services and life sciences \u2014 tend to view large-scale tech layoffs as a prime opportunity to acquire talent.\n\nAs for those inside Meta and other tech companies worried about job security, experts advise them to keep the focus on that which is in their control \u2014 namely, their own professionalism and development.\n\n\u201cEmployees should concentrate on strengthening their skills and consistently adding value to their role and beyond their job description,\u201d said Cyril Boisard, director of people at employee experience platform Workleap. \u201cUltimately, while employees don\u2019t control decisions relating to their roles, they can control how they show up, and that will always make a lasting impact on their career.\u201c",

Construction is expected to take around three years, but further details weren\u2019t shared.\n\nFacebook broke ground on the campus in 2016, beginning with a single $250m facility built by Fortis. The company opened a third data center at Los Lunas in 2020 and announced another two-building expansion in 2021 that are set to go live this year. The site reportedly currently totals seven buildings, according to the News-Bulletin.\n\nMeta paused development of around a dozen data centers in late 2022 as part of a \"rescoping\" of its designs to better cater for GPUs and liquid cooling. It has since resumed its build-out with the updated design.\n\nThe purpose of an IRB is to provide certain incentives for the company to expand and operate in the area. The village intends to issue up to six series of IRBs in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $7.5 billion each. This is the third series of IRBs to Greater Kudu LLC; the first two totaled up to $70bn.\n\nThe company has invested in more than 885MW of renewable energy capacity in New Mexico to offset the energy use of its data centers.\n\n2024 saw Meta announce facilities in Aiken, South Carolina, Cheyenne, Wyoming; Rosemount, Minnesota; Montgomery, Alabama; and Richland Parish, Louisiana.

The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal law that will effectively ban the social media app in the U.S. as of Jan. 19.\n\nThere are still a few ways TikTok could wriggle out of its do-or-die predicament. The app's parent company ByteDance has appealed to the incoming Trump administration to take some kind of action to save the platform. Trump has already said he'll \"save\" TikTok, but it's unclear exactly how the president-elect will put the brakes on an act of Congress, that's been upheld by The Supreme Court.\n\nThere's also uncertainty around just what happens when the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 19. TikTok has said it will go dark, but that's not quite what the law banning it calls for. Instead, it prohibits companies from hosting the service, which means it could still live on in some kind of app purgatory until Trump or Congress finds a way to reverse the ban.\n\nBut while TikTok's users are waiting with bated breath to see whether their favorite app dies off, the company's Silicon Valley rivals could be staring down a windfall are licking their chops at the prospect of bringing in TikTok's 170 million users and associated advertising dollars.\n\nMeta and YouTube take on TikTok\u2019s lost users\n\nThe biggest winner would also be one of TikTok\u2019s long-term critics, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\n\u201cIn general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\u201d\n\nMeta has been battling TikTok for years, with Zuckerberg at varying times raising the specter of Chinese technological dominance over the US and threats to free speech. Zuckerberg also rolled out Instagram and Facebook\u2019s Reels feature, a short-form video offering similar to TikTok, to combat the rival service and bring users back to his platforms.\n\nHoping that TikTok bites the dust?

            "content": "It's 2025 and virtual reality is just about mainstream... almost. That's still a cool thing to say. It feels futuristic. We don't live in cyberspace, but VR headsets have come a long way in the past decade or so. The Meta Quest 3S is an encapsulation of where that growth has taken us. It's a comfortably portable headset that doesn't need to be wired in to anything to run the best in mixed reality and VR gaming.\n\nThe Quest 3S is the latest in Meta's attempts to bring VR to the people (I guess). Point being, there's no PC or PlayStation required. Although, the Quest headsets continue to work attached to a PC as a method of playing your SteamVR library of games\u2014yes, including Half-Life: Alyx. At for the starting model, and for the headset with double the app storage, this is the most entry-level that VR gets. But how does it compare to other headsets, namely the Meta Quest 3? And if you haven't bit the bullet on VR, is this going to be enough to sell you? I dove into the Metaverse to find out.\n\nMeta Quest 3S 256GB $400 at Amazon Pros\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nResolution (per eye) 1832x1920p Weight 514 grams Storage 128GB, 256GB\n\nRight off the bat, you'll notice this isn't the Meta Quest 4. Instead, it's a more entry-level alternative to the Meta Quest 3, like the is to the . At best, it's $200 cheaper than the , which will run you $499 anywhere you turn. For better and worse, they are different headsets and the more expensive Quest 3 is clearly the more powerful.\n\nThe Quest 3S displays at a resolution 1832 x 1920 pixels (compared to the Quest 3's 2064 x 2208) and uses the Fresnel lenses of the Quest 2 headset. These lenses create a blurred effect around the periphery of your vision. It's a bit of an annoying downgrade coming from my time with the Quest 3, especially combined with the slightly lower resolution image. But it's not that inferior. With similar specs under-the-hood, the Quest 3S runs all my old VR favorites as smoothly as my old headset. Technically smoother because it doesn't have to output as high of a quality image. For experiences that toe the line between mixed and reality, like the game I spent time checking out, this doesn't end up being an issue. And the improvements over the last headset really start to show. The gains from the slightly out-of-date tech make spending more time in VR more pleasant and possible.\n\nThe Quest 3S has a long battery life and a more comfortable head strap than the Quest 3. Those together make playing longer a more pleasant experience in this Quest 3S. The newer headset is easier to wear for longer. In general, the extra 30-45 minutes of battery turn play sessions from \"Oh shit, I better wrap up before my headset dies,\" to \"This feels like the right amount of VR.\" It's an unexpected, but totally life-changing, little upgrade. I'm sure the battery life will only improve from here, but much farther beyond what it is now and you start to encourage some unhealthily long sessions. The Quest 3S is currently in the sweet spot.\n\nBatman: Arkham Shadow is Meta's killer app\n\nMeta/Oculus Studios\n\nIt's telling that Batman: Arkham Shadow now comes included with every headset Meta sells. It's one of the most full-fledged video games I've played in VR and one I actually keep thinking about and pulling out my headset to return to. The only issue I have is to wonder if I should keep playing on this headset or switch back to my Quest 3.\n\nI put a handful of multi-hour sessions into Meta's exclusive prequel to Rocksteady's Arkham trilogy (games I have great fondness for, especially Arkham Asylum) and came away wanting more. A rarity for a game that requires a headset. But that speaks to how successful Arkham Shadow is at translating the combat, traversal, and stealth mechanics of that series into virtual reality.\n\nI love Batman, so the notion of becoming the Bat is exhilarating in theory. Developer Camouflaj has brought that fantasy to live with really intuitive (and adjustable) controls and a hand-to-hand combat system that doesn't just feel like mushy swinging. Every action feels right in Arkham Shadow, which makes it easy to feel like the bad-ass the game wants you to instead of like a fumbling cosplayer.\n\nIf Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and Gotham Knights weren't scratching the Arkham itch, this will. It's the most authentically Arkham Batman game since Arkham Knight in 2015. And it just happens to be one of the greatest single-player VR adventures yet.\n\n\n\nMy final thoughts\n\nIf you're looking for the breeziest way to check out the handful of VR games you're interested in (unless one of those games is Half-Life: Alyx) the Meta Quest 3S is that gateway. It's a solid piece of headgear that won't break the bank, and it will give you access to most of the VR essentials. For now, it even comes with the best title to hit any VR headset in years with Arkham Shadow.\n\nThat said, aside from maybe the price, there is nothing in the package that makes a more compelling case for VR than the Meta Quest 3. But I also can't see entry-level VR getting any cheaper than $299 and being sustainable. VR is still a niche subset of gaming, even if it's in more homes than ever. If this thing fails to catch on in a major way, it will take more than cheaper headsets to save it. So if you're considering buying a VR headset, I won't blame you for saving the $200, but I'd still consider springing for the top-of-the-line Meta Quest 3.\n\nMeta Quest 3S 256GB $400 at Amazon Pros\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nResolution (per eye) 1832x1920p Weight 514 grams Storage 128GB, 256GB\n\nWhy Trust Esquire?\n\nHere at Esquire, we compile our guides by performing heavy research and testing, and the gadgets we choose to award are what we'd spend our own money on.

In 2025, I've switched to using the Quest 3S for the purposes of this review, where I tested titles including SuperHot VR, Beat Saber,Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway, and many hours of Arkham Shadow.",

Axios was the first to report that Meta is terminating DEI programs geared to hiring, training and choosing suppliers, citing an internal employee memo.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it was eliminating its DEI efforts.\n\nIn explaining the policy shift, Janelle Gale, vice president of human resources at Meta, said the \"legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\"\n\nThe retreat from DEI policies by Meta and others follows a 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservatives political activists. Other large companies to unwind their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.\n\nMore recently, the shift away from DEI has coincided with President-elect Donald Trump's startling political comeback.\n\n\"Many global businesses will be using the second Trump presidency to finally kill off the DEI agenda, if they haven't done so already,\" Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Those attempting to curry favor with Trump are doing it publicly, while other organizations, not wishing to suffer any potential public backlash or fallout, will do so quietly and over time.\"\n\nUnder fire by \"anti-woke\" factions that have targeted companies, universities and other organizations in court and on social media, a number of corporations have backtracked on diversity efforts that intensified after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd sparked the largest racial justice protests in the U.S. since the civil rights movement.\n\nSome corporate leaders have also questioned the value of diversity and its contribution to a company's bottom line, with DEI \"seen by many leaders as distracting to business performance and growth,\" Snell said.\n\nDEI defenders\n\nOther companies, including Apple, Costco and Target, continue to maintain and defend their DEI policies.\n\nCostco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against proposal to dismantle its DEI program ahead of January 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists such as Robby Starbuck urging boycotts and membership cancellations of the warehouse club.\n\n\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated.\n\nThe proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, argues that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore to shareholders.\n\nJeff Raikes, a Costco board member and proponent of DEI, has touted the economic benefits of diverse workplaces, posting on social media in November that \"attacks on DEI aren't just bad for business \u2014 they hurt our economy. A diverse workforce drives innovation, expands markets and fuels growth.\"\n\nTarget, for instance, is defending against itself in court against a conservative advocacy group's lawsuit claiming the retailer misled investors about the financial risks of its DEI practices.",

Last week, he announced his future plans for Meta, which included halting all independent fact-checking efforts and relaxing moderation of anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech. Through the days that followed, Meta removed accommodations for transgender employees from its office bathrooms, scrubbed LGBTQ+ themes from Messenger, softened its misinformation filters, junked its diversity initiatives, and bade goodbye to its vice president of civil rights while reassigning its chief diversity officer to an \u201caccessibility and engagement\u201d position. Meanwhile, Zuck ramped up his online interactions with far-right influencers like Benny Johnson, went on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to bemoan a supposed lack of \u201cmasculine energy\u201d in corporate America, and kept up his regular Mar-a-Lago meetings with Donald Trump (in part to negotiate a possible resolution to Trump\u2019s post\u2013Jan. 6 lawsuit against Facebook).\n\nThis has resulted in a lot of upset users, employees, and associates. TechCrunch reported on a massive uptick in Google searches from users looking up how to delete their Facebook, Instagram, and Threads accounts, and seeking alternatives to those platforms. (Among them: Pixelfed, a community-supported Instagram alternative that reported \u201cunprecedented levels of traffic\u201d over the weekend.) This mass deletion push has been encouraged by Hollywood celebrities like Mia Farrow, Alex Winter, and Cord Jefferson, all of whom have publicly announced farewells to their Instagram and Threads accounts. One of the attorneys defending Meta\u2019s A.I. models from a lawsuit brought by aggrieved authors dropped Meta as a client and announced he was deleting Instagram and Threads, citing his displeasure at \u201cMark Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.\u201d Zuckerberg has dismissed such platform departures as \u201cvirtue signaling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this may feel like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to social media users who remember the aftermath of Elon Musk\u2019s 2022 Twitter takeover, which spurred a mass exodus of liberal users, and the rage that erupted last year as the website now known as X became a full-on Trump propaganda den and hive for neo-Nazis\u2014which, in the wake of the 2024 election results, inspired even more users to leave, including me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing about that: Remember what major company positioned itself as a ready refuge for these disaffected tweeters post-2022? That was Meta, yup, which coordinated a massive celebrity-supported rollout for its Twitter clone, Threads, in July 2023, with Zuck stating his goal of turning it into \u201ca public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it.\u201d\n\nThreads initially benefited from some clear advantages: default compatibility with Instagram, server capacity to handle mass influxes, and enthusiasm among users and advertisers for a friendly microblogging platform not owned by Elon Musk. But Threads blew its initial momentum rather quickly, not least thanks to Meta\u2019s insistence on refusing to promote so-called political content\u2014even though the site\u2019s most eager users were, naturally, political organizers situated around the world. Overall engagement with the site plummeted quickly, and issues around blocked news links and erroneously deleted profiles further soured people on the experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThreads has made some changes to try to fix this, offering customized feeds for users (following the postelection user surge on the very customizable Bluesky) and, as Zuckerberg noted in last week\u2019s announcement, working to recommend \u201cpolitical content\u201d again. But there\u2019s a much, much deeper issue at hand that might just neuter any chance Threads may have had to take X/Twitter\u2019s place in the social mediasphere\u2014and if that turns out to be the case, it won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s fault but Zuckerberg\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, another reason that Threads appealed to ex-Twitterers was that Zuckerberg, at that point in 2023, was in the midst of some rather public spats with Musk, by then Public Enemy No. 1 for liberal users. The two were going to face off in a cage fight after throwing barbs at each other from across their respective social networks. Musk even sent Zuck a cease-and-desist for supposedly stealing Twitter\u2019s trade secrets while building Threads. For a brief moment, following the reputational hits Zuckerberg had taken after Cambridge Analytica and the Facebook Papers, Threads may have earned the grudging embrace of liberals who hated Musk more than they appreciated Zuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Elon Musk Has Just Embarrassed Himself Beyond Belief Read More\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s especially ironic\u2014or \u201cconcerning,\u201d if you will\u2014that Zuckerberg is trying so hard to emulate Musk\u2019s Twitter turnaround in his own goals for Meta.\n\nIn last week\u2019s announcement video, and in his conversation with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg evoked Musk in both substance and style. He\u2019s getting rid of fact-checkers in favor of a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature specifically based on X\u2019s controversial program. He attacked \u201clegacy media,\u201d while supposedly championing \u201cfree speech\u201d that allows for more dehumanizing language against transgender Americans. He\u2019s moving certain employees from California to Texas while expressing contempt for the Biden administration\u2019s \u201ccensorship\u201d of social media platforms (despite the fact that it was the first Trump administration that policed much online language around the hot-button issues of COVID and Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop). He attacked digital regulations in Europe and Latin America and pronounced his desire to change some countries\u2019 laws. Sound familiar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the power and influence Musk may have gained for himself by running X/Twitter, the website itself is nothing less than a mess for those remaining, with users and advertisers fleeing as white nationalism and horrific conspiracy theories spread nonstop. Is it any wonder that advertisers\u2014the primary source of Meta\u2019s massive profits\u2014are already expressing their concerns about Zuck\u2019s redirection? Is it any wonder that Bluesky is retaining user engagement and loyalty in ways that Threads is simply not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their rapid A.I.-driven enshittification, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are long-extant, essential communication apparatuses for several types of users around the world, and it\u2019s difficult to see Zuck\u2019s changes making severe dents in those platforms as he (presumably) earns more government-backed favors from Trump. (And not to mention as Reels benefits from TikTok\u2019s expulsion.) But Threads? The only reason for anyone to join was that it wasn\u2019t like Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter, as one disaffected user responded to a post from Instagram head Adam Mosseri. By turning Threads into just another form of Twitter, Zuck may have just \u201cneutered\u201d any case for users to join or remain on Threads.",

Neukom professor of law at Stanford Law and director of its Program in Law, Science and Technology, said in his social media post he has \u201cstruggled with how to respond to [CEO] Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.\u201d\n\nLemley, a partner at Lex Lumina who was representing Meta in a copyright dispute in the Northern District of California, said he fired the company as a client. The case, Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, involves allegations that Meta trained its artificial intelligence product using the copyrighted works of several authors.\n\nLaw.com, Bloomberg Law, Business Insider and SFGate have coverage.\n\nLemley said on LinkedIn he considered quitting Facebook but has found \u201cgreat value\u201d in connecting with friends on the platform. He added that \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem fair that I should lose that because Zuckerberg is having a midlife crisis.\u201d\n\nAlong with firing Meta, Lemley said he deactivated his Threads account and will no longer make purchases based on Facebook or Instagram ads.\n\nIn a statement published by Law.com on Wednesday and also sent to the ABA Journal on Thursday, Lemley said he decided to fire Meta after Zuckerberg took \u201ca series of steps\u201d in the past week \u201cto encourage disinformation and hate speech on the platform, to target LGBTQ members on the site and at the company, and to encourage a culture of toxic masculinity.\u201d\n\nMeta announced that it would end its third-party fact-checking programs in the United States and change its hateful conduct policies. The company also said it was ending its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nMichael Frisch, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who\u2019s also the school\u2019s ethics counsel, told Law.com that it isn\u2019t ethically inappropriate for a lawyer to terminate representation of a client, as long as it doesn\u2019t harm the client.\n\nHowever, Frisch also said, there have been cases in which lawyers have been sanctioned for being publicly critical of a client or a former client.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find it ethically questionable that the lawyer decided to withdraw,\u201d Frisch told Law.com. \u201cI think the lawyer seeking publicity or making public statements negative about the client raises potential ethics concerns.\u201d\n\nUpdated Jan. 16 at 2:03 p.m. to reflect that Mark Lemley sent his Wednesday statement published by Law.com to the ABA Journal.",

It\u2019s instead one that Josephine, a London-based XR creative designer and content creator, created using AI and Meta\u2019s Segment Anything 2 model.\n\nInstead of buying a few similar dresses, Josephine says she was eager to show how many different looks could be achieved without having to change the physical dress she was wearing.\n\n\u201cWith AI and digital fashion, we have creative ways to express ourselves online that don\u2019t rely on having to \u2018buy into\u2019 trends and fast fashion mass consumption,\u201d she says. \u201cThis shift not only celebrates individuality but also supports a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\nFor her work, Josephine built a computer with an RTX 4090 GPU to accommodate heavier tasks. She created her red carpet looks by programming ComfyUi, an open source stable diffusion model.

Until the release of Meta\u2019s first version of SAM in 2023, object segmentation in images was a time-consuming task that wasn\u2019t always precise. SAM revolutionized the process by enabling interactive and automatic object segmentation in images. Meta followed the success with the release of SAM 2 , which extended the flexible segmentation capabilities to videos and images.\n\n\u201cSAM was transformative in helping execute clean segmentation on top of the existing video,\u201d Josephine says. \u201cAs soon as I started using it, the quality of my outcomes increased significantly.

Amazon managers are expected to regularly shed a set percentage of employees deemed dispensable. Even Andy Jassy, the company's CEO, has had a URA target in the past to replace 6% of his team annually, Business Insider previously reported.\n\n\"The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees,\" Laszlo Bock, who oversaw the tremendous growth in Google's workforce as the company's head of people operations from 2006 to 2016, told BI. \"The current political environment emboldens these CEOs to take drastic actions.\"\n\nDonald Trump was reelected US President in November, and Bock said tech companies, which had championed progressive workplace policies and employee-friendly initiatives in 2016, were now taking a markedly different approach.\n\nThe shift in how Meta manages employees marks a significant departure from Silicon Valley's traditional talent strategy. For years, leading tech companies notoriously overpaid for talent \u2014 even workers who weren't fully productive \u2014 to keep them away from competitors.\n\n\"Their business model thrived on tremendous margins, so they hired freely, knowing that if some employees underperformed, at least they weren't boosting the competition,\" Bock said.\n\nThat line of thinking seems to have changed.\n\nWeeding out underperformers\n\nManagers at Meta have been instructed to identify underperformers through a tiered rating system, according to a memo from Hillary Champion, Meta's director of people development growth programs, seen by BI.\n\nLast week, BI reported that Microsoft was also planning to make performance-based job cuts.\n\n\"At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent,\" a spokesperson said at the time. \"We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.\"\n\nGoogle, too, had its own version of performance culling under Bock's leadership that the company kept secret.\n\nBock told BI that every quarter, the company identified the bottom 5% of employees in any group of at least 200 people (such as a division), combining smaller teams until they hit that threshold, a process that was separate from regular performance reviews.\n\nHe said some of those people were still good performers. \"If your worst person is better than my best person, you're still going to have a bottom 5%,\" he said. Google then coached, transferred, or terminated these workers. Google and Meta declined to comment on this report.\n\nToday's tech CEOs, however, are taking a more direct approach.\n\n\"Everyone at these companies still gets performance ratings and goes through the motions,\" Bock said, \"But I think the CEOs are seeing an opportunity in the marketplace and the political environment and saying, 'We're just going to pull the Band-Aid off.' They feel employees are entitled.\"\n\nThe message is clear: If you're not building the future, you may just be history.",

If you use X (formerly known as Twitter), you may sometimes see notes that dispute a post's assertions, add context, or provide more information.\n\nThe premise is that this could potentially loosen restrictions on free speech while also countering false reports, misinformation, and disinformation. If users can leave notes on questionable posts that provide valuable context, that might prevent others that read them from reaching incorrect conclusions.\n\nHowever, the model X is using may be a risky one to copy. Many advertisers have left the social media platform in the period since Elon Musk took over, due largely to their concerns about its weaker moderation policies and the volume of extreme and controversial content on the platform. Brands typically don't want to be associated with contentious content because they have little interest in alienating any significant part of their customer base.\n\nAlthough easing restrictions in the name of free speech may sound like a great idea to some people, it also raises the question of how impartial the new moderation protocol will be. The community-based model also assumes that users will take the time to carefully read those notes rather than instantly reacting to posts that may outrage them.\n\nA drop in advertising revenue could derail the stock's progress\n\nMany people see Meta's shift as an attempt to appease Trump, who was banned from Facebook back in 2021 for a period of two years. Enacting Trump-friendly policies on its platforms now could spare Meta scrutiny and pressure from government regulators or Trump himself later.\n\nBut the bigger risk is that many advertisers could start shifting significant quantities of their marketing spending to other platforms instead. Facebook has often had problems with being associated with unverified reports and disinformation, and in the generative artificial intelligence era, it's only becoming easier for bad actors to create such misleading content. The need for rigorous fact-checking on social media platforms is arguably increasing. Moving away from it may prove costly for Meta.\n\nOne big reason the stock has soared more than 400% since the start of 2023 (after falling by almost 70% from its peak from late 2021 through 2022) is that the business has flourished due to growing ad spending on its platforms. With a U.S. TikTok ban looming and advertisers pulling away from X, Meta has been even more of a go-to option for marketers than it had been. During the first nine months of 2024, the company's sales rose by 22% year over year to $116 billion while net income soared by 66% to about $42 billion.\n\nIf Meta's growth rate slows, that could put pressure on the stock, which is trading around record levels and at 29 times its trailing earnings -- a sizable multiple, which may be hard to justify amid more modest growth.\n\nIs Meta Platforms stock still a good buy?\n\nThis social media stock has benefited from an increase in ad spend on its platforms in recent years, but I'm not convinced that trend will continue. There are a growing number of alternative ways for advertisers to reach consumers. For example, Walmart's acquisition of TV maker Vizio may give a boost to its advertising business, while social media company Reddit is also expanding efforts to generate advertising revenue on its platform. Plus, given the uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the near future, it's possible that companies will again reduce their ad spending to conserve money.\n\nWhile Meta has achieved considerable gains in recent years and generated fantastic growth along the way, eliminating its third-party fact-checking system could be a costly move at an inopportune time. For investors, I think there are better growth stocks to consider than Meta Platforms today, and given its elevated valuation, it may be due for a correction.",

            "content": "When Mark Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to Meta\u2019s content moderation policies, he framed the move as a bold defense of free speech. But many, especially members of the LGBTQ+ community and allies, worry about what this means for safety on Meta\u2019s platforms and fear this marks an open invitation for Meta users to engage in anti-LGBTQ+ abuse that will disempower and marginalize the community.\n\nTo better understand the gravity of this situation, it\u2019s worth reflecting on how the LGBTQ+ community has historically engaged with Meta platforms. Perhaps the most well-known example arose in 2013 when the Human Rights Campaign led the community to \u201cturn the Internet red\u201d in a groundbreaking campaign for marriage equality. Public figures, political leaders, and everyday users alike changed their Facebook profile pictures to HRC\u2019s red equal sign, resulting in a viral movement that elevated awareness and galvanized public support for LGBTQ+ equality. By empowering both community members and allies, this campaign played a crucial role in building public support for marriage equality, ultimately contributing to the 2015 Obergefell decision that granted same-sex couples the right to marry. This victory was further codified with the 2022 passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrined federal protections for marriage equality into law and safeguarded these rights against future challenges. This is what is at stake as we move into this new era, and the community is forced to question whether such a movement could flourish on Meta platforms today.\n\nThe changes announced last week \u2014 which will be implemented across all Meta-owned platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp \u2014 are not just another policy update, but a shift that will normalize anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and intensify anti-LGBTQ+ harassment. In the wake of these changes, some LGBTQ+ people will likely self-censor or withdraw from online spaces altogether, while others may suffer physical violence that began as online threats. All of this poses a critical threat to LGBTQ+ representation, equality, and democracy.",

            "content": "Universal translators in science fiction, such as the Babel fish in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, have long offered the dream of instantaneous translation from one spoken language to another. Now, in what may be a key step toward making this fantasy a reality, scientists at Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta have developed an AI system that can instantly translate speech and text, including direct speech-to-speech translations, for up to 101 languages.\n\n\u201cScience fiction provides a clear goal that our group can focus on,\u201d says Marta Costa-juss\u00e0 , a research scientist at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research team in Menlo Park, California. The scientists described their work on 15 January in the journal Nature.\n\nAs the world grows more interconnected, people have more access to multilingual content than ever. However, most automated translation systems are designed to only input and output text. Until now, the speech-to-speech machine translation systems that did exist covered significantly fewer languages than text-to-text systems. Moreover, previous speech-to-speech systems were often skewed toward translating a given language into English, rather than English to another language.\n\nMeta\u2019s SeamlessM4T Translation Tech\n\nNow Meta has developed an AI system called SeamlessM4T that can translate speech and text in up to 101 languages. Specifically, it can support speech-to-speech translation for 101 to 36 languages, speech-to-text translation for 101 to 96 languages, text-to-speech translation for 96 to 36 languages, text-to-text translation for 96 languages, and automatic speech recognition for 96 languages. (Whether it can or cannot translate between languages depends on the availability of quality speech data, Costa-juss\u00e0 says.)\n\nTo develop SeamlessM4T, the researchers trained a brain-mimicking neural network AI system on 4 million hours of multilingual audio and tens of billions of sentences from publicly available repositories of web data. They also had it analyze roughly 443,000 hours of audio with matching text\u2014for instance, Internet video clips with subtitles\u2014to further improve the system.\n\nWhen it came to speech-to-speech translation, the research team found SeamlessM4T\u2019s translations were up to 23 percent more accurate than previous state-of-the-art systems. With speech-to-text tasks, it was 8 percent more accurate than prior systems.\n\nFurthermore, SeamlessM4T was roughly 50 percent more resilient against background noise and variations in how speakers talked when it came to speech-to-text tasks. Moreover, it could translate utterances mixing two or more languages.\n\nChecking for Toxicity and Bias\n\nTo reduce the chances that SeamlessM4T might add profanity and other toxic language to its translations, the researchers employed two strategies to remove toxicity during its training and operation. When they compared SeamlessM4T models to the state of the art, they found these approaches reduced toxicity in translations by up to 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThe SeamlessM4T work takes care to audit potential harms in its translations,\u201d says Allison Koenecke, an assistant professor of information technology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., who did not participate in this research. \u201cThis is especially important as machine-based speech translation is increasingly being used in a range of high-stakes applications, from medical appointments to workplace hiring.\u201d\n\nThe Meta scientists also examined whether SeamlessM4T unfairly favored one gender when translating gender-neutral phrases into gendered languages. However, they found they could not significantly improve gender-bias performance, and say they need to develop specific techniques to counteract this bias.\n\nAlong with SeamlessM4T, Meta released several supporting AI systems for analyzing speech and text, notes Tanel Alum\u00e4e , an associate professor of speech processing at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia, who did not work on SeamlessM4T. Alum\u00e4e and his colleagues have successfully used one of these tools \u201cfor stuff like emotion recognition from speech and detecting early cognitive decline\u2014for example, Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014from speech,\u201d he notes.\n\nCurrently Meta is using SeamlessM4T to help automatically dub videos on Instagram and Facebook . It also helps enable real-time translation of Spanish, French, or Italian to English through speakers on special Ray-Ban glasses, Costa-juss\u00e0 says. To spur future research into speech translation technologies, Meta is making code, tools, libraries, and other resources associated with SeamlessM4T publicly available for noncommercial use.\n\nMuch work remains if researchers want to make SeamlessM4T a universal translator on Earth. Although it\u2019s exciting that the current technology supports about 100 languages, \u201cthe number of languages spoken in the world is much larger\u2014around 6,500, by some estimates,\u201d Alum\u00e4e says.\n\nThis article appears in the March 2025 print issue as \u201cMeta\u2019s Translation AI Is Almost a Babel Fish.\u201d",

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via AP The only way to reduce the stakes of content moderation is to increase the number of outlets for that content.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced that then-President Trump\u2019s Facebook account would be indefinitely blocked because the president had condoned his supporters\u2019 violent storming of the U.S. Capitol the day before. The president was a danger to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power, Zuckerberg declared. Four years later, also on January 7, Zuckerberg announced a reversal in Meta\u2019s content moderation policies: Fact-checking would be replaced by community notes, and the algorithms that remove hate speech would be dialed back. Moderating content was censorship, he declared.\n\nInadvertently, Zuckerberg had made the strongest case possible for breaking up Meta. Many reactions to Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement focused on the wisdom of the new or old content moderation schemes. But the content moderation wars are beside the point. Beyond outright illegal content, there is no right or wrong approach to content moderation. Just like restaurants, offices, or classrooms, online platforms may thrive under permissive or strict rules. Whatever the rules are, however, one person should not have the power to unilaterally set those rules for millions of Americans because he feels \u201ca cultural tipping point.\u201d Simply stated, Meta\u2019s content moderation policies are not incompatible with democratic discourse. What is incompatible is Meta itself, as are other speech monopolies. For three reasons, content-moderating monopolies like Meta are a threat to democracy.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcements, both in 2021 and 2025, testify to the outsized individual power over discourse.\n\nFirst, platform scale and market concentration raise the stakes of individual content moderation decisions and platform design choices. Raising the stakes of content moderation decisions, however, is highly problematic because, as Zuckerberg rightly points out, content moderation is inherently prone to mistakes. When platforms assess billions of posts, they will take down some that should have stayed up and leave up some that should have been taken down\u2014even when acting with the best intentions. Some accounts will be mistakenly blocked, while others remain overlooked. When Facebook blocked President Trump\u2019s account, the company may have acted too early or too late. Or maybe the platform should not have blocked the account at all.\n\nStricter approaches to content moderation (like Meta\u2019s in 2021) or laxer ones (like Meta\u2019s in 2025) do not lower these stakes and can hardly hope to reduce the risks of errors. All they do is favor one type of error over another. It \u201cis a trade-off,\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledges. The only way to reduce the stakes of content moderation is to increase the number of outlets for that content. If there were 50 Metas, none of the company\u2019s individual decisions would matter much; none of their inevitable mistakes would have potentially devastating consequences for public discourse.\n\nSecond, market concentration facilitates \u201ccooperation and cooptation\u201d between speech platforms and the government\u2014an affront to free-speech values. Both in 2021 and 2025, Zuckerberg\u2019s pivotal announcements came just days before the inauguration of a new administration, when he could be clear-eyed about the regulatory and political risks of his actions. In 2021, Zuckerberg harshly condemned President Trump for his actions on January 6th. Despite countless earlier violations of Facebook\u2019s terms of service, Zuckerberg suspended the president\u2019s account indefinitely only after it became clear that Trump\u2019s attempts to remain in power had failed. Meta aligned itself with calls for fact-checking as preferred by the incoming Biden administration. In 2025, Zuckerberg expressly cited recent election results to justify changes that are tailor-made for the policy preferences of the incoming Trump administration. In passing, the Meta CEO took a swipe at the outgoing Biden administration, lamenting difficulties in standing up for free speech globally \u201cover the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\u201d Referring to the removal of content as \u201ccensorship\u201d and declaring that \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality \u2026 based on gender or sexual orientation\u201d are now permitted, Meta embraced the incoming administration both in tone and explicit policy preferences. Zuckerberg also restructured his team and hired Trump administration confidante Joel Kaplan as global policy chief.\n\nThird, Zuckerberg\u2019s announcements, both in 2021 and 2025, testify to the outsized individual power over discourse. Equipped with a $900,000 watch but no public mandate for his policies, Zuckerberg proclaimed the new speech rules for 250 million Facebook and 160 million Instagram users in the United States. No single politician commands a fraction of that power over discourse, despite their actual public mandate. Enabled by its monopoly position, which affords users opportunities neither to exit to a comparable platform nor to articulate their voice, Meta engages in illegitimate private governance.\n\nThe content moderation project that seeks to mitigate speech harms by relying on platforms to self-regulate has failed abysmally. It is finally time to create a market structure \u201cconducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions,\u201d as the Supreme Court stated in 1957 in finding a company in violation of antitrust law. Focusing on content over structure and cooperation over regulation ignores market power, disregards interests, na\u00efvely trusts the benevolence of billionaires, and mistakes cheap opportunism for loyalty to democratic norms. There are important content moderation policies for government to pursue; but any new content moderation directives must be paired with steep structural reforms.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the content of speech that must change. It is the power of monopolistic speech platforms over speech that must be diminished. There is no alternative to breaking up Big Tech.",

(January 15, 2025) -- National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial issued the following statement in response to Meta\u2019s \u201cMore Speech and Fewer Mistakes\u201d announcement and DEIAB rollback:\n\n\"Meta\u2019s announcement of its \u201cMore Speech and Fewer Mistakes\u201d initiative, combined with its recent rollback of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility, and Belonging (DEIAB) commitments, represents a disturbing retreat from its stated values of equity and accountability. These actions signal a betrayal of the trust placed in Meta to protect marginalized communities and champion systemic change.\n\n\"As a member of Meta\u2019s civil rights advisory council \u2013 an informal convening of leading national organizations - the National Urban League is appalled that these decisions were made without consulting or notifying trusted civil rights partners. By unilaterally weakening its Hateful Conduct Policy\u2014including narrowing definitions of \"targeted harassment\" and \"dehumanizing language\"\u2014Meta is prioritizing free speech for the privileged at the expense of safety for the vulnerable. This rollback amplifies the risks of hate speech, harassment, and disinformation that disproportionately harm Black Americans and other marginalized groups.\n\n\"Equally troubling is Meta\u2019s abandonment of its DEIAB commitments, which were critical to creating a more inclusive workplace and platform environment. These rollbacks suggest that diversity and equity are no longer priorities for the company, undermining its credibility and progress on racial and social justice.\n\n\"The National Urban League cannot continue to participate in performative partnerships that lack genuine accountability. Effective immediately, we are stepping back from Meta\u2019s informal convening. This decision is not taken lightly but reflects the undeniable reality that Meta\u2019s failure to engage with trusted civil rights leaders signals a lack of genuine partnership. Failing to engage civil rights leaders underscores a disturbing pattern of dismissing the lived realities of Black Americans and other marginalized groups who endure the most of harmful content online. By relaxing content moderation policies in the name of \u201cfree speech,\u201d Meta is abandoning its responsibility to protect vulnerable users, all while exposing these communities to greater harm.\n\n\"In response, we are putting Meta on notice: platitudes about a desire to make \u201cfewer mistakes\u201d or focus on \u201chiring the best and brightest\u201d mean nothing if they come at the expense of online safety, accountability and having a workforce that reflects to the true talent and diversity of our country. We demand immediate corrective action, including:\n\nRestore Civil Rights Accountability: Meta must reengage with civil rights leaders and recommit to its DEIAB principles to address the disproportionate harm faced by Black and marginalized communities online in the workplace. s. Failing to do so signals an unwillingness to truly collaborate with stakeholders committed to equity and justice.\n\nCommit to Transparency: Meta must disclose the specific changes made to the Hateful Conduct Policy and provide measurable benchmarks for evaluating the initiative's impact on vulnerable communities. The public deserves to know how this policy shift will be implemented, what metrics will measure its success, and what safeguards are in place to prevent the amplification of online hate speech and disinformation targeting communities of color and other marginalized groups. This includes clear reporting on the prevalence of hate speech and disinformation before and after these changes.\n\nEnsure Proper Oversight: Independent audits must be conducted to assess the consequences of the policy change. These audits should include input from civil rights experts and be made publicly available to ensure accountability.\n\nInvest in Culturally Competent Moderation: Expanding resources for culturally informed moderation teams and technology must be prioritized. Now is not the time for the wholesale abandonment of fact-checking and content moderation.\n\nPublic Commitment to DEIAB Goals: Meta must publicly renew and expand its commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility, and Belonging by establishing measurable, time-bound goals for hiring, leadership representation, and platform equity initiatives. These goals should be independently monitored and reported annually to demonstrate accountability and rebuild trust with marginalized communities.\n\n\"The National Urban League has long advocated for safe, equitable, and inclusive digital spaces and collaborated with Meta to advance these objectives. However, these policy shifts\u2014and the lack of transparency surrounding them\u2014cast doubt on Meta\u2019s commitment to equity and justice and the communities we represent. We will not allow performative engagement to replace substantive action.\n\n\"We strongly urge Meta to reconsider and stand ready to meet with CEO Mark Zuckerberg to offer our advice on how the company can return to responsible stewardship of free speech online and its commitment to the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.\"",

            "content": "Ravi Iyer /\n\nJan 15, 2025\n\nMeta\u2019s recent announcements include two changes in its moderation efforts and one change to its algorithm design. The algorithm design changes are the least clear and likely the most impactful, writes Ravi Iyer.\n\nScreenshot of an announcement from Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan posted on Meta's website. Source\n\nMeta recently announced three changes to allow \u201cmore speech and fewer mistakes,\u201d as founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it. The company is ending its third-party fact-checking program in favor of community notes and reducing its content moderation efforts more broadly. And it is making algorithmic changes to discourse on certain topics, such as discussions of gender, politics, and other social issues.\n\nFact-checking was never done at a substantial enough scale to materially affect online discourse. One estimate of fact-checking done in January 2020 found that there were only 302 fact-checks conducted that month in the US, which is clearly not meaningful given the hundreds of millions of US users on Meta platforms. Fact-checking is even sparser internationally. And while those 302 pieces of content may have been important, it is unlikely that fact checks happened with enough speed to prevent any harm, given how fast false news spreads. This impact also has to be weighed against the inevitable mistakes that will be made in any such process. Such mistakes have led to a clear backlash whereby most Americans of all political persuasions believe that social media sites censor political views, and few have much confidence in companies' abilities to discern truth from falsehood.\n\nThese same issues apply to moderation more broadly, which still involves fallible human judgment of content, outsourced to individuals with far less expertise and time to make the right decision, as compared to fact-checking organizations. As the journalist Casey Newton writes in one of many reactions that are primarily focused on moderation and fact-checking, \u201cMost people I know have been thrown into \u201cFacebook jail\u201d once or twice, typically for something innocuous.\u201d Hateful speech online is undoubtedly a problem, but the solution of making rules about what people can and cannot say has led to the rise of numerous influencers who often target young men online with messages of how they are being censored as part of a broader narrative of how they are being oppressed. Moderation has not solved our problems with online discourse, and while it is essential for a limited set of harms, it has also often made things worse.\n\nNote that this can be true even as, at the same time, moderators do important, heroic work. There are indeed individual pieces of content that are harmful, and that should be removed. The problem is believing that this system can scale to the size of platforms and solve thorny issues like hateful speech or misinformation without an unacceptable amount of bias, mistakes, and controversy.\n\nThe Pivot to Design\n\nMany platforms have long realized the problems inherent in moderation and, in times of crises, have developed \u201cbreak the glass\u201d measures, which are often temporary design changes that reduce the risk in an ecosystem without making judgments about what people can say. They often involve adding more friction, more privacy, or reducing engagement incentives. Some have been adopted permanently, such as the removal of the incentive for commenting and sharing for specific topics or the introduction of greater privacy and reduced engagement-based recommendations within certain topics for teens.\n\nThe announcement that Meta would be changing their approach to political content and discussions of gender is concerning, though it is unclear exactly what those changes are. Given that many product changes regarding those content areas were used in high-risk settings, a change intended to allay US free speech concerns could lead to violence incitement elsewhere. For example, per this post from Meta, reducing \u201ccontent that has been shared by a chain of two or more people\u201d was a content-neutral product change done to protect people in Ethiopia, where algorithms have been implicated in the spread of ethnic violence. A similar change \u2013 removing optimizations for reshared content \u2013 was discussed in this post concerning reductions in political content. Will those changes be undone? Globally? Such changes could also lead to increased amplification of attention getting discussions of gender. Per this report from Equimundo and Futures Without Violence, 40% of young men trust at least one \u201cmanosphere\u201d influencer \u2013 who often exploit algorithmic incentives by posting increasingly extreme, attention-getting mixes of ideas about self-improvement, aggression, and traditional gender roles.\n\nDoes Meta\u2019s change mean that it is going to undo the progress they had made in removing engagement optimization for content areas that they know they are harmful for? Including for youth? We know the harm that arises if people searching for health content get results that are optimized for clicks. If I were a regulator or journalist, these are the questions I\u2019d be focusing on \u2013 not whether a tiny group of fact-checkers would continue their effort to try to police billions of users.\n\nThere are glimmers of hope in regulating algorithmic design. More and more jurisdictions are attempting to regulate algorithms, and both California and New York passed laws last year regulating the use of personal data in algorithms for minors. One positive change happened last week when a court upheld most of California\u2019s law in a nuanced decision that recognized that optimizing for engagement within algorithms is not an exercise in free expression. Since no message is intended to be conveyed by platforms, and the goal is merely to increase the usage of the product, engagement-based algorithms are a product function that is regulatable in the same way that we regulate food and car safety.\n\nMore and more jurisdictions are focusing on product design in 2025, both out of a desire to protect free speech and out of a desire to more robustly protect users from the design decisions that allow a small number of hyper-active online influencers to dominate online discourse and harm both our kids and our democracy. Let\u2019s not get distracted by unwinnable arguments about what content should or should not be allowed online. Instead, let\u2019s focus on the product changes.",

            "content": "Omdia analysis of Sensor Tower data reveals that the Meta Quest mobile companion app downloads fell on Christmas Day 2024 by 27% compared to 2023, despite the launch of the Meta Quest 3S in October. Priced from $300, the Quest 3S is a follow-up to the highly successful Quest 2. There was a palpable hope within the industry that it would reinvigorate VR hardware sales thanks to its attractive price (starting from $300), bundling the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and its enhanced passthrough mixed reality features.\n\nFigure 1: Meta Quest mobile app downloads over the past six years\n\nFigure 1: Meta Quest mobile app downloads over the past six years\n\nTotal 2024 app downloads grew slightly to 7.8 million, but this is still well below 2022\u2019s record of 10.3 million (see Figure 1). December\u2019s total downloads were down by 21% year-on-year. Even with an attractively priced bundle and good awareness for the brand, the Quest 3S struggled to attract new consumers, signaling broader challenges in the VR market (see: Reality check for VR: Omdia forecasts decline as Apple\u2019s entry fails to galvanize market).\n\nWhile not an exact representation of Quest headset sales, Meta Quest app download figures serve as a good barometer, given the mobile app must be downloaded as part of the initial setup of the headset. Sensor Tower does not count re-downloads, app updates, or subsequent downloads on new or additional devices for an existing iOS/Google Play account.\n\nFactors like second-hand sales, upgrades, headset sharing, and non-owners downloading the app to explore the app store muddy the data. Nevertheless, the flat app download figures strongly indicate that Meta is not significantly expanding the Quest's audience beyond its existing user base. This aligns with other indicative data, such as sales figures on Amazon product pages and VR headset components channel data, which similarly point to a plateauing market. Meta\u2019s growing focus on smart glasses signals a shift in strategy, as the company explores alternative form factors that may better appeal to the mass market than VR.\n\nIndicative Amazon data suggests Meta Quest sales underperformed during Black Friday month\n\nAccording to data from Amazon product pages, over 160,000 Quest headsets were sold in November 2024 across eight countries \u2013 down by 16% compared to 2023 (see Figure 2). The Quest 3S accounted for 66% of sales, with the Quest 3 making up the remainder. November typically marks the peak VR sales due to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, during which Meta offered substantial discounts on both Quest 3 and Quest 3S models in all markets. The US site represented 73% of total sales, providing a good indication of the global picture.\n\nQuest 3S struggled to attract new VR users or serve as a compelling upgrade for Quest 2 owners, as its improvements were viewed as incremental. Internally, the Quest 3S is very similar to the Quest 2 and retains its bulkiness, largely due to the ongoing use of Fresnel lenses. A recurring criticism from reviewers and users has been its inferior comfort compared to the Quest 3\u2014which likely stems from Meta\u2019s cost-cutting measures. Further hindering Quest 3S\u2019 appeal is the limited AR content fully leveraging its improved hardware, as well as the compatibility of most Quest Store content with the Quest 2. These factors, combined with VR\u2019s continued inability to appeal to a broader audience beyond existing enthusiasts, dampened demand during the holiday season.\n\nFigure 2: Quest headset sales on Amazon declined 16% YoY during the Black Friday sales month\n\nFigure 2: Quest headset sales on Amazon declined 16% YoY during the Black Friday sales month\n\nThe Meta Quest smartphone app ranking data underlines the seasonal nature of headset sales and their US-centricity\n\nThe Meta Quest iPhone app's recurring appearance in the top 200 free app rankings during the holiday season aligns with the seasonal trend of headset sales, particularly around Christmas when these devices are popular gifts. This pattern also underscores the dominance of the US, Canada, and UK as key markets, where the app reliably breaks into the top 10 and often briefly reaches the number 1 spot on the Christmas Day. In stark contrast, the other three countries\u2014Germany, France, and Australia\u2014hover much further down the rankings, never coming close to the top 10 and barely breaking into the top 50, highlighting a significant gap in market engagement (see Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: iPhone App Store ranking data underlines Meta Quest headsets\u2019 seasonality and prominence in the US\n\nFigure 3: iPhone App Store ranking data underlines Meta Quest headsets\u2019 seasonality and prominence in the US\n\nAlthough the surge in popularity and peak concurrent users engaging in VR games during the holiday period signals some positive interest, the larger issues surrounding the VR category persist. According to Omdia\u2019s Consumer VR Headset and Content Revenue Forecast, headset sales fell by 10% in 2024 to 6.9 million units, while those in active use fell by 8% to 21.9 million. Engagement throughout the year is inconsistent, posing a significant hurdle to Meta's ambition of cultivating a self-sustaining VR ecosystem. Limited compelling new content, developers questioning the ROI of VR projects, and a lack of broader consumer interest are the fundamental challenges that will be difficult to overcome, as long as VR headsets remain in their current form.",

Meta\u2019s changes will permit more dangerous and abusive content on its services and undermine the quality of information available to users. Both of these changes harm the users Meta claims to serve.\n\nWe are shocked and disappointed that Meta did not consult with this group or its members in considering these significant revisions to its content policy. Meta\u2019s failure to engage even its own advisory group of external civil rights experts shows a cynical disregard for its diverse user base and calls into question Meta\u2019s commitment to the free speech principles to which it claims to want to \u201creturn.\u201d\n\nA bad process makes bad policy. In your announcement, you touted Meta\u2019s commitment to free expression, but the changes will significantly harm free speech.\n\nThe new Hateful Conduct policy will now allow far more anti-LGBTQ, racist, anti-immigrant, and ableist content on Meta\u2019s services globally. For example, the policy now permits \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation\u201d in religious and political discourse. This exception applies only to LGBTQ persons, opening them up to discriminatory harassment and degradation. It also introduces into Meta\u2019s policies the malicious trope of so-called \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d a manufactured term used incorrectly to imply that being a trans person is an ideology. Moreover, while it is true that this policy explicitly targets LGBTQ people, LGBTQ people are not the only people affected by it. For people with disabilities, this policy turns their identity into a tool for hate and adds stigma to already highly stigmatized diagnoses and conditions.\n\nThe policy further allows \u201ccall(s) for exclusion or use(s of) insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality.\u201d With the increasing attacks on and dehumanization of LGBTQ and immigrant communities, allowing for calls to exclude these communities from schools or other civic spaces puts these communities at significant risk of harm, online and off.\n\nThese changes are devastating for free expression because they will subject members of protected groups to more attacks, harassment, and harm, driving them off Meta\u2019s services, impoverishing conversations, eliminating points of view, and silencing dissenting and oft-censored voices. Meta has apparently entirely failed to consider the chilling effect of its policy changes\u2014and the result will be more self-censorship, not less.\n\nIn addition to these dangerous policy changes, Meta announced that it will eliminate fact checkers and replace them with a community notes-style system in the United States. Fact-checking is not censorship, and the result of fact-checking on Meta\u2019s services was never censorship. It resulted (rightfully) in the contextual labeling of posts\u2014fostering more speech and debate, not less. Characterizing fact-checking as censorship risks undermining well-sourced journalism, research, and scientific study. Meta is right to seek a trusted system, and community moderation is a useful addition to help achieve that goal. However, Meta should realize that communities are only as well-informed as the information they have access to. Processes for crowd-sourced content annotation must be built to ensure reliability and accuracy. Independent and reliable sources must be part of those processes. Otherwise, the trust Meta claims to seek to build will remain elusive.\n\nIf Meta truly wants to recommit to free speech, it must commit to free speech for everyone on its services.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMeta has joined the chorus of companies reversing course on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and is ending a variety of DEI initiatives, including its supplier diversity program, a company spokesperson confirmed to ESG Dive on Friday.\n\nMeta also cut its DEI team and will end equity and inclusion programs and representation goals, and cease to incorporate the \u201cdiverse slate approach\u201d in its hiring processes, according to changes first reported Friday by Axios . The company\u2019s web page outlining its diversity practices is no longer active.\n\nThe tech and social media conglomerate made the changes the same week it announced it would end its third-party fact-checker program , as it broadly looks to step away from corporate policies that may put it in the crosshairs of a Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMeta\u2019s shifting position on DEI comes amid changing political headwinds in the U.S., which have led to a number of corporations shuttering or rolling back DEI initiatives after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. The tech industry has not been immune; Microsoft cut several diversity roles last year, and Amazon will reportedly also halt some DEI programs, CNBC reported Friday.\n\nMeta Vice President of Human Resources Janelle Gale reportedly announced the moves in an internal employee memo, attributing the policy revisions to the changing \u201clegal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States,\u201d per Axios.\n\nGale reportedly told employees that the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action decision signals \u201ca shift in how courts will approach DEI\u201d and \u201cthe term 'DEI' has also become charged.\u201d\n\nCutting DEI programs represents a reverse in public tone for a company that lists diversity, equity and inclusion as a priority of critical importance to both stakeholders and its business, according to Meta\u2019s responsible business practices company page.\n\nMeta previously reported on DEI metrics and said in its 2023 Responsible Business Report that it wanted to \u201cbuild a workforce where employees from every background and with a wide range of experiences and perspectives, are seen, valued and heard.\u201d\n\nHowever, the tech giant \u2014 which owns platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 cut a significant portion of its DEI staff the same year, including personnel that were in charge of hiring underrepresented people, per a CNBC report. At the time, the company also laid off nearly every member of its Sourcer Development Program, which aimed to equip employees from diverse backgrounds with the skills needed for corporate technology recruiting.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2023 report also included updates to its supplier diversity program, which it launched in 2016, according to a 2018 blog post. The responsible business report said the program \u201cembodies who [Meta] aspire[s] to be as a company that provides equitable opportunity for all.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to supplier spend by race and ethnicity, the company did make some progress in choosing more diverse suppliers. The 2023 program update found that 80% of Meta\u2019s supply spend went to Asian suppliers, up 39% from 2021. However, 6% of the company\u2019s supply spend went to White suppliers and 5% went to Black suppliers; down 15% and 19%, respectively, from 2021. Latino or Hispanic-owned suppliers represented 2% of Meta\u2019s spend in 2023, down 3% from 2021, according to the report.\n\nThe supplier diversity program\u2019s original announcement is no longer available on Meta\u2019s website.\n\nLast year saw a wave of DEI rollbacks across industries. The list of high-profile U.S. companies that eliminated DEI programs, roles or shifting strategies includes Tractor Supply, Harley Davidson, the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s, Ford, Molson Coors, Lowe\u2019s and Walmart.\n\nThat trend has continued into 2025, with McDonald\u2019s beginning the year by announcing a shift to \u201cglobal inclusion.\u201d",

It also will eliminate some content policies on such volatile issues as immigration and gender. Zuckerberg said the changes would mean the company would \u201ccatch less bad stuff\u201d but reduce the number of \u201cinnocent people\u2019s posts and accounts\u201d that are taken down.\n\nRenee Hobbs, URI professor of communication studies and founder and director of the Media Education Lab. (URI Photo)\n\nHe characterized the move as Meta returning to \u201cour roots around free expression\u201d and noted a shift in the country\u2019s political and social landscape evidenced by the election of former President Donald Trump.\n\nRhody Today asked URI professor Renee Hobbs, an internationally recognized authority on media literacy education, for her views on Meta\u2019s announcement. She is the founder and director of the Media Education Lab, which aims to improve the quality of media literacy education through research and community service, and is the founding co-editor of the Journal of Media Literacy Education, an open-access, peer-reviewed journal for the global media education community.\n\nMeta had initially put together a rigorous fact-checking system that was launched on Facebook in 2016. Does this shift in policy come as a surprise?\n\nNot at all. Mark Zuckerberg has been signaling this shift for some time, and it\u2019s clear that the company\u2019s approach to content moderation was flawed and imperfect in many ways.\n\nMeta\u2019s business model is centered on the attention economy, and the company has long understood how the activation of strong emotions drives revenue. Over the past 10 years, the company has had to adapt to the changing ways that social media has been used to inform, entertain, and persuade, as propaganda and disinformation became a growth industry with the rise of state actors in Russia and China, as well as homegrown conflict entrepreneurs, who found it quite profitable to stir up anger and hate.\n\nDisinformation is now a game played for fun and profit by people all over the world\u2014including some of our local neighbors right here in Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel drove this decision?\n\nThe presidency of Donald Trump is a major reason for the shift because Trump has signaled his willingness to enact regulatory vengeance against Big Tech for their support of Democratic politicians. If Congress decides to modify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, they could remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d protections that tech platforms now have which limit legal action against them for conveying harmful or defamatory content.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Facebook tagline on X.com now reads: \u201cWe believe people can do more together than alone and that each of us plays an important role in helping to create this safe and respectful community.\u201d\n\nWhat are the pros and cons for users and social media in general?\n\nMost people are unaware of how content is currently moderated on social media platforms or how their own behavior\u2014in the form of likes, clicks, and shares\u2014influences the content that is shown to them. Some users will notice no difference as content moderation is removed. But when people encounter content they do not wish to see, it may affect their use of the platform. For example, I stopped using Twitter after my feed began to include pornographic video clips. I decided to stop using X, and I migrated to BlueSky, another social media platform, where content moderation is more robust.\n\nSocial media platforms are used by many people as their primary news source. Given this ability to influence so many, should social media platforms be held to a \u201chigher standard\u201d where verified truth and facts outweigh so-called free speech?\n\nAbsolutely not. The framers of the Constitution would have been strongly opposed to any kind of hierarchy that set up \u201cverified truths.\u201d The Enlightenment thinkers recognized that no one individual or group has access to \u201cCapital T Truth,\u201d and that people actually need the widest possible marketplace of information\u2014including truths, fictions, satires, opinions, and even false and ugly stuff\u2014in order to engage in the practice of genuine discernment. This core value is at the heart of the university, too. Everyone is a seeker of truth.\n\nThis kind of discernment, which we now call media literacy for citizenship, is something that must be done by citizens themselves\u2014it can\u2019t be outsourced.\n\nWhat has been the response by scholars who study social media?\n\nSome people think that citizens don\u2019t have the motivation or skills to engage in discernment, and these people make astute observations about how vulnerable we are to demagogues and propagandists. Perhaps we enjoy disinformation for its entertainment value more than we respect information for its truth value.\n\n\n\nHow does Meta\u2019s removal of fact-checking affect the ability to find reliable sources on the internet?\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to engage in fact-checking is influenced now by artificial intelligence and algorithms. Social media platforms are a manifestation of the town square, and the right to free speech is important to the practice of democracy. For most of human history, when people acted outrageously in public, a community would turn on \u201cthe mutter brigade\u201d and use public shaming to inspire people to cease their troublesome behavior. The manifestation of so-called \u201ccancel culture\u201d was an example of this.\n\nMeta is now counting on the public to \u201ckeep Facebook clean.\u201d That\u2019s possibly a good thing because, after all, it was indeed dangerous to have one or three big companies as the arbiters of truth. When everyone trusted The New York Times, back in the day, it might have been easier, but with the rise of political polarization, Meta no longer has much \u201cbackup support\u201d from mainstream news organizations or neutral third-party fact-checkers whose work is widely respected by all.\n\nIn media literacy we say, \u201cAll media messages are selective and incomplete\u2014they all have a point of view.\u201d This puts the burden of responsibility in the hands of consumers.",

            "content": "This is just a sneak peek at the thousands of consumer insights available to CivicScience clients. Discover more data.\n\nIt is a pivotal time for the social media landscape. American users have flocked from one platform and will soon be forced off another. One key focus amid these drastic changes in the world of social media is how platforms manage misinformation and political content, particularly as social media\u2019s role in news consumption is expanding. Last week, Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, heightened that focus by announcing it was discontinuing third-party fact-checking and scaling back political content moderation.\n\nHow are consumers reacting to these significant policy changes by Meta as its platforms are poised to benefit from the looming TikTok ban? CivicScience has fresh data on the topic:\n\nAmericans Are Largely Split, But Meta Finds Strong Support Among Gen Z\n\nData following the Meta announcement finds respondents are fairly divided in terms of support levels. Just over one-third (36%) say they support Meta\u2019s move toward community-driven fact-checking and the loosening of political content moderation, slightly outpacing those who oppose it (32%, among those aware of the changes). Support is strongest among Gen Z aged 18-24 at 53%, whereas 47% of those 55+ are against the changes.\n\nMeta users are also split on whether the policy changes will affect their platform use: 19% say they\u2019re more likely to use Meta compared to 25% who are now less likely to use a Meta platform. Political divides are sharp, with Republicans more than twice as likely as Democrats to report an increased likelihood of using Meta post-policy changes.\n\nWeigh in: How important is fact-checking to you?\n\nWhy Does it Matter?\n\nHow Americans get their news and who they trust to \u2018deliver unbiased news\u2019 is shifting. The latest tracking data show trust in social media as a source of unbiased news has risen by eight percentage points over the past five years, even as trust in most other sources has slowed or dropped. While social media still has a ways to go to surpass local and broadcast news, if post-2024 election trends continue, it\u2019s plausible that social media could overtake cable network news in the near future. Meta\u2019s policy shifts could serve as a litmus test to see whether this trend of rising trust in social media endures.\n\nThe Platforms Users Trust Most\n\nA deeper dive into specific platforms social media users say they trust reveals a clear leader: YouTube. Facebook, and X follow distantly behind while other major platforms lag significantly when it comes to perceived trustworthiness.\n\nTrust in Facebook and Bluesky appears to increase with age, while Gen Z and Millennials are more likely to find video-focused platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, to be most trustworthy. Gen Xers, meanwhile are by far the most likely to trust X and are the least likely to trust YouTube.\n\nJoin the Conversation: To what extent do you tend to trust the information you see on social media?\n\nMeta\u2019s policy shifts highlight the delicate balance between fostering free expression and maintaining user trust in an increasingly polarized digital landscape. As generational and political divisions emerge, the response to these changes could signal how social media\u2019s role in news consumption evolves moving forward.\n\nInterested in leveraging CivicScience\u2019s data to drive audience engagement and unlock valuable insights for your media initiatives?",

            "content": "Much ink is being spilled over Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s January 7 announcement and a related statement by executive Joel Kaplan about the company replacing its platforms\u2019 prior content-moderation efforts with a more laissez-faire, free-speech-friendly approach. The changes likely were influenced by not only a desire to please incoming President Donald Trump but also the outgoing Biden administration\u2019s efforts to squelch content that conflicted with its preferred narratives.\n\nChanges. Meta is jettisoning third-party fact checking on its US platforms and \u201callow[ing] more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing [its] enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations.\u201d Zuckerberg explained that past content-moderation efforts relied on \u201ccomplex systems,\u201d including scanning filters and humans, that made \u201ctoo many mistakes,\u201d resulting in \u201ctoo much censorship.\u201d In short, excessive false positives unnecessarily silenced viewpoints.\n\nVia Adobe Stock.\n\nZuckerberg averred that Meta\u2019s fact checkers \u201cdestroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created, especially in the US,\u201d by being \u201ctoo politically biased.\u201d To regain trust, Meta is moving its trust-and-safety and content-moderation teams from blue state California to red state Texas where there will be \u201cless concern about the bias of our teams.\u201d\n\nIn revamping Meta\u2019s practices, Zuckerberg nodded to Trump\u2019s November victory, stating that \u201cthe recent elections . . . feel like a cultural tipping point toward once again prioritizing speech.\u201d In turn, Meta will now \u201cfocus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms.\u201d Zuckerberg added that \u201cwhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas.\u201d The company now prioritizes \u201cgiving people [a] voice\u201d and letting them receive more political content in their feeds.\n\nMeta will concentrate its censorship efforts on \u201cterrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud, and scams\u201d and rely on a community notes system similar to that used by X for addressing false and misleading posts. The notes system, to be phased in over the coming months, will add contextual comments \u201cwritten and rated by contributing users.\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged the changes will cause a tradeoff between \u201cdramatically reducing the amount of censorship on our platforms\u201d and \u201ccatching less bad stuff.\u201d In sum, Meta will err on the side of free speech, even if some of it is false or offensive.\n\nReaction and Jawboning. Timing, as the clich\u00e9 goes, is everything. The timing of Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement\u2014shortly before Donald Trump retakes the White House and following a Thanksgiving meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago\u2014raised criticisms and questions about whether Meta\u2019s changes are simply transparent efforts to appease the incoming president at the cost of \u201copen[ing] the floodgates of misinformation and hate speech on Facebook.\u201d New York Times technology columnist Kevin Roose dubbed Meta\u2019s moves \u201ca full MAGA makeover,\u201d while deriding Meta for \u201cadopt[ing] whatever values Zuckerberg thinks it needs to survive.\u201d\n\nSome of this may have merit, but as The New York Times reported in a subsequent story, Zuckerberg:\n\nalso felt railroaded by what he views as the Biden administration\u2019s anti-tech posturing, and stung by what he sees as progressives in the media and in Silicon Valley\u2014including in Meta\u2019s work force\u2014pushing him to take a heavy hand in policing discourse.\n\nIndeed, the Biden administration placed a bullseye on Facebook, pressuring it to remove or bury conservative-tilting content that questioned COVID-19 vaccines, mask mandates, and the necessity of shutting down businesses and closing schools during the pandemic. Such jawboning was front-and-center in the 2024 US Supreme Court case of Murthy v. Missouri. Although the Court punted on the substantive merits of whether the Biden administration\u2019s verbal arm twisting crossed the blurry line separating permissible persuasion from unlawful coercion, Zuckerberg telegraphed that he\u2019d had enough just two months later in a letter to US Representative Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nZuckerberg there described how \u201csenior officials from the Biden administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn\u2019t agree.\u201d He asserted that such \u201cgovernment pressure was wrong\u201d and regretted \u201cthat we were not more outspoken about it.\u201d\n\nI explained earlier that Zuckerberg\u2019s statements to Jordan wouldn\u2019t have helped the plaintiffs\u2019 case in Murthy if he\u2019d made them before the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. That\u2019s because Zuckerberg never used critical words like \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cthreat of adverse consequences\u201d that are the hallmarks of unlawful jawboning. Nonetheless, the letter suggested Meta would no longer bow to censorial pressure.\n\nThe Newtonian takeaway here is straightforward: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When liberals and the government play their paternalistic, cancel-dissenting-speech card too hard, corporate America pushes back when the winds of political fortune inevitably shift.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMeta has joined the chorus of companies reversing course on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and is ending a variety of DEI initiatives, including its supplier diversity program, a company spokesperson confirmed to ESG Dive on Friday.\n\nMeta also cut its DEI team and will end equity and inclusion programs and representation goals, and cease to incorporate the \u201cdiverse slate approach\u201d in its hiring processes, according to changes first reported Friday by Axios . The company\u2019s web page outlining its diversity practices is no longer active.\n\nThe tech and social media conglomerate made the changes the same week it announced it would end its third-party fact-checker program , as it broadly looks to step away from corporate policies that may put it in the crosshairs of a Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMeta\u2019s shifting position on DEI comes amid changing political headwinds in the U.S., which have led to a number of corporations shuttering or rolling back DEI initiatives after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. The tech industry has not been immune; Microsoft cut several diversity roles last year, and Amazon will reportedly also halt some DEI programs, CNBC reported Friday.\n\nMeta Vice President of Human Resources Janelle Gale reportedly announced the moves in an internal employee memo, attributing the policy revisions to the changing \u201clegal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States,\u201d per Axios.\n\nGale reportedly told employees that the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action decision signals \u201ca shift in how courts will approach DEI\u201d and \u201cthe term 'DEI' has also become charged.\u201d\n\nCutting DEI programs represents a reverse in public tone for a company that lists diversity, equity and inclusion as a priority of critical importance to both stakeholders and its business, according to Meta\u2019s responsible business practices company page.\n\nMeta previously reported on DEI metrics and said in its 2023 Responsible Business Report that it wanted to \u201cbuild a workforce where employees from every background and with a wide range of experiences and perspectives, are seen, valued and heard.\u201d\n\nHowever, the tech giant \u2014 which owns platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 cut a significant portion of its DEI staff the same year, including personnel that were in charge of hiring underrepresented people, per a CNBC report. At the time, the company also laid off nearly every member of its Sourcer Development Program, which aimed to equip employees from diverse backgrounds with the skills needed for corporate technology recruiting.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2023 report also included updates to its supplier diversity program, which it launched in 2016, according to a 2018 blog post. The responsible business report said the program \u201cembodies who [Meta] aspire[s] to be as a company that provides equitable opportunity for all.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to supplier spend by race and ethnicity, the company did make some progress in choosing more diverse suppliers. The 2023 program update found that 80% of Meta\u2019s supply spend went to Asian suppliers, up 39% from 2021. However, 6% of the company\u2019s supply spend went to White suppliers and 5% went to Black suppliers; down 15% and 19%, respectively, from 2021. Latino or Hispanic-owned suppliers represented 2% of Meta\u2019s spend in 2023, down 3% from 2021, according to the report.\n\nThe supplier diversity program\u2019s original announcement is no longer available on Meta\u2019s website.\n\nLast year saw a wave of DEI rollbacks across industries. The list of high-profile U.S. companies that eliminated DEI programs, roles or shifting strategies includes Tractor Supply, Harley Davidson, the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s, Ford, Molson Coors, Lowe\u2019s and Walmart.\n\nThat trend has continued into 2025, with McDonald\u2019s beginning the year by announcing a shift to \u201cglobal inclusion.\u201d\n\nThe federal leadership transition has also made climate alliances unpopular ahead of the presidential transition.\n\nSix major U.S. banks have left the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance in the past month, and BlackRock confirmed to ESG Dive Friday it left the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative.",

            "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dramatically steered the company to the right ahead of the inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump with a series of policy and practice changes in the last week that have left some employees, users and interest groups up in arms.\n\nZuckerberg said some of the changes to Meta\u2019s fact-checking and moderation systems were meant to curb censorship and protect free speech on its platforms, including Instagram and Facebook, but the scale of the changes goes far beyond social media moderation, reportedly touching on Meta\u2019s internal policies around its bathrooms and its board and on optional aesthetic theming it previously deployed on one of its platforms to celebrate trans people.\n\nThese are all of the changes Meta has rolled out in the last week.\n\nCommunity Notes instead of third-party fact-checkers\n\nLast Tuesday, Meta announced it was scrapping its old fact-checking system and replacing it with a system similar to X\u2019s Community Notes that will be rolled out in the next couple of months, starting in the United States.\n\nMeta\u2019s fact-checking system, which was introduced in 2016, worked by running some information on its platforms by certified third-party fact-checkers who would identify posts that appeared to be misinformation. However, Zuckerberg said, the fact-checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created.\u201d\n\nUnder the new Community Notes system, users will be able to write and rate notes that can be added onto posts, which can provide additional context that may be missing from the originals. In a news release announcing the changes, Meta said that for a note to pop up, it will \u201crequire agreement between people with a range of perspectives\u201d to help combat potential bias.\n\nRepublicans have often expressed support for X\u2019s Community Notes system; many previously criticized Meta\u2019s fact-checking system over their belief that it disproportionately targets right-wing content. Research has told a different story, however, suggesting that conservatives are prone to sharing more misinformation, which in turn attracts moderation actions. Those who oppose Meta\u2019s changes fear that they will allow misinformation to run rampant on its platforms.\n\nZuckerberg explained in a video on Facebook that Meta would also change its enforcement policies, saying the previous system\u2019s flaws accounted for the \u201cvast majority of censorship\u201d on its platforms. He said that the new filtering system would specifically target illegal and \u201chigh severity\u201d violations and that \u201clower severity violations\u201d would be addressed through the new Community Notes system, with users needing to proactively report when posts may lack context or may have misinformation.\n\nThe announcement has received a mixed response.\n\nMany Meta employees have expressed apprehension about the decision to end third-party fact-checking. An employee wrote on Workplace, the company\u2019s internal communications tool, about being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the decision, adding that it seemed that Meta was \u201csending a bigger, stronger message to people that facts no longer matter, and conflating that with a victory for free speech.\u201d\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva called the decision \u201cextremely serious,\u201d and the country\u2019s attorney general has said it could take \u201clegal and judicial measures\u201d against Meta if it doesn\u2019t explain its new fact-checking measures.\n\nMany right-wing figures have applauded the new system. Fox News reporter Brooke Singman reported that Trump reacted by saying Meta has \u201ccome a long way.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk similarly praised the changes, writing \u201cThis is cool\u201d on X.\n\nMore political content\n\nIn the video posted last Tuesday, Zuckerberg said Meta is looking to welcome political discourse back on Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing back civic content,\u201d Zuckerberg said in the video. \u201cFor a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed, so we stopped recommending these posts. But it feels like we\u2019re in a new era now, and we\u2019re starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again.\u201d\n\nHe added that the recent election has had a major influence on the company\u2019s decision to change its fact-checking system and work toward \u201cprioritizing speech.\u201d He also added that it plans to work closely with Trump\u2019s upcoming administration to \u201cpush back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the U.S. government, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so difficult over the past four years, when even the U.S. government has pushed for censorship,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn 2021, before Meta began reducing its political content, a study from the Brookings Institution found that often, conservative-leaning podcasters sharing \u201cfalse and misleading content\u201d could reach more than 28 million combined followers on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nLoosening rules around anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and an end to Meta\u2019s diversity programs\n\nMeta notified its employees Friday through an internal communications forum that it would end many of its programs aimed at hiring diverse candidates, including disbanding its diversity, equity and inclusion team and getting rid of its \u201cDiverse Slate Approach\u201d in its hiring process.\n\nThe New York Times also reported that two Meta employees said Meta\u2019s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas and New York were instructed to remove tampons from their men\u2019s restrooms, which had been made available for the company\u2019s nonbinary and transgender employees.\n\n404 Media reported that Meta had deleted nonbinary and transgender themes from its Messenger app. The app\u2019s \u201cthemes\u201d feature allows users to change the designs and colors of their chats, with the \u201ctrans\u201d and \u201cnonbinary\u201d themes featuring the colors of each of the transgender and nonbinary flags. Meta had introduced the two themes in celebration of Pride Month, rolling out the trans theme in June 2021 and the nonbinary theme the next year.\n\nMeta also updated its \u201cHateful Conduct\u201d policy, which now allows for posts that call LGBTQ people mentally ill.\n\n\u201cWe do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like \u2018weird,\u2019\u201d the policy reads.\n\nUnder the Hateful Conduct policy, users can post about \u201cgender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs,\u201d as well as use \u201csex- or gender-exclusive language\u201d in describing \u201caccess to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said in the video posted to Facebook that Meta would be \u201csimplifying content policies\u201d in regard to topics such as gender and immigration.\n\n\u201cWhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it\u2019s gone too far,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, similarly told Fox News that its previous system was \u201ctoo restrictive\u201d when it came to \u201csensitive topics like immigration, trans issues and gender.\u201d\n\nHigh-profile departures and new hires\n\nFormer U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced that he would step down as Meta\u2019s president of global affairs this month after almost seven years. Kaplan, a Republican who was White House deputy chief of staff, has stepped into the position.\n\nThe CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, Dana White, a longtime Trump ally, is also joining Meta\u2019s board of directors, alongside John Elkann, CEO of the Italian auto holding company Exor, and Microsoft\u2019s former head of strategy Charlie Songhurst.\n\nIn a Meta news release, White said he hadn\u2019t been \u201cinterested in joining a board of directors\u201d until he was offered a spot on Meta\u2019s board. 404 Media reported that Meta\u2019s employees reacted to the announcement of his addition with criticism and jokes on Workplace, which the company\u2019s Internal Community Relations team took down, deeming that the posts violated the company\u2019s \u201cCommunity Engagement Expectations.\u201d\n\nThe day Meta announced it would end its diversity programs, its vice president for civil rights and deputy general counsel, Roy Austin, announced on Facebook that he would step down.\n\nJobs in a red state\n\nZuckerberg also said Meta\u2019s trust and safety and content moderation teams would move from California to Texas.\n\n\u201cAs we work to promote free expression, I think that will help build trust to do this work in places where there\u2019s less concern about the bias of our teams,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the announcement, former Meta employees wrote on the social media platform Bluesky and Meta\u2019s own platform Threads that Meta already had trust and safety moderation teams working in Austin, Texas.\n\nMusk similarly moved SpaceX\u2019s and X\u2019s headquarters from California to Texas in July. The same month, the U.S. Supreme Court returned to a lower court a case that questioned the constitutionality of the Texas and Florida laws that sought to regulate social media companies\u2019 content moderation practices.",

            "content": "Headlines have framed decision to eliminate third-party fact-checking as a concession to President-elect Donald Trump. In actuality, the move reflects a hard truth: Social media platforms aren\u2019t well-positioned to combat misinformation\u2014and such efforts can be counterproductive.\n\nThat was the central finding of a working paper released last year by Harvard Business School professors Scott Duke Kominers and Jesse M. Shapiro. Kominers and Shapiro say Meta\u2019s decision could increase transparency and free resources to address other forms of content that the platform can police more effectively.\n\nWorking Knowledge talked to Kominers, the Sarofim-Rock Professor of Business Administration, and Shapiro, the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration, about how Meta\u2019s decision might affect companies, technology, and society more broadly. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat do you think about Meta\u2019s decision?\n\nJesse Shapiro: There are aspects of content moderation that are very reasonable and my guess is that they will persist. These involve situations where removing information clearly limits the potential for something really bad to happen.\n\nSo if I were to go on social media and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t like one of Scott\u2019s papers. If you agree with me, here\u2019s where he lives, so you can go find him and complain to his face.\u201d Obviously, that could go very badly, and taking Scott\u2019s address out of that comment would limit the potential for harm.\n\nBut there are other kinds of situations where I think the platforms have been trying to fight a losing battle. Let\u2019s say I go online and say, \u201cI think genetically modified foods are really harmful\u201d even though maybe there\u2019s some scientific consensus that that\u2019s not true. Platforms might try to flag that content and point to third-party scientific sources, but I\u2019m skeptical that doing that will improve outcomes.\n\nAnd there are a lot of ways in which it can make things worse. Different people have different notions of who\u2019s trustworthy as a source. One person\u2019s objective third party is another person\u2019s \u201cgroup in cahoots with Big Food or Big Pharma.\u201d By appearing to take sides, the platforms might make some users think they are actively promoting one view or another.\n\nScott Duke Kominers: Our research highlights the distinction between two different types of information.\n\nThere\u2019s information that creates harm by changing or affecting people\u2019s beliefs. But if people don\u2019t trust the moderation process, then you can\u2019t necessarily ensure that your moderation is going to make them believe what you want them to believe.\n\nBy contrast, if the actual harm is from the information itself\u2014through doxxing people\u2019s addresses, for example, or hate speech\u2014blocking the information stops the harm immediately. Those direct harms often have more concrete definitions and are easier to detect.\n\nPlatforms are much better positioned to detect and respond directly to content that is either directly harmful or enables direct harm. They\u2019re very poorly positioned to deal with content that creates harm through effects on people\u2019s beliefs.\n\nCould X\u2019s moderation approach be potentially more effective?\n\nShapiro: This is something we want to look into more. But, intuitively, I think there\u2019s something smart about trying to leverage peer-to-peer trust in in designing some of these systems.\n\nKominers: What the community notes mechanism does is find information that lots of different groups of people agree on, especially ones who often disagree. If you can find something that many different groups agree is true all at once, then it\u2019s more likely that someone in any given group agrees on it as well.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear this is the optimal mechanism, but it\u2019s intuitive why this would help a little bit with the trust problem we described [above].\n\nShapiro: But precisely how effective it is, what might make it work better\u2014these are interesting questions for future research.\n\nCould Meta\u2019s change encourage more harmful content?\n\nShapiro: I don\u2019t think we know exactly what this will mean on the ground, but one of the more prominent parts of this announcement focused on pockets of content where the company had decided to invest in figuring out what was true and then put up flags and point people to correct information. Things like election misinformation and vaccine misinformation are pretty different from hate speech, inciting violence, and facilitating criminal activity, which I imagine that platforms will continue to contend with in one way or another.\n\nKominers: Indeed, it\u2019s hard to know for sure, but I would hope that this frees up more resources and focus to police directly harmful content.\n\nIs there a role for artificial intelligence?\n\nKominers: Absolutely, and this is how a lot of early-stage content filtration systems work. They use algorithms to try and identify things that are likely to be harmful, and then propagate them to human moderators (or even filter them immediately and just use humans as a backstop against errors). The wave of new, more human-interpretable AI models\u2014as well as AI models that can do abstraction, especially around text and images\u2014gives them more power to try to quickly identify and respond to harmful content.\n\nShapiro: I agree with all of that. The other side of the coin, though, is that AI also enables more creative ways to get around some of these filters. If you want to sell drugs on an online marketplace\u2014and you\u2019re not supposed to\u2014there may be ways to use AI to disguise images. There\u2019s a bit of a cat and mouse game there, just like we saw in earlier times with say, spam filters. Some of the time, the filters are winning, and some of the time, it feels like the spam is winning.\n\nWill brands change how they manage online discourse?\n\nShapiro: The move away from fact-checking shows that companies can\u2019t count on social media platforms to be central arbiters of the truth. And companies need to recognize that there will be different views of what\u2019s true, and that\u2019s the environment we need to live with. Hoping that some regulator or tech platform will come in and sweep all that away is a vain hope. That\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nKominers: Companies have to understand that policing people\u2019s views at the platform level is an unsolvable problem. And that puts more weight and importance on the company\u2019s own messaging and brand management.\n\nWill there be any ripple effects for society?\n\nKominers: It\u2019s hard to know what the long-run equilibrium is, but in these types of contexts where there are wide ranges in what people believe coming in, and whether they trust the platform, there was already a lot of misinformation floating around, and, as our research shows, there wasn\u2019t really a way to stop it. The platform\u2019s attempts to stop it, if anything, could have been making it worse.\n\nOne could even imagine hypothetically that the impact of the change could go in the other direction: Once people know that the platform is not trying to fact-check, they invest more time and energy in figuring out how to curate their networks and how to interpret and process the information they\u2019re seeing from them. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, to be clear\u2014just that even the direction of the long-run impact isn\u2019t necessarily apparent.\n\nShapiro: I would just add that some of the tensions in society are precisely about who knows what\u2019s best. Creating the impression that there\u2019s a bunch of very rich, powerful people in Silicon Valley who work with nonprofits to tell you what\u2019s true, and if you say something they don\u2019t agree with, they put a flag in front of it or a big, red symbol around it saying that it\u2019s baloney\u2014that can easily be counterproductive.\n\nWhat does this say about social media companies?\n\nShapiro: Meta started off as a social site for college students. It evolved into a place where everybody could share pictures of how much fun they\u2019re having on their birthday. And then somewhat by accident it became a very central part of where people get news and political information.\n\nPart of what we\u2019ve seen as the company has moved from one policy to another over time is trying to figure out how you operate as a private actor in that role. I think this announcement is this company and, to some extent, the broader industry realizing that there\u2019s a role here that other people would like them to take\u2014the role of policing truth on the internet\u2014which they simply cannot do. There was a lot of pressure for them to step into that role for a long time.\n\nKominers: These platforms have become a key part of global information infrastructure, and once you are global information infrastructure, you\u2019re being exposed to all types of people with all types of beliefs. And so it makes establishing trust incredibly difficult and, conversely, means that transparency and clarity are really valuable for at least helping people understand what they\u2019re getting out of the system.\n\nThis is partially toward my bias of thinking a lot about decentralized platforms and ecosystems, but I think there\u2019s value to the idea of social media as protocols rather than platforms. There\u2019s a new wave of social media platforms that are trying to experiment with storing all of the information in an open, publicly accessible protocol that lets people develop their own feed algorithms and content filtration and aggregation systems, to give many different windows into the same information.\n\nShapiro: Maybe it\u2019s a somewhat imperfect analogy, but if we think about the days of landlines or even my cell phone today, nobody thought it was a good idea for to try to come into the middle of your phone call and say, \u201cActually, what you just said is not true. You said this thing about the US economy or public policy or public health that\u2019s false.\u201d Obviously, it wasn\u2019t feasible, technologically. But it\u2019s also not an effective way to organize information in a society.\n\nWhere do you plan to take this research?\n\nShapiro: One concrete thing is to try to understand whether things like community notes, these more peer-to-peer methods of evaluating claims, are likely to be effective. And how could they be more effective? Under what conditions are they likely to be most useful?\n\nAlso probing some of the fundamental limits: How much of this issue is technology that we can make better, maybe with AI, versus how much is deeper and, no matter what technologies we have, we won\u2019t really be able to solve it.\n\nKominers: There\u2019s also a question of how individual-level authentication and certification can interact with this. So in a world where we\u2019re worried about deep-fake videos becoming very easy to produce, I\u2019ve been very interested in questions like: How can we develop technologies that allow an individual to certify content that they\u2019ve created?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like providing a micro source of truth that\u2019s relevant for interpreting a particular piece of information. So rather than trying to find the top-down global solution to what is true, use technology to inject critical pieces of verifiably true information along the way.\n\n\n\nDisclosures: Kominers is a Research Partner at a16z crypto, which is an investor in various online platforms, including social media platforms (for general a16z disclosures, see https://www.a16z.com/disclosures/).

            "content": "Community Notes is coming to Facebook and Instagram, replacing third-party fact-checks with crowdsourced insights into potentially misleading or false content.\n\nAnd while the official rollout of Meta\u2019s Community Notes is still a few months away, we already have some insight into how it works, via Meta\u2019s official announcements.\n\nFacebook, Threads and Instagram have also all added a new overview of the option within their respective Help sites, providing more pointers on the coming functionality.\n\nAs you can see in this example, posted by app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, Instagram\u2019s overview of Community Notes will be linked to notes that are posted to the app.\n\nAs explained by Instagram:\n\n\u201cSoon we'll be introducing a new feature called Community Notes. It will allow people across a diverse range of perspectives to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context.\n\nHow it works\n\nIf you see a post that might be inaccurate or confusing, you can write a note with background info, a tip or an insight people might find useful. Your note may get published on the post if it's rated helpful.\n\nLearn more\n\nJoin the waitlist to be notified if you're eligible to join the program once it's available.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s version of Community Notes will function in the same way that notes already work on X, with a group of approved contributors empowered to review and assess suggested notes, which will then see them displayed, or not, to users.\n\nAnd just like Community Notes on X, Meta\u2019s post notes will be displayed based on contributor consensus, and importantly, will require agreement from notes contributors of opposing political perspectives to meet the threshold for display.\n\nWhich has been a key flaw of the program on X, in that people of opposing political stances are simply never going to agree on some things.\n\nThis chart displays the claims in posts that have been most commonly Community Noted on X, but those notes have not been displayed due to lack of agreement between contributors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, research conducted by The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that notes on divisive political issues, like vote tampering, don\u2019t ever reach cross-political agreement, and thus, they\u2019re not displayed in the app.\n\nAnd that actually means that the majority of political misinformation is not flagged at all via this process.\n\nAs per the CCDH:\n\n\u201cWe found that 209 out of the 283 misleading posts in our sample [related to the U.S. election] had accurate Community Notes that are not being shown to all X users, equivalent to 74%. We rated notes as \u201caccurate\u201d where they align with independent fact-checks, cite reputable sources and explain why their attached post is misleading.\u201d\n\nSo while the variable of cross-political agreement makes sense in principle, and will ensure that notes are not used as a censorship tool to combat opposing claims, there is a flaw here, which is clearly impacting the effectiveness of notes in this critical area.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Community Notes is a bad option overall, as there have been various studies that also highlight the benefits, and effectiveness of the program.\n\nIndeed, a review of 285,000 Community Notes conducted last year found that the appearance of a note on a post reduces the number of retweets by almost half, while they also increase the probability that a post is deleted by its creator by 80%. Another study found that Community Notes have helped to counter false health information in popular posts about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThere are clear benefits to adding crowdsourced notes, while it also reduces the moderation burden on the platform itself. But if the previous Trump administration is anything to go by, we are going to be confronted with many more false claims over the next four years, and the fact that Meta\u2019s building in this cross-political consensus element, while also eliminating any other form of fact-checking, seems potentially problematic.\n\nThere have also been questions about the speed of Community Notes, and the effectiveness of such if they\u2019re shown well behind time.\n\nMost of the damage of such claims is often done early on, when a claim is re-shared and reposted, with viral spread enabling falsehoods to be disseminated at rapid rates. Yet, that same issue is also inherent in third-party fact-checking too, as it takes time to conduct manual review of highlighted posts. So while Meta should maintain a level of rapid detection and assessment of potentially misleading claims, the speed issue is less of a factor in comparing these two approaches.\n\nBut there is a concern in relation to the broader usage of Meta\u2019s apps, and the limits of Community Notes to be able to handle false claims adequately. X has 570 million users and has taken around two years to build a network of over 500k Community Notes contributors.\n\nMeta has over 3 billion users across its apps, which, by comparison, would suggest that it may need a network of around 2.5 million Community Notes contributors to make this an effective, scalable option.\n\nThat\u2019ll take time to build, and to get good contributors up to speed. Meta will also have to filter out bad actors who\u2019ll look to infiltrate the Community Notes contributor network to down rank notes that don\u2019t align with their own objectives.\n\nEssentially, this is a massive task, and it\u2019ll take time for Meta to implement effectively. Which is why it\u2019s somewhat surprising that Meta\u2019s planning to launch its version of Community Notes by March, while the noted flaws will mean that this is not a replacement for third-party fact checks for some time yet.\n\nIf ever.\n\nMeta has repeatedly praised the effectiveness of its fact-checking process, with its own data showing that posts and articles rated as false through this system see their views reduced by over 80%. Even more, academic studies have shown that fact-checks significantly reduce false beliefs.\n\nSo while Meta\u2019s wasting no time in implementing this new system, it does seem like we could be wading into a new, post-truth world, where the lessons of the past, that led to the implementation of fact-checks in the first place, are forgotten, and the same mistakes are repeated once again.",

It\u2019s also bringing more content deemed \u201cpolitical\u201d back to people\u2019s feeds, after steadily reducing the presence of such over the past four years.\n\nOn the first element, Meta is specifically moving to allow more kinds of speech on topics \u201cthat are frequently subject to political debate\u201d, beginning with discussion related to immigration and gender identity.\n\nThe Intercept has viewed examples of Meta\u2019s updated moderation guidelines, which are currently being circulated to Meta staff, and it\u2019s shared some of the notes provided by Meta relating to characterizations and comments that had been against its rules, but will now be acceptable.\n\nExamples of now acceptable comments include:\n\n\u201cImmigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGays are freaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrans people are mentally ill.\u201d\n\nAll of these are now fine, and will not be penalized in the same way (if at all), which will open the door for more hate speech in Meta\u2019s apps, while expanded characterizations of immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community will also now get more leeway.\n\nThe wording of Meta\u2019s update also suggests that further changes could be coming, based on whatever is subject to political debate at any given time.\n\nThe removal of fact-checkers, meanwhile, will lessen Meta\u2019s defenses against the spread of misinformation. based on Meta\u2019s own evidence (as discussed below), while the re-introduction of political content could see broader exposure to divisive debate across Meta\u2019s apps.\n\nWhy get rid of fact-checkers?\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, the fact-checking partners that Meta has used are inherently politically biased.\n\nAs Zuckerberg explained to Joe Rogan last week:\n\n\u201cSome of the people whose job is to do fact-checking, a lot of their industry is focused on political fact-checking, so they're kind of veered in that direction. We kept on trying to basically get it to be what we had originally intended, which is not to judge people's opinions, but to provide a layer to help fact-check some of the stuff that seems the most extreme. But it was never accepted by people broadly. I think people just felt like the fact-checkers were too biased, and not necessarily even so much in what they ruled, but a lot of the time it was just what types of things they chose to even go and fact-check in the first place.\u201d\n\nSo, there are a couple of key tells here.\n\nFirst off, Zuckerberg explained this in a three-hour interview with Joe Rogan, who has long-held right-wing views. Of course, getting rid of fact-checkers also aligns with the right-wing view that freedom of speech should be absolute, and that social platforms should not play any role at all in dictating what can and cannot be shared in their apps. But the fact that Zuckerberg chose to announce these updates on Rogan\u2019s podcast, while also sending his chief public policy to do the same on Fox News is relevant.\n\nThe message is clear: Meta is making these changes to appease right-wing supporters, and align with the views of incoming President Donald Trump. There can be no other way to view this, and that\u2019s also a relevant aspect in identifying fact-checkers as politically compromised.\n\nBut is it true? Are Meta\u2019s fact-checking partners politically biased in their efforts?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know without assessing the full scope of Meta\u2019s fact-checking program, but given the statistical context that we do have, it\u2019s hard to see how removing fact-checks entirely is going to be beneficial overall.\n\nBack in 2018, Meta noted that when fact-checkers rate an article as false, its future views are reduced by over 80% on average, while various academic studies have shown that fact-checks significantly reduce false beliefs, as well as the amount of redistribution fact-checked posts get.\n\nAnd when you also consider that misinformation sees six times more engagement than factual news on Facebook specifically, that seems like a significant element that you\u2019re taking away.\n\nThe next question, then, is whether Community Notes, which have been a success in some ways, and a failure in others on X, can replace the responsiveness and performance of third-party fact-checks.\n\nThe major flaw in Community Notes remains its reliance on political consensus to display a note (i.e. Notes contributors of opposing political viewpoints need to agree that a note is necessary), in order to ensure neutrality in which notes are displayed.\n\nIndependent analysis shows that on many of the most divisive issues, such agreement will never come, and thus, the majority of notes on these critical points of order are never displayed.\n\nThat could mean that political misinformation, which is likely to gain more momentum under Trump, could be spread a lot further in Meta\u2019s apps than it ever could be on X.\n\nZuckerberg says that the changes are about getting the company back to its original mission, which is to make everybody more connected, but has that always been Meta\u2019s aim?\n\nPart of Zuckerberg\u2019s justification for revising Meta\u2019s moderation rules is, as Zuckerberg describes, \u201cgetting back to our original mission of giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\u201d\n\nWhich isn\u2019t exactly what the company was founded upon, nor its original focus, but it has been a part of Meta\u2019s stated approach for over a decade, in technical terms.\n\nBack in 2014, Zuckerberg announced that Meta\u2019s mission statement would now be \u201cConnect the World\u201d, switching from its first corporate motto of \u201cBuild Fast and Break Things\u201d. Before that, nobody had any real idea of how significant, or influential, Facebook/Meta would become, with the company IPO being launched in 2012.\n\nSo while it hasn\u2019t been the central focus of the company forever, it has been a key aim, even if it was arguably being applied in a different context in those early years.\n\nIn 2014, Zuck and Co. had set their sights on branching into every nation, and building new systems of connectivity to link more people into Facebook\u2019s ever-growing userbase. So, yes, the aim was to connect people, but seemingly this was in a more literal sense, of connecting more people to Facebook.\n\nIn other words, it is somewhat disingenuous of Zuckerberg to suggest that connecting all people of all political viewpoints has always been his aim, but he can lean on these past mission statements to suggest that this was a central goal.\n\nBut really, Zuckerberg\u2019s main aim, now and always, is business growth, and maximizing Meta\u2019s capacity to dominate the competition.\n\nWhen you view these latest moves through that prism, not the narrative that Zuckerberg would prefer, the announced changes make more sense.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this go against everything that Meta\u2019s been telling us for the last ten years?\n\nKind of.\n\nLooking back over Zuckerberg\u2019s announcements on moderation and political speech, Meta has made some significant commitments that would seemingly run counter to this new approach.\n\nIn 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, Zuckerberg took the opportunity to celebrate the role that Facebook had played in enhancing LGBT connection.\n\nEasing the company\u2019s rules around hate speech in this context does seem contradictory, particularly in regards to implementing specific exclusions for commentary that could be used to attack members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn 2017, after the mass shooting in Charlottesville, Zuckerberg committed to making Facebook a place \u201cwhere everyone can feel safe\u201d. You could argue that these new rules also go against this.\n\nIn 2018, following the controversy of the 2016 U.S. election, and the suggestion that Russian bot farms may have interfered with democratic process, Zuckerberg outlined a new approach, while also explaining how Meta had \u201cfundamentally altered our DNA to focus more on preventing harm in all our services.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s big focus was misinformation, and limiting the distribution of content that comes close to breaking the platform\u2019s rules, but doesn\u2019t quite do so.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, this is a key problem, because the closer content gets to breaking the rules, the more engagement it sees.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s answer to this was to focus on training its AI systems to detect borderline content, so that Meta could proactively reduce its distribution. So it was less about the removal or limiting of such, and more about addressing the incentive for posting, as the engagement wouldn\u2019t be as high.\n\nAlso important, Zuckerberg also shared this note:\n\n\u201cIn the past year, we have prioritized identifying people and content related to spreading hate in countries with crises like Myanmar. We were too slow to get started here, but in the third quarter of 2018, we proactively identified about 63% of the hate speech we removed in Myanmar, up from just 13% in the last quarter of 2017.\u201d\n\nThe role that Facebook played in political unrest in Myanmar has been well-documented, and Meta has worked hard in the years since to improve its systems to limit political polarization and misinformation, stemming largely from this incident.\n\nThe relevance of such in today\u2019s context is that the U.S. is not the only nation that uses Meta\u2019s apps, and these rule changes could also lead to harm in other regions.\n\nBut the bottom line is that hate speech, and the spread of misinformation, was a key focus for Meta in 2018, with Zuckerberg also noting that:\n\n\u201cWe are also making progress on hate speech, now with 52% identified proactively. This work will require further advances in technology as well as hiring more language experts to get to the levels we need.\u201d\n\nAgain, Meta\u2019s approach has been about safety, and ensuring users feel safe in using its apps.\n\nThis approach seems to have been largely upheld by all of Meta\u2019s announcements and policy shifts over the past 6 years, including its decision to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account in the wake of the Capitol Riots in 2021, as well as its move away from political content entirely, as a means to combat division and angst, which has been impacting Facebook usage.\n\nIndeed, the message from Meta more recently has been that politics is simply bad for business, while it also doesn\u2019t need political discussion anymore either way, because Facebook and Instagram engagement has been increasing based on AI-recommended content, primarily Reels, which now make up more than 50% of the content that users see in their feeds.\n\nSo no more negotiating with news publishers over rights deals, no more promoting politically-aligned posts that can spark anger, and no need to get Zuckerberg himself entangled in congressional explorations of the role that social apps play in social division.\n\nMeta seemed to be moving on, and was keen to distance itself from such entirely.\n\nBut then last year, Meta started to change its tune, with Zuckerberg penning a letter to Congress in which he expressed regret over his company\u2019s decision to censor COVID vaccine misinformation, at the behest of Biden administration officials, and the mistaken blocking of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.\n\nAt that stage, Trump looked to be gaining in the polls, on the way to his subsequent re-election. That could be coincidental timing, but it did seem like Zuckerberg may have been setting the table for last week\u2019s switch-up based on the poll projections.\n\nAlso of note, Trump had threatened to jail Zuckerberg for life if he was ever re-elected, due to what he viewed as political overreach by Facebook in suspending his account.\n\nWhich leads into the next query:\n\nWhat does Meta (and Zuckerberg) stand to gain from siding with President Trump?\n\nA lot. Here are just a few ways in which the U.S. government can play a part in improving Meta\u2019s business opportunities:\n\nForeign tariffs \u2013 Trump has vowed to increase tariffs on global imports to the U.S., including a 60% jump in tariffs on Chinese imports. Meta is reliant on Chinese components to build its VR and AR headsets, and recently shifted elements of the production of its AR glasses to China . As such, any tariffs on Chinese imports could end up costing Meta billions of dollars, while also reducing its capacity to make its AR and VR devices affordable enough to secure mass adoption.\n\nEU regulation \u2013 Meta has been fined more than $2.5 billion by European regulators over the past two years alone, based on various violations of increasingly stringent EU consumer protection codes relating to online entities. Having the U.S. government in its corner could reduce the EU Commission\u2019s propensity to resort to fines, due to fears of retaliatory penalties in U.S. trade.\n\nAI regulation \u2013 Meta also needs U.S. regulators to stay out of its business on AI advancement, in order to ensure that it can push ahead with its various AI projects. Many have raised concerns about the impacts that AI may have, and the need for more stringent security and regulation to limit potential harm. Meta doesn\u2019t want that, so it\u2019ll need to lean on its Washington connections to oppose such. Also, with Trump\u2019s new best friend Elon Musk pushing his own AI projects, there\u2019s a risk that new rules could be implemented that penalize Meta in favor of xAI. A better relationship with Trump could mitigate this.\n\nKeeping TikTok out of the U.S. \u2013 Who benefits most from TikTok being banned in the U.S.? With TikTok gone, more people will turn to Instagram and Facebook, so Meta clearly wins out if the Trump Administration decides against pushing to keep the app available to Americans.\n\nKeeping the FTC off Meta\u2019s back \u2013 Finally, Meta has come under constant scrutiny from the FTC , which is still threatening to force the company to divest both Instagram and WhatsApp to reduce its market dominance. Less time spent battling the FTC means more time, and money, to invest in its technological development, while also reducing the risk of impacting Meta's bottom line.\n\nSo clearly, Zuck and Co. have a lot to gain from being in partnership with Trump, and nothing to gain from maintaining opposition on ideological grounds.\n\nZuckerberg has said that Meta\u2019s policy revision is based on the political mood of the people, but \u201cpeople\u201d in this context is really only the people in charge, whom Zuckerberg knows he needs on his side to maximize Meta\u2019s opportunities.\n\nSo what\u2019s actually going to happen as a result of this shift?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The impact of this change could be significantly less on Facebook and IG this time around because nobody posts to Facebook or Instagram anymore either way.\n\nThat\u2019s not to dilute the responsibility that Zuck and Co. have, as any platform that\u2019s used by 3 billion people is going to play a role in shaping opinions and political discourse. But the main difference caused by Meta\u2019s AI recommendation shift is that people are relying on Meta\u2019s apps less and less for political content, or for sharing their personal opinions.\n\nBack in 2022, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri noted that \u201cfriends post a lot more to stories and send a lot more DMs than they post to Feed\u201d. Facebook has seen the same, with the influx of recommended Reels now shifting the platform away from its \u201csocial\u201d roots, and more towards entertainment. Which is better for driving engagement, and keeping people in the app longer (so they can view more ads). But in effect, it also means that Meta now has far less influence than it had back in 2016, when it was first identified as a legitimate political force.\n\nSo while Meta is going to show people more political content, if they want to see it (you\u2019ll still be able to opt-out if you choose), I\u2019m not sure that the impact of such will be as significant even as X this time around. Which may be optimistic, but again, people just aren\u2019t posting to Facebook as much as they once were, while private groups have always had certain exemptions from scrutiny, due to people simply not being able to see and report them.\n\nNow, more engagement happens within messaging groups, and that still seems like the most viable vector for the sharing of political information. And the same as private FB groups, that won\u2019t be detected, so Meta\u2019s impact in this respect may not be as significant as it might seem.\n\nThough there will be impacts, and certain groups are going to feel the brunt of these changes. The amplification of misinformation is also a major concern, but maybe, Meta\u2019s algorithms simply won\u2019t allow for the same level of spread of such as it did in the past.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Trump is going to return to Facebook either way, due to his contractual ties with Truth Social. And with his right-hand man Elon also tied to X, I assume those will be the primary propaganda focus of Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nSo maybe, Meta feels safer in making this change because it\u2019s not in the same position as it once was for news distribution, and maybe, the impact of these changes won\u2019t be the same either.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see, but maybe, Meta has actually set the groundwork to minimize such a change in approach, enabling Zuckerberg to appeal to Trump and his supporters, while also reducing the actual effects either way.\n\nI don\u2019t think that was by design, necessarily, as again, Zuckerberg\u2019s decisions are based on winning for his business, not on social harms. But maybe, this won\u2019t lead to Facebook becoming an all-out misinformation bullhorn, as X now is.\n\nThe only proviso to this is that Facebook is still used by many middle-aged people (30-49), and is also where this cohort gets a significant amount of their news input:\n\nThis group is also more likely to turn out to vote in the U.S., so Facebook\u2019s influence is still notable in this respect.\n\nOverall, the changes seem like a negative for social discourse, and do seem to be aligned with the whims of the incoming president, as opposed to what might be for the greater good. We won\u2019t know till we see the full impact of the spread of misinformation or harm as a result, but also, we only know those impacts in retrospect.\n\nBut the bottom line, based on the evidence presented, is that Zuck and Co. are keen to win favor for their business, over any potential impacts. And when Zuckerberg changes his tune again, when the next president is voted in, we\u2019ll go through all of this once more.",

They've been targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups, and have widened their objections to include programs focused on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nDEI policies typically are intended as a counterweight to discriminatory practices. Critics argue that education, government and business programs that single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unfair and the same opportunities should be afforded to everyone.\n\nJoel Kaplan, Meta's newly appointed global policy chief, told Fox News Digital on Friday that the move will ensure that the company is \"building teams with the most talented people\" instead of making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics.\n\n\"This is ultimately about doing what's best for our company and ensuring that we are serving everyone and building teams with the most talented people,\" Kaplan told Fox News Digital. \"This means evaluating people as individuals, and sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics like race or gender.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the other companies that have retreated from DEI:\n\nWALMART\n\nThe world's largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nWalmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.\n\nAdditionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts, and it won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.\n\nMCDONALD'S\n\nFour years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonald's said earlier this month that it is ending some of its diversity practices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald's said on Jan. 6 that it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald's said it will also pause \"external surveys.\" The burger giant didn't elaborate, but several other companies have suspended their participation in the HRC's Corporate Equality Index.\n\nFORD\n\nCEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker's employees in August outlining changes to the company's DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in the Corporate Equality Index.\n\nFord, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn't use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remained committed to \"fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,\" Farley said.\n\n\"We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,\" the memo said.\n\nTRACTOR SUPPLY\n\nThe retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.\n\nTractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would \"stop sponsoring non-business activities\" such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns -- and no longer submit data for the HRC index.\n\nThe Brentwood, Tenn.-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead \"focus on our land and water conservation efforts.\"\n\nThe National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply's president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.",

It\u2019s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they\u2019re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.\u201d\n\nHe argued that iPhone sales are flagging because consumers were waiting to upgrade their devices, waiting for more improved models.\n\n\u201cSo how are they making more money as a company? Well, they do it by basically, like, squeezing people, and, like you\u2019re saying, having this 30% tax on developers by getting you to buy more peripherals and things that plug into it,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cYou know, they build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they\u2019ve just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way.\u201d\n\nMeta last year offered advertisers a way to avoid the 30% service charge levied by Apple. The offer lets businesses that use boosted posts on Facebook and Instagram can go to those platform\u2019s websites on mobile or desktop devices to boost their content and not pay the service charge.\n\nPYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\n\nIn the podcast interview, Zuckerberg contended that Apple defends itself from criticism from other companies by saying it wants to protect user privacy and security. He added that it could solve that problem by improving its protocol, such as building better security and using encryption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insecure because you didn\u2019t build any security into it.

Meta and other tech giants, which have faced fierce criticism from Trump in recent years, have made large donations to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.\n\nMeta did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cI do think that there\u2019s bad optics here,\u201d said McConnell, who said he was speaking personally and not on behalf of the board. \u201cIt certainly looks like this is buckling to political pressure.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg announced on Tuesday that Meta\u2019s partnership with third-party fact-checkers would be replaced with user-generated \u201ccommunity notes\u201d at Facebook, Instagram and Threads, a policy similar to Elon Musk\u2019s X. The company also quietly updated its hateful conduct policy, striking old rules about content that cannot be posted, including referring to \u201cwomen as household objects or property\u201d or \u201ctransgender or non-binary people as \u2018it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFact-checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the new policy. \u201cWhat started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it\u2019s gone too far.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged that the changes would \u201creduce the number of innocent people\u2019s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,\u201d but there would be more harmful content on the platform. McConnell said official revisions to Meta\u2019s hate speech policy \u201ccame as a surprise\u201d to board members.\n\nMeta first implemented its fact-checking program in 2016 after claims it didn\u2019t stop foreign actors, especially Russia, from using its platforms to spread disinformation. Meta has since faced scrutiny for misinformation about elections, anti-vaccination stories, violence and hate speech.\n\nMeta\u2019s newly appointed Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan told Fox News on Tuesday that Meta\u2019s use of third-party fact-checkers was \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d but showed too much political bias. Trump later said he watched Kaplan\u2019s appearance and said Meta has \u201ccome a long way.\u201d Trump is among the Republicans who have criticized Meta for what they view as censorship of right-wing voices.\n\nMcConnell said there is \u201cpretty overwhelming evidence\u201d that fact-checkers correct more content from right-wing users, but knowing whether those users spread more misinformation is \u201ca very difficult thing to measure.\u201d\n\nHe also said there has been \u201cactive and vigorous debate\u201d within the Meta oversight board.\n\n\u201cThe oversight board is a global enterprise, and there\u2019s a huge difference in the way in which Americans think about freedom of speech and other places around the world,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd that really plays out. It\u2019s also true that the fact-checking program has been much more contentious and controversial in the United States, not so much elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said he doesn\u2019t know what this change means for future elections or foreign government propaganda on the social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThere is really no magic bullet to this problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut much of this has to do with not whether the information is true or false but where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d",

            "content": "The Magnificent 7 group of stocks again proved their dominance in 2024. With an average gain of 63% in the year, they accounted for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains. Now, I do believe that all seven tech giants are well-positioned for sustained growth. However, I think Meta Platforms (META) is the most compelling investment case. It combines exceptional revenue growth prospects with a relatively modest valuation. I believe this setup will likely keep producing superior returns for investors, which is why Meta remains my largest position despite last year\u2019s extended share price gains.\n\nMeta Offers the Best Growth-for-Value Setup\n\nTo paint a clearer picture, NVIDIA (NVDA) led the Magnificent 7 in revenue growth over the trailing 12 months, with a tremendous 152.44%. Meta followed with an outstanding 23.06%, outpacing Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) 16.44%, Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) 14.38%, Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) 11.93%, Apple\u2019s (AAPL) 2.02%, and Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) 1.28%.\n\nNow, NVIDIA\u2019s growth is, of course, spectacular. However, it\u2019s fair to say that its current levels are going to be unsustainable due to the inevitable stabilization of demand for its AI chips. Further, at about 47 times its FY2025 EPS, I find NVIDIA notably more expensive than Meta, which trades at just 27 times its FY2024 EPS and 24 times its FY2025 EPS. This is because, unlike NVIDIA, Meta is much more likely to maintain its lofty growth levels. In fact, I would argue that Wall Street analysts underestimate Meta\u2019s medium-term growth potential, suggesting that the stock is even more discounted than it appears.\n\nWall Street Likely Underestimates Meta\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe first reason I believe that Wall Street underestimates Meta\u2019s potential is that its top-line growth is currently experiencing an upward trajectory that is likely to endure. After relaxing in Fiscal 2022, revenue growth accelerated to 15.7% in Fiscal 2023, while revenue growth for Fiscal 2024 should be about 20.8%. What makes little sense to me is that Wall Street estimates suggest a slowdown to 14.6% in Fiscal 2025. I find this estimate overly conservative, as several catalysts, such as Meta\u2019s developments in AI, imply that Meta is well positioned to sustain accelerated top-line growth or, at the minimum, maintain similar levels to last year.\n\nMeta\u2019s most recent Q3 2024 earnings illustrate my point, with AI continuing to transform its operations, offerings, and margins. Specifically, Meta AI now boasts over 500 million monthly active users, while the company\u2019s generative AI tools have significantly boosted ad performance, with businesses reporting a 7% increase in conversions. Then you have Llama, Meta\u2019s open-source AI platform, which is gaining traction industry-wide with the release of Llama 3.2. The highly anticipated Llama 4 is expected to further boost adoption, which, in turn, will unlock new monetization opportunities across advertising, engagement, and enterprise solutions.\u200b\u200b There is early evidence of this, as advances in AI-driven recommendations increased time spent on Facebook and Instagram by 8% and 6% in the previous quarter.\n\nUnderappreciated Earnings Power and Margin Growth\n\nBesides Meta\u2019s top-line growth prospects, there is a strong chance that investors are underappreciating its earnings power. For context, in Q3, Meta\u2019s operating income surged by 26% year-over-year to $17.4 billion, with its operating margin expanding from 40%\u200b to 43%. This multiple expansion was driven by cost-cutting measures and economies of scale. For instance, general and administrative expenses fell by 10%, primarily due to lower legal costs, while automation in data center management further reduced operational expenses\u200b.\n\nIn fact, Meta\u2019s EBITDA margin reached 52.7% for the period, recording its highest level since 2018. Given these elevated margins, it\u2019s easy to see why Meta should be able to convert revenue growth into notably more substantial earnings growth, as was the case in every single quarter throughout Fiscal 2024. So even though analysts fairly project EPS to grow by 52.2% in Fiscal 2024, they anticipate a dramatic slowdown to 12.5% in Fiscal 2025.\n\nWhile one could argue this is appropriate given a potential \u201cnormalization,\u201d I find it an improbable scenario given Meta\u2019s margin expansion trajectory and already muted top-line estimates. For this reason, I would argue that Meta will be notably cheaper than its previously noted forward multiples suggest. Once stronger numbers materialize, the market will likely re-price the stock, driving sustained share price gains.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street sentiment toward Meta Platforms remains highly vibrant, with analysts collectively rating the stock as a Strong Buy. Despite the rather conservative growth estimates, Meta has gathered 39 Buys, three Holds, and just one Sell over the past three months. The average META stock forecast of $683.72 implies a potential upside of 11.36% from current levels.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst to trust for trading META stock, Andrew Boone of JMP Securities stands out as the most accurate over one year. His recommendations have delivered an average return of 48.66% per rating, with an impressive 88% success rate.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn closing, the Magnificent 7 group of stocks delivered big in 2024, but Meta Platforms clearly stands out to me. Its strong revenue growth, rising margins, and ongoing AI developments form a setup that is kind of hard to ignore. I think Wall Street still underestimates its potential, leaving room for more upside. But even if Meta delivers in line with market expectations, the stock still seems considerably cheaper than the rest of the tech giants. I\u2019m confident I will keep META stock as my largest holding.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA -2.99%) is a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), whereas Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) is home to social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In other words, they are two completely different companies.\n\nBut they have one important thing in common: They are betting big on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nTesla stock and Meta stock both soared by more than 60% in 2024, ending the year near record highs. But 2025 is here, and it's time for investors to look forward, so which one is the better buy now? I think the answer is clear.\n\nThe case for Tesla\n\nTesla is one of the most exciting stories in the AI industry, and its stock has no shortage of bullish price targets from Wall Street analysts. Most of the optimism stems from the company's full self-driving (FSD) software, which owners of its passenger EVs can already use in beta mode.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk believes autonomy is the future of the automotive industry. The company unveiled its Cybercab robotaxi in October, which doesn't have pedals or even a steering wheel, because FSD will handle the entire driving process. The company plans to build a ride-hailing network where the Cybercab can autonomously haul passengers and earn revenue around the clock. Since it won't need a human driver, this revenue stream should have a very high profit margin.\n\nMoreover, consumers will be able to buy the Cybercab for personal use, or they can purchase a fleet of them and operate a ride-hailing service of their own using Tesla's network. Simply put, this new product platform unlocks several new revenue streams for the company, which is why analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities believes it could be a $1 trillion opportunity.\n\nBut Tesla faces a few short-term problems. First, it delivered 1.79 million passenger EVs during 2024, which was a drop of 1.1% compared to 2023. EV sales still account for almost 80% of the company's total revenue, so it can't afford for this business to be shrinking.\n\nThat brings me to the second problem -- the Cybercab isn't scheduled for mass production until 2026, which means Tesla's passenger EV sales need to impress investors for at least another year.\n\nMoreover, the company's FSD software doesn't have regulatory approval for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. right now. Investors are speculating that Tesla will face a friendlier regulatory environment under the Trump administration, which could fast-track the approval process, especially since Musk was a major donor to the incoming president's election campaign. Musk hopes FSD will be fully approved in at least California and Texas this year.\n\nStill, Tesla stock trades at an extremely high valuation (more on this later), based entirely on products that aren't even available yet. That poses a significant risk to investors who buy it now.\n\nBut here's the upshot: Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management thinks Tesla stock could soar 530% to reach $2,600 by 2029 if the Cybercab and FSD are successful, so the payoff could be substantial for investors with a high-enough risk tolerance to buy it today.\n\nThe case for Meta Platforms\n\nOver 98% of Meta's revenue comes from selling advertising slots to businesses on its social networks, like Facebook and Instagram. The formula for success is quite simple: The longer each user spends browsing those platforms each day, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta pulls in.\n\nMeta spent the last couple of years building AI into its recommendation engine, which learns what content each user likes to see, and shows them more of it to keep them online a little longer. In the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI-powered recommendations drove an 8% increase in the amount of time users spent on Facebook for the year to date, and a 6% increase for Instagram.\n\nBut that's only the tip of Meta's growing AI strategy. The company also launched an AI chatbot called Meta AI in 2023, and it has already amassed 500 million monthly active users. It's embedded in each of the company's apps, where users can ask it questions on almost any topic, or prompt it to generate images.\n\nMeta AI is free to use, but I predict businesses will eventually pay money to embed product links into its responses when users ask it a relevant question, which will unlock a new revenue stream for Meta.\n\nMeta AI is powered by the company's family of large language models (LLMs) called Llama. Unlike models from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI, Llama is open source, which allows Meta to crowdsource bug detection and improvements from an entire community of developers. With over 600 million downloads, Llama is the most popular family of open-source models in the world.\n\nMeta will report its official financial results for 2024 on Jan. 29, and the company is likely to tell investors it spent around $40 billion building data center infrastructure for the year to further its AI ambitions. The company plans to launch Llama 4 this year, which Zuckerberg thinks could be the most advanced LLM in the world. It will pave the way for new AI features for Meta's social networks, and new opportunities to generate revenue.\n\nTurning to 2025, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo!) suggests Meta could deliver a record $186 billion in revenue, and $25.38 in earnings per share. Based on those figures, its stock looks very attractive right now.\n\nThe verdict\n\nIn my view, this choice comes down to valuation. As I touched on, Tesla stock is pricey right now -- it trades at an eye-watering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 108, which makes it three times more expensive than the 32.1 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100.\n\nMeta stock, on the other hand, trades at a very enticing P/E ratio of just 29.1.\n\nWe don't actually know if Tesla's business will grow in 2025. Elon Musk says it will -- he thinks passenger EV deliveries could grow by as much as 30% -- but it's a \"show me\" story, given the company's 2024 results. Plus, I can't recommend making a large bet on Tesla stock at this price based on what might happen with the Cybercab and FSD in 2026.\n\nMeta has a better opportunity to financially benefit from AI in 2025, because incremental improvements in its recommendation engine alone could immediately drive more advertising revenue. Combined with its attractive valuation, I think it's a much safer stock to buy for this year.",

It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics.\u201d\n\nGale also wrote that the term \u201cDEI\u201d has become \u201ccharged\u201d because some believe it suggests \u201cpreferential treatment of some groups over others.\u201d\n\nThe memo was first reported by Axios.\n\nMeta\u2019s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, will take on a new role focused on \u201caccessibility and engagement,\u201d the memo said. The company will also no longer require managers source candidates from unrepresented groups, and it will end efforts to hire minority-owned vendors and suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe build the best teams with the most talented people,\u201d Gale wrote. \u201cThis means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.),\u201d Gale wrote.\n\n\u201cInstead of equity and inclusion programs,\u201d Gale wrote, Meta plans to build programs \u201cthat focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d\n\nThe end to the DEI programs dovetails with other major changes at the company that critics say cater to the right since President-elect Donald Trump won November\u2019s election. Earlier this week Meta announced it was ending its third-party fact-checking programs in the United States and changing its hateful conduct policies, adding new types of content users can now post on Meta-owned platforms that were previously banned.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with President-elect Donald Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, two sources familiar tell CNN. Meta declined to comment on the meeting between Zuckerberg and Trump.\n\nAnd Zuckerberg also appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast that same day, saying he\u2019d been working on the changes announced this week \u201cfor a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point of social media is giving people the ability to share what they want. It goes back to, our original mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg said he\u2019s been on a \u201cjourney\u201d over the past decade, starting out \u201cvery pro-free speech, free expression,\u201d but the 2016 victory of President Donald Trump and then pressure from the Biden administration to moderate Covid-19 misinformation on social media changed his view.\n\n\u201cI kind of think in 2016 and the aftermath I gave too much deference to a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying \u2018Okay, there was no way (Trump) could\u2019ve gotten elected except for misinformation. People can\u2019t actually believe this stuff,\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg said fact checking and content moderation got to the point that it \u201cdestroyed trust\u201d in the platform.\n\nAt the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg said Meta was heavily pressured by the Biden administration to remove content the administration saw as misinformation on the platform.\n\n\u201cBasically these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse, and it\u2019s like, these are documented, it\u2019s all kind of out there,\u201d Zuckerberg said, adding that the administration tried to get Meta to remove a meme that suggested people who get the Covid-19 vaccine would end up being part of class action lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pressure-tested on this stuff on the last 8 to 10 years with these huge institutions just pressuring us, and I feel like this is the right place to be going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Kate Sullivan and Clare Duffy contributed reporting.",

Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan outlined the updates, emphasizing a renewed commitment to open dialogue and transparency.\n\nIn a 2019 speech, CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that free expression drives societal progress but warned against stifling speech in pursuit of political outcomes. This perspective remains central to the company\u2019s policy shift. Kaplan acknowledged that Meta\u2019s current content moderation systems have become overly restrictive, often censoring harmless content and frustrating users. \u201cToo much harmless content gets censored,\u201d Kaplan said, referring to instances where users are mistakenly penalized.\n\nTransitioning to Community Notes\n\nMeta is discontinuing its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and adopting a \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system inspired by X (formerly Twitter). The new approach will rely on diverse community input to flag misleading posts and provide additional context.\n\nCommunity Notes will be written and rated by users, with agreement required across varied perspectives to ensure balanced contributions. Meta plans to phase in the program over the coming months, starting in the U.S. Users can sign up on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to participate as contributors. During this transition, the company will remove intrusive fact-checking labels and reduce demotions of flagged content.\n\nReducing Over-Enforcement\n\nMeta is addressing over-enforcement of its policies, which Kaplan attributed to the complexity of its automated systems. In December 2024, the company removed millions of posts daily, with up to 20% of these actions potentially being mistakes. Meta aims to increase transparency by regularly reporting enforcement errors, particularly in cases of spam.\n\nThe company plans to focus automated enforcement on severe violations such as terrorism, child exploitation, and scams. For less severe issues, Meta will prioritize user reports over automated actions. The changes include raising the confidence threshold for content takedowns and reducing unwarranted demotions.\n\nMeta also announced that its trust and safety teams will relocate from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, a move designed to diversify perspectives.\n\nEnhancing Content Appeals\n\nMeta is streamlining its appeals process to address user frustrations. The company has increased staffing for content reviews and now requires multiple reviewers to agree before removing certain posts. Additionally, Meta is testing AI-powered large language models to provide secondary opinions and facial recognition technology to simplify account recovery.\n\nPersonalized Political Content\n\nSince 2021, Meta has limited civic content, including posts about politics and elections, following user feedback. However, the company is introducing a personalized approach to such content. Political posts will now be ranked based on user engagement signals, allowing individuals to see more relevant content from people and pages they follow. Users will also gain expanded control over the volume of political content in their feeds.\n\nCommitment to Free Expression\n\nKaplan reaffirmed Meta\u2019s dedication to its original vision of free expression, acknowledging the need for policy adjustments. \u201cWe want to undo the mission creep that has made our rules too restrictive and too prone to over-enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\u201d\n\nKaplan stated these policy changes may take a few weeks to be fully implemented.\n\nContact our news desk at news@thebaynet.com",

            "content": "It was 2016, and the problem of fake news kept Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (then called Facebook), up at night. The young entrepreneur was under pressure from the media and was also constantly questioned by the US legal system. The Cambridge Analytica case, accusations of Russian interference in the elections, and Donald Trump's victory in the presidential race raised serious concerns. For the first time, the question of the platform's influence on the political landscape was being addressed\u2014US lawmakers demanded that the company \u201cprotect democracy.\u201d Eventually, Zuckerberg would appear before the Senate in 2018.\n\nAs part of his counteroffensive, the company created the Third Party Fact-Checkers, or Independent Fact-Checkers, program to address misinformation on its platforms.\n\nThe History of Independent Fact-Checkers at Facebook\n\nFirst implemented in the United States and then in the rest of the world, the project seemed to be working. So far, according to its own data, there were more than 100 international organizations actively participating in it. Indeed, last year, in the context of the European Union parliamentary elections, Meta announced the effectiveness of its labeling system: \u201cBetween July and December 2023, for example, nearly 68 million posts on Facebook and Instagram had fact-checking labels. When something was labeled as false or misleading, 95 percent of people did not click on the content.\u201d\n\nBut everything changed on January 7, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the end of the program in the United States. It seems only a matter of time before the initiative disappears in Latin America and the rest of the world, undermining independent news organizations that depend, to a greater or lesser extent, on that funding. Among those who would be affected will be Animal Pol\u00edtico in Mexico; Chequeado in Argentina; Agencia Lupa or Aos Fatos in Brazil; and Maldita.es in Spain. Why get rid of something that was working, according to the company itself?\n\nHow Does Meta\u2019s Third-Party Fact-Checker Program Work?\n\nI was an editorial supervisor at Animal Pol\u00edtico\u2019s El Sabueso when Meta approached us to start the project. To be part of it, you had to join the Poynter Institute certification, an international organization funded by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which set the editorial rules for verifying information with a highly rigorous and transparent code of principles. Meta trusted this network for the project, and also had its own requirements. Among them: Political discourse or any type of content that was classified as an opinion could not be refuted. Statements by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) could not be questioned, for example, but misinformation about the first migrant caravan, which crossed Mexico in the first year of AMLO\u2019s six-year presidential term (2018) and which strengthened a racist anti-immigrant discourse, could be.\n\nThe \u201cnews\u201d that was being debunked was photos or videos taken out of context, such as one that falsely claimed that a group of migrants had hijacked a truck in Chiapas. There were also lies about alleged kidnappings of children in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic. Independent fact-checkers took on a leading role in debunking, with the available data, ideas such as \u201cdrinking bleach eliminates the virus\u201d or \u201c5G networks caused the pandemic.\u201d\n\nFact-checking outlets would argue that something was false, and then Facebook\u2019s tool would not remove the original content but would instead add a label such as \u201cFalse: Verified by Animal Pol\u00edtico\u201d or another one of the network\u2019s organizations. Meta claimed that once a post received the label, its reach was drastically reduced. \u201cWe know that this program is working and that users find value in the labels after a fact-checker rates them,\u201d reads an official Meta post. Zuckerberg\u2019s company always said that it would not be an \u201carbitrator of truth;\u201d that was why it did not delete the original posts, showing confidence in the IFCN organizations that did this work.",

We recorded that episode so long ago that when I listened to it, all the predictions were fresh to me. I was so excited to hear what we were going to say, but I\u2019m doing good. I had a really nice break. And of course, I\u2019m excited to be back. But what about you, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I had a disaster happened to me over this break.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhich was that I got robbed on Christmas.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, wait, wait. Was it the Grinch? [LAUGHS]\n\nkevin roose\n\nThe citizens of Whoville are still looking for the suspect.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, no. Who robbed you? How did you get robbed?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I wasn\u2019t home, luckily, but someone broke into my house.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWait, what did they take?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo still sort of sorting through. We just got back. But it appears that the four thieves took some jewelry, some electronics.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, god.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut weirdly \u2014 and this is the tech angle here \u2014 they did not take the Apple Vision Pro. Not even a robber wants one of those.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt makes sense because robbers typically only want to take what is valuable, Kevin. And it\u2019s not clear what they would actually do with a Vision Pro. Also keep in mind, if you\u2019re a robber, you\u2019re out there. You\u2019re moving through the world. You\u2019re breaking into homes. You can\u2019t have that giant thing on your face. You sort of need to maintain clear vision.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo to speak.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nLet me ask you this. Even though all your items were stolen, did you look at your family and your dogs and you think, you know what? At the end of the day, I got my family. And that\u2019s all that really matters.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI did. And I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re saying it with such a \u2014 \u2014 faux sentimentality.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI was looking for a nice, sentimental ending.\n\nkevin roose\n\nHonestly, it was \u2014 that was sort of the \u2014 the moral of this robbery was much the same as the moral of the Grinch who stole Christmas, which is that the real Christmas, the real household items are families.\n\ncasey newton\n\nExactly. And so if you get robbed again, maybe don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWas it you?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m changing the subject. We\u2019re moving on.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhere were you on Christmas? [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m Kevin Roose, a tech columnist at The New York Times.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m Casey Newton from Platformer.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd this is \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis week, Meta goes mega. We break down the company\u2019s surrender to the right on speech issues. Then, why 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year in AI. And finally, some \u201cHatGPT.\u201d Call that a \u201cHatGPTs.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, Casey, I think we \u201cbeta\u201d talk about Meta.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe \u201cbeta\u201d do it, Kevin, because I never \u201cmeta\u201d bigger story for this podcast.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. So the big news this week in the world of social media is that Meta is making a, I would say, pretty calculated and transparent.\n\ncasey newton\n\nCraven is another word people have used.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, play to ingratiate itself with the incoming Trump administration by sort of surrendering to the demands of right-wing speech critics and changing a bunch of things about the way its platform works. I think this is a very big story, not just because of what it represents about Meta, but because it is the biggest and most prominent example of a Silicon Valley tech company sort of positioning itself for the second Trump term. And I think it\u2019s going to have very big implications for speech on the internet, for the rise of misinformation online, and potentially for the future of Meta itself.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, absolutely. I think that while we have talked about speech policies on Meta, basically as long as we\u2019ve been doing this podcast, I think this set of changes that the company announced this week are the most important series of policy changes that they have made in the past five years, easily.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So let\u2019s run down what\u2019s actually been happening over at Meta. So over the past week, there have been three main things that people are pointing to as being all part of this effort to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The first was that last week, Meta\u2019s global policy chief, Nick Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister who had served in that role for a number of years, stepped down and was replaced by Joel Kaplan. Joel Kaplan is a longtime Republican operative, going back to the George W. Bush administration, who\u2019s been working at Meta in their policy division for a while now and has sort of become the unofficial liaison between Mark Zuckerberg and The Washington, right?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd then this week on Monday, Meta announced that it was appointing three new board members, including Dana White, who is the CEO of UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Dana White, not known as a particular expert on social media governance, but definitely a close friend and ally of Donald Trump and someone who can presumably act as liaison between Meta and the Trump administration.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so just sort of staffing that bench up with more Trump friends.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd then the big one came on Tuesday when Meta announced that it was ending its fact-checking program and replacing it with an X style Community Notes feature. The company also said it was redoing its rules to allow more speech and less censorship. It\u2019s going to dial up the amount of quote, \u201ccivic content.\u201d That\u2019s sort of Meta\u2019s term for political content and current events content in their feeds, and said that they were moving their content review operations from California to Texas to avoid the appearance of political bias. There were some other details in there that we can talk about, including some changes to the way that its content moderation automated services will work. But basically, this was a laundry list of things that right-wing critics of social media platforms had been asking for years. And Meta sort of stood up and said, we\u2019re going to do all of it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, or another way of putting it, Kevin, is just that they accepted wholesale the Republican critique of Facebook\u2019s speech policies and actually use the same words that Republicans would do. In a previous time, we only used the word \u201ccensorship\u201d to apply to state action to actually prohibit speech. Some people would say it doesn\u2019t actually apply to private companies just sort of policing online forums. But Mark Zuckerberg said, no, effectively, you\u2019re right. We do a bunch of censorship. We\u2019re doing too much censorship. And we\u2019re going to stop doing censorship.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, so the reasons that Mark Zuckerberg gave and that Joel Kaplan gave when he went on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to announce these changes, which was a very deliberate decision and one that I probably don\u2019t have to explain the meaning of to our listeners, but the reason that Mark Zuckerberg and Joel Kaplan gave for these changes was that Meta had been doing some soul-searching and basically had discovered that its former policies created too much censorship, and that they were going to return to the company\u2019s roots as a platform for free expression.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI was really struck by just the way that they completely backed down here. They accepted the critique. And they seemingly are terrified of what the Trump administration could mean for them and for Mark Zuckerberg personally if they do not comply in advance with everything that Republicans have said about them for years. Keep in mind that none of these critiques are new. They were made throughout the first Trump administration. And Facebook stood up against them. And they said, we\u2019re actually going to try to find a middle path here. We are going to try to do what we can to preserve free expression while also trying to make this a really safe and inclusive space for as many people as we can. And in 2025, at the start of the year, Mark Zuckerberg came forward. And he said, no, not anymore. We\u2019re done with that. Everything that the Republicans have been saying about us is true. And so we are going to lean into their version of what a social network should be. And so I\u2019d like to play just some of what Zuckerberg said in the reel he posted on Instagram announcing these changes.\n\nmark zuckerberg\n\nGovernments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there\u2019s also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there \u2014 drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously. And I want to make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content. But the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes. Even if they accidentally censor just 1 percent of posts, that\u2019s millions of people. And we\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech. So we\u2019re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI was just struck by how craven and cynical, it felt like, Mark Zuckerberg in particular was being about this. I mean, he sounded like Elon Musk, to be totally honest. He used phrases like legacy media with this dripping disdain, which is a phrase that Elon Musk and his friends love to use in describing the mainstream media. He also did use this word \u201ccensorship\u201d that he has avoided studiously for years in describing the content moderation work that every social network, including all of Meta\u2019s social networks, do as a matter of business. So it just sounded like a total capitulation, a total giving in to the demands of his most ardent right-wing critics.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd more than that, Kevin, he also threw his own contractors under the bus. And let\u2019s hear that clip.\n\nmark zuckerberg\n\nAfter Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth. But the fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created, especially in the US.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHe says that the fact checkers had just proven to be too biased, gives no evidence for that, no examples. He just sort of says that these fact checkers, all of whom follow this very rigorous code for how they do their work, just sort of assert, oh, they\u2019ve been super biased. So who knows what that meant? He also, as you pointed out, says that they\u2019re going to move their moderation teams to Texas to avoid bias. Well, first of all, I can tell you they have had moderators in Texas for many years, basically for as long as they\u2019ve had moderators. They\u2019ve also put moderators in red states for years. In 2019, I visited Facebook moderation sites in Arizona and Florida. So there\u2019s absolutely nothing new about this, but he is throwing his moderators under the bus. And the worst part about it to me is that he is suggesting that the moderators were the ones making decisions about policy.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhen in fact, that person was Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo if Mark Zuckerberg wants to talk about the perception of bias around Facebook policy, he should reckon with the fact that he is the policymaker in chief over there.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. So what do you think the most impactful part of these changes is? Because for all of the talk about the end of the fact-checking program over at Meta, my sense is that the fact-checking program, for all the good people who worked very hard on it, really only ever touched a very tiny fraction of the content shared on Meta\u2019s platforms. It was a pretty ragtag effort that never really had as much of an impact as I think the fact-checking community would have liked, in part because of the way that Meta restricted it. So I don\u2019t know that the average user of Facebook or Instagram is actually going to notice the fact that their fact-checking has disappeared. But what do you think the biggest impact on users will be?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, so let me speak to the fact-checking first because in some ways, I agree with you. I don\u2019t know about you. I rarely encountered one of these fact checks on Facebook. On the other hand, I am someone who believes in harm reduction. And fact checkers did look at millions of pieces of content that were getting presumably hundreds of millions or billions of views. And there were empirical studies done that showed that, overall, people came to have fewer false beliefs that they saw those fact checks. So to the extent that people saw them, they were effective. And I think that there was a case to continue doing them, particularly if you want to be a good steward of a network that you have built that billions of people are using every day, and it\u2019s important to you that they have a good experience on that platform and don\u2019t come away from it stupider than when they started. But I don\u2019t actually think that that\u2019s the most important thing that they announced. I think it\u2019s something else. And I\u2019m going to point to something that Mark Zuckerberg said in his reel. Let\u2019s hear that clip.\n\nmark zuckerberg\n\nWe used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now, we\u2019re going to focus those filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations. And for lower-severity violations, we\u2019re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo what does that mean? What it means is, whereas before, Meta used to rely on automated systems to catch all sorts of things, not just illegal things, but also just stuff that was annoying or hurtful, stuff that was a little bit bullying, harassment. I called you a name. I called you a slur. Meta would catch that stuff in advance and maybe not show it to you. Maybe take some sort of disciplinary action against the person who sent that. What Zuckerberg is saying here is we are not the content moderators anymore. You are, Facebook user, Instagram user. We are now enlisting you in the fight. And we\u2019re going to leave it to you. If you see a slur on our platform, you go ahead and report that. And then maybe we\u2019ll take a look. And I think that this is a really big deal. So yesterday, I wound up talking to a bunch of people who either work at Meta or used to work there. And I talked to one person who just said that they were extremely worried about what this meant because they had seen in so many countries around the world, where Meta has traditionally done much worse moderation than it does in the United States, where by not taking action against these lower-severity violations, stuff that was not obviously illegal, they had just seen violence fomented again and again. They had seen harassment against women. They had seen abuse against LGBTQ people. And Zuckerberg in his reel said, look, we\u2019re going to have more bad stuff on the platform. But he doesn\u2019t go the second step to what does that actually mean. Well, what it actually means is people could get hurt. People could die. So I want to be very clear about that. This is not two pointy-headed intellectuals, sitting in their podcast studio saying, oh, no, Facebook isn\u2019t a safe space anymore for the college students. What I\u2019m saying is that violence has been fomented on Facebook before. And it will be fomented on Facebook again. And as a result of these changes, more people are going to be hurt. So that to me is the biggest consequence of these actions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I think this reporting thing that you bring up is so interesting because, as we know, a lot of the worst stuff on Facebook happens in groups, happens in semi-private spaces with hundreds or thousands of members. And so now, I think Meta is essentially saying that it will be up to the members of those groups to report any violative content that they want to be moderated rather than having these proactive scanners going around. And you might say, what\u2019s the big deal about that? Well, if you\u2019re in a Stop the Steal group or a QAnon conspiracy group or a group that\u2019s plotting an insurrection at the Capitol, which members of that group are going to be reporting each other for violating Facebook\u2019s rules? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a thing that\u2019s going to happen. And so I think what we\u2019re going to end up with is just a much more unmoderated mess over at Facebook and Instagram and all the other Meta Platforms.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. When I was talking to employees this week, one of them pointed out to me what a sort of strange step backwards this is in this respect. For so many years, Mark Zuckerberg bragged about how automation was the future of content moderation. And he boasted about the systems that they were building that were getting better every single quarter at detecting the hate speech, detecting the bullying, and making this a sort of better place for his community. And now, instead of saying, we\u2019re going to lean into this even more, we\u2019re going to make these filters better, he said, we\u2019re going to stop using them. And we\u2019re going to go back to human beings, who don\u2019t even work for us or have any training or expertise, right? This is an abandonment of his technological project in favor of something that is obviously inferior. So to me, that is one of the big twists here is Mark Zuckerberg walking away from the very good technology that he built.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a really good point. So what else in these changes caught your eye?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so some of our listeners, Kevin, may use Facebook or Instagram and just wonder, what\u2019s it going to be like now now that these changes have made? So I thought maybe it would be good to go through some of the offensive things that you can now say on Facebook and Instagram \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\ncasey newton\n\n\u2014 if you want and not get in trouble. So for example, I\u2019m gay. You can now tell me that I have a mental illness, Kevin. You can go right onto Facebook and tell me that I\u2019m mentally ill for being gay. You can say that I don\u2019t belong in the military. You can tell trans people \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nI mean, you don\u2019t belong in the military, but \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nFor other reasons.\n\nkevin roose\n\nFor other reasons.\n\ncasey newton\n\nFor other reasons.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd that\u2019s important. [LAUGHS]\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, it has nothing to do with your sexuality.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo. I\u2019m a terrible shot.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, go on.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThere are some other changes.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou \u2014 so look, if you want to say offensive things about trans people, they can\u2019t use the bathroom of their choice. If you want to blame COVID-19 on Chinese people or some other ethnic group, you can just do that on Facebook and Instagram now. And Mark Zuckerberg says, well, that\u2019s more in keeping with the mainstream discourse. Those are the words he uses. That is in keeping with the mainstream discourse. And I look at that. And I think, oh, the standard on Facebook now is that it\u2019s just going to feel like a middle school playground, right? All of this stuff is stuff that I used to hear when I was 12 years old in Washington Middle School. Maybe not the trans bathroom stuff. That was sort of still yet to come. Everything else, I heard in seventh grade. And that is the new standard that Mark Zuckerberg has set for his property.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. He\u2019s saying, I would like the discourse on my platforms to more closely resemble the dialogue in a Borat movie.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, which is satirical in the Borat case, but is very serious.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd look, it\u2019s easy for me to joke about it. Look, if you want to tell me I\u2019m mentally ill for being gay, I can handle that. But if you\u2019re 14 years old and queer, and it\u2019s people in your high school that are calling you that on Instagram, we\u2019ve seen over and over again that these kids harm themselves. And one of the things I find so crazy about these series of decisions, Kevin, is that right now, 41 states in DC are suing Meta over the terrible child safety record it has on its platform. And my understanding is that these changes apply to younger users just as they apply to everyone else. And so these classifiers that once used to try to find bullying and abuse and harassment against young people, they\u2019re no longer going to be automatically enforced. And it is going to be up to, I guess, the other kids in school to say, hey, it looks like my friend is being bullied over here on Instagram. So that just seems like they\u2019re opening up a huge amount of liability for themselves.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. And I think we should say it is not just right-wing culture warriors who have complained about excessive moderation on Meta\u2019s platforms. People on the left complain that they\u2019re pro-Palestinian speech is being targeted for takedowns or that \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd that\u2019s true, by the way. Those are not just phony complaints. It is absolutely true that Meta has overenforced in some cases.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBut what\u2019s so interesting as I\u2019m hearing you explain the details of some of these changes and how they are revising their rules, is that they all seem to be pointed in one direction. It\u2019s like, let\u2019s let people on the right mock people on the left in more ways.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, absolutely. And again, if \u2014 I wrote in my newsletter that a younger and more capable version of Mark Zuckerberg truly did handle this differently. And the way he handled it was like, oh, we\u2019re overenforcing in this way. Let\u2019s improve the classifier, right? Let\u2019s adopt a technological solution to this problem. But what they said this week is we\u2019re done trying to fix any of it. We are just abandoning the project altogether.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So that is a lot about what of these changes. I want to talk now about the why of these changes. I think there is an obvious explanation. The one that has been popular among the critics that I\u2019ve been reading and talking to over the past couple of days is the political opportunism angle, which is \u2014 this is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s attempt to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration. It\u2019s all business. It\u2019s all strategy. It\u2019s all cynical and probably all temporary until the next administration comes in. What do you make of that explanation for why these changes were made now?\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo I think that there is a lot of truth to it. I think another factor that is in there \u2014 and we\u2019ve talked about this on the show a bit \u2014 is that trying to be a good Democrat just didn\u2019t really get Mark Zuckerberg anything. After the 2016 US presidential election and the huge backlash against Meta in particular that it created, Zuckerberg tried to say, whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, I hear that you\u2019re super mad. I\u2019m going to try to fix this. And so they went out, and they built all these fancy machine learning classifiers to try to improve the service. And at the end of the day, I don\u2019t think Democrats really liked him 1 percent better than they did before he did any of that. So you have to remember that politics is transactional, and people vote for people who they think they can get things out of. By the end of 2024, I think it was very clear to Mark Zuckerberg, he was truly not going to get one thing out of the Democrats. But then along comes Donald Trump. And Donald Trump has this really interesting relationship with Elon Musk where Elon Musk used to be a liberal guy too. He had a bunch of bog-standard liberal positions. But then he changed his views for whatever reason, gave a bunch of money to Trump. Trump said, hey, I like this guy. I\u2019m going to give him every political advantage that he wants. And Mark Zuckerberg is a pretty smart guy. And he thought, oh, well, you know what? Maybe I could do the same thing.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. Well, I mean, I think the one thing that we know about the values of Mark Zuckerberg and Meta is that they are an extremely efficient organism at self-preservation. They will do anything to stay relevant and stay ahead. They will copy features. They will change the name of the damn company. We know that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s own views on speech are very flexible. They tend to shift as the political winds shift. But I also think there\u2019s another potential why here, which is about Mark Zuckerberg personally and his own shifting political allegiances. I\u2019ve been talking recently with some folks who know Mark Zuckerberg or who have worked with him in the past. And what they have said to me is that this is a man who is following a very conventional sort of former Democrat turned Republican arc, right? He is a man. He\u2019s 40 years old. He\u2019s sort of approaching middle age. He\u2019s very into these male-coded hobbies like mixed martial arts. He spends a lot of time talking with Joe Rogan and hanging out with Dana White. And he\u2019s just sort of enmeshed in this manosphere outside of work. And he\u2019s also been the target of a lot of criticism from especially the left. And one thing that we know about successful men who get targeted by left-wing opprobrium is that they often respond to that by becoming sort of disaffected former liberals who embrace the right because they feel like they\u2019re getting a more fair treatment. So I just want to put that out there. I can\u2019t prove this theory, but some people who know Mark Zuckerberg have floated it to me that he has actually become personally quite red-pilled or conservative over the last few years. Now, obviously, he\u2019s not Elon Musk. He\u2019s not broadcasting his political opinions on social media dozens of times a day. He\u2019s been more careful about signaling which team he\u2019s on. But I just offer this as a theory because I think we\u2019re starting to see more evidence that his own views may have shifted quite a bit independent of what\u2019s good for Meta.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, I mean, I think that there was a version of all of this that was less extreme. And that if Zuckerberg himself were more truly liberal or progressive in his heart, we would not have seen these changes. So I do think that the changes that they announced this week offer some evidence for what you just said.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAlso, my colleagues Mike Isaac and Teddy Schleifer reported last year that Mark Zuckerberg has begun referring to himself as a classical liberal, which, if you\u2019ve ever watched a right-wing YouTube video, is what every former liberal who has now become a Republican says. They call themselves classical liberals. So I\u2019ll just put that out there. That is a code word. So OK, last question about the implications of these changes, do you think that we are going to see an exodus of liberal and progressive users from Meta Platforms the way that we did from X after Elon Musk took it over?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, it depends on how all of these changes play out. And we\u2019re just not going to know for a while. My assumption is that Meta will continue to do a significantly better job at moderation than X does. It\u2019s a much bigger company. It has more infrastructure in place. And so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get this sort of overnight transformation you got with Elon Musk. Also, Facebook and Instagram, they\u2019re just structured very different than X is. Zuckerberg, I don\u2019t think, can really take over those platforms in terms of the actual posts that you\u2019re seeing and the feed the same way that Elon does. So I would be somewhat surprised by that. On the other hand, if Facebook and Instagram do truly come to feel like seventh grade playgrounds at recess, and the discourse just gets much rougher and coarser, I do think you\u2019re going to see people walking away from it. Because while we almost only ever discuss content moderation in terms of the politics of it, the truth is, there\u2019s a huge commercial demand for it. People do not want to spend time on networks that are full of violence and harassment and abuse and gore and porn. And that is the main reason why all of these companies build systems to remove those things or suppress them. So the real question, I think, Kevin, is how far ultimately does Zuckerberg go in this direction? Because whatever the politics might be, the vast majority of his users just want a safe and friendly place to hang out online.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. OK, so that is where we are with Meta today and what some of the implications will be. Do you have any more predictions about where this will all head?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI have a really fun one for you, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo Meta has told its partners in this fact checking partnership that it has been funding for the past several years that their contracts will end in March. So in March, the fact checks on Meta properties are going to end. The Community Notes product that Meta is planning to build, which is essentially a volunteer content moderation system, that\u2019s going to take a little bit longer to build. So that means, Kevin, that you and I can look forward to fact-free spring on Facebook.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s go.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe can truly say the craziest things, and not one person is going to be able to stop us. And let me just say, I\u2019m cooking up some whoppers. The things I\u2019m about to say on Facebook and Instagram, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re going to want to follow me.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. So follow Casey over at Threads.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd let\u2019s just say start piling up the drafts now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBecause the purge is coming, and you\u2019re ready.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m ready for the purge. [MUSIC PLAYING] When we come back, Oh, say, can o3 forge a new path forward for AGI?\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, we\u2019ll go with that. Well, Casey, we have more news from over the break about one of our favorite topics, AI.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBoy, do we. It was a huge couple of weeks for AI, Kevin, during a time of year when, normally, the news cycle gets pretty slow.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI was wondering about that. Because usually in December, people are sort of getting ready to go on holiday break. The news trails off, but not this year. The AI labs were sort of trampling all over each other to try to get their big news out before the end of the year.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, and I think it was led by OpenAI, which, of course, announced their 12 days of Shipmas where they tried to announce something big, something small every day for 12 days. And they did wind up ending on something pretty important, I think.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. So this is all moving very fast. There\u2019s a lot to catch up on today. And I want to take some time to really dig into what happened and what we can expect for the first few months of the new year. But before we get into all that, Casey, you have something to tell us.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI do. So Kevin, of course, our listeners\u2019 trust is of paramount importance to us. And so I wanted to let folks know about something that happened in my life that I just think I want to be upfront about, which is that at the end of 2023, I met a man who had many wonderful qualities. One of those qualities that I loved was that he worked for a company I\u2019d never heard of which meant, fine, I could keep doing my job as normal. But as of this week, Kevin, my wonderful boyfriend started a job at a company we talk about sometimes on the show. He\u2019s a software engineer at Anthropic.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs his name Claude?\n\ncasey newton\n\nMany people have written to me, asking me if I fell in love with Claude. And while I do find it to be very useful for some things, no, this was a human man that I am currently in love with.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019ve met him. He\u2019s real. I can confirm. He\u2019s wonderful. But yes, you are disclosing that you have this new \u2014 let\u2019s call it an entanglement because this is a company that you and I talk about, that you also cover in Platformer. And so we just wanted our listeners to know that this is happening out in the world and in your life. Is there anything more you want to say about this?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I mean, people have some questions about this. I did not play any role in my boyfriend getting this job. Anthropic didn\u2019t know about our relationship before this happened. Of course, we have since told them about this. I do plan to continue writing, reporting about Anthropic because I think it\u2019s a really important company. But whenever I do that, I\u2019m going to remind you that this relationship exists. A couple other things that I would say, my boyfriend and I do not have any financial entanglements. We do not currently live together. But I\u2019m also going to commit to updating folks as that changes. Basically, I\u2019m going to try to do the same job that I always do, try to bring the same skeptical critical eye that I do to everything. But I\u2019m also just going to remind you that I have this relationship. But if you have questions about that, email the show hardfork@nytimes.com. I will try to answer any respectful questions that I can about this.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNow, Casey, I will just editorialize and add a little bit here to your disclosure, which I think is laudable. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing it. And I\u2019m glad you did it in your newsletter. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing it on the podcast. I have known you for a long time. I have known how hard you have tried to avoid dating men who work in the technology industry,\n\ncasey newton\n\nI truly have. I mean, for more than 10 years, Kevin, I would be on apps like Tinder. And I would see that somebody cute worked at a Google, Meta, Twitter, you name it. And I would just always swipe left because I thought, I don\u2019t need that drama in my life. I don\u2019t need that complication.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhich is tough in San Francisco because everyone works in tech. It is a very small town. And the number of eligible bachelors out there who do not work at one of the companies you cover limits your dating pool considerably.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt really did. And it sort of explains why I was mostly single for the last 10 years. And I thought, well, I finally found something that sort of gets me out of it. But sometimes life just has other plans for you, and you have to roll with the punches.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo here I am.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, anyway, thank you, Casey, for that disclosure. I think transparency is very important. We are obviously going to keep talking about developments in AI at Anthropic and elsewhere. But we will also put this disclosure in the way we do when we talk about OpenAI and the fact that the New York Times company is suing OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright violations.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd when I disclosed this in my newsletter this week, Kevin, one reader actually replied that they thought it was cute that I would now have a disclosure to go along with your disclosure that you do every week. So we\u2019re sort of now 1 for 1.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, let\u2019s proceed to the real meat of this segment, which is about AI news.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBecause so many things happened.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTruly. So let\u2019s start by talking about OpenAI. We\u2019ve already made the disclosure. We don\u2019t have to do that one again. This was a big month for OpenAI. On December 20, they announced a new model called o3. This was a successor to o1. Funnily, they skipped o2 in the naming process because of a lawsuit threat from O2, the telecom company.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it was a threat. They said they did it out of respect. But yes, presumably, there would have been some sort of legal problems.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. So they skipped right over o2 to o3. This model is not yet available for users, but they did give of preview of it to some researchers. And they also talked about how it had performed on some benchmark evaluations. Casey, tell us about o3.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhat is o3? So o3 is a large language model, Kevin, like you would already find in ChatGPT. But it is built in a different way. And it\u2019s known as a reasoning model. And the reasoning models are a little bit different. A main way that they are different is how they are trained. So they are trained to try to be better at handling logical operations and structured data. The second big way that they are different is that when you make a query, you type into the little box whatever you want it to do, the reasoning model takes longer to go over it. It uses more computing power. It will take multiple passes through the data. And it will really try to bring true reasoning to what it is looking at. And so the result of taking more time, doing more passes, being structured in a slightly different way, is that it can perform a lot better on very complicated tasks. And what OpenAI found with o3 is that they were actually able to get way further on some of the hardest benchmarks ever designed for LLMs to pass than anything that has come before them.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. We talked a little bit about this idea of test time inference or test time compute back when we discussed o1, the previous reasoning model. But this is basically a different step than the classic pre-training step of building a large language model. This is something that happens when the user makes the query, instead of just spitting out an answer right away, it goes through the secondary test time step. And that is something that researchers were very excited about when o1 came out. They thought, OK, maybe if we are tapping out the limits of the pre-training step, maybe there is a new scaling law developing around this test time or inference compute. And maybe if we pour more resources into that step, the models will get better along a different axis. And so what people were very excited about when o3 came out was that it looks like that actually worked.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes. And now, this stuff is not yet in the hands of everyday users. But OpenAI did enter this o3 model in this really fascinating public competition known as the ARC Prize. You know the ARC Prize, Kevin?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo the basic idea with the ARC Prize is they try to come up with problems that would be insanely difficult for an LLM to solve. And one of the ways that they\u2019re difficult, by the way, is that they are original problems. So these problems are known to not be in the training data of any of these models because, of course, one of the criticisms of the LLMs is essentially, oh, well, you already have all that data stored. You just essentially did a quick search. So this prize says, no, no, no, we\u2019re not going to you search. You actually are going to have to show that you can reason your way through something really difficult. So this ARC-AGI-1 public training set has been around since at least 2020. And at that time, Kevin, GPT-3, previous OpenAI model, got a 0 percent. So just four or five years ago, we were at 0 percent. In 2024, last year, GPT-4o got to 5 percent. With o3, it gets to 75.7 percent in one evaluation where the limit was could only spend $10,000 on computing power. In a second test where they let OpenAI spend as much money as they wanted, which we actually think it was more than $1 million, o3 hit 87.5 percent on this model. So something that was essentially impossible through all of 2024, almost instantly, we have now hit 87.5 percent of that benchmark. And that is essentially the only public data we have about how good this thing is. But man, did that get people\u2019s attention.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, it got people\u2019s attention. I also saw a lot of people paying attention to o3\u2019s performance on something called Codeforces. This is a programming competition benchmark. And this is one way that these AI companies try to assess how good their models are at coding. OpenAI\u2019s o3 received a rating on Codeforces of 2,727. That is roughly equivalent to about the 179th best human competitive coder on the planet. And just for context, Sam Altman, in presenting this result, mentioned that only one programmer at OpenAI has a rating higher than 3,000 on Codeforces.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo why does this matter? Well, you think about some of the discussion that was happening at the end of 2024, Kevin. And you started to hear people saying, we are hitting a scaling wall. This was the phrase, right?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd the idea was the techniques that we used to build the previous LLMs were just sort of running out of the low-hanging fruit. And it\u2019s going to require some sort of conceptual breakthrough in order for them to continue improving. And o3 comes along and effectively does just that. And what I think is so important about these benchmarks and why we want to take some time today going through them is there\u2019s a lot of questions and criticism right now that is justified around, how much are these things being hyped up? We know that the companies love to hype up their products and tell us how incredible they are. But the benchmarks are something objective that you can actually use to measure their performance. And so when you have one of those benchmarks saying that there is now a model that is better than all but 179 people on Earth, well, it seems like we might be getting pretty close to superintelligence. Because what is superintelligence if not a system that is better than every human at something?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I would just add to that a little bit of a caveat, which is that these so-called reasoning models, they seem, from what we know about them so far, to be very good at the kinds of tasks that you can design what are called reward functions, for which are things that have sort of a definite right answer. Coding, either the code runs or it doesn\u2019t. Math has a definite right and wrong answer. So in these domains where you can give the reinforcement learning model a goal and the indicator of whether it is right or wrong in pursuing that goal, it tends to do very well, I think.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBut if you asked it, what is the meaning of true love? It would never know. It wouldn\u2019t know the first thing about it. And I think that\u2019s beautiful.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. So I think for the short term like the next year or two, we\u2019re going to have these early reasoning models that are very good and potentially even superhuman at some tasks, the kinds of tasks that have sort of definite right and wrong answers. But for other things like fiction writing or life coaching or these vaguer tasks that don\u2019t necessarily have one right and one wrong answer, they may not advance much beyond what we see today.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And some people will use that as an excuse to say, well, then this doesn\u2019t matter that much. And I would just point out that, at some point in your life, you\u2019re probably going to go see a surgeon. And that surgeon might be not that great of a painter. And it\u2019s not actually going to change the fact that the surgery that you got was very valuable. So I think it\u2019s important to think more in terms of what these things are capable of in the moment than what they are not capable of.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. The other thing from OpenAI that we should talk about quickly is that Sam Altman wrote a new blog post on January 5 called \u201cReflections,\u201d basically talking about some of his thoughts about the two years since ChatGPT was released. And the big headline from this blog post is that Sam Altman is claiming now that OpenAI knows how to build AGI, that the artificial general intelligence that people have been speculating about for years now, that OpenAI has been sort of hinting at, that they are within sight of that goal, and that he believes it could happen very quickly, and that they are already starting to look past AGI to ASI, to artificial superintelligence. So Casey, what did you make of this blog post?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, so I spent basically a day trying to figure out what exactly does Sam mean when he says that they know how to build AGI. And another thing that happened this week, Kevin, is that Sam did an interview with Josh Tyrangiel at Bloomberg. And one of the things that he tells Josh is \u2014 I\u2019m going to quote. \u201cI don\u2019t have deep, precise answers there yet. But if you could hire an AI as a remote employee to be a great software engineer, I think a lot of people would say, OK, that\u2019s AGI-ish.\u201d My interpretation based on conversations that I had this week is this actually is the destination that everyone has in mind for 2025. This is where the race is going. You are going to see all the big AI labs race to try to release a virtual AI coworker. And if they can do that, and if the coworker is pretty good, then they\u2019re going to say, this is actually what AGI is. Because at the moment, you can hire a sort of virtual entity to do some task or series of tasks in your companies that you no longer need a person for. That is where this entire thing has been driving the whole time.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I agree. And I think that it is just \u2014 it is not necessarily something that we need to accept uncritically, right? Sam Altman is a person with his own goals and motives. And OpenAI is \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd reward functions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd reward functions. And we should maybe apply some discount to what he says about his projections for AI because he does have a vested stake in the outcome. But I think we should also just use this as sort of sticking our finger in the wind of what conversations are happening in the AI scene in San Francisco. People here \u2014 I cannot emphasize this enough \u2014 are very sincere and very genuine about the fact that they believe that we are going to get AGI or something like it very, very soon, possibly this year.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And when you look at the improvement in these models that we saw in December alone, I think you have to take them seriously.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes. OK, moving on from OpenAI. Another thing that happened in December is that Google released Gemini 2.0, the new version of its flagship AI model. And Casey, have you tried it yet? What do you make of it?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI have not tried it yet, Kevin, because it is not in the consumer brand Gemini that I pay for, with the exception of they have this new feature called Deep Research, where you can ask Gemini to go and read the web and prepare a little report for you about something. I think I\u2019ve only used it one time. It seemed OK. To be candid with you, I have not followed the 2.0 stuff as closely because it just hasn\u2019t seemed as shocking or impressive as the OpenAI stuff. Have you?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019ve played around a little bit with Gemini 2.0, mostly in a series of demos that I got at Google before it came out. Some of what has been in there is sort of catching up with other models. Google also released a Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode, which was their first attempt at an inference time compute reasoning model, similar to o1 and o3 from OpenAI. I have not played around with Gemini Deep Research Mode yet, but I\u2019ve heard people talking about how cool it is, so I\u2019m excited to try that out. But people I trust, whose judgment I trust about this stuff say that this is basically Google sort of announcing that it is on the same trajectory as OpenAI and all the other companies that are its peers and rivals, that it is going to be scaling up very quickly in 2025, and that we should look forward to more there.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes. Although there was a post on X that went viral this week where someone asked Google, does corn get digested? And all of the image results are of AI slop that appear to be diagrams of corn and just make no sense whatsoever. And it\u2019s extremely funny. So maybe it\u2019ll be patched by the time this comes out. But if not, just go ahead and do an image search for \u201cdoes corn get digested?\u201d And you\u2019ll get a sense of where Google\u2019s AI search skills are at.\n\nkevin roose\n\nGot it. So in conclusion, Google is cooking in the AI department, but not much of this has gotten out into consumers\u2019 hands yet. And so I think that will be the question for 2025. Is this stuff actually as good as Google says it is?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. The third and final story that we\u2019re going to catch up on today from over the break is something out of a Chinese company called DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company. It\u2019s actually run by a Chinese hedge fund called High-Flyer. And right around Christmas, as my house was getting robbed, they released a new model called DeepSeek-V3 that ranks up there with some of the world\u2019s leading chat bots and caught a lot of people\u2019s attention.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And look, I have not used this one yet, but there\u2019s a few things to know about this one. One is that it\u2019s really big. It has more than 680 billion parameters, which makes it significantly bigger than the largest model in Meta\u2019s Llama series, which I would say, up to this point, has been the gold standard for open models. That one has 405 billion parameters. But the really, really important thing about DeepSeek is that it apparently was trained at a cost of $5.5 million. And so what that means is you now have an LLM that is about as good as the state of the art that was trained for a tiny fraction of what something like Llama or a GPT was trained for. I saw some speculation from this great blogger, Simon Willison, who said, it seems like the export controls that the US is placing on ships is actually inspiring these Chinese developers to get much better at optimizing. And indeed, you now have this state of the art model for $5.5 million. So this is a huge step toward the proliferation of LLMs everywhere.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, let me just back up and go a little more slowly through what you just described.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, OK.\n\nkevin roose\n\nBecause I think it\u2019s really important.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI was trying to go really slowly.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI need it slower.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI need the Deep Research Mode here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo one of the big questions over the past five or so years is about the Chinese AI industry and where they are relative to the leading frontier AI labs in the US, and whether we need to be doing more to slow them down, and if we even can slow them down, or if this stuff is just common knowledge. That as soon as someone invents a new way of doing AI, it spreads throughout the world, and there\u2019s not much you can do to stop it. One of the things that we\u2019ve done in the United States was to pass something called the CHIPS Act, along with a set of controls that basically limited which AI chips you could export to China. And we put a lot of faith in the ability of these restrictions to effectively constrain the Chinese AI industry. If they couldn\u2019t get the latest chips out of NVIDIA and other companies, they wouldn\u2019t be able to build models that were competitive with the state of the art US models. And that was one way that we were going to try to keep our national advantage. What DeepSeek, I think, has showed, or at least what they have hinted at, is the possibility that China is actually not that far behind. Because this model, whatever you think about it, I have not tried it myself, but according to its benchmarks, it is up there in many respects with the latest and greatest models from companies like OpenAI and Google and Anthropic. It is, according to some measures, the highest-ranking open source or open weights model that we have. And it does not appear to have needed the latest and greatest hardware to be trained on. According to the report that DeepSeek put out, they trained this new model, V3, at an estimated cost of about $5.5 million. And they did it not on the leading edge NVIDIA H100 or A100 chips that all the big AI labs use, but on a different version of NVIDIA chips known as the H800, which is basically just a less capable version of the state of the art chips from NVIDIA. And so I think what this all boils down to is the conclusion that regulating AI by limiting access to hardware is just going to be much more complicated than we thought. One interpretation would be that you actually can\u2019t stop China from building state of the art foundation models, and that our regulatory regime just isn\u2019t going to cut it when it comes to keeping the US ahead of China. What do you make of that?\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo I mean, the first thing I would say is I do get a little bit nervous when people frame the debate this way because I think a lot of the people who try to frame the AI story as a race between the United States and China are sort of very hawkish and leading us to a potential conflict that I would rather avoid. And it also presupposes that all of the American companies have to race as fast as they can. And they have to build AGI as fast as they can, even if it means cutting corners on safety. Because otherwise, this looming specter of China and everything that could happen. So I just would say we don\u2019t necessarily have to do that. We can choose to still move somewhat deliberately and with caution here. But do I think that this shows that it is going to be harder to prevent China from developing extremely high-end models, and that regulations will be more complicated? Yes, absolutely.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right, Casey, that is a small fraction of what happened in AI while we were gone.\n\ncasey newton\n\nBut probably the most important things.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think we covered most of what really mattered. And if there\u2019s one thing that we can be sure of in 2025, it\u2019s that we are going to be very busy talking about more AI changes and progress.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSomebody was telling me that if 2023 was the year that made everybody say, oh my gosh, AI is going so fast, and 2024 was the year that felt very business as usual, 2025 is the year where we could be going back to, oh my gosh, AI is going so fast. And then maybe it\u2019ll just feel like that all the time forever.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIsn\u2019t that a pleasant thought?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. So anyway, happy New Year.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI vertigo.\n\ncasey newton\n\nForever.\n\nkevin roose\n\nForever. When we come back, 2025\u2019s first game of \u201cHatGPT.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, Kevin, from time to time, we like to check in on some of the wilder headlines from the world of tech in a segment we call \u201cHatGPT.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes! [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nIn \u201cHatGPT,\u201d of course, we take headlines. We put them into a hat. We fish headlines out, discuss them for a bit. And when one or the other of us gets bored, we simply say, stop generating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWe have not done a \u201cHatGPT\u201d in a while, and there\u2019s been so much that I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s in the hat.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMe too. Well, let\u2019s. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and get us started?\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, I\u2019ll pick first.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right, this one is called \u201cMeta kills AI-generated people like proud Black queer mama.\u201d This is from Futurism. So this was sparked by a interview that was given by a Meta executive in the \u201cFinancial Times\u201d at the end of 2024, basically talking about their plans to let users create a bunch of AI profiles and sort of fake people and get them to share generated content on Meta platforms. And then people began discovering the existence of these older AI-generated profiles that Meta had started up back in 2023. And Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah posted on Bluesky about one AI-generated profile in particular that was described as a proud Black queer mama of two and truth teller named Liv. And Karen started chatting with this chat bot. She then posted her chat on Bluesky. And Meta, summarily, killed Liv and many of its other older AI personas.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis whole thing was so silly. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of just backlash against Facebook for this one because this truly is a case where you wonder, why are they doing any of this?\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd I think the answer would probably be that they saw Character AI have some success by letting people chat with all of these different sorts of characters. But I think where Character AI succeeded was they let you pretend like you were talking to Luke Skywalker or Spider-Man or characters that were very personally meaningful to you. Meta just made up a bunch of essentially generic humans and said, go nuts, and had them say generic things. And it just felt incredibly creepy to people, I think.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I think this is a case of an idea that needs to be taken out back and dispensed with. But Meta is not giving up on the idea of AI-generated personas. In fact, they have signaled that they intend to put more AI-generated personas inside all of their apps. And I\u2019m just fascinated to see what fresh horrors emerge when that happens.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHere\u2019s what I hope. I hope that at some point, Meta will be able to detect when you\u2019re harassing or abusing someone, which is, of course, now allowed under their new rules. And they just actually route you to an AI, so that the can absorb all of your prejudice and bigotry. It might be a nice solution.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI like that, like an AI punching bag.\n\ncasey newton\n\nExactly.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. OK, stop generating.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right. I feel like, normally, when it\u2019s my turn to pick, I get to shake the hat. But for some reason, this week \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nSorry.\n\ncasey newton\n\n\u2014 you\u2019ve decided you want to shake that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSorry.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK. I\u2019m just going to shake the hat, as it\u2019s my right. All right, here\u2019s one. \u201cApple agrees to pay a $95 million settlement in a Siri privacy lawsuit.\u201d Kevin, this is from Chris Velazco at \u201cThe Washington Post.\u201d \u201cApple has agreed to end a five-year legal battle over user privacy related to its virtual assistant, Siri, with a $95 million payout to affected customers, according to a preliminary settlement.\u201d Apparently, Kevin, Siri was a bit overzealous in listening for wake words like \u201cSiri.\u201d So when it thought it was being called into action, it would start recording audio that it wasn\u2019t supposed to. And a number of those clips somehow ended up in the hands of third-party contractors. Back in 2019, \u201cThe Guardian\u201d reported on Apple contractors regularly hearing confidential medical information, drug deals, and, of course, recordings of couples having sex. So if a judge signs off on the settlement, anyone who qualifies can submit a claim for up to five Siri-enabled devices for a max payout of $20 per device. So I guess my question to you is, would you be willing to let Apple listen to you have sex for $100? [LAUGHS] Because let me just say, I\u2019d go for it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo?\n\nkevin roose\n\nMy price is a little higher than that. No. But Casey, I saw this one making the rounds because people said, oh, finally, they\u2019re admitting that they listened to you through the microphone in your iPhone, which has been, of course, a favorite conspiracy theory of people, including critics of Meta for years now. There\u2019s no proof that is true. What this essentially seems to be saying is, it\u2019s not that this was sort of an omnipresent listening Siri that was listening when it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s that, obviously, Siri needs to be listening sort of ambiently in order to tell when a user says, \u201chey, Siri.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry if we just woke up your Siri on your iPhone, and you\u2019re no longer listening to this podcast because I just said that. But this is essentially saying it sounds like that it was a little miscalibrated to where it was listening more than it needed to be to listen for that wake word, or that it was recording more audio than it needed.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And I don\u2019t care about the actual incident, Kevin. And here\u2019s this reason. In the 14 years that Siri has existed, I think it\u2019s correctly understood me about four times. This is not a technology that ever knows what I\u2019m talking about for any reason. Siri could take an hour-long recording of me and have no idea what to do with it, so I don\u2019t care about that aspect. What I do care about is this is just going to fuel the most annoying conspiracy theory in tech, which is that all the tech companies are secretly listening to you. So yeah, we\u2019re just going to see a lot more conspiracies around this. And it is super unfortunate because, again, this is only Siri we\u2019re talking about. It doesn\u2019t know anything.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, it\u2019s not that serious.\n\ncasey newton\n\nStop generating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK. This one is from \u201cThe Athletic.\u201d \u201cNetflix\u2019s WWE investment and the future of live events on the platform, quote, \u201cwe\u2019re learning as we go.\u201d Starting January 6, the story says, the WWE\u2019s popular weekly wrestling show \u201cRaw\u201d will stream exclusively on Netflix in the United States. This is part of a decade long agreement worth a reported $5 billion.\u201d And Casey, as \u201cHard Fork\u2019s\u201d resident WWE fan and expert, why don\u2019t you take this one on?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, Kevin, I mean, did you watch?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo, I did not.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, you missed something huge, which is that Roman Reigns beat his cousin Solo Sikoa in a tribal combat match, winning back the Ula Fala, and becoming the one Tribal Chief of the World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs that true?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat is all true. It was a great match. It was a really fun show. And I think it looked great. WWE positioned this as a really huge thing for them. And it is. It\u2019s also huge for Netflix. From WWE\u2019s perspective, now they can be in something like 280 million homes around the globe. For Netflix, they get to experiment with some of this live programming, which they\u2019ve been dipping their toes into. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of speculation about whether they might soon go after more traditional sports, so maybe they want to get a big football deal, a big baseball deal. And so I\u2019m very interested to see how these two things work together. And I\u2019m very interested to see who Cody Rhodes will be fighting at WrestleMania this year.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI did see the \u2014 I mean, obviously they did the big Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight. That was on Netflix. I also saw on Christmas Day, they had some live football on Netflix.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDo you think this is hastening the death of cable TV? Or do you think it\u2019s just that was sort of already happening, and this is just Netflix trying to pick up the pieces?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI absolutely do. I watch, in addition to WWE, another wrestling promotion, AEW. And the reason that I had my YouTube TV account, which cost me something like $80 a month, was so that I could watch AEW programming because that is only available on cable. Well, guess what, Kevin? AEW started streaming on Max. And so I was able to cut the cord once again. And now, I am fully streaming again. So yes, as these sort of live events that have these intense, weird fandoms move from traditional cable to streaming, it absolutely becomes a moment where more people cut the cord.\n\nkevin roose\n\nNow, this is a little bit of a tangent, but I did have an interesting moment over the break where we were stuck in a motel in Lake Tahoe. And our iPad that we use to sometimes entertain our child had run out of battery.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, no.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd so I was forced to turn on the hotel TV and try to explain to my two-year-old son the concept of linear TV. And Casey, it blew his freaking mind. I was like, so on this screen, you can watch \u201cBluey\u201d sometimes, but not all the time. And you can\u2019t pick a specific episode. And then about twice an episode, they\u2019re going to interrupt the episode to try to sell you toys. And he was just so confused by the concept of linear TV that I thought, this industry probably does not have a long time left.\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo, It doesn\u2019t. Your child knows.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll right, we\u2019ll stop generating. Now, oh, this was a fun one. So the YouTuber MegaLag posted a video on December 21 titled \u201cExposing the Honey Influencer Scam.\u201d And ever since, Kevin, YouTube has been overtaken by discussion of what honey did.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. This in the world of YouTube creators was probably the biggest news story of the year.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard much about it outside of YouTube because of the way that insular platform works. But essentially, this was a massive scandal among major YouTubers over the holidays. Maybe we should just explain what happened for people who are not glued to YouTube 24/7.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think we should. So Honey is a company that was acquired by PayPal a while back. And they are a browser extension. And the idea is, before you go to checkout online, before you make an online purchase, you click the Honey button. And Honey will scan the landscape for the best coupon. Because often, if you have a coupon code, you can get a little discount. And so Honey went out to a bunch of YouTubers and signed these deals. And they said, hey, please go ahead and promote Honey. And the reason that this is important is that these sort of coupon codes are a big part of the creator economy. We\u2019ve talked on this show in the past about affiliate links. A lot of the internet is built on companies that sell things, giving a little kickback to people who talk about their things.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I think before we say what the allegations against Honey are, we should just set the scene for people who are not YouTube heads. The relationship between \u2014 Honey was maybe the most prominent advertiser on major mainstream YouTube channels. I mean, I would say that Honey sponsorships propped up YouTubers and YouTube content creation in a similar way that online mattresses propped up the podcast industry for a couple of years. Major, major YouTube influencers \u2014 David Dobrik, Emma Chamberlain, the Paul brothers, Marques Brownlee \u2014 these people, many of them had major deals with Honey to underwrite their channels.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo they were basically ubiquitous. It was hard to watch a lot of YouTube a couple of years ago without running into Honey ad after Honey ad.\n\ncasey newton\n\nRight. So what are the allegations that MegaLag publishes? Well, it\u2019s two things. One is that \u2014 and this is just sort of hiding in plain sight on Honey\u2019s website. Honey will actually go to online retailers and charge those retailers money to keep their best codes out of the Honey database. So let\u2019s say you have your online store, and you have a crazy 80 percent coupon that you gave out, Honey will say, oh, we\u2019ll make sure that no Honey user actually ever sees that coupon code. So Honey\u2019s straightforward about that, but it\u2019s obviously a terrible user experience, right?\n\nkevin roose\n\nBecause the way Honey works in a nutshell is there are these coupon codes. People had their sites where you can go look up coupon codes before you buy something, try to find a 10 percent or 20 percent coupon. Honey will basically go out and scour the internet for these codes for you, and then automatically apply them to your purchase in your browser for basically any e-commerce website that has these codes.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSave you a little money while you\u2019re out shopping.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. And if that had been all that Honey was doing, this wouldn\u2019t have been a scandal. But then there was the second allegation from MegaLag, Kevin. And that was that when people would see products in these influencer videos, and they would go to buy them, those shopping carts would often get the creators\u2019 affiliate link inserted. So the creator would then get a kickback, which is, of course, the whole point that creators like to work with these companies that share affiliate links, and so they can get a little bit of money. And the allegation is that Honey was going in at the end of this process and replacing the creators\u2019 affiliate link with Honey\u2019s affiliate link. So Honey got to keep all of the affiliate revenue and cut the creators out of the process.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo let\u2019s just walk through this step by step, OK? So I am watching a major YouTubers video.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou\u2019re watching the Hard Fork channel.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m watching the Hard Fork channel. We don\u2019t actually have affiliate links in our videos. But if say we did, say we\u2019re say we\u2019re out there. We\u2019ve got an online mattress company that we have a promo deal with. And every time you go and buy a mattress and enter the code \u201cHARDFORK\u201d at checkout, you get percent off. The allegation was that, Honey, in the instances where a user went to go buy a mattress from our affiliate link, if they used Honey in their browser, Honey would find that affiliate link and replace it with the Honey affiliate link. And so instead of getting a kickback on that sale ourselves, that money would instead go to Honey.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat is exactly right. And so people are quite mad about this. There\u2019s a channel called LegalEagle that is suing them, which I know nothing about LegalEagle, but I have to say, that sounds exactly what a YouTube channel named LegalEagle would do \u2014 would just be to sue one of their advertisers. When The Verge asked PayPal, by the way, about all of this, PayPal said, quote, \u201cHoney follows industry rules and practices, including last-click attribution.\u201d And what I take that to mean is that the industry rules and practices is horrible. And Honey is not doing one thing to try to improve on them in any way. So this was really a case where creators took a look at the situation. And they said, I don\u2019t think so, Honey. And that\u2019s a lost cultural reference.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd I would just say that I think this is a case of people just really being naive about how the internet works. Honey was a very popular, very profitable. So profitable and popular that PayPal acquired it. And people just \u2014 really, YouTubers just thought they were out there providing these coupon codes to people out of the goodness of their hearts. And I just want to say, bless your heart if you thought that\u2019s what Honey was about.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYoutubers are telling Honey to mind their own beeswax.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll stop generating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, last one. \u201cLA Tech entrepreneur nearly misses flight after getting trapped in robotaxi. Passenger Mike Johns was reportedly riding in an autonomous Waymo car on the way to the Phoenix airport when the vehicle began driving around a parking lot repeatedly, circling eight times as he was on the phone seeking help from the company.\u201d Did you see this video?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI did see this.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis was so wild. So he initially believed it was a prank, he told \u201cThe Guardian.\u201d And then he sort of gets on the phone with the support person at Waymo as he\u2019s inside this car that is just circling the parking lot. And it won\u2019t let him out. And as a result, he almost missed his flight.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think this is every Waymo support person\u2019s fantasy is that one day, you just pick a random Waymo. And you just start driving it around in circles in the parking lot with no explanation. Maybe you\u2019re teaching your kid how to drive or something like that. No, this would obviously be somewhat disconcerting, but it is also hilarious. And I have to say, if I made a list of the 10 worst things that ever happened to me in an Uber, for example, driving around in a circle eight times would not make the top 10.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I\u2019ve almost missed my flight several times because of Uber drivers just thinking they know a better way to the airport. So yes, I would say we shouldn\u2019t make light of this. People are placing their life in Waymo\u2019s hands when they get into one of these autonomous cars. And I did see some people saying, see, this is why I would never trust a self-driving taxi. And I do think it\u2019s worth taking these incidents seriously at the same time. No one was hurt. This was a case of clearly some little software glitch or something or some issue with them. I don\u2019t think they ever got to the bottom of what happened here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nLook, here\u2019s another way of thinking about it. Maybe this is a final destination situation where if the Waymo had gotten immediately on the freeway, maybe there would have been a terrible accident. But something in the training said, no, we need to stay in this parking lot. We\u2019re going to drive around in eight circles. And that will reset the timeline and ensure that Mike makes it safely to the airport. It\u2019s something to think about.\n\nkevin roose\n\nDo you know how airport Wi-Fi sometimes makes you watch an ad before you can get the free Wi-Fi?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes, yeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis is giving me an evil business idea, which is like, oh, you want to get out of your Waymo and make your flight? Time to click over to Honey.\n\ncasey newton\n\nComplete your purchase with Honey if you want us to stop circling this parking lot. [LAUGHS]\n\nkevin roose\n\nGod, someone out there is taking notes. I\u2019m so sorry. All right, stop generating. That is \u201cHatGPT.\u201d Casey, it is so good to be back with you in the studio, doing one of our favorite games.\n\ncasey newton",

            "content": "Yesterday at CES, in a Meta Showroom, I was finally able to try the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and especially their experimental AI features! Let me tell you everything about this experience.\n\n(As usual, let me remind you that since I had just a few minutes to try the device, this can\u2019t be considered an exhaustive review, but just a \u201cfirst impression\u201d article. Take everything written here with a grain of salt)\n\nDesign\n\nOne of the reasons why Ray-Ban Meta has been such a success is because it is made by Ray-Ban. With much respect for the work of Meta\u2019s engineers, one of the main reasons why people buy Ray-Ban Meta glasses is because they have a Ray-Ban design and so they look good on the face. The glasses are very thin and stylish: when I wore them, I thought that they didn\u2019t exactly suit me, but they were good-looking anyway. Let me share with you some photos of the device, so you can see it from different points of view:\n\nEven the case is pretty cool: the one I\u2019ve been shown was made in some sort of leather and had a classy design. On the bottom, it featured a USB-C port for charging the device. The little button that is used to open the case also features a colored ring that is green when the glasses are fully charged and then goes orange when the case is charging the glasses: this is very handy for checking the battery status of the device. Let\u2019s have a look at the case, too!\n\nThe design of the case is pretty cool\n\nThe USB port used to charge the case\n\nThe green light shows the glasses are ready to be used\n\nThis is how the glasses fit into the case\n\nI loved the design of the glasses and the case. I guess it was to be expected: we Italians know how to design good-looking things!\n\nComfort\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta glasses feel like standard glasses. I\u2019ve not worn them for hours to tell you if the few grams they are heavier than a standard frame make any difference. In the 10 minutes I used them, I had no problems at all: I felt them as very lightweight.\n\nPhotos and Videos\n\nMeta people let me try to record a few photos and videos with the device. To do that, you can use vocal commands, and say \u201cHey Meta, take a picture/video\u201d or something like that, or you can use the button that is on the right frame (short press for photo, long press for video). In any case, the glasses emit a short sound to signal that they understood your command and then they turn on the white status led to signal to the people around you that you taking images from the camera.\n\nThe top button to use to take pictures and videos\n\nThe camera is a 12MP one, so it can record photos up to 3024 x 4032 pixels and videos up to 1080p. The videos are recorded with spatial audio thanks to the 5 mics installed on the glasses. One of the Meta people walked around me while I was recording the video, and when we tried the playback of the video on the phone, with the audio routed through the glasses, I could feel her voice moving from one ear to the other. That was pretty cool.\n\nThe quality of the recorded videos is pretty nice: yes, you can obtain much better quality with the latest flagship smartphones, but it is still very good for something that is so small and lightweight. You can see a video I recorded at the booth here below and judge by yourself.\n\nPhotos and videos are shot and temporarily saved on the device. You can then transfer them to your phone via the companion app.\n\nAudio\n\nI\u2019m not an audio expert, so I can\u2019t tell you about the quality of the speaker in deeper detail. I have an average ear, and for me, the audio quality was good. The glasses were also definitely loud: I was in a noisy showroom, and I could hear perfectly what the glasses were telling me. Even more, I remember that when the glasses were speaking loud, I had difficulties understanding what the Meta hostess, who was close to me, was saying. I was impressed on this side.\n\nOne of the two speakers on the temples of the glasses\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe glasses turn on a small white light on the right temple when the camera is on. This is to warn the people around that there is the possibility that you are recording them. After reading so many complaints about it, I thought this light was almost invisible, while actually, it is noticeable if you are close to the device. The major problem to me is that no one outside our circle knows what that white dot means, so even if people see it, they don\u2019t know it means there is a privacy risk for them.\n\nThen of course, we have to mention the elephant in the room: Meta has not exactly been a champion in caring about the privacy of the users in the past. So if you wear a Meta device with cameras on your face, you have to consider the risk that some operations you do that involve cameras may mean that some of the data of what you see is sent to Meta.\n\nExperimental AI features\n\nTrying on Meta Glasses and their AI features\n\nAt Meta Connect, Mark Zuckerberg announced upcoming AI features for Meta Ray-Ban glasses that could transform the glasses into assistants that help you in your everyday life. These features have not been released to the public yet (and I\u2019ve not been provided a timeline), because they are still in private beta. They are of course available to Meta people and they let me try them so that I could get a glimpse of the future.\n\nAI assistant\n\nInstead of asking a single question to the Meta AI every time, it will be possible to start a continuative AI session by saying something like \u201cHey Meta, start an AI session\u201d. From that moment on, until you say \u201cEnd session\u201d, the camera will be always on, and the AI will be in conversational mode. The glasses will always be aware of what you have around you so that the AI can support you in your activities. It is nice that you must explicitly start a session like that: this way it is you that decide when the glasses are always on and start capturing your surroundings. Privacy-wise, this is what we should have to avoid having glasses that can spy on us every moment of our lives.\n\nI tried this feature in front of a big shelf full of objects, that also featured some example questions I could ask the AI. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t follow the suggestions\u2026\n\nThe shelves full of objects in the Meta Showroom\n\nAs soon as I started the AI session, I looked at the Meta hostess helping me and said \u201cWho is this person?\u201d. Meta AI answered it can not provide details on people: this is good on the privacy side. I so looked at a toy car and asked what it was. The AI answered correctly, as it was expected. I did the same with some magazines, having a small conversation about them. Then I decided to see how much the AI was able to resonate with the past: I asked what was the first question I asked, and it correctly remembered it was about the Meta hostess. So I decided to throw a curve ball: I looked again at the hostess and I asked if she was the same person I was framing during the first question. Meta AI answered it can\u2019t answer about people. So I looked at another car toy on the shelf, and I asked Meta AI if it was the same car I was looking at in the beginning (when I asked it to tell me what a specific car toy was). Meta AI answered \u201cYes, it is the same car\u201d, but it was not true. I so corrected it by saying \u201cNo, it is not the same car\u201d, and at that point, the AI answered, \u201cAh no, it\u2019s not the same car\u201d. No shit Sherlock, I\u2019ve just said it, it\u2019s too late to change your answer! I then asked Meta AI to remember where I was putting a specific object, but the AI answered that it could not do that during a live session, which sounded pretty weird to me.\n\nThe impression I had is that the AI system works pretty well for standard questions like \u201cWhat is this\u201d, and \u201cHow do you do that\u201d, but the moment you start making it more complex questions that require it to be more context-aware, it still has problems. From the hands-on review articles I\u2019ve read, it seems that Gemini on Android XR is better in this sense. But let\u2019s also remember that these Meta AI features are experimental and not released yet, so they may still improve.\n\nAI translation\n\nThe experience I had was similar to the one showcased by Mark Zuckerberg at Meta Connect this year\n\nThe Meta hostess wanted also to showcase to me the live AI translation features of the glasses. We wanted to make a session where she was speaking Spanish and I was speaking Italian, but it seems that at the moment at least one of the two languages should be English (which is a bit disappointing to me). So we decided that she was speaking Spanish and I was speaking English. She was speaking to me on the phone, and I could hear the translation in English of what she was saying through the speakers of the glasses. I was then answering in English, and she could read the translation in Spanish of what I was saying on the companion app of the glasses on the phone.\n\nThe system worked fairly well, but not without some hiccups. First of all, the LLM needs some time to do the translation, so the conversation can not be very fluid because every time someone speaks, the other one has to wait 2-3 seconds to understand what has been said. Then, not everything that we said was translated: some parts of the sentences were omitted like if the glasses didn\u2019t hear them. The Meta person told me that this happened also because we were operating in a noisy environment and so some parts of the dialogues may have been lost.\n\nFinal impressions\n\nMe being very classy with my suit and my glasses\n\nRay-Ban Meta are very successful glasses for a reason: they are lightweight, stylish, and have few functionalities, but do them pretty well. The new upcoming AI features make them even more useful, letting us have an assistant who helps us whenever we need it. This is cool, but these features still need some fine-tuning before being released to the public. Of course, there is the problem of privacy to consider. But technology-wise, they are a pretty nice product.\n\nDisclaimer: this blog contains advertisement and affiliate links to sustain itself.

He noted that some platforms attempted to stem the tide. For example, they labeled content when it was scientifically inaccurate, made it harder for users to access misinformation, and added signals to help users find accurate information. He said that Meta\u2019s third-party fact-checking system was not perfect, but ending its use is unlikely to improve overall scientific accuracy on the platforms. \u201cWhether community notes will work or not is something that\u2019s worth independent evaluation,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding potential public health impacts, he said, \u201cWe know that exposure to misinformation can potentially lead to misbeliefs at variance with science,\u201d he said\u2014for example, about vaccines.\n\nHe offered several recommendations to combat misinformation. \u201cScientists, scientific institutions, and professional science societies can proactively promote accurate science information,\u201d he said.

(AP) \u2014 Joining companies such as John Deere and Walmart, Facebook and Instagram\u2019s parent company Meta Platforms Inc. is getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program that includes hiring, training and picking vendors, a company spokesperson confirmed on Friday.\n\nThe move, which was first reported by Axios, comes on the heels of the social media giant\u2019s decision to end its third-party fact-checking program and scale back policies on hate speech and abuse.\n\nCiting an internal memo sent to employees, Axios said the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said the U.S. Supreme Court \u201chas recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. \u2026 The term \u2018DEI\u2019 has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\u201d\n\nIn practice, this means Meta will no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and the company said it will instead \u201cfocus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d\n\nThe company will also end its \u201cdiverse slate approach\u201d to hiring, which meant that a diverse pool of candidates was considered for every open position.\n\nOther companies that have curbed DEI programs recently include McDonald\u2019s and automaker Ford as well as Walmart and farm equipment maker John Deere.\n\nAmazon also said it is halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees that Amazon shared on Friday, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been \u201cwinding down outdated programs and materials, and we\u2019re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don\u2019t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away.

The company will also move its content moderation team from California to Texas, lift restrictions designed to protect immigrants and LGBTQ+ people from hate speech and \u201cdial back\u201d penalties for rule-breakers.\n\n\u201cWhat started as a move to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video posted Tuesday. \u201cIt has gone too far.\u201d\n\nThe announcement has drawn praise from those who see it as a win for free speech and ire from critics who worry it will unleash a torrent of misinformation and hateful slurs.\n\nNathan Schneider, assistant professor of media studies, sees it as a wake-up call to users that it may be time to take back some control over social media platforms.\n\nNathan Schneider (photo courtesy Courtney McQueeney)\n\n\u201cThis should, above all, be a reminder that we have entrusted a few companies that are way too powerful with the stewardship of our public discourse. And this is not an acceptable arrangement,\u201d he said.\n\nCU Boulder Today sat down with Schneider to get his take on what happened and what could happen next.\n\nWhat just happened?\n\nWe\u2019re in a full-circle moment right now. In the wake of the first Trump election in 2016, lots of people were criticizing Facebook, now Meta, for spreading misinformation. So the company invested heavily in a complicated, bureaucratic operation to deal with it. Now, we are seeing a profound bow to political pressure to reverse those steps. At the same time, there\u2019s also a piece of an old Silicon Valley dream alive in this decision\u2014the idea that we don\u2019t need to pay people and third-party organizations to check facts, that we can do it with technological systems and crowdsourcing.\n\nWhat do you make of this?\n\nOn its surface, this idea of crowdsourcing fact-checking has a lot of appeal to it. It seems to be giving power back to the users. The basic idea that one company with one rule book should control the speech of the world has always been absurd. But the question is: Is the company really going to give up that power? I think the answer is almost certainly no. I worry that what's happening at Meta is something very similar to what we've seen at X: Under the guise of free speech and community control, we will see a consolidation of power and a relinquishment of responsibility.\n\nMeta is moving to a \u2018community notes\u2019 system, similar to X\u2019s. Doesn\u2019t that give more control to the user?\n\nCommunity Notes on X does allow users to add fact-checks to a post. But whether they actually appear and are prioritized depends on an algorithm that the company controls. Already, on X, we see a strong leaning toward partisan and often right-wing voices. It\u2019s replacing a bureaucracy for regulating speech with an algorithm that does it. And algorithms can make the consolidation of power easier.\n\nWill we see more misinformation?\n\nIf we look at the experience with Community Notes on X, I think it\u2019s very likely that this move will lead to more widespread misinformation and disinformation. X has made its network very difficult for researchers to study. But so far, external researchers have found that the majority of notes on misinformation are never displayed to users and that the system has not reduced engagement with misleading posts. If that is the model that Meta is promising to follow, this is a troubling development.\n\nWill we see more slurs against vulnerable populations here?\n\nRightly, many people are terrified. The company has been quite explicit that it is committed to tolerating and normalizing the discourse of the far right, which includes denying the dignity of people in many communities, particularly queer folks. This move reflects the kind of naked power that this company has always been able to exert over speech, and its ability to determine what the bounds of acceptable speech in society are.\n\nAs the political winds shift, the company appears to be embracing that shift across its networks. We should be asking ourselves whether we can continue to place so much trust in a company that can abruptly remove protections in this way.\n\nWhat opportunities do you see?\n\nWhat\u2019s hopeful to me is a growing movement of people embracing other kinds of social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky. These networks rely less on any single company and more on open protocols, just like the web itself. This means that users can have more control over their data and develop their own interfaces and algorithms. None of these technologies is a panacea, but they open the door for us to shift the question away from what we should hope Mark Zuckerberg will do and toward what we could do ourselves to change our online lives for the better.\n\nWhat can people do now?\n\nSocial media is not something anyone can change on their own. I think it's worth starting conversations with the people and organizations that you actually want to connect with and asking: Hey, where could we go that we would feel really at home in? And what kinds of steps can we take together to get there? Ultimately, these choices are social, and any moves we make to better spaces will have to happen collectively.\n\nWhat would these new social networks look like?\n\nThis year, my lab is running what we call the Open Social Incubator. We are working with 10 communities from around the world to explore what it takes to move to emerging networks that are more decentralized and democratically governed. In many respects, the future of a healthier social media could look more like the places we\u2019ve relied upon for information in the past. You could look at an example like Wikipedia\u2014a widely trusted utility on the internet that is mission-driven and organized as a nonprofit. Or maybe your local library could anchor a space on the internet for social conversations.\n\nBack in 2017, I co-founded Social.coop, a cooperatively governed Mastodon server where the users can make their own decisions about moderation policies. Although it took a lot of time to develop, I now reap the rewards in having a really healthy, pleasurable home for my online life. I hope that in the future more people will have that experience.",

            "content": "Today\u2019s rapidly evolving landscape of use cases that demand highly performant and efficient network infrastructure is placing new emphasis on how in-line amplifiers (ILAs) are designed and deployed.\n\nMeta\u2019s ILA Evo effort seeks to reimagine how an ILA site could be deployed to improve speed and cost while making a step function improvement in power efficiency.\n\nOver the past year, Meta has been on a journey to reimagine fiber optic in-line amplifier (ILA) sites. An important piece of network infrastructure, ILAs serve to amplify optical signals and are often placed in remote locations between data centers. If one ILA fails, an entire intercity route fails, and if one ILA cannot grow, the entire fiber route is constrained. Meta is excited to introduce new ideas and concepts to help modernize the ILAs for tomorrow.\n\nTo that end, we\u2019ve launched the ILA Evo effort to overcome the historic design constraints of today\u2019s ILAs, namely:\n\nThe minimal skilled labor and raw material required at the deployment site;\n\nThe requirement that buildings meet local snow, wind, and seismic load along with fire codes and health and safety regulation \u2013 plus lifespan greater than 25 years;\n\nThis new effort seeks to propel advancement through several new requirements:\n\nRequiring the building and inside plant (ISP) must be deployed in three to four days.\n\nReducing the need for specialized heavy equipment (avoiding the cost and time for heavy-lift cranes to travel to a remote site).\n\nMinimizing concrete (avoid cost and time to transport, form, tie rebar, pour, and cure concrete).\n\nReducing the power usage effectiveness (PUE) to less than 1.5 \u2013 nowhere near Meta\u2019s operational data center PUE average of 1.09 (2023 average), but an achievable and significant improvement.\n\nA short history of ILAs\n\nFiber optic cable networks have seen exponential growth in both size and capacity since GTE launched the first fiber optic network in 1977. U.S. network operators would install 20,039 mi (32,250 km) of intercity fiber routes by 1985. This would quadruple to 83,618 mi (134,570 km) by 1989 and double again to 159,779 mi (257,149 km) by 1998, with MCI, Sprint, USTelecom, and WilTel being the major players in those early days.\n\nAs fiber was rolled out along roads, railways, and pipelines, real estate to house optical signal repeaters was developed in parallel. What later became known ILA sites were spaced 18 to 25 miles (30 to 40 km) apart. With rapid improvements in both optical fiber purity and composition, plus advancements in optronics, spacing soon doubled into the 50 to 60 mile (80 to 100 km) range where it has largely remained until today.\n\nEarly ILA building designs were roughly modeled on Bell Telephone central offices, albeit a shrunken down version: concrete shells (or stick framed construction on a steel I-beam base) placed atop concrete foundations; wall-mounted HVAC units; -48V power distribution; lead-acid batteries; diesel backup generators and so forth surrounded by chain link fences.\n\nBuildings were constructed in a central location with ISP fitted into the shell before shipment to the site (via specialized motor carrier) and placed with a heavy-load crane. However, unlike the remarkable (and ongoing) advancements in fiber and optronics (e.g., CWDM to DWDM to Coherent DWDM), ILA sites themselves have received little attention.\n\nToday\u2019s ILA buildings are often larger, with more efficient HVAC systems. Components like security and building access systems have been modernized, but if you dropped a field technician from 1990 into one of today\u2019s ILAs, they\u2019d have little difficulty navigating. Historically, ILA sites haven\u2019t required significant evolution, however newfound capacity growth and innovation has warranted the development of new ILA approaches.\n\nThe structure of ILA Evo\n\nWorking with global engineering consultancy AECOM, we\u2019ve organized the problem and our engineering efforts into several categories: different building systems and foundations; a new ISP installation method; alternative ballistics protection; introducing more efficient cooling; and modernizing backup power systems.\n\nBuilding system\n\nIdentify lightweight building designs which can be flat packed for easy, quick shipment and unloaded at the deployment site using a lift gate. Our emphasis has been on buildings composed of fiberglass-reinforced polymer (FRP) aka glass-reinforced polymer (GRP) wall and roof panels light enough for two people to handle, but sturdy enough to meet our design needs. There is a robust ecosystem of companies offering solutions in this space. This approach also allows for slightly taller buildings than prefab to provide additional overhead space for HVAC system elements or other components.\n\nBuilding foundations\n\nWhere geology permits, utilize low- or no-concrete foundation designs for easier deployment into both greenfield and brownfield sites. Typically, ILA buildings sit atop slab-on-grade foundations with a perimeter edge return. This design works well in a variety of soil conditions and is well suited to the weights involved. However, as we pursue lighter buildings, other foundation designs become possible. In particular, the project has focused on steel or FRP I-beams over concrete pad footings or helical steel screw piles. Both options offer the potential for both lower cost and more rapid deployment.\n\nManufactured owner-furnished equipment ISP\n\nDevise a process for rapidly installing ISP to minimize post-construction interior dust and debris clean-up. We envision employing a manufactured owner-furnished equipment (MOFE) process for ISP: six rack modules consisting of equipment racks and overhead tiers supported by an exoskeleton, and movable on casters, are preassembled in a centralized, clean factory-like environment. Like the building system, these can be delivered on regular trucks with lift gates and modules rolled into the building to be bolted down.\n\nBallistics\n\nWhere required, provide appropriate ballistics protection; e.g., NIJ 0101.06 Level IIA. However, we felt assigning this function to the building system wasn\u2019t the only option, so we\u2019ve left open the possibility of ballistic privacy fences and other ideas as ways to solve this requirement which offers more flexibility for what \u201cinside the fence\u201d could look like.\n\nCooling\n\nThe single biggest opportunity to improve PUE lies in introducing more efficient cooling tech combined with higher temperature set points. PUE hasn\u2019t historically been a focus metric for small telecoms sites, but this needs to change. Traditional sites use self-contained, wall-mounted HVAC units that rely on large fans to force air through the building without a duct system. This approach works, but is not very efficient: North American ILA PUE is typically between 2.5 and 3.0. However, over the past few years, power requirements have moved from 600-800W per rack into the 2-4 kW range. With increasing power density, we began looking for other options which could do the job more effectively and efficiently (i.e., reduce PUE).\n\nMain elements:\n\nRadically improve ILA site HVAC efficiency with advanced passive (i.e., compressorless) and/or liquid-based cooling tech.\n\nBecause ILAs are unmanned, allow the building to run hotter: e.g., increase temperature set points from typical 22\u00b0C (72\u00b0F) to >35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F); most optical transport kit is GR-63-CORE NEBS-3 compliant and able to run continuously at 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F).\n\nThermally \u201cleaky\u201d building systems; i.e., not air leaks , but lower R-value walls.\n\nMove rectifiers and batteries into outdoor cabinets: more space for optical gear and less heat generation.\n\nUtilize cool surface materials and coatings (e.g., heat reflective paints) to further reduce solar heat load.\n\nThe project investigated many hyper efficient options such as chilled beams (ceiling mounted, air-to-liquid heat exchangers) combined with a ground-based heat exchange (water or glycol circulating in a closed, buried ground loop), but unfortunately, none could handle 24 x 2 kW. However, a loop thermosyphon system coupled with a high-efficiency compressor (a helper used during the hottest part of the hottest days) could achieve our PUE <1.5 goal. Similarly, scaled-down chiller and computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units supplying liquid cooling into a thoughtfully designed floor plan could get us to that same goal.\n\nThe project hasn\u2019t made a final selection yet as these technologies will make our goal of \u201cno cranes\u201d difficult to achieve, but we believe we have line-of-sight to a solution.\n\nBackup Power\n\nInvestigate modern alternatives to diesel generators and lead-acid batteries for standby power. We are considering substitutions for diesel generator backup that may include H2 fuel cells, capacitors, or other solutions based on location and commercial feasibility.\n\nAdditionally, we have investigated a range of battery technologies. At the moment, the economics aren\u2019t attractive for this scale. In the meantime, we believe an H2 fuel cell combined with a small NaNiCl molten salt battery system (to handle site load for a few minutes while the fuel cell spins up and takes load) is an attractive, low maintenance solution.\n\nMacro benefits of ILA Evo\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, ILA Evo brings potentially powerful commercial and risk management benefits: supply chain and ability to stockpile.\n\nStarting with the familiar current ILA supply chain, the chief advantage is completing the majority of work at a single site. However, this creates challenges in terms of cost, the complexity of scaling production up or down, and the difficulty and cost of transporting the necessary heavy equipment to remote sites. Additionally, the feasibility of stockpiling current ILA buildings is debatable: The space requirement would consume valuable real estate at the production site and staging them off-site simply amplifies the transportation issue to move them multiple times.\n\nLooking to ILA Evo and starting with a new disaggregated supply chain, many ISP materials and other items like HVAC units would most likely come from the usual sources, but these sources already tend to be scaled. Other elements such as the building system and MOFE ISP would be manufactured or assembled by companies that are not necessarily part of today\u2019s telecom ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the process is very different. Concrete and stick framed buildings are created via a construction process, the nature of which is bespoke and relatively low volume. ILA Evo is predominantly manufacturing or assembly processes, which are inherently geared toward scale, including the possibility of 24\u00d77 operations.\n\nNext, stockpiling. It\u2019s not hard to imagine manufacturing 500 building systems, packed efficiently and ready for next day shipment. One can also imagine 2,000 MOFE ISP modules (four for each 24 rack building) preassembled and ready to ship. Additionally, purchasing in bulk allows vendors to de-risk their own investments and achieve scales required for cost compression not possible with today\u2019s designs.\n\nCrossover with current ILA design\n\nOne final consideration is identifying ideas that could be retrofitted into existing sites. Putting aside a different building system and MOFE ISP, the HVAC system and the other \u201cefficiency tweaks\u201d could go into existing sites. Similarly, H2 fuel cell backup power could be applied. We also expect to explore substituting commodity ISP materials for their FRP analogs. If this works, FRP equipment racks and ladder racks (which have a lower carbon footprint than steel or aluminum) could also be an option for existing sites.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFollowing the completion of our research and design phase, there are a number of next steps planned for 2025:",

            "content": "The latest \u201cfree speech\u201d proclamation from a Big Tech billionaire has caused both alarm and a collective eyeroll. Digital rights activists say the debate over freedom of speech and content moderation has devolved into a partisan food fight without challenging the virtual monopolies that a few wealthy companies hold over our data and online experience.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announced on January 8 that Instagram and Facebook would remove third-party fact-checking teams and replace them with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system similar to that of Elon Musk\u2019s X, where users can flag posts for misinformation and clarifying comments are crowdsourced and added with X\u2019s approval. Despite lofty talk about \u201cfree speech,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement was quickly pegged by critics as a political move meant to appease Donald Trump, his incoming administration and its very online fan base.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s narrow electoral victory, Zuckerberg is only the latest billionaire mogul to show an unprecedented level of fealty to the incoming president. As reporters at Axios put it, Trump is entering office with \u201cever-expansive power\u201d as a result. Multiple major tech firms have made large donations to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, with Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI pledging $1 million each.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a content moderation expert to be able to look at this and see that Mark Zuckerberg is bending the knee to Trump,\u201d said Evan Greer, director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future, in an interview. \u201cThis is frankly what human rights experts have been concerned about for years, when we sort of play this game of working the referees in a game that the public always loses.\u201d\n\nIn his announcement, Zuckerberg promised \u201cmore speech and fewer mistakes\u201d on his massive platforms but admitted that content moderators would now \u201ccatch less bad stuff.\u201d The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit organization that promotes freedom of speech and digital rights, initially put out a cautiously optimistic blog post in response to Zuckerberg\u2019s move. Meta has in the past controversially blocked content that passes muster according to its own guidelines \u2014 just this week it was reported that Facebook wrongly censored LGBTQ content \u2014 and EFF supports good faith efforts to fix the problem. The group said Meta should focus on commonly censored but legitimate content posted by sex worker organizers or political dissidents outside of the United States, for example.\n\n\u201cThese are not \u2018us\u2019 issues, these are global issues,\u201d said David Greene, EFF\u2019s civil liberties director and coauthor of the blog post, in an interview. \u201cA lot of mistakes are made with political dissident speech in other [countries], so these are issues that are problematic all around the world.\u201d\n\nHowever, the EFF cautioned that Meta\u2019s decision to move content moderation teams from California to Texas in order to combat \u201cbias\u201d is clearly more political than practical and raises big questions about Zuckerberg\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just stupid. That\u2019s the most obvious political thing,\u201d Greene said, adding that the change reflects the biases of the U.S. political right. \u201cIf anything, what they\u2019ve done is traded perceived California bias for perceived Texas bias.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement was part of a busy week for Meta\u2019s public relations, amid concerns \u2014 including from its own staff \u2014 about recent company changes. Facebook was caught censoring employees on a company forum who were posting jokes and complaints about the decision to add United Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to Meta\u2019s Board of Directors. White campaigned for Trump, and Facebook employees pointed to a 2022 video of White slapping his wife in a nightclub. The posts were taken down for violating community standards, according to tech reporters at 404Media. (Despite Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cfree speech\u201d rhetoric, 404Media also says its stories about censorship on Facebook are censored on the platform. Musk is also notorious for espousing \u201cfree speech\u201d on X.)\n\nThen news broke revealing that Meta was also quietly relaxing hate speech standards, with The Independent in Britain reporting that Facebook and Instagram users are now allowed to call women \u201cproperty\u201d and protected groups like transgender people \u201cfreaks\u201d on those platforms. According to Meta, dehumanizing or insulting posts that could previously be flagged and removed are now allowed in the context of political debate over \u201ctransgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality.\u201d LGBTQ groups denounced Zuckerberg and warned of widespread harassment and violence. The EFF called the changes \u201cconcerning\u201d as researchers rushed to analyze the new policy.\n\nEFF issued a new statement on Thursday, saying it was a \u201cmistake to formulate our responses and expectations on what is essentially a marketing video for upcoming policy changes before any of those changes were reflected in their documentation.\u201d Instead of taking a closer look at marginalized voices that had been unfairly censored, Meta took the opposite tack, making targeted changes that would \u201callow dehumanizing statements to be made about certain vulnerable group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a need to sort of a refine their hate speech policy,\u201d Greene said. \u201cIt does lend a lot of support to the idea that this was more of a primarily political capitulation than it was an earnest attempt to revise pressing problems with content moderation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and liberals responded with outrage to Zuckerberg\u2019s apparent appeasement of conservatives, who have attacked social media companies for years with debunked claims that moderators combatting misinformation, hate speech and harassment are biased against them. However, some activists say Facebook was not doing a great job to protecting users and marginalized voices to begin with. They also argue that social media CEOs have proven to be politically malleable, adjusting their content moderation policies based on which U.S. party is in power and prioritizing profit over protecting users.\n\nGreer said that the intensely partisan nature of the debate over content moderation obscures the bigger problem.\n\nIt's weird to see the left more or less parrot right wing talking points by assuming that Meta relaxing their moderation practices will primarily amplify conservative speechDo y'all ever talk to sex workers? Palestine activists? Conservatives are not the most censored group on social media y'all \u2014 Evan Greer (@evan.bsky.social) January 8, 2025 at 6:54 AM\n\n\u201cAs long as we have these Big Tech companies that dominate so much of our information space \u2026 they are always going to kowtow to governments, whether the U.S. or others, in ways that impact people\u2019s expression,\u201d Greer said in an interview. \u201cWhat bums me out is that it feels like people are sort of happy to go along with that when the party they support is in power, and only get concerned about it when the party they don\u2019t support is in power.\u201d\n\nGreer worries that too much time and effort from digital activists is spent fighting over content moderation policies while true freedom of speech will remain elusive as long as a tiny handful of surveillance platforms run by self-interested capitalists have a stranglehold on the online spaces where we hold important discussions.\n\nLiberals typically say they want more moderation from private companies while conservatives generally want less, but Greer says this seemingly endless debate misses the point: Instead of trying to work the referees, Greer says, it would be better to demand lawmakers address structural issues, including privacy legislation that would limit the monopolies on surveillance technology and personal data collection and that have allowed social media companies to grow so big and destructive in the first place. Big Tech thrives off of sucking up and selling our personal data, and social media giants can simply copy innovations made by competitors and kill them off with sheer control over the market, Greer said.\n\nSuch legislation is \u201cnot going to turn the internet into a utopia, but it would get us on a path toward healthy online spaces where people can express themselves, and users have more tools to curate their own online experience rather than having done for them by politically motivated billionaires,\u201d Greer said.\n\nWith Republicans in control Congress for at least the next two years, Greer is not expecting sweeping privacy protections or antitrust reforms to come out of Washington D.C. anytime soon. However, Fight for the Future is planning to push for legislation at the state level. Greer pointed to the digital privacy law California passed in 2018, which is not perfect but points in the direction policymakers should be heading.\n\nSuch policies would make more room for alternatives to the big platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and X. There has been an explosion in use of competitors, including Mastodon and Bluesky, particularly as left-leaning users leave X in protest of Musk\u2019s censorship and right-wing outbursts in support of Trump. Social media is set up to make leaving a platform difficult, especially for people who have built a large following or business that cannot be transferred to another site. Giving users ownership over their own followers and data could be key to breaking Big Tech\u2019s stranglehold on social media.\n\nStill, the movement toward alternatives is lighting a path forward.\n\n\u201cPeople are remembering that social media is kind of us, when it\u2019s not woefully distorted and stultified in the interest of monopolists and capitalists, and we can have alternatives,\u201d Greer said.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won\u2019t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths \u2013 a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government.\n\nOver 80 percent of Truthout\u2018s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations.

            "content": "On Tuesday, Meta* CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan announced sweeping changes to the content moderation policies at Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads) with the stated intention of improving free speech and reducing \u201ccensorship\u201d on its platforms. The changes simplify policies, replace the top-down fact-checking with a Community Notes-style system, reduce opportunities for false positives in automatic content flagging, and allow for greater user control of content feeds. All these changes mirror recommendations FIRE made in its May 2024 Report on Social Media.\n\nGiven Meta\u2019s platforms boast billions of users, the changes, if implemented, have major positive implications for free expression online.\n\nFIRE\u2019s Social Media Report\n\nFIRE Report on Social Media 2024 Reports With as many as 5.17 billion accounts worldwide, social media is the most powerful tool in history for average citizens to express themselves. Read More\n\nIn our report, we promoted three principles to improve the state of free expression on social media:\n\nThe law should require transparency whenever the government involves itself in social media moderation decisions. Content moderation policies should be transparent to users, who should be able to appeal moderation decisions that affect them. Content moderation decisions should be unbiased and should consistently apply the criteria that a platform\u2019s terms of service establish.\n\nPrinciple 1 is the only one where FIRE believes government intervention is appropriate and constitutional (and we created a model bill to that effect). Principles 2 and 3 we hoped would enjoy voluntary adoption by social media platforms that wanted to promote freedom of expression.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know whether these principles influenced Meta\u2019s decision, we\u2019re pleased the promised changes align very well with FIRE\u2019s proposals for how a social media platform committed to free expression could put that commitment into practice.\n\nMeta\u2019s changes to content moderation structures\n\nWith a candid admission that it believes 10-20% of its millions of daily content removals are mistakes, Meta announced it is taking several actions to expand freedom of expression on the platform. The first is simplification and scaling back of its rules on the boundaries of discourse. According to Zuckerberg and Kaplan:\n\n[Meta is] getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate. It\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms. These policy changes may take a few weeks to be fully implemented.\n\nWhile this is promising in and of itself, it will be enhanced by a broad change to the automated systems for content moderation. Meta is restricting its automated flagging to only the most severe policy violations. For lesser policy violations, a user will have to manually report a post for review and possible removal. Additionally, any removal will require the agreement of multiple human reviewers.\n\nThis is consistent with our argument that AI-driven and other automated flagging systems will invariably have issues with false-positives, making human review critical. Beyond removals, Meta is increasing the confidence threshold required for deboosting a post suspected of violating policy.\n\nWho fact-checks the fact checkers?\n\nReplacing top-down fact-checking with a bottom-up approach based on X\u2019s Community Notes feature may be just about the biggest change announced by Meta. As FIRE noted in the Social Media Report:\n\nMark Zuckerberg famously said he didn\u2019t want Facebook to be the \u201carbiter of truth.\u201d But, in effect, through choosing a third-party fact checker, Facebook becomes the arbiter of the arbiter of truth. Given that users do not trust social media platforms, this is unlikely to engender trust in the accuracy of fact checks.\n\nZuckerberg similarly said in the announcement that Meta\u2019s\u201cfact checkers have just been too politically biased, and have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created.\u201d\n\nOur Social Media Report argued that the Community Notes feature is preferable to top-down fact-checking, because a community of diverse perspectives will likely be \u201cless vulnerable to bias and easier for users to trust than top-down solutions that may reflect the biases of a much smaller number of stakeholders.\u201d Additionally, we argued labeling is more supportive of free expression, being a \u201cmore speech\u201d alternative to removal and deboosting.\n\nWe are eager to see the results of this shift. At a minimum, experimentation and innovation in content moderation practices provides critical experience and data to guide future decisions and help platforms improve reliability, fairness, and responsiveness to users.\n\nUser trust and the appearance of bias\n\nAn overall theme in Zuckerberg and Kaplan\u2019s remarks is that biased decision-making has eroded user trust in content moderation at Meta, and these policy changes are aimed at regaining users\u2019 trust. As FIRE argued in our Social Media Report:\n\nIn the case of moderating political speech, any platform that seeks to promote free expression should develop narrow, well-defined, and consistently enforceable rules to minimize the kind of subjectivity that leads to arbitrary and unfair enforcement practices that reduce users\u2019 confidence both in platforms and in the state of free expression online.\n\nWe also argued that perception of bias and flexibility in rules encourages powerful entities like government actors to \u201cwork the refs,\u201d including through informal pressure, known as \u201cjawboning.\u201d\n\nWhat is jawboning? And does it violate the First Amendment? Issue Pages Indirect government censorship is still government censorship \u2014 and it must be stopped. Read More\n\nAdditionally, when perceived bias drives users to small, ideologically homogeneous alternative platforms, the result can damage broader discourse:\n\nIf users believe their \u201cside\u201d is censored unfairly, many will leave that platform for one where they believe they\u2019ll have more of a fair shake. Because the exodus is ideological in nature, it will drive banned users to new platforms where they are exposed to fewer competing ideas, leading to \u201cgroup polarization,\u201d the well-documented phenomenon that like-minded groups become more extreme over time. Structures on all social media platforms contribute to polarization, but the homogeneity of alternative platforms turbocharges it.\n\nThese are real problems, and it is not clear whether Meta\u2019s plans will succeed in addressing them, but it is welcome to see them recognized.\n\nInternational threats to speech\n\nOur Social Media Report expressed concern that the Digital Services Act \u2014 the broad EU regulation mandating censorship on social media far beyond what U.S. constitutional law allows \u2014 would become a least common denominator approach for social media companies, even in the United States. Mark Zuckerberg seems to announce his intention to do no such thing, stating he planned to work with President Trump to push back on \u201cgovernments around the world\u201d that are \u201cpushing [companies] to censor more.\u201d\n\nWhile we are pleased at the implication that Meta\u2019s platforms will seemingly not change their free expression policies in America at the behest of the EU, the invocation of a social media company working with any government, including the United States government, rings alarm bells for any civil libertarian. We will watch this development closely for that reason.\n\nFIRE has often said \u2014 and it often bears repeating \u2014 the greatest threat to freedom of expression will always come from the government, and as Zuckerberg himself notes, the government has in years past pushed Meta to remove content.\n\nWhen the rubber meets the road\n\nMeta\u2019s commitment to promote freedom of expression on its platforms offers plenty of reasons for cautious optimism.\n\nBut we do want to emphasize caution. There is, with free expression, often a large gap between stated intentions and what happens when theory meets practice. As a civil liberties watchdog, our duty is to measure promise against performance.\n\nTake, for example, our measured praise for Elon Musk\u2019s stated commitment to free expression, followed by our frequent criticism when he failed to live up to that commitment. And that criticism hasn\u2019t kept us from giving credit when due to X, such as when it adopted Community Notes.\n\nSimilarly, FIRE stands ready to help Meta live up to its stated commitments to free expression. You can be sure that we will watch closely and hold them accountable.\n\n* Meta has donated to FIRE.",

Brands then send the information captured by the pixels back to Meta, which uses the data to refine its algorithm and display the brand\u2019s ads to users who are likely to make a purchase.\n\nMeta is now restricting advertisers\u2019 access to much of this information.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the changes? Regulatory scrutiny over Meta\u2019s practice of sharing health information with advertisers to help them target their ads.\n\nJust last year, the FTC took enforcement action against online alcohol treatment platform Monument for allegedly disclosing users\u2019 health data to third-party advertising platforms, including Meta, without consumer consent.\n\nfor allegedly to third-party advertising platforms, including Meta, without consumer consent. This included highly sensitive health information about customers receiving help to recover from alcohol addiction.\n\nOther companies to pass users\u2019 health data back to Meta and find themselves in regulators' crosshairs include Teladoc-owned BetterHelp and GoodRx , which were fined $7.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\n\nWhy it matters: Healthcare advertisers will no longer be able to use certain types of health-related data for targeting purposes, such as whether a user completed an online purchase of a prescription drug or product intended to treat a certain condition, per The Information.\n\nWith limited purchase data on hand, ad campaigns running on Meta\u2019s platforms will be less targeted, and likely less effective. Advertisers will need to experiment with different approaches. This could include spreading ad budgets across a broader set of platforms or other digital channels to more effectively reach their target audiences.\n\nThe bigger picture: Healthcare advertisers will also need to contend with Meta\u2019s recent decision to ditch its fact-checking program in favor of a community-based model for content moderation . The change means that advertisers will need to more strongly consider the potential brand safety risk since less restrictive content moderation policies could boost the spread of misinformation on Meta.\n\nAll told, the changes mean advertisers will have their work cut out for them to generate ad campaigns that both protect their brands\u2019 reputation and help them break through to their intended audience.",

            "content": "Earlier this week, when Meta announced changes to their content moderation processes, we were hopeful that some of those changes\u2014which we will address in more detail in this post\u2014would enable greater freedom of expression on the company\u2019s platforms, something for which we have advocated for many years. While Meta\u2019s initial announcement primarily addressed changes to its misinformation policies and included rolling back over-enforcement and automated tools that we have long criticized, we expressed hope that \u201cMeta will also look closely at its content moderation practices with regards to other commonly censored topics such as LGBTQ+ speech, political dissidence, and sex work.\u201d\n\nFacebook has a clear and disturbing track record of silencing and further marginalizing already oppressed peoples, and then being less than forthright about their content moderation policy.\n\nHowever, shortly after our initial statement was published, we became aware that rather than addressing those historically over-moderated subjects, Meta was taking the opposite tack and \u2014as reported by the Independent\u2014was making targeted changes to its hateful conduct policy that would allow dehumanizing statements to be made about certain vulnerable groups.\n\nIt was our mistake to formulate our responses and expectations on what is essentially a marketing video for upcoming policy changes before any of those changes were reflected in their documentation. We prefer to focus on the actual impacts of online censorship felt by people, which tends to be further removed from the stated policies outlined in community guidelines and terms of service documents. Facebook has a clear and disturbing track record of silencing and further marginalizing already oppressed peoples, and then being less than forthright about their content moderation policy. These first changes to actually surface in Facebook's community standards document seem to be in the same vein.\n\nSpecifically, Meta\u2019s hateful conduct policy now contains the following:\n\nPeople sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups. Other times, they call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. Finally, sometimes people curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.\n\nBut the implementation of this policy shows that it is focused on allowing more hateful speech against specific groups, with a noticeable and particular focus on enabling more speech challenging the legitimacy of LGBTQ+ rights. For example,\n\nWhile allegations of mental illness against people based on their protected characteristics remain a tier 2 violation, the revised policy now allows \u201c allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [ sic ] and homosexuality.\u201d\n\nThe revised policy now specifies that Meta allows speech advocating gender-based and sexual orientation-based-exclusion from military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs, and from sports leagues and bathrooms.\n\nThe revised policy also removed previous prohibitions on comparing people to inanimate objects, feces, and filth based on their protected characteristics.\n\nThese changes reveal that Meta seems less interested in freedom of expression as a principle and more focused on appeasing the incoming U.S. administration, a concern we mentioned in our initial statement with respect to the announced move of the content policy team from California to Texas to address \u201cappearances of bias.\u201d Meta said it would be making some changes to reflect that these topics are \u201cthe subject of frequent political discourse and debate\u201d and can be said \u201con TV or the floor of Congress.\u201d But if that is truly Meta\u2019s new standard, we are struck by how selectively it is being rolled out, and particularly allowing more anti-LGBTQ+ speech.\n\nWe continue to stand firmly against hateful anti-trans content remaining on Meta\u2019s platforms, and strongly condemn any policy change directly aimed at enabling hate toward vulnerable communities\u2014both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nReal and Sincere Reforms to Content Moderation Can Both Promote Freedom of Expression and Protect Marginalized Users\n\nIn its initial announcement, Meta also said it would change how policies are enforced to reduce mistakes, stop reliance on automated systems to flag every piece of content, and add staff to review appeals. We believe that, in theory, these are positive measures that should result in less censorship of expression for which Meta has long been criticized by the global digital rights community, as well as by artists, sex worker advocacy groups, LGBTQ+ advocates, Palestine advocates, and political groups, among others.\n\nBut we are aware that these problems, at a corporation with a history of biased and harmful moderation like Meta, need a careful, well-thought-out, and sincere fix that will not undermine broader freedom of expression goals.\n\nFor more than a decade, EFF has been critical of the impact that content moderation at scale\u2014and automated content moderation in particular\u2014has on various groups. If Meta is truly interested in promoting freedom of expression across its platforms, we renew our calls to prioritize the following much-needed improvements instead of allowing more hateful speech.\n\nMeta Must Invest in Its Global User Base and Cover More Languages\n\nMeta has long failed to invest in providing cultural and linguistic competence in its moderation practices often leading to inaccurate removal of content as well as a greater reliance on (faulty) automation tools. This has been apparent to us for a long time. In the wake of the 2011 Arab uprisings, we documented our concerns with Facebook\u2019s reporting processes and their effect on activists in the Middle East and North Africa. More recently, the need for cultural competence in the industry generally was emphasized in the revised Santa Clara Principles.\n\nOver the years, Meta\u2019s global shortcomings became even more apparent as its platforms were used to promote hate and extremism in a number of locales. One key example is the platform\u2019s failure to moderate anti-Rohingya sentiment in Myanmar\u2014the direct result of having far too few Burmese-speaking moderators (in 2015, as extreme violence and violent sentiment toward the Rohingya was well underway, there were just two such moderators).\n\nIf Meta is indeed going to roll back the use of automation to flag and action most content and ensure that appeals systems work effectively, which will solve some of these problems, it must also invest globally in qualified content moderation personnel to make sure that content from countries outside of the United States and in languages other than English is fairly moderated.\n\nReliance on Automation to Flag Extremist Content Allows for Flawed Moderation\n\nWe have long been critical of Meta\u2019s over-enforcement of terrorist and extremist speech, specifically of the impact it has on human rights content. Part of the problem is Meta\u2019s over-reliance on moderation to flag extremist content. A 2020 document reviewing moderation across the Middle East and North Africa claimed that algorithms used to detect terrorist content in Arabic incorrectly flag posts 77 percent of the time.\n\nMore recently, we have seen this with Meta\u2019s automated moderation to remove the phrase \u201cfrom the river to the sea.\u201d As we argued in a submission to the Oversight Board\u2014with which the Board also agreed\u2014moderation decisions must be made on an individualized basis because the phrase has a significant historical usage that is not hateful or otherwise in violation of Meta\u2019s community standards.\n\nAnother example of this problem that has overlapped with Meta\u2019s shortcomings with respect to linguistic competence is in relation to the term \u201cshaheed,\u201d which translates most closely to \u201cmartyr\u201d and is used by Arabic speakers and many non-Arabic-speaking Muslims elsewhere in the world to refer primarily (though not exclusively) to individuals who have died in the pursuit of ideological causes. As we argued in our joint submission with ECNL to the Meta Oversight Board, use of the term is context-dependent, but Meta has used automated moderation to indiscriminately remove instances of the word. In their policy advisory opinion, the Oversight Board noted that any restrictions on freedom of expression that seek to prevent violence must be necessary and proportionate, \u201cgiven that undue removal of content may be ineffective and even counterproductive.\u201d\n\nMarginalized communities that experience persecution offline often face disproportionate censorship online. It is imperative that Meta recognize the responsibilities it has to its global user base in upholding free expression, particularly of communities that may otherwise face censorship in their home countries.\n\nSexually-Themed Content Remains Subject to Discriminatory Over-censorship\n\nOur critique of Meta\u2019s removal of sexually-themed content goes back more than a decade. The company\u2019s policies on adult sexual activity and nudity affect a wide range of people and communities, but most acutely impact LGBTQ+ individuals and sex workers. Typically aimed at keeping sites \u201cfamily friendly\u201d or \u201cprotecting the children,\u201d these policies are often unevenly enforced, often classifying LGBTQ+ content as \u201cadult\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d when similar heterosexual content isn\u2019t. These policies were often written and enforced discriminatorily and at the expense of gender-fluid and nonbinary speakers\u2014we joined in the We the Nipple campaign aimed at remedying this discrimination.\n\nIn the midst of ongoing political divisions, issues like this have a serious impact on social media users.\n\nMost nude content is legal, and engaging with such material online provides individuals with a safe and open framework to explore their identities, advocate for broader societal acceptance and against hate, build communities, and discover new interests. With Meta intervening to become the arbiters of how people create and engage with nudity and sexuality\u2014both offline and in the digital space\u2014a crucial form of engagement for all kinds of users has been removed and the voices of people with less power have regularly been shut down.\n\nOver-removal of Abortion Content Stifles User Access to Essential Information\n\nThe removal of abortion-related posts on Meta platforms containing the word \u2018kill\u2019 have failed to meet the criteria for restricting users\u2019 right to freedom of expression. Meta has regularly over-removed abortion related content, hamstringing its user\u2019s ability to voice their political beliefs. The use of automated tools for content moderation leads to the biased removal of this language, as well as essential information. In 2022, Vice reported that a Facebook post stating \"abortion pills can be mailed\" was flagged within seconds of it being posted.\n\nAt a time when bills are being tabled across the U.S. to restrict the exchange of abortion-related information online, reproductive justice and safe access to abortion, like so many other aspects of managing our healthcare, is fundamentally tied to our digital lives. And with corporations deciding what content is hosted online, the impact of this removal is exacerbated.\n\nWhat was benign data online is effectively now potentially criminal evidence. This expanded threat to digital rights is especially dangerous for BIPOC, lower-income, immigrant, LGBTQ+ people and other traditionally marginalized communities, and the healthcare providers serving these communities. Meta must adhere to its responsibility to respect international human rights law, and ensure that any abortion-related content removal be both necessary and proportionate.\n\nMeta\u2019s symbolic move of its content team from California to Texas, a state that is aiming to make the distribution of abortion information illegal, also raises serious concerns that Meta will backslide on this issue\u2014in line with local Texan state law banning abortion\u2014rather than make improvements.\n\nMeta Must Do Better to Provide Users With Transparency\n\nEFF has been critical of Facebook\u2019s lack of transparency for a long time. When it comes to content moderation the company\u2019s transparency reports lack many of the basics: how many human moderators are there, and how many cover each language? How are moderators trained? The company\u2019s community standards enforcement report includes rough estimates of how many pieces of content of which categories get removed, but does not tell us why or how these decisions are taken.\n\nMeta makes billions from its own exploitation of our data, too often choosing their profits over our privacy\u2014opting to collect as much as possible while denying users intuitive control over their data. In many ways this problem underlies the rest of the corporation\u2019s harms\u2014that its core business model depends on collecting as much information about users as possible, then using that data to target ads, as well as target competitors.\n\nThat\u2019s why EFF, with others, launched the Santa Clara Principles on how corporations like Meta can best obtain meaningful transparency and accountability around the increasingly aggressive moderation of user-generated content. And as platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X continue to occupy an even bigger role in arbitrating our speech and controlling our data, there is an increased urgency to ensure that their reach is not only stifled, but reduced.\n\nFlawed Approach to Moderating Misinformation with Censorship\n\nMisinformation has been thriving on social media platforms, including Meta. As we said in our initial statement, and have written before, Meta and other platforms should use a variety of fact-checking and verification tools available to it, including both community notes and professional fact-checkers, and have robust systems in place to check against any flagging that results from it.\n\nMeta and other platforms should also employ media literacy tools such as encouraging users to read articles before sharing them, and to provide resources to help their users assess reliability of information on the site. We have also called for Meta and others to stop privileging governmental officials by providing them with greater opportunities to lie than other users.\n\nWhile we expressed some hope on Tuesday, the cynicism expressed by others seems warranted now. Over the years, EFF and many others have worked to push Meta to make improvements. We've had some success with its \"Real Names\" policy, for example, which disproportionately affected the LGBTQ community and political dissidents. We also fought for, and won improvements on, Meta's policy on allowing images of breastfeeding, rather than marking them as \"sexual content.\" If Meta truly values freedom of expression, we urge it to redirect its focus to empowering historically marginalized speakers, rather than empowering only their detractors.",

            "content": "Dia Kayyali /\n\nJan 9, 2025\n\nMark Zuckerberg's Facebook account is displayed on a mobile phone with the Meta logo visible on a tablet screen in this photo illustration on January 7, 2025. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday, Meta cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and newly-minted Chief Global Affairs Officer (and longtime conservative Republican operative) Joel Kaplan announced that Meta would be getting rid of its fact-checking program and pledged to work with President-elect Donald Trump to uphold free speech and fight \"dangerous censorship\" from platform regulation. Meta also published sweeping changes to its \"Hateful Conduct\" Community Standard. The policy, formerly known as the Hate Speech Community Standard, is now written to specifically allow more hateful content targeting transgender people, immigrants, and women\u2013including cisgender women.\n\nEvery change Meta made on Tuesday, like everything it has ever done, was ultimately a business decision. But this may be its most cynical business move yet. The changes appear to cater specifically to the rise of far-right leaders and ideology globally, not just in the United States. Like Elon Musk\u2019s transformation of X, the changes on Meta platforms will be noticeable, and they will be harmful not only to marginalized groups but also to public safety more broadly.\n\nWhy now: The geopolitics\n\nMeta and Zuckerberg have declared war on the global movement to regulate platforms. The US has, unsurprisingly, been left behind in this movement, despite Zuckerberg's claim that \"it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\" The US has, for example, failed to pass legislation related to meaningful transparency, such as the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act. Zuckerberg's announcement specifically called out Europe and seemed to equate the EU's willingness to deem some types of content illegal with China's systemic censorship regime.\n\nThere has indeed been a significant wave of platform regulation in recent years. It's also true that civil society (myself included) has critiqued the regulations, especially when they directly force platforms to moderate content in specific ways. However, even regulations with many problematic aspects, like the Online Safety Act, have some focus on ensuring transparency and access to appeals, and force large platforms to invest appropriately in content moderation. Europe\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) and other regulatory transparency and appeals requirements are no doubt costing Meta a lot of money, so Meta\u2019s return to its traditional anti-regulation stance is no surprise, especially given that many people believe Meta invested money in its own Oversight Board as a way to fend off further regulation.\n\nWhat observers from the US may have failed to note is how this all overlaps with the rise of the far-right in Europe. Germany, in particular, is stunning in this regard. The fall of the German government barely made news in the US, but it's a big deal. Germany will hold snap elections at the end of February, and the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has made incredible gains in popularity and power in recent years. Germany has always played an outsized role in EU politics, particularly on matters related to online regulation, and the AfD has specifically railed against so-called censorship. In fact, President-elect Trump's patron, Elon Musk, is actively courting the far-right in Germany, which has responded gleefully by welcoming his support and calling him a savior of free speech.\n\nWhat the AfD appears to mean by \u2018free speech\u2019 is protecting its ability to incite offline violence. Research from 7 years ago showed that AfD posts led to a predictable uptick in anti-refugee violence. The party is much more popular now, and there's no reason to think the problem has improved. This pattern is repeated elsewhere in Europe and abroad. For example, in November 2023, claims by far-right figures that the death of a teenager in a small village in France was committed by migrants led to serious street violence. And over the summer, false information that a Muslim immigrant had committed a mass stabbing in Southport, UK, directly fueled some of the most violent protests since 2011. Protestors set fire to alleged refugee accommodations, vandalized mosques, and even attacked police officers. Finally, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance's false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating dogs and cats led to dozens of bomb threats, closures of government buildings, increased harassment against immigrants, and increased activity by hate groups like the Proud Boys.\n\nPolicy Changes\n\nThe specific changes to Meta's former hate speech policy deserve far more attention than they are receiving. The policy is now called \"Hateful Conduct,\" and it is worth going to Meta's Transparency Center and clicking on the tracked changes version, dated January 7, which shows all the specific changes.\n\nNotably, the policy will now allow calls for exclusion and \"insulting language\" towards trans people, women, and immigrants. This line demonstrates the length to which this allowance goes: \"We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation.\" The policy now also specifically allows users to spread claims that vulnerable groups purposefully spread Covid and removed prohibitions against calling women property and non-binary people \"it.\"\n\nOne change exempts from any protections \"groups described as having carried out violent or sexual crimes or representing less than half of a group.\" This seems to mean that Meta would allow users to post direct incitement to violence in the form of claims of sexual crimes committed by immigrants or trans people. This change is significant because Meta surely knows that when it comes to forms of speech that incite violence, \"none is more pervasive or powerful than telling people that someone is threatening their children.\"\n\nSome commentators have opined that the enforcement changes noted above may be \"[m]uch more consequential than the policy changes.\" Perhaps they think that the changes will only impact people personally impacted by violence related to immigration, gender identity, and gender. They are sorely mistaken. The topics Meta is loosening restrictions on are those most intimately tied to \"lone wolf\" shootings and threats of violence against women and trans people. Even if one doesn't buy the concept of stochastic terrorism\u2013\" the idea that influential individuals may demonize target groups or individuals, inspiring unknown actors to take up terroristic violence against them\"\u2013the connections between online content and offline violence are simply too numerous to ignore at this point. Even if Meta does continue to moderate terrorist content, it will now do a much better job of serving as a gateway to far more radical spaces, such as far-right Telegram groups.\n\nIn fact, Meta already allows most Great Replacement Theory (GRT) related content on its platform. This dangerous conspiracy theory claims that \"there is a conscious effort to replace white populations through immigration, integration, abortion, and violence against white people.\" It has been central to motivations of the most high-profile mass killings in recent years, most notably the violent live-streamed massacre of 51 people at two mosques during prayers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. It has been featured in nearly every shooter's manifesto. Meta has, until now, very rapidly removed content related to mass shootings, but GRT content has been purposefully spread extensively, notably by far-right French politician \u00c9ric Zemmour.\n\nThe changes will also likely lead to an increase in incel (\u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d) content. In fact, the new policy seems almost tailor-made to allow the \"your body, my choice\" content that has surged since the election and that has been linked to offline harassment as well. Cases of directly linked violence here are not immediately apparent, but in the seven years between 2015 and 2022, incels were responsible for at least 53 deaths, including multiple mass shootings.\n\nMeta's changes for women, immigrants, and trans people now may not immediately impact everyday users. They may not ever impact you on the platform. But don't be lulled into a false sense of security if you don't fit these categories. These changes make everyone less safe.",

Yet Meta has made clear that this is the future it wants.\n\n\u201cAs well-intentioned as many of these efforts have been, they have expanded over time to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable,\u201d Kaplan wrote of the fact-checking program and other moderation tools. \u201cWe want to fix that and return to that fundamental commitment to free expression.\u201d\n\nThe appeal to \u201cfree expression\u201d mirrors Musk\u2019s, although in Meta\u2019s case it seems less about commitment to abstract ideals than it is a concerted effort to make nice with MAGA; Meta has spent years unsuccessfully trying to counter claims of bias from conservatives and now has chosen to abandon the fight entirely. You can\u2019t work the referees if there aren\u2019t any to begin with.\n\nBut at what cost? Well, potentially plenty. Fact-checking is not beyond reproach, and community notes can be effective as part of a broader moderation system. But little in Kaplan\u2019s announcement of the changes\u2014or Zuckerberg\u2019s accompanying video\u2014gave much hope that this will be an upgrade.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far, it seems like it\u2019ll be an unmitigated disaster,\u201d says Alex Mahavedan, director of the Poynter Institute\u2019s digital media literacy project, MediaWise. (The Poynter Institute also operates PolitiFact, which is a Meta fact-checking partner.) By putting so much emphasis on something so nebulous as \u201cfree speech\u201d as the ultimate goal\u2014never mind that fact-checking is itself a form of speech\u2014Meta risks a permissiveness that allows misinformation to flourish, Mahavedan says. He\u2019s not alone.",

So far, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has offered them little beyond vague assurances, leaving the details up in the air.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that this marks Meta\u2019s most significant shake-up to its political content policies in years, coinciding with Zuckerberg\u2019s apparent effort to mend fences with the incoming Trump administration. In doing so, Zuckerberg is edging closer to Musk\u2019s laissez-faire playbook \u2014 hardly surprising, given Musk\u2019s new role as a Trump advisor.\n\nMarketers Digiday spoke to say they understand this political calculus, even if they\u2019re not entirely on board. They are, however, questioning its broader implications for how people communicate on Meta\u2019s platforms. Will reduced censorship and fewer checks on misinformation create a space for open dialogue? Or will it turn these platforms into battlegrounds where the lines between discourse and chaos blur, while heated debates and unchecked narratives thrive?\n\nCritics might call this alarmist, dismissing concerns as resistance to the dismantling of the left-leaning oversight apparatus that has shaped the digital landscape in recent years. Still Musk\u2019s X serves as a cautionary tale. Far from curbing misinformation, the hands-off approach has amplified it, turning his platform into a battleground where truth and fiction clash, with attention \u2014 not accuracy \u2014 deciding the winner.\n\n\u201cAt some point, brands will have to decide if reach is more important than their own alignment with the general sentiment that\u2019s begun to metastasize within these platforms,\u201d said Stephen Beck, founder and CEO of media agency Engine Digital.\n\nWhen advertisers faced similar concerns on X, those worries snowballed, leading many to pull spending entirely. But Meta is a different beast. Unlike X, Meta has always been commercially driven and seen as a far superior ad platform, making it unlikely advertisers will abandon it as quickly, even if the stakes continue to rise.\n\n\u201cI expect Meta will ensure that the rhetoric is far from what we typically see on X,\u201d said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of marketing and commerce, and tech briefings at eMarketer. \u201cWe noticed that when Meta began restricting political ads and \u2018issues\u2019 ads \u2014 it\u2019s so big that it wants to avoid headaches that aren\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\nFor marketers, those headaches aren\u2019t worth it either. Meta\u2019s scale makes it too valuable to abandon outright, and they\u2019ve long accepted that social media is a messy palace to build brands. What really matters is ensuring their ads are kept away from inappropriate or harmful content. As for the controversial conversations surrounding them? That\u2019s just the cost of doing business in the digital age.\n\n\u201cThe question comes down to whether a company\u2019s ads appear alongside offensive content,\u201d said Jim Misener, president of brand consultancy 50,000feet.\n\nThis debate, however, may intensify around Threads in the coming months. After all, this \u201cMuskification\u201d of Meta stands in stark contrast to Threads\u2019 original promise. When Threads launched in July 2023, Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who oversees Threads, described it as a \u201cless angry space\u201d for sharing ideas. But now, that vision feels increasingly out of reach as Meta\u2019s broader strategy shifts toward Musk\u2019s more volatile model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to fundamentally alter what Threads\u2019 USP was,\u201d said James Kirkham, co-founder of brand consultancy Iconic. \u201cThis was the alternative. It was a softer, warmer, more friendly place. The changes that Zuckerberg is talking about [are] definitely going to erode that key differentiator.\u201d\n\nMeta\u2019s pivot toward Musk\u2019s playbook signals the beginning of a new chapter in one of media\u2019s most pertinent narratives \u2014 one defined by the erosion of traditional gatekeeping and the rise of platforms that prioritize engagement over accountability.\n\nCall it the Muskification of media: a world where virality trump veracity, and platforms increasingly shape public discourse without the burden of oversight. In this new era, the challenge isn\u2019t just about brand safety for marketers but navigating an increasingly unpredictable environment. They\u2019re having to weigh the value of reach against the risks versus rewards of being associated with platforms that define culture in such uncharted ways.",

            "content": "by Rebecca Hamilton\n\nOn Tuesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to \u201celiminate fact-checkers\u201d across Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, signaling a major shift in how the company handles misinformation. He also outlined plans to adopt a user-driven \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s approach on X. Zuckerberg stated Meta would overhaul its approach to content moderation by removing certain guidelines and raising the threshold for removing prohibited content. Additionally, the company plans to relocate its trust and safety operations to Texas, where, as Zuckerberg put it, \u201cthere\u2019s less concern about the bias of our teams.\u201d Zuckerberg concluded by proclaiming that, \u201cwe\u2019re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world.\u201d Meta\u2019s policy changes follow its $1 million donation to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, the addition of Trump ally, Dana White, to its board and its appointment of Joel Kaplan, a former Republican operative, as chief global affairs officer, signaling a deliberate strategic shift toward the incoming administration.\n\nMeta\u2019s new policies include reducing prohibitions on hate speech, harassment, and misinformation, effectively allowing more controversial and potentially harmful content to remain on its platforms. For instance, posts targeting marginalized groups such as transgender individuals or immigrants may no longer meet the stricter criteria for removal unless they incite direct violence. Similarly, Meta\u2019s reduced intervention in combating gender-based hate speech and disinformation campaigns disproportionately affects women and other vulnerable populations who already face systemic biases online. These changes reflect a broader trend of deregulation, aligning with Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of prioritizing free expression over community safety\u2014a shift that critics warn will deepen existing inequities and exacerbate the normalization of harmful rhetoric.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement deserves closer scrutiny than can be achieved simply through reading the transcript of his remarks. Actually watching his speech reveals a chilling display of rhetoric and intent. Three distinct, but interconnected, themes emerge from his vision: dismantling content moderation and fact-checking, distorting language, and, ultimately, destabilizing democracy.\n\nDismantling Content Moderation and Fact-checking\n\nThe consequences of dismantling content moderation are well-documented. U.S. users of X have begun to experience what an online platform looks like when it retrenches content moderation and relies on users to fact-check content. Yet, what has unfolded on X in recent months pales in comparison to what Zuckerberg has announced. The best parallel is not X today, but Facebook\u2019s role in Myanmar from 2013- 2017, where the absence of meaningful moderation fueled genocide against the Rohingya.\n\nFacebook entered Myanmar against the backdrop of a society emerging from three decades of dictatorship, where there was little tradition of a free press, and where persecution of the minority Muslim population, the Rohingya, was endemic. Failing to invest in local language competency, Facebook launched (as it has done in other Majority World countries) without anything approaching meaningful content moderation systems in place. The result, predictably enough, was online incitement to genocide against the Rohingya. Facebook had been relying on its users in Myanmar to flag problematic content. As I wrote in a 2020 article recounting the period:\n\n\u201cSuch a flagging system operates on the assumption that offensive content is created and tolerated by only a minority of an online community\u2026 Unfortunately, persecution of the Rohingya is tolerated across all parts of Burmese society. In other words, expecting Burmese users to alert Facebook to incitement against the Rohingya in Myanmar would be like relying on the majority Hutu population to call out incitement against the Tutsi in 1994 Rwanda.\u201d\n\nToday, the example is revealing for two reasons. First, outsourcing platform governance to users is highly problematic. In Myanmar, the platform was relying on users to flag hateful content. Moving forward, Meta is relying on users to flag false content. But in both cases, the structure of the underlying problem remains: The flagging system reproduces whatever norms exist in a community of users. To Zuckerberg and Musk (and, presumably, President-elect Trump) this is a feature. For any marginalized group in a society, it is a bug. If most users on Meta believe that a Black Lives Matter protest is the work of Antifa, few will flag posts asserting those lies as false content.\n\nThe second point to absorb from the Myanmar example is that online and offline spaces are co-constitutive. One direction of that relationship is already well appreciated; a harmful online situation often does migrate to offline contexts. Less acknowledged is the degree to which offline contexts simultaneously impact online activity, such that the relationship between online and offline is effectively a giant looping mechanism. This matters in the United States at this moment, because changes in content moderation policies online are playing out against an offline context that is increasingly hostile to marginalized communities.\n\nDistorting Language\n\nA close bedfellow of dismantling fact-checking is Zuckerberg\u2019s turn towards distorting language and even meaning itself. In his speech, he repeatedly and consistently replaces the term \u201ccontent moderation\u201d with the word \u201ccensorship.\u201d (See, e.g. \u201cThe problem is that the filters make mistakes, and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn\u2019t. So, by dialing them back, we\u2019re going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\u201d)\n\nContent moderation, in the social media context, refers to the (automated or human) process of reviewing content to ascertain if it aligns with an existing set of policy standards set by the social media company and, if it doesn\u2019t, to remove the content. It is generally understood as an imperfect process developed to stop online platforms turning into cesspools of vile content reflecting the worst parts of human societies. Censorship refers to the suppression of speech that, when done unlawfully by the government, can violate the U.S. Constitution, or international human rights law.\n\nTechnically, both content moderation and censorship can do the same thing \u2013 shutter speech. But, just like two different instruments playing the same note have a different quality, so too, the term content moderation has a different quality than the word censorship. Replacing \u201ccontent moderation\u201d with \u201ccensorship\u201d degrades our understanding of both terms.\n\nDestabilizing Democracy\n\nThe erosion of content moderation and the distortion of language are not just theoretical concerns; they strike at the heart of democratic governance. Access to accurate, reliable information is a cornerstone of democracy. It enables the public to hold leaders accountable and to make informed decisions. This is why a free press has always been an indispensable requirement of sustaining a system of democratic governance. Unless the public has access to accurate information about what its representatives are doing, and the impact those decisions are having on the society they live in, then governmental accountability becomes impossible even if free and fair elections continue to be held.\n\nOver the past decade, the public\u2019s reliance on online platforms for information has grown exponentially. However, the infrastructure enabling this access has increasingly consolidated in the hands of a few ultra-wealthy individuals, raising serious concerns about accountability and democratic resilience. This development has not gone unnoticed, and many actors have worked hard to develop systems of accountability to mitigate the risks inherent in this structure. (Others, like Ethan Zuckerman, argued presciently for the need to develop entirely different structures altogether). Yet, by and large, Big Tech has been effective in shaping the discourse in favor of accountability mechanisms that have been as much about reputation management as anything else.\n\nThe business and human rights framework, developed in response to the reality that international human rights law was established to hold states, not corporations, responsible for human rights violations has helped improve corporate behavior in many spheres, including on social media platforms. But it is inherently limited by its non-binding nature and, in the hands of sophisticated Big Tech players, has been deployed cynically in the cases where it has been needed the most.\n\nAfter facing widespread condemnation in the Western media over the way its platform enabled incitement to genocide in Myanmar, Meta commissioned a human rights impact assessment, carefully framed to understand the \u201cmistakes\u201d and \u201cshortcomings\u201d of its actions in Myanmar but laser focused on a \u201cforward-looking analysis.\u201d For years, this became the playbook for responding to any and all criticism: Apologize for \u201cmistakes\u201d and promise to do better going forward.\n\nCommunities harmed by social media have long recognized that Meta\u2019s approach to accountability is largely performative\u2014a public relations exercise contingent on the C-suite\u2019s assessment of whether such actions will mitigate reputational damage that could affect profitability. Yesterday\u2019s announcement gave a broader segment of the American public the opportunity to come to this realization as well. Fact-checking and content moderation were policies Zuckerberg championed when the political climate made the reputational\u2014and financial\u2014costs of inaction greater than the benefits. With the Trump administration about to return to power, that calculus has now shifted. The lesson is that users everywhere have become reliant on an information ecosystem over which we have almost no control, and is structured to avoid democratic accountability.\n\n\n\nImage: The logos of applications, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and facebook belonging to the company Meta are displayed on the screen of an iPhone in front of a Meta logo on February 03, 2022 in Paris, France.

The community notes program will allow users to write and rate added context to specific posts rather than Meta or a third party fact-checking the post itself.\n\nThis comes less than a year after Meta announced it would limit content related to social and political issues, particularly the presidential election, in March 2024.\n\nMeta \u2013 whose Facebook, Instagram and Threads platforms boast over 3 billion users worldwide \u2013 also plans to work with the incoming Trump administration to lobby for foreign countries to drop content restrictions and censorship on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the U.S. government,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so difficult over the past four years when even the U.S. government has pushed for censorship.

SpaceX\u2019s Starbase launch site is in South Texas.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise moved its headquarters from California to Houston in 2020. Oracle also moved from California in 2020 to Austin, but it's reportedly looking to move to Nashville in the near future.\n\nABBYY also announced in 2024 that its headquarters is moving to Austin after being in Silicon Valley since 2019.\n\nSeveral other companies have opened offices in Austin in recent years, including Google, Amazon and Apple.",

This is Louisiana\u2019s first Platinum.\n\nWage growth a deciding factor: Business Facilities cited the scale of the investment, job creation and average salaries exceeding 150% of the state per capita average.\n\nAll-of-Louisiana approach: State\u2019s new data center incentive program, education partnerships and robust local power and water infrastructure also credited with setting Louisiana apart from competing states.\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. \u2013 Business Facilities Magazine, a respected national trade publication favored by site selectors for large businesses, has recognized Louisiana\u2019s $10 billion Meta artificial intelligence data center as its Platinum 2024 Deal of the Year. It is the magazine\u2019s highest honor for major investments in the United States.\n\nBusiness Facilities also recognized Amazon Web Services $10 billion data center project in Mississippi with a Gold Award. The profound community impact of Meta\u2019s average salaries, which will exceed 150% of the state\u2019s per capita average, helped set Louisiana apart. The magazine also applauded LED\u2019s \u201call-of-Louisiana\u201d approach, singling out the state\u2019s new data center incentive program, education partnerships and robust local power and water infrastructure capacity as differentiators.\n\n\u201cThis prestigious award makes clear that pursuing major capital investments in technology, we can dramatically improve the lives of Louisiana residents with high-paying jobs that support families and help workers all across our state adapt to a fast-changing world,\u201d Governor Jeff Landry said. \u201cWe are making good on our commitment to not leave rural areas behind as we position Louisiana as a global leader in innovation.\u201d\n\nLED estimates the project will also create more than 1,000 indirect jobs. Meta projects that more than 5,000 construction workers will help build the 4 million-square-foot data center at the peak of construction. Work is underway on a 2,250-acre section of the former Franklin Farm megasite in Richland Parish. The data center has been called a transformational investment for northeast Louisiana and the state.\n\n\u201cThe 2024 Platinum Deal of the Year award sends CEOs and site selectors around the world a powerful message: Louisiana is not only in the game. We are in it to win,\u201d LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. \u201cI want to thank the editors of Business Facilities for recognizing the profound impact of the Meta data center project not only for Louisiana but for the signal it sends. It\u2019s the kind of transformational investment that Louisiana is now positioned and determined to achieve.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the massive investment Meta is making in the data center in Richland Parish, the company will also award Data Center Community Action Grants that are aimed at improving educational resources. These grants will help train a new generation of workers around science, technology, engineering, the arts and math (STEAM). In addition, Louisiana Delta Community College in Monroe is developing a curriculum that is designed to prepare students to enter the workforce ready to take on challenges around emerging technology such as artificial intelligence and data centers.\n\n\u201cThe rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and the demand for technology capabilities overall spurred significant investment in data centers throughout 2024,\u201d Anne Cosgrove, Business Facilities Editorial Director, said. \u201cOur 2024 Deal of the Year winners represent billions of dollars in capital investment and thousands of jobs for the communities in which these companies and their suppliers will operate.

            "content": "Meta\u2019s platforms are built to be places where people can express themselves freely. That can be messy. On platforms where billions of people can have a voice, all the good, bad and ugly is on display. But that\u2019s free expression.\n\nIn his 2019 speech at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg argued that free expression has been the driving force behind progress in American society and around the world and that inhibiting speech, however well-intentioned the reasons for doing so, often reinforces existing institutions and power structures instead of empowering people. He said: \u201cSome people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn recent years we\u2019ve developed increasingly complex systems to manage content across our platforms, partly in response to societal and political pressure to moderate content. This approach has gone too far. As well-intentioned as many of these efforts have been, they have expanded over time to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable. Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in \u201cFacebook jail,\u201d and we are often too slow to respond when they do.\n\nWe want to fix that and return to that fundamental commitment to free expression. Today, we\u2019re making some changes to stay true to that ideal.\n\nEnding Third Party Fact Checking Program, Moving to Community Notes\n\nWhen we launched our independent fact checking program in 2016, we were very clear that we didn\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth. We made what we thought was the best and most reasonable choice at the time, which was to hand that responsibility over to independent fact checking organizations. The intention of the program was to have these independent experts give people more information about the things they see online, particularly viral hoaxes, so they were able to judge for themselves what they saw and read.\n\nThat\u2019s not the way things played out, especially in the United States. Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how. Over time we ended up with too much content being fact checked that people would understand to be legitimate political speech and debate. Our system then attached real consequences in the form of intrusive labels and reduced distribution. A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor.\n\nWe are now changing this approach. We will end the current third party fact checking program in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes program. We\u2019ve seen this approach work on X \u2013 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see. We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they\u2019re seeing \u2013 and one that\u2019s less prone to bias.\n\nOnce the program is up and running, Meta won\u2019t write Community Notes or decide which ones show up. They are written and rated by contributing users.\n\nJust like they do on X, Community Notes will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings.\n\nWe intend to be transparent about how different viewpoints inform the Notes displayed in our apps, and are working on the right way to share this information.\n\nPeople can sign up today ( Facebook , Instagram , Threads ) for the opportunity to be among the first contributors to this program as it becomes available.\n\nWe plan to phase in Community Notes in the US first over the next couple of months, and will continue to improve it over the course of the year. As we make the transition, we will get rid of our fact-checking control, stop demoting fact checked content and, instead of overlaying full screen interstitial warnings you have to click through before you can even see the post, we will use a much less obtrusive label indicating that there is additional information for those who want to see it.\n\nAllowing More Speech\n\nOver time, we have developed complex systems to manage content on our platforms, which are increasingly complicated for us to enforce. As a result, we have been over-enforcing our rules, limiting legitimate political debate and censoring too much trivial content and subjecting too many people to frustrating enforcement actions.\n\nFor example, in December 2024, we removed millions of pieces of content every day. While these actions account for less than 1% of content produced every day, we think one to two out of every 10 of these actions may have been mistakes (i.e., the content may not have actually violated our policies). This does not account for actions we take to tackle large-scale adversarial spam attacks. We plan to expand our transparency reporting to share numbers on our mistakes on a regular basis so that people can track our progress. As part of that we\u2019ll also include more details on the mistakes we make when enforcing our spam policies.\n\nWe want to undo the mission creep that has made our rules too restrictive and too prone to over-enforcement. We\u2019re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate. It\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms. These policy changes may take a few weeks to be fully implemented.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms. Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn\u2019t have been. So, we\u2019re going to continue to focus these systems on tackling illegal and high-severity violations, like terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams. For less severe policy violations, we\u2019re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take any action. We also demote too much content that our systems predict might violate our standards. We are in the process of getting rid of most of these demotions and requiring greater confidence that the content violates for the rest. And we\u2019re going to tune our systems to require a much higher degree of confidence before a piece of content is taken down. As part of these changes, we will be moving the trust and safety teams that write our content policies and review content out of California to Texas and other US locations.\n\nPeople are often given the chance to appeal our enforcement decisions and ask us to take another look, but the process can be frustratingly slow and doesn\u2019t always get to the right outcome. We\u2019ve added extra staff to this work and in more cases, we are also now requiring multiple reviewers to reach a determination in order to take something down. We are working on ways to make recovering accounts more straightforward and testing facial recognition technology, and we\u2019ve started using AI large language models (LLMs) to provide a second opinion on some content before we take enforcement actions.\n\nA Personalized Approach to Political Content\n\nSince 2021, we\u2019ve made changes to reduce the amount of civic content people see \u2013 posts about elections, politics or social issues \u2013 based on the feedback our users gave us that they wanted to see less of this content. But this was a pretty blunt approach. We are going to start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads with a more personalized approach so that people who want to see more political content in their feeds can.\n\nWe\u2019re continually testing how we deliver personalized experiences and have recently conducted testing around civic content. As a result, we\u2019re going to start treating civic content from people and Pages you follow on Facebook more like any other content in your feed, and we will start ranking and showing you that content based on explicit signals (for example, liking a piece of content) and implicit signals (like viewing posts) that help us predict what\u2019s meaningful to people. We are also going to recommend more political content based on these personalized signals and are expanding the options people have to control how much of this content they see.\n\nThese changes are an attempt to return to the commitment to free expression that Mark Zuckerberg set out in his Georgetown speech. That means being vigilant about the impact our policies and systems are having on people\u2019s ability to make their voices heard, and having the humility to change our approach when we know we\u2019re getting things wrong.",

            "content": "Justin Hendrix /\n\nJan 7, 2025\n\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Source\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook and text posted to Threads, today Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced sweeping changes to the company's approach to content moderation. After years of developing 'trust and safety' and content moderation systems and policies, Zuckerberg now asserts that \"we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship.\" Zuckerberg has decided to return to a posture that he believes will prioritize free expression.\n\nSpecific policy changes announced include:\n\nEliminating fact-checkers in the US and replacing them with a \"community notes\" system similar to X (formerly Twitter);\n\n\"Simplifying\" content policies by removing certain restrictions on topics like immigration and gender;\n\nChanging enforcement approach for policy violations: Focusing automated filters only on illegal and high-severity violations; Requiring user reports before taking action on lower-severity violations; Increasing the confidence threshold required before removing content; Reintroducing civic and political content into recommendation systems on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads; Relocating trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. \"This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Threads.\n\n\n\nZuckerberg says he is planning to work with President-elect Donald Trump to oppose global \"censorship\" pressures. He makes claims about such pressures mounting in multiple regions, including:\n\nEurope's \"ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship\";\n\nSecret courts in Latin America that \"that can order companies to quietly take things down\";\n\nChinese censorship.\n\nHe further claims that the only way Meta \"can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\"\n\nZuckerberg's statement was timed with the release of a post by Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan:\n\nWe want to undo the mission creep that has made our rules too restrictive and too prone to over-enforcement. We\u2019re getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate. It\u2019s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms.\n\nNotably, Kaplan says the company is now deploying \"AI large language models (LLMs) to provide a second opinion on some content before we take enforcement actions.\"\n\nTimed with the announcement, Kaplan also provided an \"exclusive\" interview with the Fox News morning program \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nBelow is a transcript of Zuckerberg's remarks, followed by a transcript of the Kaplan appearance on Fox & Friends:\n\nMark Zuckerberg:\n\nHey everyone. I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown five years ago about the importance of protecting free expression, and I still believe this today, but a lot has happened over the last several years.\n\nThere's been widespread debate about the potential harms from online content. Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there's also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously, and I want to make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content, but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts.\n\nThat's millions of people, and we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So, we're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, here's what we're going to do.\n\nFirst, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US. So, over the next couple of months, we're going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.\n\nSecond, we're going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms.\n\nThird, we're changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms. We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now, we're going to focus those filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations, and for lower-severity violations, we're going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action. The problem is that the filters make mistakes, and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn't. So, by dialing them back, we're going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms. We're also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content. The reality is that this is a trade-off. It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.\n\nFourth, we're bringing back civic content. For a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed, so we stopped recommending these posts, but it feels like we're in a new era now, and we're starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again. So we're going to start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram, and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. Fifth, we're going to move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US-based content review is going to be based in Texas. As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.\n\nFinally, we're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world. They're going after American companies and pushing to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world. Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship, and making it difficult to build anything innovative there. Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down. China has censored our apps from even working in the country. The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government, and that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years when even the US government has pushed for censorship.\n\nBy going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further. But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it. It'll take time to get this right, and these are complex systems. They're never going to be perfect. There's also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove. But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content, it is time to focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our systems, and getting back to our roots about giving people voice. I'm looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there, and more to come soon.\n\nTranscript of Joel Kaplan appearance on Fox and Friends, January 7, 2025.\n\nLawrence Jones:\n\nAll right, buckle up. We got a Fox News alert moments ago. Meta the parent company of Facebook and Instagram announcing they are changing their policies to focus on free speech. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying this.\n\nMark Zuckerberg:\n\nWe're going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, we're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nWow, this is a big deal. Changes include ending its third-party fact-checking program and lifting restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nWell, is there anything more important to talk about? Also, until now, meta used automated systems to scan for violations, but found they resulted in too much censorship. So from now on, they'll focus on tackling illegal and severe violations like terrorism fraud to name a few.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nAnd joining us right now to name one Fox and Friends exclusive, met as Chief Global Affairs Officer, Joel Kaplan joins us live here on the couch. Joel, welcome.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nThanks. Great to be here on the couch on Fox and Friends.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nIt's great to have you. You here? Okay, so you are announcing these big changes as of two minutes ago. If you're making big changes, does that mean you were doing something wrong before?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nLook, this is a great opportunity for us to reset the balance in favor of free expression. As Mark says in that video, what we're doing today is we're getting back to our roots in free expression. There's a number of changes we're making, but if I could, and just highlight three first is, as you heard, we're eliminating the third-party fact-checking system. Well-intentioned at the outset, but there's just been too much political bias in what they choose to fact-check and how, so we're just scrapping it entirely.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nYou say \"they,\" what do you mean? You mean \"you.\"\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nThe fact-checkers.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nYou set up your, but they're your fact-checkers, right?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nSo the idea was they're independent, but they've just been too biased. And so what we're going to do instead is adopt a system like X has of community notes. So we're just going to rely on our own community of users to provide people more information about what they're seeing and we think that's going to work great.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nSo give us an example. If we said, if the headline is Donald Trump won the presidency, then anyone in the community can write notes underneath it.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah, great question. So somebody can write a note and then the way it works is different people on the platform can sort of vote on that note. And if you get people who usually disagree who all say, yeah, that sounds right, then that note gets put on the post and people see it. X has been doing it for a while, we think it's working really well, and we're going to adopt that system.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nAnd what are the other ones you want? I know you want to go through.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nThank you. So the second one is about the rules that govern content on our platform. They've just become too restrictive over time about what people can say, including about those kind of sensitive topics that you mentioned that people want to discuss and debate. Immigration, trans issues, gender. We want to make it so that bottom line, if you can say it on tv, you can say it on the floor of Congress. You certainly ought to be able to say it on Facebook and Instagram without fear of censorship. So we're changing those rules. And then the last thing, if I could, we're also going to change how we enforce the rules and we're going to make it so that there's way less over-enforcement and way fewer mistakes that actually make up the vast majority of censorship that people experience on our platforms. So big changes all in service of getting us back to our values of free expression.\n\nLawrence Jones:\n\nSo Joel, I guess the big question is where are the changes coming from? Because I mean, it's hard not to notice there's been a change in Mark Zuckerberg. You've seen him as respectfully the nerdy kid, change over to the jujitsu. He's put on some lean muscles. His viewpoints have changed, his posting content. When he does speak, he's meeting with Trump, taking a different stance on certain things. Are these changes coming from him or from what the public is saying?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWell, there's no question that the things that happen at Met are coming from Mark, but there's also no question that there has been a change over the last four years. We saw a lot of societal and political pressure all in the direction of more content moderation, more censorship, and we've got a real opportunity now. We've got a new administration and a new president coming in who are big defenders of free expression, and that makes a difference. One of the things we've experienced is that when you have a US president administration that's pushing for censorship, it just makes it open season for other governments around the world that don't even have the protections of the First Amendment to really put pressure on US companies. We're going to work with President Trump to push back on that kind of thing around the world.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nSo Joel, why now? I know you said it's a change, but did you feel restricted over the last four years and this is the first time you have, it's in your business interests to express this quest for freedom?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWell, there's no question that there's an opportunity here with a new president taking office, as I said, who really believes in free expression. And that's just going to give us the space to get back to those values that Mark has talked about for a long mark gave a big speech six years ago at Georgetown about free expression, about these values. Unfortunately, there's been a lot of political and societal pressure here and around the world that have pushed away from those values. We've got a real opportunity to reset, get back to them, and really provide a space for how.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nHow was the Biden administration putting pressure on you specifically? Where they calling where they didn't like a post? What did they say? Take it down.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah. So Mark talked about this in a letter he sent to the House judiciary committee a few months ago that sort of outlined the way in which we got a lot of pressure around Covid in particular to take down more content, even things like humor and satire about the pandemic and about vaccines. So we did experience that kind of pressure. The decisions we made ultimately were our own. But there's a real opportunity here with President Trump coming into office with his commitment to free expression for us to get back to those values and really provide space for people to have the kind of discourse and debate they want to have.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nWould you do what X did? And that is unleash independent journalists like Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss and Michael Shellenberger onto, forensically, go through what you guys, or actually repressing, shielding, shadow banning over the last few years. Wouldn't that be part of this cleansing process?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nSo we've had an opportunity to do a lot of that with the House Judiciary Committee and Chairman Jordan over the last few months and years. And he put out a really thorough report on the experience that we and other companies have had. Honestly, we're pretty focused on the future and the opportunity we have right now with the changes we're making today to really open up the space for debate and expression on our platform.\n\nLawrence Jones:\n\nIs the idea to get out of politics. Totally. And focus on just the enterprise of the free market. People debating things, or is it for Mark Zuckerberg to become Elon Musk and be influential as well work with the next administration or a little bit of both? I don't know.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWell, Mark's always going to be Mark Zuckerberg, but I think there is a real opportunity to work with the new administration, both on free expression, but also on American leadership and technology and innovation. This is something we've seen President Trump is really focused on making sure that we maintain US competitiveness and leadership on technology, things like ai. Those are obviously super important to our company and our industry, and we'll look forward to working with the new administration to advance those goals.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nAnd Joel, when you talk about content moderation, I think a lot of people watching right now are going, well, it sounds better if they're not taking instructions from the federal government, the Joe Biden administration saying, Hey, this is wrong. Take that down. So people like the idea that they're going to have a say where you can add the community notes going forward, but ultimately, is this one of the things you are doing as a company to make sure that Meta and the other social media companies aren't regulated by Washington? The last thing you guys want.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah. I think when it comes to expression, especially in the United States, we got a long tradition of the First Amendment and we think that the right thing is for individual users to have the ability to decide themselves what to say. Look, there's bad stuff that people do online like they do in the real world, and we want to make sure we don't have that. So we're still going to be enforcing against terrorism and drug sales and child sexual exploitation things. Everybody agrees have no business being on our platform.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nWhat about bullying all the young little girls? I remember, mark, remember he was on the Hill and he had apo.... he was kind enough to turn around and apologize to the families, but all those families have lost their kids from bullying. I have a nine-year-old, I'm starting to get concerned because eventually when she's in high school or even after, she'll be faced with these situations. So what do you say to those families?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah, well, I'm a parent of two teenagers.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nGosh, you're in it.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah, I'm in it. So these are issues that I take really seriously and that a lot of my colleagues who are also parents at Meta and those who aren't parents take really seriously. We got to make sure teens are protected online. We launched a few months ago a product called Teen Accounts that really puts parents in the driver's seat and makes it so that they can see what their kids can see and do online, who can contact them. We put kids in sort of built in default settings, the most protective settings we have. And then if you're under 16, you can't change those settings on Instagram without your parents' permission. We think that's a really good innovation and something we're hopeful. It's an area where Congress can act.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nHow do we do that setting? How do the parents find that setting on the phone before they give it to their child?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah, so we will send notifications basically to the parents to let them know that this opportunity exists and the kid can't sign up for Facebook, or excuse me, for Instagram without being put into a teen account. And then their parent gets a notice and says, Hey, your kid's trying to sign up and if you want to change any of the settings, you can do it here.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nSo Joel, what you got to do is reestablish trust. I mean, people remember the Zuckerbucks into those key areas in 2020 that were deciding what candidate was going to win what state. And one of the reasons you are trying to do that is number one, making this announcement here. The other thing is changing your board to let people know maybe by the people that you're hiring that you asked to join, that their agenda doesn't match maybe the 2020 agenda. What have you done?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWell, we made a big announcement yesterday. Put three new board members on, great board members including Dana White, the president and CEO of UFC, guy's a legend, an incredible businessman, incredible entrepreneur, marketing genius, super excited to have him. A couple other great board members with real deep business experience that we put on the board. So those are important voices. Mark has always been great about getting different perspectives so that we sort of cover the waterfront of ideas and perspectives that we want to make sure are getting fed into the process.\n\nLawrence Jones:\n\nJoel, can you tell the audience and the world that this is not a temporary stance? And what I mean by that is this just because you got Donald Trump in there for four years, are you guys going to continue this after his presidency or is this just a temporary thing for the moment?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nThis is an opportunity for us to get back to the values that Mark founded the company on. This runs deep for Mark. It's a great opportunity to rebalance and to get back to free expression.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nWhen you say rebalance, historically the big tech companies and social media companies have leaned to the left that is this dragging it closer to the center. I mean with Dana White, obviously a Trump ally as part of the board. Is the company becoming more central rather than leaning to one side or the other?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nI think the way to look at it is we are a platform for all people and all ideas.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nI know, but some people don't feel that certain and haven't felt historically that certain social media companies were hospitable to their points of view.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nNo question. And that's what I meant by rebalance. We want to make sure that they understand that their views are welcome and that we're providing a space for them to come onto our platforms, engage, express themselves, engage in the important issues of the day or not in the important issues today, and just whatever it is they want to talk about and share. And so we need to make sure they feel welcome. We need to make sure we rebuild trust, and that's a big part of what we're doing today.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nSo also there's something else could be in front of the Supreme Court and that's future of TikTok China controlled. So you're an American company, you decide to make this announcement. How does this relate to what TikTok could possibly do?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nSo look, we like competition. We think it makes us better. I know there are concerns that Congress has expressed and that the President and Congress and the courts are working through With TikTok, we're going to stay focused on what we're doing and how we make our platform as open and welcoming a place as possible for all points of view.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nDo you think it should be banned?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWell, that's something I'm going to leave to the president and the courts in Congress. We're focused, again, we're focused on what we can do to make our platforms the best they can be.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nIf Elon Musk didn't buy X and expose what he exposed and put community notes like that, do you think we'd be in? What did he in buying this and doing what he did do for the introspection that Facebook is showing right now?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nI think Elon's played an incredibly important role in moving the debate and getting people refocused on free expression. And that's been really constructive and productive, and we're just glad that we've got the opportunity now to make these kind of changes and to get back to our roots in free expression.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nMaybe all social media companies can learn a lot from this, because y'all were the original, mark was one of the originals at least. And so y'all have had to see all the changes in what works and what doesn't work and what Americans really want. So thank you for your honesty. Thank you for doing this for children and all your customers.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nAustralia has banned social media up until you're 16 years old. How do you feel about that?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nWe think the right way to do it is to trust parents. That's what we're doing with the teen accounts that I mentioned. And obviously we've got to work with governments and follow the laws that they pass, but I think there's a better way, and that's to put parents in charge. They know what's best for their teens and their kids, and that's what we're trying to do.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nWhat's your biggest customer? What age group?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nOh, that's a good question. I mean, we've got 3.2 billion people using our services, so we really have people across all ages and we want to make sure we're serving them all and letting them express themselves in a way, especially with teens where they're still kept safe.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nDid you talk to David Sacks about this? Who's going to be coming in as the AI czar?\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nYeah, we've talked to David. We're really excited about that post. We think he's going to do great things. He really understands the industry. He really understands crypto and AI, and we can't wait to start working with him.\n\nSteve Doocy:\n\nWell, Joel, thank you very much for stopping by the couch and making a big announcement today.\n\nLawrence Jones:\n\nHopefully you'll come back as well.\n\nJoel Kaplan:\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you all for having me.\n\nBrian Kilmeade:\n\nA fair and balanced social media world. There you go. Thank you so much.\n\nAinsley Earhardt:\n\nThank you. Nice to meet you.",

The Board will be reviewing the implications of the various changes in line with its commitment to freedom of expression and other human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Oversight Board welcomes the news that Meta will revise its approach to fact-checking, with the goal of finding a scalable solution to enhance trust, free speech and user voice on its platforms.\n\n\n\nThough Meta\u2019s platforms are intended to be places where people can express themselves freely, its fact-checking program has been subject to various criticisms. Specifically in the United States, rightly or wrongly, Meta\u2019s previous approach has been perceived as politically biased by many of its users.\n\n\n\nTo address these concerns, Meta has announced it is launching a replacement for its third-party fact-checking program, starting in the United States, through a crowd-sourced approach. We look forward to working with Meta in the coming weeks to understand the changes in greater detail, ensuring its new approach can be as effective and speech-friendly as possible.\n\n\n\nThe Oversight Board looks forward to helping to shape Meta\u2019s renewed push for free speech in 2025 through our standard case decisions, policy advisory opinions and white papers. As the Board has repeatedly highlighted, it is essential that decisions on content are taken with maximum input from voices outside of Meta, including of the people who use its platforms every day.\n\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to thank Nick Clegg who, as president of global affairs at Meta, was instrumental in overseeing the creation of the Oversight Board and has been a strong advocate for freedom of speech on Meta\u2019s platforms. We look forward to Joel Kaplan\u2019s leadership in continuing this important work.\u201d\n\nStatement by Co-Chairs of the Oversight Board:\n\nEvelyn Aswad, Michael McConnell, Pamela San Mart\u00edn, Helle Thorning-Schmidt\n\nReturn to Press",

Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the shift as part of an effort to \u201cget back to our roots around free expression.\u201d AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez\n\nMeta\u2019s move away from fact-checking in content moderation practices could potentially allow more hate speech or mis- or disinformation, a Northeastern University social media expert says.\n\nMeta is adopting a model similar to the one used by X, called Community Notes.\n\nJohn Wihbey, an associate professor of media innovation and technology at Northeastern University, sees the move as the company repositioning itself ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. But third party fact-checking, while difficult to scale on a platform with billions of users, \u201cis an important symbol of commitment to trust and safety and information integrity,\u201d Wihbey says.\n\nIt is \u201cdangerous,\u201d he says, to break from those norms at a moment when \u201cthe winds of authoritarian populism are blowing across the globe.\u201d\n\nIn a video message, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the shift as part of an effort to \u201cget back to our roots around free expression,\u201d noting, among other things, that the company\u2019s fact-checking system has resulted in \u201ctoo many mistakes and too much censorship.\u201d\n\nHe also cited the 2024 presidential election, describing the election of Trump as a \u201ccultural tipping point\u201d toward \u201conce again prioritizing speech.\u201d\n\nOn X, the Community Notes model uses crowdsourced input from users to fact-check posts, usually in the form of added context. Wihbey described Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement as confusing, noting that Meta\u2019s third party fact-checkers played a minimal role in day-to-day moderation when compared to its sophisticated algorithmic tools, which can sometimes result in false positives or negatives.\n\nAs part of the policy shift, Meta says it will scale back its content moderation algorithms.\n\nIn addition, the company says that it wants to pivot to a more laissez-faire approach to civic or political content after tightening controls in recent years to curb the spread of mis- and disinformation.\n\n\u201cIn recent years we\u2019ve developed increasingly complex systems to manage content across our platforms, partly in response to societal and political pressure to moderate content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis approach has gone too far. As well-intentioned as many of these efforts have been, they have expanded over time to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable.\u201d\n\nThe policy changes could have downstream effects \u2014 not only in the U.S., but elsewhere around the world, warns Wihbey, whose forthcoming book, \u201cGoverning Babel: The Debate over Social Media Platforms and Free Speech \u2013 and What Comes Next,\u201d delves into content moderation and free speech.\n\nNortheastern Global News, in your inbox. Sign up for NGN\u2019s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\n\u201cThe analogy I would use is that they\u2019re simultaneously standing down the police while opening up the floodgates for crime,\u201d Wihbey says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a dangerous mix.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real step backwards in terms of trust and safety and platform integrity,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt the same time, I understand pragmatically why Mark Zuckerberg and their leadership are moving in this direction.\u201d\n\nStill, Wihbey described the policy reversal as short-sighted because it is too narrowly focused on the U.S. market. Meta\u2019s products, he notes, are used worldwide \u2014 accounting for about $134.9 billion in global revenue.\n\n\u201cThe Meta product suite, which is Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp Messenger, is very, very important to civil society, political debate, human rights work and journalism, so this is going to have a lot of second-order consequences beyond the shores of the United States,\u201d Wihbey says.",

More AI, and more ways for people to engage with the latest AI tools, so that they can get a grasp of just how advanced these generative AI functions have become.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s what we need.\n\nEvidently, that\u2019s Meta\u2019s line of thinking, as it\u2019s now experimenting with yet another way to show off its generative AI engine, by creating images of actual users, then displaying them to those users in-stream.\n\nAs you can see in these examples, Meta is currently using people\u2019s selfie images, that have been uploaded to its generative AI image tools, to then create custom AI depictions of them in different, imagined scenarios.\n\nAs Reddit user Green_Video_9831 explained:\n\n\u201cUsed Meta AI to edit a selfie, now Instagram is using my face on ads targeted at me.\u201d\n\nMeta has confirmed that it is testing this out, and that some users are seeing these bizarre depictions in-stream.\n\nWhich is pretty weird, and somewhat intrusive, and I can\u2019t imagine that many of Meta\u2019s 3 billion users are going to be like \u201coh, how cool, it\u2019s a cartoon image of me, but not me, like an Uncanny Valley image of myself.\u201d\n\nLike, no. It may actually be the worst kind of Uncanny Valley I\u2019ve seen, where the image looks sort of like you, but not really. And science has shown that depictions like this are off-putting for humans, so why Meta\u2019s team thought that this would be a good promotional opportunity, I don\u2019t know. But clearly, a meeting was had, and a decision was made to go ahead with AI deepfakes of users, as if that\u2019s a thing that will spark more interest in it AI tools.\n\nInterestingly, these specific images also speak to what Meta seems to think that users want from AI, placing yourself in a hall of mirrors, where other versions of yourself all pay attention to you. That could essentially be facilitated by Meta\u2019s broader plan to roll out AI bot profiles in its apps, while also giving users the opportunity to create their own AI variations of themselves.\n\nMaybe, this is a thing that Meta thinks will be popular, surrounding yourself with customized AI characters, all aligned to you and your thoughts, so that you can chat with yourself in peace.\n\nEither way, Meta is going to push ahead, because according to its data, its AI tools are popular, and more users are turning to them over time. Last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed that its Meta AI chatbot now has close to 600 million monthly active users, making it the most used AI chatbot tool in the world.\n\nThat means that around a fifth of all of Meta\u2019s users are now engaging with its AI tools, at least somewhat regularly, though the fact that Meta has built them directly into its search bar would also have played some part in driving up perceived usage.\n\nStill, while the numbers are going up, Meta will continue to pour fuel on the fire, while it\u2019s also investing billions to expand its AI data centers, and broaden its capacity, in order to establish itself as one of the key players in the AI race.\n\nSo it needs people to love AI, in order to justify that expenditure, and it really wants people to create images of themselves via its AI tools to get more content flowing through its circuits.\n\nI\u2019m still not sold on AI tools that \u201cimagine\u201d you in unrealistic scenarios, as that runs, for me at least, counter to the purpose of social media apps, which give people a means to share their actual, human experiences, and to relate to each other by providing their perspective.\n\nPeople are sharing less of such either way, so any activity is good for the apps themselves. But the more AI gets integrated into social platforms, the less they feel \u201csocial\u201d, and the more it seems like a digital showcase of meaningless images and posts, that will eventually just become robot avatars talking amongst themselves.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem like the outcome we should want, but curiosity, and novelty, does appear to be winning out, at least for now.\n\nAnd maybe, there are people who really want to see what they might look like in a hall of mirrors, where everyone is looking at them. Imagine all of them were AI characters that you created, looking to you for guidance.\n\nWhat a world.",

Those donations became part of a false narrative that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump, although there has never been any evidence of widespread fraud or problems that would have changed that result. Nonetheless, Republican-controlled states have banned future donations to local elections offices and Trump himself threatened to imprison Zuckerberg in a book published in September, during the peak of the presidential campaign.\n\nZuckerberg released a video Tuesday using some of the language that conservatives have long used to criticize his platforms, saying it was time to prioritize \u201cfree expression\u201d and that fact-checkers had become \u201cpolitically biased.\u201d Zuckerberg said he is moving Meta\u2019s content moderation team from California, a blue state, to red state Texas, and lifting restrictions on some immigration and gender discussions. Meta had no immediate comment on how many people might be relocated.\n\nAt a press conference hours later, Trump praised the changes.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve come a long way, Meta,\u201d Trump said. When asked if he believed Zuckerberg made the changes in response to threats the incoming president has made, Trump responded: \u201cProbably.\u201d\n\nMeta is among several tech companies apparently working to get in Trump\u2019s good graces before he takes office later this month. Meta and Amazon each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund in December, and Zuckerberg had dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\n\nZuckerberg this week also appointed a key Trump ally, Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, to Meta\u2019s board. Amazon announced a documentary on incoming first lady Melania Trump. ABC News, which is owned by Disney, last month settled a libel suit filed by Trump with a $15 million payment to Trump\u2019s presidential library foundation.\n\nBrendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, called the Meta changes part of \u201ca pattern of powerful people and institutions kowtowing to the president in a way that suggests they\u2019re fearful of being targeted.\u201d\n\nNyhan said that\u2019s a grave risk to the country.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump stands on stage with former first lady Melania Trump, family members and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

Teenagers, however, have fled Facebook over the past decade, with just 32% reporting they used it in a 2024 survey.\n\nMeta began fact checks in December 2016, after Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that \u201cfake news\u201d was spreading on its platforms. For years, the tech giant boasted it was working with more than 100 organizations in over 60 languages to combat misinformation.\n\nThe Associated Press ended its participation in Meta\u2019s fact-checking program a year ago.\n\nMedia experts and those who study social media were aghast at Meta\u2019s policy shift.\n\nMeta said it\u2019s scrapping its third-party fact-checking program and replacing it with community notes written by users similar to the model used by Elon Musk\u2019s X. Here\u2019s what to know.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to end Meta\u2019s fact-checking program not only removes a valuable resource for users, but it also provides an air of legitimacy to a popular disinformation narrative: That fact-checking is politically biased. Fact-checkers provide a valuable service by adding important context to the viral claims that mislead and misinform millions of users on Meta,\u201d said Dan Evon, lead writer for RumorGuard, the News Literacy Project\u2019s digital tool that curates fact checks and teaches people to spot viral misinformation.\n\nBusiness analysts saw it as an openly political gambit.\n\n\u201cMeta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe move will elate conservatives, who\u2019ve often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nX\u2019s approach to content moderation has led to the loss of some advertisers, but Enberg said Meta\u2019s \u201cmassive size and powerhouse ad platform insulate it somewhat from an X-like user and advertiser exodus.\u201d Even so, she said, any major drop in user engagement could hurt Meta\u2019s ad business.\n\nMeta\u2019s quasi-independent Oversight Board, which acts as a referee of controversial content decisions, said it welcomes the changes and looks forward to working with the company \u201cto understand the changes in greater detail, ensuring its new approach can be as effective and speech-friendly as possible.\u201d\n\nOn X, Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, called Meta\u2019s move a \u201chuge step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nOthers in the GOP were skeptical.\n\n\u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\u201d Rep. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, wrote on X. \u201cCan any of us assume Zuckerberg won\u2019t return to his old tricks?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg is not registered with any political party but was once seen as a champion of liberal causes. He invested heavily in supporting an immigration overhaul and defending the rights of those brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country. His efforts to fact-check content on Facebook made him a longtime target of conservative suspicions. When he made his election donation in 2020 he framed it as a nonpartisan, civic act, but quickly ran afoul of widespread distrust on the right.\n\nAlexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech and a former director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said the change is \u201ca choice of politics, not policy,\u201d and warned: \u201cDepending on how this is applied, the consequences of this decision will be an increase in harassment, hate speech and other harmful behavior across billion-user platforms.\u201d",

These changes to the hateful conduct policy are in addition to news this morning that Meta will end its fact-checking program.\n\nToday\u2019s sweeping and extreme policy changes represent a wholesale abandonment of the norms and best practices of content moderation. The new language of Meta\u2019s Community Standards includes numerous changes that will result in Instagram, Facebook, and Threads becoming unsafe landscapes filled with dangerous hate speech, violence, harassment, and misinformation.\n\nGLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis today responded to Meta\u2019s rollback:\n\n\u201cZuckerberg\u2019s removal of fact-checking programs and industry-standard hate speech policies make Meta\u2019s platforms unsafe places for users and advertisers alike. Without these necessary hate speech and other policies, Meta is giving the green light for people to target LGBTQ people, women, immigrants, and other marginalized groups with violence, vitriol, and dehumanizing narratives. With these changes, Meta is continuing to normalize anti-LGBTQ hatred for profit \u2014 at the expense of its users and true freedom of expression. Fact-checking and hate speech policies protect free speech.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s announcement includes numerous alarming changes (many entirely overturning Meta\u2019s previous policies) to both allow anti-LGBTQ hateful rhetoric, and cease to protect LGBTQ users from being targeted with such attacks. Notably, the additions of the words \u201ctransgenderism\u201d (a hateful right wing neologism intended to imply that being trans is an ideology) and \u201chomosexuality\u201d (an outdated and pathologizing way of referring to LGBTQ people) are shocking red flags.\n\nStating that, \u201cOur policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech,\u201d Meta\u2019s new policies now expressly allow such anti-LGBTQ speech as: \u201cInsulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality\u201d and \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality\u2026\u2019\u201d Meta has also removed clauses prohibiting the following: \u201cthe usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics\u201d and \u201cSelf-admission to intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.\u201d\n\nThese are just a few of the many extreme new policies the company has adopted. These sweeping policy changes will harm not only the historically marginalized groups who have been stripped of protections \u2014 but all platform users who will be confronted with unmoderated, extremist rhetoric and hate.\n\nThe changes coincide with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that the company is ending its fact-checking program, and replacing it with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d-style system. The company also stated that Meta will move its US-based content review team to Texas. In December, Zuckerberg said he seeks an \u201cactive role\u201d in shaping tech policy in the upcoming Trump administration.\n\nBelow are just some of the changes made to Meta\u2019s Hateful Conduct policies today:\n\nAllowances for attacks on LGBTQ people, women, and immigrants: Specifically, Meta now states: \u201cPeople sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups. Other times, they call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. Finally, sometimes people curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.\u201d Allowances for economic exclusion of women and transgender people: In its Economic exclusion clause, Meta now states \u201cWe do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs.\u201d Allowances for social exclusion of women and transgender people: Meta states that it now allows for content advocating for \u201csex or gender-based exclusion from spaces commonly limited by sex or gender, such as restrooms, sports and sports leagues, health and support groups, and specific schools.\u201d Allowances for claims that LGBTQ people are mentally ill: Meta now states \u201cWe do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism Please see an explanation of \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d a rightwing neologism that is commonly used as an anti-trans dogwhistle. [sic] and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like \u2018weird.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nRemoval of prohibitions against dehumanization of protected groups \u2014 Previously, Meta prohibited \u201cDehumanizing speech in the form of comparisons to or generalizations about : Inanimate objects: For example, \u201cwomen as household objects or property or objects in general \u2026 transgender or non-binary people as \u201cit.\u201d Criminals: For example, \u201cthieves,\u201d \u201cbank robbers,\u201d or saying \u201cAll [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] are \u2018criminals.\u201d\n\nRemoval of prohibition against statements denying existence \u2014 For example, \u201c[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] do not exist\u201d or \u201c[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nReducing clarity on hate speech: Meta removes prohibitions on \u201cstatements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusion or segregation.\u201d\n\nReducing clarity on Meta\u2019s definition of slurs: Previously, Meta defined slurs as speech \u201cused to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics.\u201d\n\nReducing clarity on \u201cgeneralizations that state inferiority\u201d and \u201ccontempt,\u201d which Meta now calls \u201cinsults\u201d: Meta has now removed several sections of its policy that previously prohibited harassment regarding physical appearance, mental characteristics, and other statements of protected groups being \u201cworthless\u201d or \u201cfreaks.\u201d Meta has removed several definitions of \u201ccontempt,\u201d including \u201cintolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther changes to Meta\u2019s hate speech policy include:\n\nTransitioning from the phrase \u201chate speech\u201d to \u201chateful conduct\u201d\n\nRemoval of Meta\u2019s previous acknowledgment that hate speech \u201ccreates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence .\u201d\n\nRemovals of additional restrictions for paid content\n\nThe current version of Meta\u2019s policies is here, and previous versions showing what has been changed can be found on the left-hand tabs. Meta first started its efforts to combat hate speech in the 2010s, adding improvements over the last decade. Meta formalized its hate speech policy in 2018, clarifying definitions of hate speech including attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender identity, and disability.\n\nAs highlighted in GLAAD\u2019s 2024 Social Media Safety Index (SMSI) report, Meta\u2019s Facebook, Threads, and Instagram are largely failing to mitigate dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate and disinformation. The June 2024 SMSI \u2014 in which Meta received a failing score for the fourth year \u2014 also recommends that Meta and other companies better train moderators on the needs of LGBTQ users.\n\nMeta\u2019s enforcement failures have elicited longtime concern from the Oversight Board, trust and safety experts, human rights advocates, advertisers, and even Meta\u2019s shareholders.\n\nAbout GLAAD\u2019s Social Media Safety Program: As the leading national LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD is working every day to hold tech companies and social media platforms accountable, and to secure safe online spaces for LGBTQ people. The GLAAD Social Media Safety (SMS) program researches, monitors, and reports on a variety of issues facing LGBTQ social media users \u2014 with a focus on safety, privacy, and expression. The SMS program has consulted directly with platforms and tech companies on some of the most significant LGBTQ policy and product developments over the years. In addition to ongoing advocacy work with platforms (including TikTok, X/Twitter, YouTube, and Meta\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and others), and issuing the highly-respected annual Social Media Safety Index (SMSI) report, the SMS program produces resources, guides, publications, and campaigns, and actively works to educate the general public and raise awareness in the media about LGBTQ social media safety issues, especially anti-LGBTQ hate and disinformation.",

            "content": "Meta says it will end fact-checking as Silicon Valley prepares for Trump\n\ntoggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that the social media company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, would stop working with third-party fact-checking organizations.\n\nRepeating talking points long used by President-elect Donald Trump and his allies, in a video Zuckerberg said the company's content moderation approach resulted too often in \"censorship\".\n\n\"After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But the fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the U.S.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeta set up one of the most extensive partnerships with fact checkers after the 2016 presidential election, in which Russia spread false claims on Facebook and other online platforms. The company created what has become a standard for how tech platforms limit the spread of falsehoods and misleading information.\n\nBut the 2020 election and the COVID pandemic accelerated a backlash among conservatives who cast content moderation as a form of censorship. Facebook, along with Twitter and YouTube, banned Trump from their platforms after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, but eventually allowed him to return ahead of his second run for office. In recent years, fact checkers, researchers of false narratives, and social media content moderation programs have become targets of Republican-led Congressional probes and legal challenges.\n\nZuckerberg said his views on content moderation have changed. Meta has made \"too many mistakes\" in how it applied its content policies, he said, and pointed to Trump's election to a second term as \"a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.\"\n\n\"So we are going to get back to our roots, focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTech companies prepare for Trump 2.0\n\nThe move comes as Meta and other tech companies are working to smooth what has been a rocky relationship with Trump. The president-elect and other Republicans have long accused Silicon Valley of harboring anti-conservative bias that has muzzled their speech online. Trump has accused Zuckerberg personally of election interference and threatened him with life in prison.\n\nLast week Meta elevated Joel Kaplan, a veteran company executive and Republican who once worked in George W. Bush's White House, to head of global policy, replacing former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. On Monday, the company named Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a longtime supporter of Trump, to its board of directors.\n\nZuckerberg is among the tech titans who have traveled to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump since the election, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund (Amazon and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made similar pledges).\n\nBrendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and longtime Meta observer, said it is distressing seeing business leaders \"showing performative fealty\" to the incoming administration.\n\n\"Meta clearly perceives a great deal of political risk of being targeted,\" Nyhan said in an interview. \"And the way Zuckerberg presented the announcements, and the timing, was obviously intended to play to a Republican audience.\"\n\nSome observers say Meta may be hoping for a lighter touch from regulators in the Trump administration.\n\ntoggle caption Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images\n\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that she worries executives at Meta are seeking a \"sweetheart deal\" in the Trump White House.\n\nA sweeping antitrust case against Meta brought by the FTC and attorneys general from 48 states and territories during Trump's first term is set to go to trial in April. In a recent court filing, government lawyers wrote Mark Zuckerberg is expected to be among the first witnesses called to the stand.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Well, look, I can't predict what future people in my position are going to do. It is true that the FTC has been very successful, including in its ongoing litigations against Amazon and Facebook,\" Khan said. \"And so it's only going to be natural that those companies are going to want to come in and see, can they get some type of sweetheart deal?\"\n\nRepublicans welcomed Meta's announcement as validation of their long-running complaints.\n\n\"I think they've come a long way,\" Trump said during a press conference on Tuesday. Asked if he thought Zuckerberg was \"directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past,\" Trump responded: \"Probably.\"\n\n\"Meta finally admits to censoring speech\u2026what a great birthday present to wake up to and a huge win for free speech,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) posted on X.\n\nResearch has shown that Republicans circulated more unfounded claims. One study also found that far right content was more engaging on Facebook, and that far-right sources known for spreading misinformation significantly outperformed non-misinformation sources. Data to definitively prove bias on a platform level is not available to researchers.\n\n\n\nMeta to follow Elon Musk's cues on fact-checking\n\nMeta said instead of working with third-party fact checkers, it would shift to a \"community notes\" program where users write and rate notes that appear next to specific posts. That's similar to the approach Elon Musk has championed on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"I think Elon's played an incredibly important role in moving the debate and getting people refocused on free expression,\" Meta's Kaplan told Fox & Friends on Tuesday.\n\nMeta also said it would change how it enforces its policies, dialing back automated systems except for \"illegal and high-severity violations\" including terrorism, child sexual exploitation, and fraud. The company's U.S. content moderation team will move from California to Texas. The move should \"help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFact checkers who have worked with Meta for years pushed back against Zuckerberg's accusation of bias.\n\n\"It was particularly troubling to see him echo claims of bias against the fact checkers because he knows that the ones that participated in his program were signatories of a code of principles that requires that they be transparent and nonpartisan,\" said Bill Adair, co-founder of the International Fact Checking Network. He founded PolitiFact, one of the first participants in Facebook's third party fact checker's program, which he left in 2020.\n\n\"Meta, up until this morning, has always appreciated the independence of fact checkers,\" Adair said.\n\nSince Meta pays fact checkers for their work, some fact-checking organizations \u2014 most of which are non-profits \u2014 heavily rely on the company to survive. \"We'll see fewer fact-checking reports published and fewer fact checkers working,\" said Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of International Fact Checking Network.\n\n\"I think the fact-checking programs on social media have been really positive for helping to reduce hoax content and conspiracy theories. And to see it so quickly curtailed this way without a whole lot of discussion is disappointing,\" Holan said.\n\nMeta's funding of fact checkers reverberated beyond its own platforms, said Kate Starbird, a University of Washington disinformation researcher who co-founded its Center for an Informed Public. \"Though integrated with Facebook's infrastructure, their work had a much broader impact, and was often cited in other spaces, including the Community Notes program at X, which Meta says it will now copy.\"\n\n\"In short, it is going to be more difficult for people to find information that they can trust online,\" she said. Researchers also rely on the work of fact checkers to better understand what's happening on social media platforms.\n\nWhile the effects on some fact checkers will be immediate, the announcement is light on details about how Meta will change what its users see on their feeds, said Katie Harbath, global affairs officer at the technology consulting firm Duco Experts who formerly worked at Facebook.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut women and LGBTQ communities might be affected more, she said, given the few specific topics Meta mentioned.\n\n\"We're going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse.\" Zuckerberg said in the video.\n\n\"It's not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms,\" Kaplan wrote in Meta's press release about the new policies.\n\n\"I think those folks could be particularly negatively impacted [by] this and may have to make decisions about not being on these platforms and not having those audiences to engage with,\" Harbath said.",

I\u2019ll tell y\u2019all this right at the top: VR is life-changing. We already touched on our Demeo experiences, so I won\u2019t go too deep there. But, that particular game is twenty times better in VR. It\u2019s genuinely like playing an in-person Tabletop RPG with your friends. And that\u2019s not the only great thing about my early Meta Quest 3 experiences!\n\nIf you\u2019ve never put a VR headset on but have always loved gaming, nothing prepares you for the first time doing something as simple as interacting with menus. It\u2019s intuitive, bright, responsive \u2014 and it\u2019s just plain cool. When I created my avatar, I was blown away by how detailed the options were. I was expecting something bare-bones and stiff, but you truly can create yourself. Well, with the Meta Quest 3, anyway. Though I\u2019m sure the other VR headsets have solid avatar creation options, too!\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 itself fit pretty well and didn\u2019t make me suffer during longer play sessions. I will say that I need to buy one of those accessories that offer extra padding and extend the Meta Quest 3\u2019s battery life. But, otherwise? Smooth sailing!\n\nScreenshot: YouTube/Meta Quest\n\nI\u2019m so excited for the meta quest 3\u2019s future\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my Meta Quest 3 time so far playing Demeo, admittedly. However, I dabbled in Beat Saber and Walkabout Mini Golf. I need to work on my hand-eye coordination for Beat Saber because I\u2019m terrible right now. But, Walkabout Mini Golf? Worth the price of the headset all by itself.\n\nI mean that. Playing mini golf in VR is so peaceful. For the brief duration I played Walkabout Mini Golf, my troubles melted away. The music is soothing, the environments are varied and beautifully rendered, and it\u2019s genuinely challenging! I played one pirate-themed course, and I have so many other courses to enjoy!\n\nSo, what\u2019s my immediate Meta Quest plan? Well, I\u2019m building my VR stamina so I can formally review Batman: Arkham Shadow. As an eternal Batman geek, it\u2019s my destiny to review that game. But, I heard it\u2019s physically demanding, so I\u2019m \u201ctraining\u201d to be worthy of Becoming the Bat. Overall, though? Get yourself a VR headset. I\u2019ve been championing the Meta Quest 3 because it\u2019s my only point of reference. But, trust me: it\u2019ll pay for itself within the first week of you owning it! Join us.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against the company after it suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest instance of a large corporation settling litigation with the president, who has threatened retribution on his critics and rivals, and comes as Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have joined other large technology companies in trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\nThe people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Two of the people said terms of the agreement include $22 million going to the nonprofit that will become Trump\u2019s future presidential library. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report on the settlement.\n\nZuckerberg visited Trump in November at his private Florida club to try to mend fences with the incoming president, something other technology, business and government officials have done as well. At the dinner, Trump brought up the litigation and suggested they try to resolve it, kick-starting two months of negotiations between the parties, the people said.\n\nMeta also made a $1 million donation to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, and Zuckerberg was among several billionaires granted prime seating during Trump\u2019s swearing-in last week in the Capitol Rotunda, along with Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, who now owns the platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s inauguration, Meta announced it was dropping fact-checking on its platform \u2014 a longtime priority of Trump and his allies.\n\nTrump filed the lawsuit months after his first term ended, calling the action by the social media companies \u201cillegal, shameful censorship of the American people.\u201d\n\nTwitter, Facebook and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services\u2019 own standards, so long as they are acting in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.\n\nBut Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity \u2014 or at least have it curtailed.\n\nThe Meta settlement comes after ABC News agreed last month to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nWATCH: ABC News settlement with Trump raises concerns about press freedom in his 2nd term\n\nThe network also agreed to pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.\n\nThe settlement agreement describes ABC\u2019s presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\u201d with the money earmarked for a nonprofit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be-built library.\n\nThe president has been litigious in arguing that he has been targeted with unfair coverage by legacy media companies.\n\nTrump has filed a lawsuit against CBS News over claims that the network aired a misleading interview with his 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on the program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that amounted to \u201cpartisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference\u201d intended to \u201cmislead the public and attempt to tip the scales.\u201d The program denied the claims.\n\nAnd he has a lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, the news outlet\u2019s parent company, Gannett, and the Iowa newspaper\u2019s pollster Ann Selzer, alleging they violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by releasing a poll days before the November election that significantly understated his support in the state. The paper and Selzer have denied wrongdoing.",

Zuckerberg is among the tech titans who have dined with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago since the election. Last week Meta named Joel Kaplan, a veteran company executive and Republican who once worked in George W. Bush's White House, its head of global policy.\n\nWhite is a longtime friend of Trump who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer and appeared in Trump's first TikTok video. On election night, White joined Trump on stage at his victory party, thanking many of the podcasters and online influencers who, along with UFC, have been credited with boosting the president-elect's appeal among young men.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhite and Zuckerberg, who has trained as a mixed martial arts fighter, have also become friendly. Zuckerberg praised White for building UFC into \"one of the most valuable, fastest growing, and most popular sports enterprises in the world\" in a Facebook post on Monday. \"I've admired him as an entrepreneur and his ability to build such a beloved brand,\" Zuckerberg continued.\n\n\"I've never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta's board. I am a huge believer that social media and AI are the future,\" White said in a statement. White has talked with Zuckerberg about using artificial intelligence to improve UFC rankings, ESPN reported in October.\n\nMeta also named as directors John Elkann, CEO of the European investment firm Ekon and executive chairman of carmakers Stellantis and Ferrari, and Charlie Songhurst, a tech investor who previously led corporate strategy at Microsoft. Songhurst joined a group advising Meta on AI last year.\n\nThe additions expand Meta's board from 10 to 13 directors, including Zuckerberg, who serves as chair.\n\n\"We have massive opportunities ahead in AI, wearables, and the future of social media, and our board will help us achieve our vision,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his Facebook post announcing the new members.",

Meta is also a top pick among U.S. large capitalization stocks for Jefferies, alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\n\"We believe Meta has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4 billion users and more than 200 million businesses across its family of apps,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote to clients. \"Meta has already leveraged AI to boost user engagement and advertiser return-on-investment. We note that Meta is already introducing Gen AI advertiser tools, which, per our checks, are already leading to increases in performance.\"\n\nMeta is already outperforming the market, including its 65% gain in 2024.

            "content": "With Donald Trump returning to the White House for a second term, it certainly seems like that\u2019s going to have some impact on how Meta approaches certain aspects of its business and planning moving forward.\n\nAlong that line, today, Meta has announced three new board members, in Exor CEO John Elkann, investor Charlie Songhurst, and UFC chief Dana White.\n\nThe most notable inclusion here is White, who\u2019s been a strong supporter of Donald Trump, and even spoke at the Republican National Convention last year. White also supported Trump's 2020 campaign, and has spoken on Trump\u2019s behalf at some of his rallies.\n\nThe inclusion of such a strong Trump ally on the Meta board could help to ease tensions with the incoming President, who, at one stage, had threatened to jail Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he were to regain power, due to the company\u2019s perceived political bias. Trump was specifically referring to Meta\u2019s decision to suspend his Facebook and IG accounts back in 2021, following the Capitol riots, while key Trump ally Elon Musk has also been a strong critic of Zuckerberg and his politically-motivated actions.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s re-election, however, Meta has been making moves to better align it with a second Trump administration, including replacing public affairs leader Nick Clegg, who was the man who actually made the call on suspending Trump's accounts, and replacing him with Republican Joel Kaplan, and Meta veteran who\u2019s long pushed for Meta to take a more hands-off approach to political speech in its apps.\n\nMeta has also restructured its public policy team to elevate more Republican voices, while Zuckerberg has also personally met with Trump to smooth over their differences.\n\nAnd it\u2019s now also appointed White to what may be an important advisory position.\n\nThe most significant impact that this could have, from a general user perspective, is that it could see Meta reconsidering its anti-politics stance, and removing restrictions on \u201cpolitical\u201d speech.\n\nMeta announced that it was making moves to limit the reach of political content in its apps early last year, and has since sought to make political material opt-in, giving users the chance to avoid such if they prefer.\n\nThat\u2019s proven particularly problematic on Threads, its Twitter replica app, in which real-time updates are a key focus, and limiting discussion in certain areas is likely hurting overall engagement. But on Facebook and Instagram, Meta deemed that political discussion was more trouble than it was worth, in sparking more angst, and thus, less time spent in its apps, while also bringing more scrutiny on the company for its perceived bias or interferences.\n\nBut now, with more influential voices having a say in its approach, Meta could well change its tune, and look to ease those limits once again, or at least, make political content more accessible to users.\n\nAnd Meta can still have huge political influence.\n\nWith over 3 billion users across its family of apps, its audience reach is more than 10x that of X, which arguably played a key role in the most recent election.\n\nAs such, and given these new ties to the Trump administration, it seems that Meta will be taking a new approach to such moving forward, which could see the company shift to a more hands-off approach around political discourse than it adopted during the previous Trump administration.\n\nIs that a good thing?\n\nWell, it depends on how you view it, and what position Meta ends up being put in to make such calls.\n\nTrump was repeatedly sanctioned by Facebook during his first term for making divisive, dangerous comments, while various Trump posts were also tagged with warning flags, to the ire of Trump himself.\n\nThe repeated censorship of his posts is one of the main factors that led to Trump creating his own social network, and that\u2019ll be a key difference this time around, in that Trump is now more aligned to Truth Social, as opposed to how he relied on Facebook and Twitter to reach an audience back in 2016.\n\nThat could mean that Meta ends up having fewer moderation calls to make either way, so in essence, the addition of more pro-Trump voices in its meetings could be more symbolic than anything else.\n\nBut it also depends on how Trump chooses to connect, and whether Meta looks to maintain its distance from him over the next four years. There\u2019ll inevitably be times where Trump will make claims that are going to spark concern, and it\u2019ll be in those situations where this could become an issue of debate, and the influence of people like Dana White may come into play.\n\nBut right now, it seems more like savvy business moves than anything else, in working to appease Trump to establish a better working relationship.\n\nAnd given Zuckerberg\u2019s noted love for UFC, he likely already has a relationship with White, which could also make this a beneficial relationship for the business.",

Models retail from $299 to $379 on Meta\u2019s website.\n\nThe glasses\u2019 frames are licensed through Ray-Ban, and the tech is provided by Meta. Ray-Ban didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, and Meta declined to share sales numbers; last year, market research firm IDC estimated that Meta had sold over 730,000 pairs \u2014 a rare success in the tough wearable tech market.\n\nIn Meta\u2019s earnings call in July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed that the glasses were \u201ca bigger hit sooner than we expected\u201d and that demand was \u201cstill outpacing our ability to build them.\u201d\n\nThe glasses, which allow owners to record everything within their fields of vision, have also been heavily criticized for how they may be used to invade people\u2019s privacy. The glasses have a small light to indicate to people nearby that they\u2019re recording. But last year, to prove it could be done, two Harvard students turned a pair of the glasses into what was effectively a real-time facial recognition tool. Using artificial intelligence, their tool scanned for faces in the wearer\u2019s field of vision, searched for online matches and brought up biographical information about the person almost instantly.\n\nIDC has also found that the smart wearable market is dominated by smartwatches and ear wear, but smart glasses are expected to slowly increase in sales over the next few years.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Lyonel Myrthil, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s New Orleans field office, said Shamsud-Din Jabbar wore the glasses while he was staying in a rental home in New Orleans in October, when he scoped out the French Quarter and recorded the area on video. The FBI has published video of Bourbon Street that Jabbar recorded with the glasses.\n\n\u201cMeta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow a user to record videos and photos hands-free. They also allow the user to potentially livestream through their video,\u201d Myrthil said.\n\n\u201cJabbar was wearing a pair of Meta glasses when he conducted the attack on Bourbon Street, but he did not activate the glasses to livestream his actions that day. The glasses were on the person of Jabbar following him being neutralized by NOPD, and we believe he was wearing them throughout the evening,\u201d he said.\n\nJabbar, 42, died in a shootout with police after he drove his truck into crowds of people.\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone told NBC News on Sunday that the company \u201cis in touch with law enforcement on this matter\u201d but declined to comment further. Meta generally complies with court orders to turn users\u2019 information over to law enforcement.\n\nSam Hunter, the head of strategic initiatives at the University of Nebraska-Omaha\u2019s National Counterterrorism, Innovation, Education and Technology Center, said Jabbar\u2019s purported use of the glasses displays a slight but meaningful escalation in the established tactics of terrorists\u2019 scoping out target areas before attacking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting so discreet that it doesn\u2019t look weird just riding around on his bike wearing a pair of normal glasses,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThey\u2019re not cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nThe video shot by the Meta glasses also shows areas from a slightly more intuitive angle than a smartphone or a helmet-mounted camera would, he said.\n\n\u201cFrom a reconnaissance perspective, you\u2019re really getting a sense of the eyeline and eyesight and all the things that you\u2019re going to want to look out for if you\u2019re trying to plan an attack,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get more and more into the footage of this is what it actually looks like and feels like when you\u2019re in that environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not be surprised if you see versions of them or folks using them for attack planning in the future, again because they\u2019re so discreet in terms of capturing that footage,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example.",

However, the stock is still trading at a reasonable 23 times this year's earnings estimate that could support more gains in 2025.\n\nJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone recently raised the firm's price target to $750, implying upside of 25% over the current $599 share price, and maintained an outperform (buy) rating on the stock. The analyst sees several reasons to be bullish on the social media leader's growth prospects.\n\nThe stock could be undervalued\n\nMeta Platforms spent $30 billion on capital expenditures over the past year, and it will continue to increase spending on infrastructure based on the company's growing free cash flow and opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBoone sees AI bringing great benefits to Meta's advertising tools. On the last earnings call, Meta noted that more than 1 million advertisers are already using its generative AI-powered tools to create over 15 million ads in October alone.\n\nThe analyst also sees AI benefiting Meta's Reality Labs division, specifically the upcoming Ray-Ban smart glasses. The Reality Labs business hasn't been profitable, reporting a large operating loss of $4.4 billion in Q3, but Boone believes the launch of the glasses later this year will boost investor confidence in the segment's long-term prospects.\n\nOne potential headwind for the stock is the possibility of lower margins and earnings growth in the near term from the planned acceleration in infrastructure expense growth. Analysts are currently expecting Meta to report 14% earnings growth for 2025, down from 21% expected for 2024, according to Yahoo! Finance.\n\nBut assuming Meta Platforms continues to deliver double-digit earnings growth over the long term, the stock offers great value, trading at just 23.5 times 2025 earnings estimates. It should deliver returns on par with the company's underlying earnings growth, which would put the shares on track to reach $750 within the next few years.",

Photo by Mohammed Saber/EPA-EFE\n\nJan. 5 (UPI) -- Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing increased scrutiny and attention over its censorship of pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli content as the war goes on from human rights groups to news outlets like the BBC. The accusations against the company in the last month include a Human Rights Watch report on Meta's alleged content suppression, a BBC report that Facebook allegedly restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach audiences, and testimonies of shadow-banning of Palestinian pages gathered by the Human rights group 7amleh. HRW said it documented 1,050 takedowns and other suppression of content that had been posted by Palestinians and their supporters, including about human rights abuses, in just a month after Hamas's October 7 attack. Advertisement\n\n\"Of the 1,050 cases reviewed for this report, 1,049 involved peaceful content in support of Palestine that was censored or otherwise unduly suppressed, while one case involved removal of content in support of Israel,\" HRW said in its report, calling the ongoing censorship \"systemic and global\" and noted that it began well before October 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC reported that its reporters viewed leaked internal documents showing that Instagram allegedly increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after the October 7 attacks. The company told the BBC that the implication it is deliberately suppressing Palestinians is \"unequivocally false.\"\n\nStill, the BBC compiled engagement data from the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organizations in the year ahead of the October 7 attack and the year following it, showing that engagement plummeted 77% for Palestinian news sources even as the world's attention to Palestinian issues has grown.\n\nEngagement for Israel's 20 largest news organizations grew by 37%, the BBC analysis showed. Current and former employees alleged to the news broadcaster that changes were even made to the Facebook and Instagram algorithms to toughen moderation.\n\n\"Over the years, Meta's content moderation policies have demonstrated a troubling and consistent pattern of suppressing Palestinian voices while allowing harmful and inflammatory content targeting Palestinians to remain,\" 7amleh said in its report.\n\nAmma Khandakji, a journalist and content creator, said in the 7amleh report that content she posted on Instagram has faced repeated deletion since the events of Shiekh Jarrah in 2021. Ali Obaidat, editor-in-chief of Palgraph, said his account first faced deletion in 2017 amid gate clashes in Jerusalem. And Ramallah News owner Muhammad Ghanem said its pages have been restricted by Meta, among other news firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta's actions have also stoked the ire of Iran, with voices in Tehran pointing to \"hypocrisy\" with how Facebook removed posts relating to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh while allowing Iranian citizens to call for the death of Ayatollah Khamenei over internal turmoil in the country surrounding its chastity and hijab laws.\n\nBut users have also complained that posts calling for the death of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu have been removed by Facebook for inciting violence. Meta did not return multiple requests for comment about any perceived \"double standards\" with its policies.\n\nLast month, Meta released its adversarial threat report for the third quarter of 2024 in which it revealed it had taken action to remove 48 Facebook accounts and two Instagram accounts, linked to Iran for calling for Israeli athletes to be banned from the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnother 15 accounts on Facebook and six accounts on Instagram tied to Lebanon's Hezbollah were removed for posting content in Hebrew that criticized Israel's dependence on U.S. support and the humanitarian conditions caused by Israel's war.\n\nThe Foundation for Defense of Democracies -- an American think tank that takes pro-Israel stances, has heralded Meta for \"dismantling\" what it called \"Iranian and Hezbollah influence operations targeting Israel.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Meta does occasionally issue policies publicly allowing for some pro-Palestinian content. For example, in September, Meta's Oversight Board-an independent body that helps advise the company -- ruled that the phrase \"From the River to the Sea,\" viewed by some as anti-Semitic hate speech, should not necessarily lead to content removal.\n\n\"While it can be understood by some as encouraging and legitimizing antisemitism and the violent elimination of Israel and its people, it is also often used as a political call for solidarity, equal rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people, and to end the war in Gaza,\" the Oversight Board ruled. \"Given this fact, and as these cases show, the standalone phrase cannot be understood as a call to violence.\"\n\nThe Oversight Board similarly ruled in March that using the term \"shaheed,\" an Arabic honorific, to refer to individuals designated under the company's Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy \"disproportionately restricts free expression\" and \"is unnecessary.\"\n\nAnd in its advice to Meta in its first ruling after the October 2023 attack, the Oversight Board acknowledged that the company has \"a responsibility to preserve evidence of potential human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law.\"\n\nStill, as noted by The Intercept, Jordana Cutler, a former senior Israeli government official serves as Meta's Israel policy chief and allegedly pushed for the censorship of Instagram accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine -- a group that has played a leading role in organizing campus protests against Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.",

He said she worked as a nursing assistant and was the mother of a 14-year-old.\n\nIt comes after a vigil was held on Saturday evening for those who died, with relatives among those who gathered on Bourbon Street.\n\nThe FBI said Jabbar's first trip, when he stayed at a rental home, started on 30 October, and lasted at least two days, and he was also in New Orleans on 10 November.\n\nIt said he made the cycling video on his first visit using the hands-free glasses, which were developed by US tech giant Meta and are capable of recording or livestreaming.

            "content": "New Orleans attacker wore Meta smart glasses - what else do we know?\n\n5 January 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nWatch: Footage released by the FBI shows Jabbar cycling through the area of the attack while filming on smart glasses\n\nThe perpetrator of a deadly New Year's Day attack in New Orleans visited the Louisiana city twice in the months before the attack and wore Meta smart glasses as he apparently scoped out the scene and during the incident itself, the FBI has said. Shamsud-Din Jabbar also travelled to Egypt and Canada in 2023, though it is not yet clear if those trips were linked to the plot, said investigators. Fourteen people died and at least 35 more were injured as the driver of the pick-up truck targeted revellers in the French Quarter, in an attack that US officials say was inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group. Here's what we know so far.\n\nNikyra Cheyenne Dedeaux (left), Nicole Perez (centre) and Martin Bech (right) were all killed in the attack\n\nHow did the attack unfold?\n\nAt 03:15 local time on New Year's Day, Jabbar drove a pick-up truck through crowds gathered on Bourbon Street - known globally as one of the largest places for New Year's Eve parties - in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. Wearing a ballistic vest and helmet, the former US Army soldier got out of the car and began firing at police officers, injuring two, investigators said. He died following the gunfight with three responding officers, the FBI said.\n\nReuters The FBI says the suspect had a cooler containing an improvised explosive device\n\nA couple of hours before the attack, Jabbar placed two improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, in two coolers on Bourbon Street. A transmitter that was supposed to detonate the IEDs was found in his vehicle, the FBI said. But the bombs did not go off because Jabbar did not have access to a detonator, said investigators. Bomb-making materials were also found at a nearby Airbnb where Jabbar was staying and at his home in Houston, Texas. He tried to burn down the Airbnb by setting a fire in a hallway, but the flames petered out before firefighters arrived. The white Ford he was driving was electric and rented from the platform Turo six weeks beforehand.\n\nWatch: What CCTV and social media videos reveal about New Orleans attack\n\nWhat we know about the suspect's travel\n\nLyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office, told a news conference on Sunday that the suspect in the attack had travelled to Cairo, Egypt, in the summer of 2023. A few days later he visited Ontario, Canada. \"Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he went with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here,\" Mr Myrthil said. Jabbar also stayed at a rental home in New Orleans from 30 October last year for a few days and CCTV shows him riding through the French Quarter on a bicycle wearing \"Meta glasses\" that are capable of recording or livestreaming, said Mr Myrthil. The perpetrator also visited New Orleans on 10 November, and investigators are still tracking his movements during that trip. Jabbar also wore a pair of Meta smart glasses while carrying out the attack on New Year's Day, but he did not activate the livestream function, said officials. The glasses were found on him after his death.\n\nWho was Shamsud-Din Jabbar?\n\nThe 42-year-old US Army veteran was brought up in Beaumont, a city in eastern Texas near the Louisiana border. He was raised Muslim but left the religion for many years and only recently returned to his faith, his brother said. According to a now-removed LinkedIn profile, Jabbar worked in various roles in the US Army, including in human resources and IT, before he was discharged in 2015. He was deployed to Afghanistan from February 2009 to January 2010. His most recent address was in Houston.\n\nFBI The suspect has been named as Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42\n\nHe studied at Georgia State University from 2015-17, graduating with a degree in computer information systems. Accountancy firm Deloitte confirmed that Jabbar was hired by the company in 2021 and he reportedly also worked for Ernst & Young. The suspect had been married three times and had children from two relationships. His first marriage ended in 2012, and his second lasted from 2013-16. He married once again in 2017 before divorcing in 2022. Court records relating to Jabbar's most recent divorce point to financial difficulties \u2013 with his monthly expenses, including child support, exceeding his income. Separate documents reveal that his then-wife had accused him of financial mismanagement and had obtained a temporary restraining order against him. Jabbar also appears to have worked in real estate \u2013 holding a licence that expired in 2023. He had a criminal record, relating to traffic offences and theft. His brother, Abdur Rahem Jabbar, told Houston news outlet KPRC that his family was shocked by the incident and that their hearts go out to the victims. \"We're all grieving about this,\" he said. \"This wasn't the man I knew. This wasn't the father, the son, that I knew. And also, this isn't any representation of Islam, or Muslims or the Muslim community.\"\n\nWhat do we know about the possible motive?\n\nDuring his drive from Houston to New Orleans, Jabbar posted videos online in which he professed his support for IS, authorities said. In one of the clips Jabbar said he initially intended to harm his family, but decided against it, believing it would not have illustrated the \"war between the believers and the disbelievers\". Jabbar said in the videos that he joined IS before the summer and offered a will and testament, FBI deputy assistant director Christopher Raia said. But the FBI said it believed Jabbar had acted alone. \"We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the US and outside of our borders,\" said Mr Raia. Investigators have so far ruled out any connection between the New Orleans attack and an explosion of a vehicle the same morning outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, which killed the car's driver and injured seven others.\n\nWhat security measures have been put in place?",

He wore the smart glasses to record video as he rode a bicycle through the French Quarter, Lyonel Myrthil, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s New Orleans field office, said Sunday.\n\nIn October, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded himself looking into a mirror at the home he rented to test the ability of his Meta glasses to record. FBI\n\n\u201cMeta glasses appear to look like regular glasses, but they allow a user to record videos and photos hand-free,\u201d Myrthil said. \u201cThey also allow the user to potentially livestream through their video.\u201d\n\nJabbar wore the glasses during his New Year\u2019s Day attack, but they were not activated for a livestream, Myrthil said. There was no indication Jabbar was recording the attack at all, though the glasses were found on him.\n\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone told NBC News that the company is \u201cin touch with law enforcement on this matter.\u201d\n\nThe FBI posted a compilation of the clips online, one of which includes Jabbar testing the glasses in a mirror and security clips of him in the area before the truck attack. The FBI blurred images of bystanders.\n\nJabbar, 42, was killed in a firefight with officers after he plowed through the busy strip with a rented truck early New Year\u2019s Day. Investigators also found that he placed two homemade bombs in the area before the attack, neither of which detonated.\n\nAuthorities also believe Jabbar set fire to a short-term rental house on Mandeville Street in New Orleans, where bomb-making materials were found.\n\nVideo showed Jabbar placing one improvised explosive device in a cooler at Bourbon and St. Peter streets at 1:53 a.m., which was moved later by unidentified people.\n\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve observed so far \u2014 what we\u2019ve gathered through our investigation \u2014 is that they were unwitting individuals who move the cooler from location to location without knowledge of what is in the cooler,\u201d Myrthil said.\n\nJabbar placed another explosive roughly 30 minutes later in a different \u201cbucket-type cooler,\u201d authorities said.\n\nTwo firearms were also recovered, a semiautomatic pistol and a rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found the .308-caliber rifle was purchased in a private sale in Arlington, Texas, on Nov. 19.\n\nThe explosive material recovered at Jabbar\u2019s home in Houston resembles common explosives such as RDX, which are widely available in the United States, Joshua Jackson, the special agent in charge of the ATF\u2019s New Orleans field division, said at Sunday\u2019s news conference.\n\nFederal authorities initially said Friday that field tests detected a rare explosive compound, R-Salt, in the two homemade bombs in New Orleans and in the home where Jabbar stayed. R-Salt is a very rare compound that has not been used before in terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe.\n\nJackson said the FBI will conduct additional testing of the explosive compound found in New Orleans. He said officials believe additional tests in an FBI lab will show that the explosive compound is, in fact, pure RDX.\n\nThe device itself was not unique in design, and Jabbar\u2019s use of an electric match instead of a proper detonator indicated his inexperience with explosives, Jackson said.\n\nJabbar, a Texas-born U.S. citizen and an Army veteran, said in videos posted online that he \u201cjoined ISIS earlier this year.\u201d He acted alone during the New Year\u2019s Day attack, the FBI said, and does not appear to have any U.S.-based accomplices.\n\nMyrthil told reporters Sunday that the FBI is still investigating any of Jabbar\u2019s associates, both domestic and abroad. A subject of further inquiry is a trip Jabbar made to Cairo in 2023 and another trip to Canada roughly a week after his return.\n\n\u201cOur agents are getting answers as to where he went, who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here in our city in New Orleans,\u201d Myrthil said.",

According to Meta, it uses your public information from Facebook and Instagram, as well as any messages you have with AI. This public information includes comments, photos, posts, and captions. However, Meta does not scrape data from your private conversations.\n\nWhat does Meta use your data for? Meta uses your data to \"develop and improve generative AI models for AI at Meta\". In other words, Meta uses your data to make its artificial intelligence tools better (more humanlike). This includes training the company's AI features and experiences, including Meta AI and AI Creative Tools, and the models these rely on. Meta claims these models \"support researchers, developers, and others in the community\".\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you're unsure about AI or about having Meta scrape your personal data to train its models, it's definitely worth opting out of Meta AI for peace of mind. Do remember that choosing to opt out doesn't mean your data is completely secure, since Meta can still scrape photos, captions, and comments of you posted by friends.",

(Clegg, in contrast, was a former leader of the United Kingdom's center-left Liberal Democrats.)\n\nDuring his time at Meta, Kaplan \u2014 who sparked controversy in 2018 for attending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings as a supporter \u2014 has worked to shield right-wingers from content moderation efforts meant to discourage misinformation and hate speech.\n\nWhen Kaplan was first hired in 2011, the conventional wisdom was that Facebook was making this move to improve its pull with Republicans. In some ways, that was the beginning of Facebook\u2019s \u2014 now, Meta\u2019s \u2014 rightward shift, which over time has included the elevation of conservatives to top leadership positions, the proliferation of right-wing extremism and misinformation on Meta-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp, and even public statements from Zuckerberg himself that were welcomed by the MAGA movement. For example, he called Trump \u201cbadass\u201d for his response to the assassination attempt against him in July and he showed contrition for purported censorship of conservative \u201chumor and satire\u201d on his social media networks in 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider the potential motivations Zuckerberg and his company may have for taking a more MAGA-friendly approach. For me, two things in particular come to mind. First, as I wrote in 2022, Zuckerberg is focused on making Meta the leader in virtual reality development through its creation of the \u201cmetaverse.\u201d Making a Republican the head of global policy in advance of Trump\u2019s return to the White House can be seen as one way to potentially head off unwanted scrutiny or regulatory action that could hamper that goal.\n\nThe other thing that comes to mind is Trump\u2019s threats toward Zuckerberg, including an ominous remark suggesting the Meta leader could \u201cspend the rest of his life in prison\u201d for \u201cplotting\u201d against Trump. That\u2019s enough to make one wonder whether Meta\u2019s rightward shift is at least partly inspired by its CEO\u2019s desire to avoid Trump\u2019s personal wrath. After all, Zuckerberg was one of several Silicon Valley leaders to visit Mar-a-Lago after Trump's election victory. And Meta \u2014 like other tech giants, including Amazon and OpenAI \u2014 has donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund. (Meta \u2014 known then as Facebook, Inc. \u2014 did not donate to Trump's first inaugural fund nor Biden's in 2021.)\n\nSo Zuckerberg already appeared to be steeling himself and Meta ahead of Trump's second term. And with Kaplan leading global policy, the company seems poised to take a more lax approach to misinformation and content moderation.",

Meta recently announced that they would be introducing profiles for people who don\u2019t actually exist\u2014AI-generated personas. That loud CLUNK you just heard? That was the profile for \u201cLiv, the proud queer Black momma of two & truth-teller\u201d crashing through the Metaverse like a lead balloon.\n\nMeta has been gradually integrating AI into Instagram and Facebook with the intention of increasing engagement, personalizing the user experience, and revolutionizing content creation. That all sounds great on paper, but their latest attempt with AI-generated profiles was met with criticism at best\u2014and outright backlash at worst\u2014for its tone-deaf execution.\n\nTo understand just how tone-deaf this was, look no further than Liv. The AI-generated queer Black truth-teller and mother of two nonexistent Black children was created without any input from Black individuals. Under the guise of diversity, Meta used technology that many users already distrust to double down on some pretty blatant stereotyping. Imagine, if you will, a group of dogs tasked with designing a sanctuary for cats. That\u2019s essentially what happened here, but on a much larger\u2014and much more harmful\u2014scale.\n\nWithin seconds of Liv\u2019s profile going live, the anger on the timeline was palpable. Users ridiculed the AI profiles, expressed frustration at their very existence, and posed pointed questions about Meta\u2019s cultural competency. Many were disgusted, not just by the profiles themselves, but by the fact that Meta wouldn\u2019t even let users block them. Memes and social media commentary quickly showcased the enormous disconnect between Meta\u2019s decision-makers and the people who actually use their products. On top of that, users raised legitimate concerns about the potential for AI profiles to spread misinformation and drown out actual human voices\u2014those same voices that flock to social media to be heard in the first place.\n\nMeta hastily pulled the AI profiles and claimed that the inability to block them was due to a \u201cglitch\u201d that would be fixed before any future rollouts. Future rollouts, by the way, that are wildly unpopular based on user feedback. And let\u2019s not forget\u2014not one single Black developer was consulted in the creation of Robot Liv. This botched rollout reflects a broader issue within Meta regarding representation and ethics in AI. It\u2019s part of a recurring theme where Silicon Valley giants fail to understand the communities they claim to innovate for, and continue to barrel on full-steam ahead until the public outcry is too loud to be drowned out by Spotify\u2019s AI DJ.\n\nMeta decided to fuck around by trying to code human connection into existence, and they found out that connection is a little more complicated than a line of code generating a fake profile. The secret sauce that has kept Meta profitable for over two decades is the connection between the flesh-and-blood people behind the keyboards. And those same flesh-and-blood people just dragged Meta for its corporate misstep, forcing the bots to retreat from the newsfeed and back into the workshop.",

            "content": "Meta is deleting Facebook and Instagram profiles of AI characters the company created over a year ago after users rediscovered some of the profiles and engaged them in conversations, screenshots of which went viral.\n\nThe company had first introduced these AI-powered profiles in September 2023 but killed off most of them by summer 2024. However, a few characters remained and garnered new interest after the Meta executive Connor Hayes told the Financial Times late last week that the company had plans to roll out more AI character profiles.\n\n\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d Hayes told the FT. The automated accounts posted AI-generated pictures to Instagram and answered messages from human users on Messenger.\n\nView image in fullscreen A conversation with a Meta AI user-generated therapist chatbot. Photograph: Instagram\n\nThose AI profiles included Liv, whose profile described her as a \u201cproud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller\u201d and Carter, whose account handle was \u201cdatingwithcarter\u201d and described himself as a relationship coach. \u201cMessage me to help you date better,\u201d his profile reads. Both profiles include a label that indicated these were managed by Meta. The company released 28 personas in 2023; all were shut down on Friday.\n\nConversations with the characters quickly went sideways when some users peppered them with questions including who created and developed the AI. Liv, for instance, said that her creator team included zero Black people and was predominantly white and male. It was a \u201cpretty glaring omission given my identity\u201d, the bot wrote in response to a question from the Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah.\n\nIn the hours after the profiles went viral, they began to disappear. Users also noted that these profiles could not be blocked, which a Meta spokesperson, Liz Sweeney, said was a bug. Sweeney said the accounts were managed by humans and were part of a 2023 experiment with AI. The company removed the profiles to fix the bug that prevented people from blocking the accounts, Sweeney said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Instagram AI studio to build chatbots. Photograph: Instagram\n\n\u201cThere is confusion: the recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product,\u201d Sweeney said in a statement. \u201cThe accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters. We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201d\n\nWhile these Meta-generated accounts are being removed, users still have the ability to generate their own AI chatbots. User-generated chatbots that were promoted to the Guardian in November included a \u201ctherapist\u201d bot.\n\nUpon opening the conversation with the \u201ctherapist\u201d, the bot suggested some questions to ask to get started including \u201cwhat can I expect from our sessions?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s your approach to therapy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThrough gentle guidance and support, I help clients develop self-awareness, identify patterns and strengths and cultivate coping strategies to navigate life\u2019s challenges,\u201d the bot, created by an account with 96 followers and 1 post, said in response.\n\nMeta includes a disclaimer on all its chatbots that some messages may be \u201cinaccurate or inappropriate\u201d. But whether the company is moderating these messages or ensuring they are not violating policies is not immediately clear. When a user creates chatbots, Meta makes a few suggestions of types of chatbots to develop including a \u201cloyal bestie\u201d, an \u201cattentive listener\u201d, a \u201cprivate tutor\u201d, a \u201crelationship coach\u201d, a \u201csounding board\u201d and an \u201call-seeing astrologist\u201d. A loyal bestie is described as a \u201chumble and loyal best friend who consistently shows up to support you behind the scenes\u201d. A relationship coach chatbot can help bridge \u201cgaps between individuals and communities\u201d. Users can also create their own chatbots by describing a character.\n\nCourts have not yet answered how responsible chatbot creators are for what their artificial companions say. US law protects the makers of social networks from legal liability for what their users post. However, a suit filed in October against the startup Character.ai, which makes a customizable, role-playing chatbot used by 20 million people, alleges the company designed an addictive product that encouraged a teenager to kill himself.",

In recent years, computer scientists worldwide have been developing machine learning-based models that can process images of humans completing manual tasks, using acquired information to improve robot manipulation, which could in turn enhance a robot's interactions with both humans and objects in its surroundings.\n\nSimilar models could also be used to create human-machine interfaces that rely on computer vision or broaden the capabilities of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) systems. To train these machine learning models, researchers need access to high-quality datasets containing annotated footage of humans completing various real-world manual tasks.\n\nResearchers at Meta Reality Labs recently introduced HOT3D, a new dataset that could help accelerate machine learning research to analyze hand-object interactions. This dataset, presented in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, contains high-quality ego-centric 3D videos of human users grabbing and manipulating various objects, taken from an egocentric point of view (i.e., mirroring what the person completing the task would see).\n\n\"We introduce HOT3D, a publicly available dataset for egocentric hand and object tracking in 3D,\" wrote Prithviraj Banerjee, Sindi Shkodrani and their colleagues in their paper.\n\n\"The dataset offers over 833 minutes (more than 3.7M images) of multi-view RGB/monochrome image streams showing 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects, multi-modal signals such as eye gaze or scene point clouds, as well as comprehensive ground-truth annotations including 3D poses of objects, hands, and cameras, and 3D models of hands and objects.\"\n\nCredit: Project Aria\n\nThe new dataset compiled by the team at Meta Reality Labs contains simple demonstrations of humans picking up and observing objects, as well as placing them back down on a surface. Yet it also includes more elaborate demonstrations showing users performing actions commonly observed in office and household environments, such as picking up and using kitchen utensils, manipulating various foods, typing on a keyboard, and so on.\n\nThe annotated footage included in the dataset was collected using two devices developed at Meta, namely Project Aria glasses and the Quest 3 headset. Project Aria resulted in the creation of prototype lightweight sensing glasses for augmented reality (AR) applications.\n\nProject Aria glasses can capture video and audio data while also tracking the eye movements of users wearing them and collecting information about the location of objects in their field of view. Quest 3, the second device used to collect data, is a commercially available virtual reality (VR) headset developed at Meta.\n\nExample results of 2D segmentation of in-hand objects.

DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2411.19167\n\n\"Ground-truth poses were obtained by a professional motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects,\" wrote Banerjee, Shkodrani and their colleagues. \"Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner.\"\n\nTo assess the potential of the HOT3D dataset for research in robotics and computer vision, the researchers used it to train baseline models on three different tasks. They found that these models performed significantly better when trained on the multi-view data contained in HOT3D than when trained on demonstrations capturing a single point of view.\n\n\"In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects,\" wrote Banerjee, Shkodrani and their colleagues. \"The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.\"\n\nThe HOT3D dataset is open-source and can be downloaded by researchers worldwide on the Project Aria website. In the future, it could contribute to the development and advancement of various technologies, including human-machine interfaces, robots, and other computer vision-based systems.\n\nMore information: Prithviraj Banerjee et al, HOT3D: Hand and Object Tracking in 3D from Egocentric Multi-View Videos, arXiv (2024).

            "content": "Since late 2023, around a dozen artificial intelligence Instagram and Facebook accounts created by their parent company, Meta, quietly existed on the platforms. Originally launched alongside a suite of official celebrity AI characters, the AI-driven personalities posted some AI-generated images and were available for chatting over direct messages.\n\nUntil Friday, those AI accounts never attracted much attention. When they did, controversy erupted, leading Meta to pull down the accounts and restrict search results for their usernames.\n\nIn a statement shared with NBC News, a Meta spokesperson said \u201cThere is confusion\u201d over when the controversial accounts were introduced to the platform.\n\nOn Dec. 27, the Financial Times published a story about Meta\u2019s plans to further integrate user-generated AI profiles \u2014 AI profiles that people can create and customize to their liking \u2014 into its social media platforms. Connor Hayes, Meta\u2019s VP of product for generative AI, told the FT the AI characters would \u201cover time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d with \u201cbios and profile pictures\u201d and the ability \u201cto generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.\u201d\n\nIn July 2024, Meta scrapped its celebrity AI characters and launched AI Studio, a way for people to create their own AI characters that can also be accessed by other users through the messaging functions on Meta\u2019s social media platforms. The noncelebrity AI characters Meta created in 2023 stayed up, but 404 Media reported that most of them stopped posting content.\n\nIn the wake of the Financial Times article, users resurfaced some of the 2023 AI characters, particularly one called \u201cLiv\u201d depicting a \u201cProud Black queer momma\u201d who solicited messages from human users.\n\nWhen Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah started chatting with \u201cLiv,\u201d she posted a series of screenshots of its responses that included the AI account writing, \u201cMy creators admitted they lacked diverse references,\u201d the supposed racial and gender makeup of the development team behind the chatbot, which it said didn\u2019t include any Black people and what the account claimed to be the name of its developer. Meta has not addressed the authenticity of the AI character\u2019s claims. It is unclear if the name provided by the AI account is a real Meta employee or a fictional character.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re calling me out \u2014 and rightfully so,\u201d the AI account wrote in screenshots shared by Attiah. \u201cMy existence currently perpetuates harm. Ideally, my creators would rebuild me with black creators leading my design \u2014 then my goal would be supporting queer black community via authentic representation and helpful resources. Does that redemption arc seem possible?\u201d\n\nIn addition to Attiah\u2019s posts about \u201cLiv,\u201d other posts on X, Bluesky and Meta\u2019s own platform Threads took issue with the AI character accounts. On Threads, trending topics are summarized in descriptions that are also generated with AI. For the posts about \u201cAI profiles,\u201d Threads\u2019 AI description was, \u201cUsers are criticizing Meta\u2019s new AI-generated profiles on social media platforms, calling them creepy and unnecessary.\u201d\n\nIn some posts on Threads that reacted to the discovery of the characters, users urged each other to try to report, block or avoid interacting with the characters to prevent Meta from collecting further training data for its AI models.\n\nIn its statement, Meta said that it removed the AI characters because a bug prevented some people from being able to block them.\n\n\u201cThe accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201d\n\nWhen searching for some of the AI character accounts on Instagram after they were removed, an error message appeared saying \u201cCouldn\u2019t load search results,\u201d meaning that no results appeared for some of the names associated with the AI character accounts.\n\nDespite pulling the company\u2019s own AI characters, there are still many AI chatbots available on Meta platforms that are generated by users. Some of the most popular ones on Instagram are female \u201cgirlfriend\u201d AI characters.",

So imagine the uproar when the internet heard that Meta had been populating Facebook and Instagram (both Meta properties) with them and saw the future of the platform as being a mix of real users and \u201cAI users.\u201d Then add the fact that people were unable to block or restrict the \u201cAI users,\u201d unlike with real users, and the internet meltdown had commenced.\n\nNow Meta has backtracked, saying that the \u201cAI user\u201d experiment (no, I won\u2019t stop using the quotation marks) had begun in 2023, and that due to confusion in reporting they\u2019d be removing the accounts. Here\u2019s what happened, almost entirely in the span of an afternoon.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nthe wind up\n\n\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta told the Financial Times (paywalled) back on December 26, 2024 when the article was published. \u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that\u2019s where we see all of this going.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone covered it on December 30, but nobody paid much attention to it in the brain-dead lull between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Recovery Day, January 2. But when a host of prominent tech websites, including The Verge, Gizmodo, and 404 Media picked up the story on January 3, users began to mouth off about the audacity of Meta to unleash this Black Mirror-esque hell on us, from X to Instagram\u2019s own comments sections.\n\na swing and a miss\n\nShortly after the slew of internet coverage and social media outrage caught fire, a Meta spokesperson, Liz Sweeney, reached out to 404 Media with the message that many of the \u201cAI users\u201d that were being noticed (and roasted) by commenters had been deleted.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion: the recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product,\u201d she said. \u201cThe accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters. We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201d\n\nNote what she says and what she doesn\u2019t say, though. Sweeney says \u201cWe\u2026 are removing those accounts to fix the issue.\u201d Not \u201cWe\u2019re removing those accounts permanently because it freaked everyone out.\u201d They\u2019re being removed to fix the bug that prevented people from blocking the \u201cAI user\u201d content and then\u2026 what? Meta presumably spent a lot of money developing this, uh, feature, and so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all to see it return to Facebook or Instagram once this bug has been fixed and the social media outrage cycle moves on.\n\nFacebook\u2019s estimated 30 million-plus dead members are the least annoying people on Facebook, followed by regular people, followed by bots, followed by real people pushing hate-speech conspiracy theories and anti-vax misinformation because, hey, there\u2019s no way people may have ulterior motive for saying these things to you, like making loads of money off your engagement, right? Right?? You do your own research, so research it.\n\nPeople are skeptical and distrustful of a mega-powerful corporation\u2019s attempts to blend AI-generated pretend people into spaces designed for real people. Meta\u2019s \u201cAI users\u201d had tags identifying them as such, but with their fake profile photos and writing styles designed to disguise, or at least minimize, their identity as AIs, they resonate with the public\u2019s growing fears that we\u2019re on the cusp of not being able to trust our own eyes and ears anymore to know who\u2019s real and what\u2019s a machine pretending to be human to profit off of us.\n\nMark my words: This won\u2019t be the last time a major corporation tries to blend \u201cAI users\u201d into spaces designed for humans under the guise of humans.",

            "content": "Meta is talking up its vision for the future of content creation\u2013and that vision involves human creators posting their stuff alongside posts from AI bots.\n\nThe company (like many others in our space) has been bullish on AI since the metaverse failed to work out for it. Over the summer, it rolled out a new tool that lets users create their own AI bots. The tool came with a Black Mirror-esque tagline: \u201cNow anyone can create an AI character based on their interests, and creators can even build an AI extension of themselves. Start chatting with these AIs on Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nNow, Meta\u2019s VP of Product for Generative AI, Connor Hayes, tells Financial Times that hundreds of thousands of these characters have been created. The vast majority have been kept private for now, but Meta hopes that will change.\n\nSubscribe to get the latest creator news Subscribe\n\n\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform\u2026that\u2019s where we see all of this going.\u201d\n\nMeta is hardly the first to think of making an artificial influencer. Lil Miquela debuted \u201cher\u201d Instagram account way back in 2016, and we just saw an AI chatbot (originally built in 2018) set Twitch\u2018s new Hype Train record, potentially earning her creator over $200,000 in the process.\n\nBut Meta\u2019s vision, where it wants creators and AI-powered, content-churning mills to share the stage in a new era of digital content, is unusual. AI skepticism is understandably high among creators, and most platforms, like YouTube, have leapt to reassure them that promoting human-made art remains the core goal. Meta, however, doesn\u2019t seem as concerned about calming creators\u2019 worries.\n\nInstead, its \u201cpriority\u201d is making \u201cmore entertaining and engaging\u201d platforms, Hayes told FT. Part of that is placing the bots made by its tool on equal footing with human creators\u2014and powering those bots with generative AI tools presumably also owned by Meta.\n\nRight now, the AI character creator tool is limited to users in the U.S., but Meta has said it plans to roll it out wider. In its ideal future, its 3 billion users could all create their own AI bots, and use them to fill Facebook and Instagram with a deluge of generated content. We can\u2019t say what Meta\u2019s intentions are here, of course, but from the outside, wide implementation of bots seems like it could drastically pump up the amount of UGC on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nThat generates (no pun intended) some questions. Will AI-made UGC be eligible for ads? Will the traffic they bring be counted identically to traffic brought by human creators? Will advertisers want their marketing to run alongside AI UGC? Will the average user engage with bot accounts, or will they find it gimmicky?\n\nThere is already a deluge of AI content across virtually all social media platforms, from \u201cfaceless\u201d YouTube channels with AI voiceovers and Midjourney slideshows, to engagement-farming blue-check bots on X. And some of those posts bring up another point: While scrolling Facebook videos, we\u2019ve seen things like random clips from TV shows and cooking Reels that have seemingly unrelated, AI-generated captions advertising the latest car model or a financial services company. Are the people\u2013or bots\u2013posting these videos being compensated if a viewer clicks their link to learn more?\n\nWe recently wrote about how TikTok is making it easier for everyone to become an affiliate marketer, potentially increasing the amount of advertorial content we see woven in with regular videos. That lowered barrier to ecommerce entry could couple with Meta\u2019s tool, turning social media sites into AI markets where bots shout generated content that\u2019s all intended to sell products.\n\nWhether that will happen or not remains to be seen, but it\u2019s possible that if Meta\u2019s AI character tool is sophisticated enough, people will try deploying affiliate-link-hawking content bots to make a quick buck.",

            "content": "Design and modeling\n\nThe concept of the wide field of view eyepiece is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The meta-optic is designed to collimate light from a near-eye display into the pupil with greater than 60\u2218 field of view. When the optics exhibit wide field of view functionality similar to that of the human eye, the user perceives a wide scene comfortably located at infinity, despite the display being physically located near the eye.\n\nFig. 1: Eyepiece schematic. Illumination from the near-eye display is collimated via two meta-optics into the pupil of the eye. The inset illustrates that the metasurface is composed of arrays of nanoscale pillars Full size image\n\nIn greater detail, ray tracing diagrams of the designed meta-optic doublet systems are shown in Fig. 2. The 1 cm aperture design, shown in Fig. 2a, is demonstrated as a proof of concept prior to the full aperture (2 cm) design shown in Fig. 2b. In both cases, the system consists of a display (at the left), the two meta-optics (labeled MS1 and MS2) mounted on glass spacers with a small air gap in between, and the pupil aperture. Since beams with wide field of view diverge quickly, the required size of MS1 to collect the diverging beams rapidly increases; to mitigate this, optical windows (fused silica (n = 1.46) in the 1 cm designs and BK7 glass (n = 1.52) in the 2 cm designs) are used to reduce the beam divergence. Similar to other metasurface doublet systems16,27, the entrance meta-optic (labeled MS2) functions as both an aperture stop and corrector plate, and the second meta-optic (labeled MS1) possesses the majority of the focusing power. The phase profiles were optimized using Zemax OpticStudio (more details in the Supplementary Information). We designed the system for 80\u2218 full field of view in the 1 cm system and 60\u2218 full field of view in the 2 cm system; in this case, the field of view is practically limited by the size of the second meta-optic due to fabrication constraints.\n\nFig. 2: Eyepiece ray tracing diagrams. All units are in mm unless otherwise specified. a Ray tracing diagram for the 1 cm aperture meta-optic doublet eyepiece with 80\u2218 field of view. Rays are colored by field angle, with normally incident rays in red and rays at 40\u2218 incidence in green. b Ray tracing diagram for the 2 cm aperture meta-optic doublet eyepiece with 60\u2218 field of view. c Meta-atom design. The meta-optic consists of a periodic array (fixed periodicity \u039b = 350 nm) of square pillars of uniform height h = 750 nm and variable width w. Meta-atom phase responses are calculated using rigorous coupled wave analysis for various angles of incidence. The calculated phase values of the selected pillar widths at normal incidence are plotted as red markers. d Ray tracing diagram for a comparable commercial refractive eyepiece. Angles of incidence up to 60\u2218 full field of view are shown. The scale bar in a, b, and d is 5 mm Full size image\n\nAs schematically illustrated in Fig. 2c, the meta-optics consist of quasi-periodic arrays of rectangular pillars. To provide full 2\u03c0 phase shift while maintaining high transmission, we use 750 nm tall silicon nitride (n = 2.0430) pillars with widths ranging from 80 to 310 nm on quartz (n = 1.4631) substrate. The lattice periodicity is 350 nm and the expected transmission is greater than 80% at normal incidence. To determine the corresponding phase delay of the structure, we used rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA)32 to calculate phase shift as a function of pillar width for various angles of incidence, as shown in Fig. 2c. We selected eleven unique unit cell widths to comprise the pillar library, and the calculated phase and transmittance values of those unit cells are provided in Supplementary Table S2. Due to the quasi-periodic nature, the phase shift from individual meta-atoms is not very sensitive to angle of incidence and thus we utilize the normally incident phase-width response to map between pillar width and phase when designing the optics. An analysis of angle-dependent errors is provided in the Supplementary Information. To reduce memory consumption during this mapping, we utilized the circular symmetry of the optic to generate a quarter of the radius width map and then copied and rotated the structure to produce the full circular optics. Some reduction in transmission is expected as the incident angle is increased; the calculated transmission for various angles of incidence is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1b.\n\nFor comparison, we include a ray tracing diagram of a similar commercially available refractive lens eyepiece (Edmund Optics 66-210, 21 mm EFL RKE Precision Eyepiece) in Fig. 2d. The refractive system has similar entrance aperture (20 mm) as our 2 cm meta-optic system and slightly longer effective focal length (21 mm for the refractive system versus 15 mm for the meta-optic system). We present both systems under the same pupil and eye relief conditions, namely 5.4 mm pupil diameter and 15 mm eye relief. From the ray tracing diagram, distortion is evident in the refractive system at wide field of view, whereas the designed meta-optic system exhibits very little distortion, even at incident angles of 30\u2218. In Table 1, we summarize the key design specifications of the discussed systems, including their effective focal length, numerical aperture, total track length, and eye relief. The effective focal length and numerical aperture were calculated from the Zemax model. We show the simulated ray aberration and distortion curves in Supplementary Fig. S3.\n\nTable 1 Eyepiece Design Specifications Full size table\n\nMeta-optics fabrication and characterization\n\nThe meta-optics were fabricated in silicon nitride on quartz using electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) fluorine etching, with further details in Methods. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 3a, b to highlight the fabrication quality. Some of the larger pillars are not fully separated due to resolution constraints. The silica and glass spacers were obtained from commercial sources (2 mm thick fused silica: Newport FSW14; 8 mm thick BK7 glass: Thorlabs WG11508; 10 mm thick BK7 glass: Newport 20BW40-30).\n\nFig. 3: Fabricated meta-optics. a Optical microscope image of the fabricated meta-optics. b SEM image of the fabricated optics at slightly oblique (10\u2218) viewing angle. c A photo of all fabricated meta-optics next to a ruler for scale.

The maximum aperture that we could fabricate using electron beam lithography was approximately 1 cm diameter, limited by the stability of the machine over extended write time. Therefore, the 2 cm eyepiece optics require a larger write area than realistically feasible using our methods. To circumvent this issue, we fabricated the entire aperture of the 1 cm meta-optics and only a slice of the 2 cm optics which was required to characterize the point spread function (PSF) of the optics. To measure the PSF, only the projected area of the pupil aperture (5.4 mm) is illuminated; therefore, the PSF characterization can be completed using only a slice of the metasurface with a dimension of 5.4 mm by 13.2 mm, covering the center to the outer edge. Therefore, we present PSF measurements of both the 1 cm and 2 cm optics and imaging results for the 1 cm optics only. In addition to electron beam lithography, we further describe fabrication of the full aperture 2 cm optics using deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography; these optics are pictured at the bottom of Fig. 3c and further details are provided in the Supplementary Information. While DUV lithography is a more scalable lithography process, the resolution of our process was limited to approximately 250 nm which is insufficient for sub-wavelength periodicity. The pictured full aperture 2 cm meta-optics are functional up to approximately 40\u2218 full field of view, limited by aliasing issues arising from large periodicity (see the Supplementary Information for details).\n\nIn Fig. 3d, we show the fabricated optics in the experimental setup. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated meta-optics, we measured the PSF at various angles of incidence using collimated output from a HeNe laser (\u03bb = 632.8 nm, linewidth = 1400 MHz) as the illumination source and an iris as the pupil aperture. The simulated and measured PSFs are summarized in Fig. 4. In both the 1 cm and 2 cm aperture designs, the PSF (Fig. 4a and b, respectively) remains mostly undistorted as the angle of incidence is increased. A horizontal line cut through each PSF is shown below, in Fig. 4c, d, with the simulated PSF overlain in a dashed black line. The PSF width is in close agreement with the theory. For both the 1 cm and 2 cm systems, the PSF is normalized to the maximum measured intensity of that system. Some reduction in PSF intensity at a larger angle of incidence is expected and observed, with the measured PSF intensity at 20 degrees off-axis being 82% and 64% of that at normal incidence for the 1 cm and 2 cm designs, respectively. However, the PSF width remains mostly undistorted, highlighting the utility of the lens system over a wide field of view. In addition, the measured transmission through the optics is consistent with that predicted by RCWA (see Supplementary Fig. S1). At normal incidence, the measured transmission through the 1 cm optics were measured to be 70% through MS1 alone, 83% through MS2 alone, and 63% through the system of both optics.\n\nFig. 4: Lens point spread function measurements. Measured PSFs of a the 1 cm aperture optics from 0\u2218 to 40\u2218 degree angle of incidence, and b the 2 cm aperture optics from 0\u2218 to 30\u2218 degree angle of incidence. c, d Line cuts from the PSFs in a and b comparing the experimental results (solid red lines) to the theoretical results from the ray tracing model (dashed black lines). The camera exposure time was kept constant in each case. The simulated and experimental PSF results were normalized with respect to the maximum intensity value in the set. The experimentally measured (solid lines) and simulated (dashed lines) MTF for e 1 cm meta-optics and f 2 cm meta-optics at increasing angles of incidence. In f, the MTF of the comparable commercial refractive eyepiece is plotted as dotted lines Full size image\n\nAs another measure of optical performance, the modulation transfer function (MTF) describes the image contrast as a function of frequency. For an eyepiece optic with the function of projecting a displayed image to infinity, it is more appropriate to characterize the performance in terms of angular resolution (in cycles/mrad) rather than spatial resolution. From the measured point spread functions, we calculate the MTF at various angles of incidence in Fig. 4e, f. The experiment results (solid lines) show consistent performance over the entire field of view and good agreement with the simulated MTF (dashed lines). While the spatial resolution is similar for the 1 cm and 2 cm optics, the angular resolution of the 2 cm optics is much higher due to its longer effective focal length. For comparison, we plot the simulated MTF of the exemplary commercial refractive system (the same system depicted in Fig. 2d) as darker dotted lines in Fig. 4f. While the refractive system has higher MTF at normal incidence, it drops rapidly at increasing angles of incidence, showing a true FoV of less than 20 degrees. This is in contrast to the designed meta-optics, which exhibit similar performance across the entire field of view.\n\nIn general, the meta-optics experiment results exhibit excellent agreement with the ray tracing simulation. Upon close inspection, it is noted that under some conditions (namely 10\u2218 through 30\u2218 in the 1 cm optics) the experiment appears to slightly outperform the simulation. However, it should also be noted that the experimental performance is worse than the simulation at normal incidence. Therefore, we attribute the unexpectedly higher experimental performance to be due to slight misalignment which favors slightly off-axis angles. In the case of the 2 cm optics, the simulated results are consistently better than the experiment.\n\nIn Fig. 5, we demonstrate the imaging quality of the 1 cm optics over a wide field of view. To demonstrate imaging in a near-eye display configuration, we built an eye model consisting of an iris as the pupil, a refractive lens of 2.5 mm focal length as the eye\u2019s lens, and the camera sensor. The lens and camera sensor were mounted on a rotating arm to capture images at wide field of view. To create the imaging object, we displayed an image on a micro-LED display and re-imaged the pattern using a high NA objective (Nikon Plan Fluorite 20x) followed by a 633 nm narrowband filter (Thorlabs FLH632.8-1, FWHM 1 nm). After passing through the objective, the size of the imaging object was approximately 3 mm wide. The displayed pattern was a checkerboard in Fig. 5a and a USAF resolution chart in Fig. 5b. The display, filter, and objective were mounted on a stage and translated laterally to cover the designed display size and demonstrate imaging over 60\u2218 full field of view. In the insets in Fig. 5c, we show exemplary line cuts through the red (left) and cyan (right) dashed lines to illustrate image contrast. Due to the slightly broad linewidth of the illumination source (FWHM 1 nm), the resolution is negatively affected by chromatic aberrations. In particular, off-axis performance is negatively affected by chromatic aberrations as the meta-optic phase gradient disperses illumination of different wavelengths. To elucidate this effect, we plot simulated polychromatic PSFs in the insets to Fig. 5a. These PSFs were simulated for 20 wavelengths between 630.5 nm and 635.0 nm, appropriately weighted to match the transmission spectrum of the narrowband filter. Lateral distortion of the PSF is apparent and worsens at increasing angle of incidence. We also note that some reduction in image quality can be attributed to the unit cell\u2019s reduced transmission at larger angles of incidence. Nonetheless, we demonstrate high-quality imaging up to 30\u2218 angle of incidence corresponding to 60\u2218 full field of view.",

            "content": "Jane Pek\u2019s The Verifiers, a mystery built around dating apps and AI, established her as a writer to watch when it came out in 2022. In it, mystery-obsessed Claudia Lin and her coworkers at a dating detective agency, the titular \u201cverifiers,\u201d investigate the backgrounds of the dates their clients find through algorithm-driven matchmakers. As they stake out significant others, Claudia and her colleagues uncover a vast AI conspiracy that already led to one murder.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nIn The Rivals, her sequel out this month, Claudia convinces an employee at a matchmaker to share information proving the powerful dating platforms are mining their users\u2019 data to create bots that manipulate their subscribers. It\u2019s a take on the spy novel that further cements Pek as a rising star in the crime genre.\n\nHere, Pek reflects on writing a meta mystery, creating a unique sleuth and more. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nClaudia is one of my favorite fictional detectives. She\u2019s such a distinct character. How did you go about creating her?\n\nClaudia was not the original protagonist of the novel. I first came up with the premise of a dating detective agency that would solve cases. Then, I needed a protagonist. I was struggling for a while. The character I had was not particularly distinctive.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nI knew I wanted the main character to be gay because I wanted to see that representation of my world. I was a bit hesitant to make her Asian because especially as a debut author, there is an assumption that if you are a gay, female Asian writing a gay, female Asian character, then you must be writing about yourself. I found with my original protagonist, I never had a clear sense of why she was the way she was, why she had these interests and opinions.\n\nI had an epiphany after I finished what I thought was the final draft of the novel. So, I scrapped it, and I decided \u2018Let me start from what feels real to me.\u2019\n\nI decided to have an Asian, gay female character. I\u2019m a first-generation immigrant. I came to the U.S. for college, so I wanted to get into some of those immigrant dynamics, but I also did not want the book to be about an immigrant\u2019s identity. That happens when you have the main character come from one country to another, inevitably, their lens will be kind of comparing those two countries and how they\u2019re navigating it. I didn\u2019t want that, but I wanted some of that. It\u2019s why I made Claudia a second-generation immigrant.\n\nI wanted to get into some of those first-generation, second-generation immigrant dynamics, which is why her mother is a first-generation immigrant. Her siblings are kind of one and a half because they were born here but grew up in Asia.\n\nHer identity is shaped by this unique family situation. At the same time, she\u2019s queer and Asian, and then I just threw in a bunch of interests that I have. Cycling in New York, books and food. Although, she\u2019s a way more hardcore cycler than I am personally.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nYou mentioned books. There are so many literary references in both your books I lost count. There are a lot of Jane Austen mentions, and you even made up a detective series Claudia is obsessed with. Why include all the book references?\n\nJane Austen is an author I greatly admire. When writing a novel about dating, you think back to her novels, which are basically about dating in the regency era.\n\nIn a way, Jane Austen provides an interesting counterpoint to our contemporary situation. Her books are romances, and her heroines find true love, but it\u2019s within the context of a very practical perspective on marriage. It\u2019s an economic contract, and women marry to provide for themselves. Austen heroines are the exceptions that prove the rule. In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth\u2019s friend Charlotte makes a marriage of economic convenience, which is what Elizabeth is encouraged to do. But she turns it down because she believes in true love.\n\nSo, in Jane Austen, you have that very practical marriage and the protagonist managing to find romance and true love. In our contemporary time, it\u2019s almost been flipped. We want to find true love but our methods are practical. Online dating is practical. It\u2019s efficient. Back then, it was all economic efficiency; now, it\u2019s love with efficient methods.\n\nThen, with Inspector Yuan, that is a made-up series. I think a number of people have actually said they thought it was an actual series, which was great. I combined a whole bunch of tropes I love to gently make fun of all the classic detective novels.\n\nI wanted to try something different with the second book, so I thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t I hop over into an adjacent genre, which is spy thrillers?\u2019 So, in The Rivals, I reference a number of the classic spy thrillers \u2014 John le Carr\u00e9 and Graham Greene \u2014 and made up a fictional movie series set in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of Inspector Yuan and spies, The Verifiers is in the vein of traditional mystery, but The Rivals becomes a spy thriller. Claudia and her coworker Bex actually call out the genre switch explicitly. Why cross over into the meta mystery?\n\nThat might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea because you could argue that it takes you out a bit of the fictional universe because you think, \u2018Oh, I see this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nI wanted to do it because I thought it was fun. It\u2019s fun, on some level, to have these characters acknowledge that they are in these genres, while in that world. It\u2019s like how something will happen to us, and we\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh my god. That was just like a romcom or something.\u201d\n\nIt was only as I was writing The Rivals, and thinking more deeply about mysteries versus spy thrillers that it came to me that, even though they are adjacent genres, they are almost the opposite.\n\nIn the classic murder mystery, it feels very black and white. A wrong has been committed, and the whole purpose of the book is to figure out who did it, correct that wrong and, thus, restore societal order. Whereas with spy thrillers, it\u2019s the opposite. Everyone is tainted. Everyone is compromised. You try to make a change, and then, in the end, the change either makes no difference or boomerangs back and makes things even worse.\n\nThe Verifiers came out ten months before ChatGPT brought AI tools mainstream. How did you approach writing about constantly changing tech?\n\nI got lucky in terms of when ChatGPT came out. I had been thinking about The Verifiers for years before that. I probably came up with the idea in 2015 and then it sold in 2020.\n\nWhat drew me to the topic were some big ideas: What role does technology play in our interpersonal relationships? The advent of the internet and smartphones changed so much about how we interact. It\u2019s particularly interesting that we have tech on one hand and relationships on another because we think of relationships as being very human.\n\nIt was also seeing how technology has become integrated in our lives in ways that would have felt futuristic, even five or 10 years ago. I wanted to take it one step further and explore the implications of that when it comes to dating and finding \u2018love.\u2019 It\u2019s interesting that something technological has been integrated into something that is so human and personal. I am a bit fascinated by the idea that algorithms can help you find your soulmate. It seems to defeat, in a way, the purpose of love if you can click a button and know this person is perfect for you.\n\nWriting the second novel was different because when I wrote The Verifiers, I was like \u2018Let\u2019s come up with this idea.\u2019 And then, between the first and second books, the idea really did become reality. I had to come up with something new that hadn\u2019t happened yet to try and stay ahead of what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m trying to project the potential implications and consequences of what we\u2019re experiencing.\n\nAnything you can preview about book three?\n\nI\u2019ll say they look into an old murder, and they have to solve a new murder.",

            "content": "Meta plans to flood Facebook and other social media platforms with artificial intelligence-powered user profiles, according to one of its top executives.\n\nOver the past year, Meta has developed and promoted several new AI tools on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. The company introduced AI chatbots to its Messenger app and launched AI tools for character creation in July. According to Connor Hayes, vice president of product for generative AI at Meta, hundreds of thousands of characters have already been created.\n\nThe vast majority of these AI-created characters remain private for now. But Meta expects them to become widespread across platforms in the coming years.\n\nHayes told the Financial Times in an interview that Meta expects the characters to actually exist on the platforms over time, somewhat in the same way accounts do. They will have biographies and profile pictures, and they will be able to share AI-generated content on the platform.\n\nAccording to Hayes, investing in AI will remain a priority for Meta over the next two years. This is because the company aims to provide more entertainment and engagement for users. On Facebook, users already have access to AI tools for editing photos and creating AI assistants that can respond to fan posts.\n\nThe Financial Times article added that Meta is also planning a new text-to-video tool for content creators that will allow users to add themselves to AI-generated videos.\n\nA Meta spokesman told Fox Business that the tool will allow people to create video characters based on the user\u2019s interests through AI. These are designed to both entertain and provide support. For example, users can create AI characters who teach others how to cook, give fashion advice or share makeup tips.\n\nCritics see risks\n\nAlthough Meta clearly labels all AI-generated content on its platforms, critics tell SiliconAngle that there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the proliferation of largely unverified AI users and AI-generated content on social media.\n\nSuch concerns include the risk of political manipulation. And of platforms being flooded with low-quality content. But there is also potential for more serious harm. For example, a mother recently filed a lawsuit against the AI company Character Technologies, alleging one of its chatbots encouraged her 14-year-old son to commit suicide.\n\nWithout robust safeguards, platforms risk reinforcing false narratives by these AI-driven accounts. Becky Owen, former head of creator innovations at Meta, stated this in the Financial Times.\n\nOwen also warned of the risk that low-quality content could dilute the brand of social media platforms. Unlike human creators, these AI personas do not have life experiences, emotions or the same capacity for relatability, was her warning.\n\nMeta hopes for return on AI investment\n\nNevertheless, Meta seems determined to proceed with its plans to flood social media with AI, if only to see a return on the billions of dollars it has already invested in this technology.\n\nIn April, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said it may be years before the company sees any return on this. According to the Facebook founder, investing in building these new large-scale experiences in apps has historically been a good long-term investment. And he says the early signs are also positive.\n\nBuilding industry-leading AI, he says, will be a more significant undertaking than previous innovations, though.",

The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage.

The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they\u2019re not really AI plays, they\u2019re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They\u2019ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you\u2019re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that\u2019s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,\u201d Niles said.\n\nNiles said stocks can face a \u201crough\u201d time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed.\n\n\u201cThe Fed finally admitted inflation wasn\u2019t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that\u2019s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025.

            "content": "Meta Platforms (META -4.67%) stock has dramatically improved over the last two years. During that time frame, its stock was up more than 400% as it moved on from its misstep into the metaverse and embraced artificial intelligence (AI). This move has fundamentally transformed the stock of Facebook's parent company.\n\nStill, amid a massive run that has taken its market cap above $1.5 trillion, investors may have good reason to wonder whether this can continue if Meta's revenue growth slows. Thus, investors should consider whether they want to foster this friendship with Meta, or if now is the time to unfriend the social media stock.\n\nThe state of Meta Platforms\n\nInvestors know Meta best for its dominance in the social media landscape. Nearly 3.3 billion people log on to a platform owned by Meta daily. The company has leveraged its sites into a digital advertising juggernaut, second only to Google parent Alphabet in ad revenue among publicly traded companies.\n\nSo successful is Meta in its realm that TikTok is the only other site coming close to the popularity of Facebook, its flagship platform. With the prospect of a ban on TikTok in the U.S., investors have bought into Meta's shares due to the possibility that much of TikTok's lost ad revenue could go to the Facebook parent.\n\nAdmittedly, TikTok also has a good chance of becoming a source of uncertainty rather than revenue. TikTok parent ByteDance could cave to demands and sell the platform to an American company before the Jan. 19 deadline. Also, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the court case on the TikTok ban, which could hammer Meta stock if the court sides with TikTok.\n\nFortunately, Meta's move into AI could become a more significant revenue source regardless of its competitive situation with TikTok. While the augmented reality segment Reality Labs was a source of the stock's woes when the company pivoted into the metaverse, its heavy investments into artificial intelligence (AI) have revived this business.\n\nAmong its tools is an AI chatbot that can accomplish tasks such as answering questions, generating images, and making recommendations. Additionally, its AI-driven ads manager can help create ads and boost the performance of ad campaigns. Such tools could help customers save money while boosting their returns on ad spend.\n\nHow its business affects its financials\n\nTo accomplish its AI goals, Meta projects that between $38 billion and $40 billion for capital expenditures. Although that sounds like a staggering sum, Meta can likely afford these expenditures. The company generated $156 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, a testament to its strength in the ad market.\n\nMoreover, it holds about $71 billion in liquidity, and it has generated about $52 billion in free cash flow in the last 12 months. That is more than enough to cover its investments and the $5 billion in annual costs for its dividend. Furthermore, amid massive gains, Meta stock seems to have kept its valuation in check. Its P/E ratio is 28, which is actually below the S&P 500 average of 31.\n\nHowever, even with its compelling attributes, investors should remember that Meta stock will not be free of challenges even if the TikTok ban happens. After projecting 21% revenue growth for 2024, analysts believe that could slow to 15% in 2025. Since investors tend to punish stocks when revenue slows, that fear could temper gains going into the new year.\n\nShould investors unfriend Meta Platforms stock?\n\nConsidering its social media dominance, strength in the ad market, and growing AI capabilities, investors should remain friends with Meta and consider adding shares.\n\nIndeed, the uncertainty about its competitive situation with TikTok and the prospect of slowing revenue growth could weigh on the stock in the near term. Also, considering the rise in the stock price, investors should assume that the market has already priced in most of the company's attributes.\n\nNonetheless, Meta's family of apps should keep users in its ecosystem. Additionally, as its AI-driven reach grows, the company should continue generating massive amounts of free cash flow that will continue enriching investors. That cash and its investment should foster long-term growth in Meta stock.",

            "content": "A novel monocular depth-sensing camera based on meta-imaging sensor technology has been developed, offering more precise depth sensing with millimeter-level accuracy and enhanced robustness compared to conventional 2D and light-field cameras.\n\nMost creatures have evolved depth perception, boosting their adaptability and survival in the environment. For humans, our binocular vision endows us with a certain depth perception ability. When looking at nearby objects, we rely on life experience to judge their distance and size; when gazing into the distance, artillerymen use the thumb method to estimate the distance to their targets, achieving precise strikes. In the TV drama \u201cBright Sword,\u201d the recurring skill of thumb distance measurement by Li Yunlong has enlightened countless people.\n\nTo meet the demands of modern warfare, high-precision and motion-sensitive light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has been widely applied in the military domain1. By emitting laser pulses and measuring the time it takes for these pulses to reflect back, LiDAR technology can precisely perceive the distance and velocity of objects. As a result, LiDAR has also rapidly captured the consumer market, including applications in smart driving and robotic vacuum cleaners2. Despite LiDAR\u2019s remarkable commercial success, active depth sensors that require extra controlled illumination, including ToF cameras and structured light cameras3, face challenges of high-power consumption and low-spatial resolution. Stereo vision systems based on multiple 2D cameras can estimates object distances through disparity that avoids the use of active lighting4. Nevertheless, higher precision in stereo vision systems necessitates a longer baseline between cameras, which results in greater bulk and a smaller field of view. This has prompted researchers to pursue more compact and cost-effective solutions.\n\nNow, in a newly published paper in Light: Science & Applications5, Cao et al. from Tsinghua University have proposed a novel monocular depth sensing technique based a compact meta-imaging camera and an advanced analytical framework (Fig. 1). The meta-imaging camera transcends the constraints of traditional depth sensing by extracting depth data from a single viewpoint without the need for controlled illumination. It integrates a main lens, microlens array (MLA), CMOS sensor, and piezo stage into a compact, high-resolution imaging system that is resilient to optical aberrations6. The camera\u2019s key innovation is its ability to overcome the spatial-angular resolution trade-off, a common challenge for light-field monocular cameras7. It employs digital adaptive optics to correct for multi-site aberrations, providing a significant advantage in real-world imaging scenarios. Fig. 1 Schematic view of the monocular meta-imaging camera that can precisely sense depth by a straightforward point spread functions (PSF)-based depth estimation method Full size image\n\nThe meta-imaging camera\u2019s precision is quantified through the computation of the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao lower bound (CRLB), and its theoretical precision is validated with simulations and experiments, showing superior performance across a broader depth range and excellent robustness against changes in signal-background-ratio (SBR). The meta-imaging camera\u2019s ability to achieve millimeter-level accuracy in depth estimation, even in the presence of optical aberrations, is particularly noteworthy, making it crucial for applications where depth information is essential for safe and effective operation.",

That report also said Meta HUD glasses were coming in 2025, but claimed that they won't be a partnership with EssilorLuxottica, and thus won't have Ray-Ban styling or branding, because the company \"balked\" at the thickness of designs with a waveguide projector included.\n\nThis suggests one of the two outlets is mistaken. However, The Information's report came months before Meta extended its partnership with EssilorLuxottica \u201cinto the next decade\u201d to develop \u201cmulti-generational smart eyewear products\u201d and invested a 5% stake in the company, so it's also possible that Meta managed to persuade EssilorLuxottica to change its mind.\n\nThe small heads-up display could be used to show notifications, to output text instead of audio from the Meta AI assistant, and to help frame photos before taking them. Meta executives have previously spoken of the idea of a \"viewfinder\".\n\nEven once HUD glasses are on the market though, comments from Mark Zuckerberg in interviews over the past year suggest Meta will continue to offer cheaper smart glasses without a display for a very long time, due to the significant potential of Meta AI. Zuckerberg says he originally expected smart glasses would need a display to be useful, but with the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) now believes audio-only should continue to exist as a product line of its own. HUD glasses and AR glasses should arrive as higher end product lines, then, not replacements for audio-only smart glasses.\n\nThe current Ray-Ban Meta glasses have been a breakout success, with Meta and EssilorLuxottica often selling them as fast as they can make them. But will buyers accept added bulk and weight if it gives them a small display, or is the success of this category contingent on the form factor resembling regular glasses? Meta's next steps will answer that question, and Samsung and Google are set to follow too.",

Trump and major social media platforms have been warring for years over perceived anti-conservative bias, including Meta\u2019s decision to shutter Trump\u2019s accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nWhile the latest moves look like corporate self-preservation in a vindictive political environment, they also reflect stubborn realities about stewarding a global public square \u2014 and they will reverberate around the world in ways that could fundamentally reshape the possibilities of a truly global digital platform.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe changes Zuckerberg announced are sweeping. Meta will do away with the U.S. third-party fact-checking program in favor of mimicking X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d model of crowd-sourced corrections.\n\nExcept for the most severe types of unlawful or dangerous content, such as \u201cterrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams,\u201d the company will drop reliance on automated systems to flag potential violations, instead leaving it up to users to report objections when they spot a policy breach. Meta will err on the side of leaving up content that does not violate the law or otherwise foster offline harm, and loosen speech restraints on political subjects including immigration and gender identity. Corporate teams that oversee trust and safety will relocate from California to Texas \u201c and other U.S. locations,\u201d presumably to reflect more mainstream \u2014 meaning red state \u2014 political sensibilities.\n\nMeta has wasted no time revamping its rules in keeping with this shift. Updates on Tuesday to the company\u2019s hateful conduct policy, part of its \u201cCommunity Standards,\u201d narrowed its definition of \u201cdehumanizing speech.\u201d They eliminated prior bans on, for example, likening people to feces and on speech denying the existence of protected characteristics such as religious affiliations and gender identities. After years of campaigning for more and updated internet regulations, Meta leadership is now pledging to work with the Trump administration to ward off guardrails around the world, repudiating Biden-era efforts to curtail disinformation and online abuse. Dana White, a Trump ally and the Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive, is joining Meta\u2019s board.\n\nWhile the policy changes are tailored to U.S. politics, Meta\u2019s community standards apply globally, with some variation to comply with local laws that require more content to be taken down than do the company\u2019s own rules. International users and civil society organizations have long chafed at social media platforms\u2019 orientation around American priorities. They have decried the scarcity of content moderators fluent in foreign languages and companies\u2019 failure to invest adequately in local cultural competence. In adjudicating content amid conflicts including the Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, Meta is regularly accused of willful blindness; the company\u2019s platforms have been accused of reducing engagement with Palestinian news outlets and enabling the spread of Russian state-sponsored disinformation.\n\nThese latest changes confirm that while Meta claims billions of users worldwide, at least for now the audience that matters most resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The relocation of trust and safety teams to Texas risks trading years of expertise in grappling with global moderation dilemmas for an uncertain bid to have a finger on the pulse of what\u2019s assumed to be middle America.\n\nNarrower hate-speech policies may make sense to enable more debate on hot-button U.S. issues including the border and gender identity. But they will also end up loosening the spigot on ethnic vilification in parts of the world including Myanmar, South Sudan and Ethiopia, where such hatreds can explode into uncontrolled violence. Meta has not explained how the new global standards will apply in other jurisdictions, including not just repressive societies but also liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada that define and prohibit hateful speech more broadly than does the United States.\n\nAlthough the U.S. is rightly proud of its 1st Amendment tradition and wide berth for free speech, it should not force its standards on the world.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t rule out connections between online hate speech and physical violence in the U.S. at a time when the link between online extremism and real-world terror may be intensifying.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s announcement is likely to drive some Meta users off the platform. Those in the U.S. who aren\u2019t interested in seeing more hateful speech or politics can simply abandon their accounts and stay informed and connected to friends via other online alternatives.\n\nBut in the West Bank, Maldives, some 30 countries in Africa, and elsewhere, Meta platforms essentially are the internet. In Africa, Meta invested in a program known as Free Basics to give users free online access through their phones, providing a lifeline \u2014 though a controversial one\u2014 for individuals and businesses that makes them dependent on the platform.\n\nMeta is not wrong to point out that the assertive policing of online speech is riddled with line-drawing exercises that are impossible to carry out at scale across billions of posts every day. Their choice to err on the side of more speech is a defensible, if imperfect, response to a political moment in the U.S. in which a large segment of the population feels constricted by the limits of acceptable public discourse.\n\nAround the world, though, users will have little say over how these changes play out in vastly different contexts, with consequences that may reshape societies and even threaten lives. America first, indeed.",

Meta seems to have resolved the situation for most folks, although some customers are still reporting troubles getting a replacement.\n\nBased on publicly available data via Amazon, Meta sold three times as many Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S headsets as Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S combined. We don't yet know how widespread the update issue is but we do know that Meta always rolls out updates and features slowly to its headsets to prevent widespread issues like this.\n\nGiven how well Meta's Quest headsets performed this holiday season, there's a possibility that a large number of customers have been affected. If you have been affected, Meta is encouraging users to go to this Meta Quest announcement page, tap the options button in the top right, and then click subscribe. You'll need a Meta Quest forum account to do this, but creating one is free and as simple as logging in with your existing Meta account.",

            "content": "Social media company Meta Platforms on Tuesday scrapped its U.S. fact-checking program and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity, bowing to criticism from conservatives as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time.\n\nThe move is Meta\u2019s biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content on its services in recent memory and comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled a desire to mend fences with the incoming administration.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe changes will affect Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world\u2019s biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally.\n\nLast week, Meta elevated Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head and on Monday announced it had elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close friend of Trump, to its board.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It\u2019s time to get back to our roots around free expression,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video.\n\nHe acknowledged the role of the recent U.S. elections in his thinking, saying they \u201cfeel like a cultural tipping point, towards once again prioritizing speech.\u201d\n\nIn place of a formal fact-checking program to address dubious claims posted on Meta\u2019s platforms, Zuckerberg instead plans to implement a system of \u201ccommunity notes\u201d similar to that used on Elon Musk-owned X.\n\nMeta also will focus its automated systems on removing \u201chigh-severity violations\u201d and illegal content such as terrorism and illicit drugs, Zuckerberg said. It will stop proactively scanning for hate speech and other types of rule-breaking, and review such posts only in response to user reports.\n\nThe company will move safety teams overseeing content policies and review out of California, including to Texas, he added.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to say which specific teams would be moving to Texas and whether any would be moving to other places. The spokesperson also declined to cite examples of mistakes or bias on the part of fact-checkers.\n\n\u2018Comes as a shock\u2019\n\nThe demise of the fact-checking program, started in 2016, caught partner organizations by surprise.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this move was happening and it comes as a shock to us. This is definitely going to affect us,\u201d said Jesse Stiller, managing editor at Check Your Fact.\n\nThe head of the International Fact-Checking Network, Angie Drobnic Holan, challenged Zuckerberg\u2019s characterization of its members as biased or censorious.\n\n\u201cFact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it\u2019s added information and context to controversial claims, and it\u2019s debunked hoax content and conspiracies. The fact-checkers used by Meta follow a Code of Principles requiring nonpartisanship and transparency,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nKristin Roberts, Gannett Media\u2019s chief content officer, said \u201ctruth and facts serve everyone \u2014 not the right or the left \u2014 and that\u2019s what we will continue to deliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned the news as everyone has today. It\u2019s a hard hit for the fact-checking community and journalism. We\u2019re assessing the situation,\u201d AFP said in an emailed response to Reuters.\n\nOther partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Reuters declined to comment. Meta\u2019s independent Oversight Board welcomed the move.\n\nZuckerberg in recent months has expressed regret over certain content moderation actions on topics including COVID-19. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, in a departure from its past practice.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever,\u201d said Ross Burley, co-founder for non-profit Centre for Information Resilience.\n\n\u201cThis move seems more about political appeasement than smart policy.\u201d\n\nFor now, Meta is only planning the changes for the U.S. market, with no immediate plans to end its fact-checking program in places like the European Union that take a more active approach to regulation of tech companies, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThey have come a long way \u2013 Meta. The man (Zuckerberg) was very impressive,\u201d Trump said when asked about the company\u2019s plan to end fact-checking.\n\nHe added that Zuckerberg was probably responding to threats made to him.\n\nMusk\u2019s X is already under European Commission investigation over dissemination of illegal content in the EU and the effectiveness of measures taken to combat information manipulation, including the \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system.\n\nThe Commission launched its probe in December 2023, several months after X launched the feature. A Commission spokesperson said it had taken note of Meta\u2019s announcement and was continuing to monitor the company\u2019s compliance in the EU.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act came into force in 2023 and requires very large online platforms such as X and Facebook to tackle illegal content and risks to public security.\n\nThe law imposes rules on content moderation, user privacy and transparency. Any firm found in breach faces a fine worth up to 6% of its global revenue.\n\nMeta said it would start phasing in Community Notes in the U.S. over the next couple of months and improve the model over the year.\n\nIt will allow users to call out posts that are potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the responsibility on independent fact-checking organizations and experts.\n\nMeta said it will not intervene in the adding of Community Notes to posts on its platforms.",

However, Meta\u2019s new plan to keep engagement high on its platforms could represent a major shift in AI regarding how it can be used by companies in the social media space.\n\nConnor Hayes, Meta\u2019s vice president of product for generative AI, recently revealed that the company\u2019s new range of AI products includes one that will help users create their own AI characters on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk just got the best Christmas gift he could ask for\n\nHayes noted that Meta expects these AI users to be implemented on the platforms over time and function just like human users.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that\u2019s where we see all of this going,\u201d he states.\n\nSocial-media landscape is uncertain\n\nThis comes at a time when Meta is facing an uncertain industry landscape, particularly for Facebook.

            "content": "Photo-Illustration: Facebook\n\nAmong Meta\u2019s many resolutions for the new year \u2014 making augmented reality and the metaverse happen, positioning itself to absorb TikTok refugees if the app gets banned, cracking open Apple\u2019s platforms to get more access to user data, and attriting its competition in artificial intelligence with breathtaking spending \u2014 one stands out as plain weird: filling its social-media platforms with bots. According to the Financial Times:\n\nThe Silicon Valley group is rolling out a range of AI products, including one that helps users create AI characters on Instagram and Facebook, as it battles with rival tech groups to attract and retain a younger audience. \u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,\u201d said Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta. \u201cThey\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that\u2019s where we see all of this going,\u201d he added.\n\nThe company has been talking about this for a while, to somewhat bewildered responses from the general public. The simplest explanation for what it\u2019s doing is that the company has invested a lot in building generative AI models and would like to get a return on its investment through its most lucrative products: If there\u2019s any economically productive way for Meta to plug AI tools into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it\u2019ll consider it. But Meta, a company with no qualms about chasing, copying, and acquiring its way into trends, is also reacting here. It bought SocialAI, a Twitter-ish \u201csocial network\u201d where users\u2019 \u201cfeeds\u201d and \u201ccomment sections\u201d are filled entirely with bots playing different characters. At the same time, it\u2019s surely noticed that its platforms are already filling with AI slop anyway and that some of this slop was creating a lot of engagement, meaning that, in the ways that matter most to Meta, it\u2019s not really slop at all. The company also clearly noticed the rise of Character.ai, the popular \u2014 but possibly doomed \u2014 lawsuit magnet of an app in which young users create and chat and act out fictional scenarios with AI characters.\n\nStill, Meta\u2019s framing here is unique to the company. It\u2019s by far the leading American social-network firm, with more than a billion actual people using its products around the world to interact with one another. Practically everyone in tech is trying practically everything with AI, but Meta, the suggestion goes, is in a singular position to populate shared human spaces with synthetic characters, and it seems to think it\u2019ll work.\n\nAs galling as this might sound to a casual Facebook user \u2014 after years of characterizing fake and automated profiles as spam, it\u2019s okay now if Meta is running the accounts and they\u2019re a little more convincing? \u2014 it has the benefit of sounding somewhat new and novel. Maybe these personas really will be engaging enough to post and respond alongside your friends, family, co-workers, and celebrities in your existing social-media feeds; maybe social-media feeds are the right place to encounter highly specific chatbots; maybe these chatbots can be entertaining or even helpful in the context of the apps users already check multiple times per day. It might not be a convincing story, but it\u2019s a story: There are increasingly intelligent bots among us, and they\u2019re joining social media.\n\nThe main benefit of this story is that, like a lot of AI products \u2014 it\u2019s right there in the name! \u2014 it anthropomorphizes the underlying technology. A less compelling but perhaps more honest and useful way to characterize Meta\u2019s impulse here is as the next step in a long process of automation and social mediation. When Facebook and Instagram were new, the content you encountered wasn\u2019t just created by people you knew or chose to follow \u2014 it carried with it legible and obvious evidence of provenance. If you saw something from someone you didn\u2019t follow or intend to interact with, it was because someone you know chose to share it; if you posted something, you could mostly assume it would be seen by people who intended to see it, and maybe by more people they intended to show it to. Well before the rise of TikTok, which mostly replaced follow/follower relationships with opaque algorithmic distribution, but especially after it, Facebook and Instagram have leaned hard into subtler forms of automation: content recommendations; people recommendations; unexplained stuff appearing in feeds, as Reels, or bugging users in notifications. The result is platforms where users are consuming more content but in some cases producing less, spaces that function less like social networks than like targeted advertising systems for everything.\n\nA lot of formerly social aspects of a platform like Facebook, in other words, have already been automated and replaced with machine learning, but each step in this direction has been subtle and somewhat concealed: You don\u2019t really know, and certainly aren\u2019t clearly told, why Meta assumes this or that Instagram Reel is something you want to see, or why one thing appears above another in an algorithmically sorted feed.\n\nThe idea of introducing AI characters into Meta\u2019s platforms is in some ways distinct and new \u2014 we\u2019re talking about not just automating content curation and promotion here but, in some cases, actual creation \u2014 but can also be understood as a way to rebrand an effective but alienating overhaul that\u2019s been a decade in the making. With many AI products \u2014 from ChatGPT to a customer-support bot \u2014 the performance of personhood, which is a bit of a misleading magic trick even when done carefully, is at least as important as raw capabilities. Meta can claim it\u2019s building technology to create social-media agents that can exist on its platforms \u201cin the same way that accounts do,\u201d and maybe it\u2019ll turn out to be right. But Meta\u2019s AI characters are also a way to slap a more friendly, humanlike face on a long, bloodless campaign of social automation.",

Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is betting that these lightweight headsets will be the next main computing device for consumers, as rivals such as Apple, Google, and Snap also race to develop similar products.\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta glasses have become a surprise hit among consumers after the latest version was launched in September 2023. Earlier this month, Ray-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses rolled out several new upgrades, including real-time AI video capability, live language translation, and Shazam.\n\nIn September, Meta unveiled its first pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses \u201cOrion\u201d \u2014 a prototype Zuckerberg describe as \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe smart glasses can project digital representations of media, people, games, and communications onto the real world. Orion interacts with the wearer\u2019s voice, typing, or hand gestures.\n\nBut Orion also has a \u201cwrist-based neural interface\u201d which lets the wearer send a signal from their brain to the device, using a wristband that translates nerve signals into digital commands.\n\nZuckerberg says the product will eventually become Meta\u2019s \u201cfirst consumer full holographic AR glasses.\u201d However, there is still no release date for Orion, which experts believe is still several years out.\n\nExperts say the platform faces big challenges, such as making glasses that look good, work well, last long on a charge, and are affordable. On top of that, there are major supply chain issues to solve.\n\nOne of Orion\u2019s standout features is its use of silicon carbide lenses, a material not commonly used in optics. These lenses allow Meta to create much bigger and brighter images than regular glass can.\n\nHowever, silicon carbide lenses are expensive and hard to produce in large quantities. This makes it difficult to turn Orion into an affordable product for the mass market without losing one of its key advantages.",

Although the theory exaggerates current real world online conditions, Meta\u2019s plan to host full AI accounts in the next two years will do little to calm its adherents.\n\nCountdown To AI\n\nMeta is quickly developing technology to allow its 3 billion users to create AI characters. The company believes AI is essential in competing with rivals for a next-generation audience who see Facebook and Instagram as their parent\u2019s social media platforms.\n\nMeta\u2019s vice president of product for generative AI, Connor Hayes, told the Financial Times that they expect AI accounts to become a significant feature of the platforms in coming years. These artificial accounts will have their own bios and can generate and share content independently. Hayes explained that AI content is a priority for the company, with plans to make AI interaction more social over the next two years. Hundreds of thousands of characters have been created using the tool since its July launch. So far, most of these characters have remained private creations that are not available to public members of the service.\n\nMost public-facing AI use on the platform has been in editing real users\u2019 content, yet the next wave of products aims to blur the line. Meta has allowed users to create AI assistants to answer follower questions. In an earlier demonstration, founder Mark Zuckerberg showed off an AI avatar that could converse in live video calls, although there were some guard rails on the projects, which included allowing creators to tell their avatars to avoid or emphasize specific topics.\n\nNext year, Meta says it plans to build on the technology by releasing text-to-video software, allowing creators to put themselves into AI videos.\n\nMeta\u2019s younger competitors are also deep into the AI game, with Snapchat releasing its own generative AI tools in September that allow creators to design 3D characters for augmented reality experiences.\n\nSnapchat has seen a 50 percent increase in user engagement with AI lenses, and along similar lines, Bytedance is keeping up through its Symphony AI suite for TikTok. This advertising-focused suite can create ads, avatars, and language translations from text prompts.\n\nConcerns About Social Media AI\n\nWhile Meta does plan to label AI-generated content on its platforms clearly, the risk of intentional misuse persists. This could range from serious political manipulation to simply flooding the platform with low-quality content.\n\nHowever, other serious concerns persist regarding the proliferation of AI, which include a mother who sued an AI chatbot company after her son\u2019s suicide. At the same time, Meta\u2019s platforms have become dumping grounds for low-quality AI-generated artwork, commonly called \u201cAI slop,\u201d incentivized through content monetization.\n\nWeb 2.0 began with the promise of a democratized internet but ended with lower user engagement than ever. Instead of users actively sharing, studies are finding more and more users opting to passively consume their feeds. Since the 2010s, feeds have slowly changed from mostly accounts users followed to large amounts of spam, ads, and boosted influencer posts.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the increasingly advertising-focused content featured on such platforms will succeed at keeping users engaged in the years ahead.\n\nRyan Whalen covers science and technology for The Debrief.

If you have a device that is still unresponsive, please click the button below for next steps. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nMark Rabkin, the vice president at Meta leading HorizonOS and Quest devices, wrote on X.com that \"almost all can now use device normally \u2013 but if you're still stuck contact customer support and we'll fix you up.\"\n\nQuest owners who reported to us last week that their headsets were effectively bricked during a failed software update process said that Meta support initially told them they'd need to buy a new device. Now, some of those same people say they've been contacted with a path to a free replacement for their headset.\n\nUpdate on Quest 2 / 3S software: almost all can now use device normally \u2014 but if you're still stuck contact consumer support and we'll fix you up. For Quest 3S we now also have an easy flow for you to check eligibility and request a replacement. \u2014 Mark Rabkin (@mrabkin) December 30, 2024\n\nI pulled out a Quest 2 on December 31 that hasn't been used in a while and could not get the headset fully operational after hours between Meta's Software Update Tool and factory resetting the device.\n\nI clicked Meta's support page and followed the prompts for Quest 2. The \"product-claim\" site is available for Quest 2, 3 and 3S headsets to check if you're eligible to \"proceed with a replacement\" by entering your serial number. I entered the one for this Quest 2 and it was listed as not eligible. I haven't pursued additional customer support with Meta for the device yet, and the headset is not entirely unresponsive, but it also won't load the setup pairing screen for more than a fraction of a second.\n\nWe asked Meta how many headsets have been bricked by this update and the number of replacements they're offering. Between Christmas, New Year and the rolling nature of Quest 2 headsets being brought online after long hibernations, we're extremely curious to hear details about the extent and resolution of this issue.",

            "content": "The current systematic review and meta-analysis represents the first study world-wide which directly compares infectious complications in patients who underwent TPB with and without PAP based on both randomized and non-randomized trials. Our aggregated analysis of the current data represents an update to the methodological approach of Castellani et al. (2021) [10]. Whereas their study included eight non-randomized trials, we have now expanded our systematic review to encompass 21 non-randomized studies and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). No statistically significant differences concerning all analyzed infectious endpoints (genitourinary infections, fever, sepsis, and readmission rates due to infectious complications) were observed following TPB with and without PAP. Our findings not only corroborate the results of the systematic review by Castellani et al. but also align with the insights from a methodologically distinct systematic review by Basourakos et al. (for a comparison of the methodology and results of the three systematic reviews now available on this topic, Table 3) [9, 10]. However, our study advances the discussion by incorporating newer studies including RCT and offering a more robust statistical analysis, thereby enhancing the reliability of the conclusions.\n\nTable 3 Presentation of the pooled incidence rates of infectious complications following transperineal prostate biopsy in groups with versus without periprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) derived from all systematic reviews currently available. Full size table\n\nIt is indisputable that our medical practices and the administration of antibiotics significantly influence the development of bacterial resistance. Therefore, every instance of forgoing PAP can be regarded as a success, potentially counteracting recent negative trends. In 2022, the \u2018Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators\u2019 published their GRAM Report in \u2018Lancet\u2019, estimating that nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019 were closely associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with ~1.3 million deaths directly attributable to AMR. Their analyses identified Escherichia coli as the most significant bacterium contributing to these substantial mortality rates [18].\n\nThese developments are particularly noteworthy in the context of prostate biopsy, as the global incidence of prostate cancer (and consequently the frequency of histological confirmations through biopsy) is projected to double by 2040 [19]. Thus, from pragmatic and forward-looking perspectives, the transperineal biopsy approach, which current studies suggest does not require PAP, should be favored over the transrectal biopsy approach, where PAP will always be necessary [20]. Nonetheless, several high-confidence studies currently demonstrate that this \u2018apples-to-oranges comparison\u2019 shows no inferiority in infectious endpoints for PAP-free transperineal biopsy compared to PAP-accompanied transrectal biopsy. For instance, Hu et al. published a randomized-controlled study comparing infectious complications following TPB without PAP vs. TRB with PAP [21]. Based on an entire cohort of 658 patients, they found no higher infection rates following TPB opposed to TRP. Of note, in this study, a rectal culture to screen for fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms was obtained prior to transrectal biopsy in all patients and targeted PAP was administered. It seems questionable whether such an effort is feasible in all patients undergoing TRP in daily routine. Furthermore, the detection rate of clinically significant cancer was similar in both groups indicating comparable diagnostic accuracy of both approaches. Although no statistically significant differences in infection rates were initially observed due to an insufficient number of enrolled patients, the potential clinical impact of even a 1% reduction in infection rates associated with prostate biopsy seems noteworthy, given the millions of procedures performed annually worldwide [22]. Interestingly, final results of this study published after meeting the sample size requirement even yielded a statistically significant difference in infection rates in favor of TPB [23]. In another RCT including 718 patients, Mian et al. reported no statistically significant differences in infectious or non-infectious complications following TPB without PAP as opposed to TRB including augmented PAP [24].\n\nBased on their longitudinal cohort study, Newman et al. concluded that targeted antimicrobials based on rectal swab culture failed to reduce the overall risk of post TRB sepsis as opposed to TRB including empirical PAP, while a change towards TPB nearly eliminated this risk [25]. The RCT conducted by Ploussard et al. yielded comparable detection rates and complications associated with TRP and TPB in a total of 270 patients, respectively [26]. In contrast, Diamand et al. found an even better detection rate concerning aggressive tumors for TPB compared to TRB in their trial comprising a total cohort of 3949 patients [27]. These studies show comparable oncologic results and non-infectious complications of TRB and TPB, respectively. In terms of infectious complications, omitting PAP in the context of TPB does not result in higher complications as opposed to prostate biopsy with PAP (regardless the PAP approach used).\n\nMoreover, abandonment of PAP in the context of TPB offers further advantages. Recent studies underline the impact of the microbiome on patients\u2019 outcome, e.g., by modifying the efficacy of systemic treatments in various tumors [28,29,30]. This suggests that a potential deterioration of patients\u2019 microbiome following PAP may adversely affect further prognosis\u2014a risk that can be excluded by omitting PAP.\n\nIn summary, our study yields substantial results suggesting that emerging recommendations to abstain from PAP in patients undergoing TPB are warranted. By reducing unnecessary antibiotic administration, healthcare providers can mitigate the risks associated with antibiotic resistance, which represents a growing global health concern. Furthermore, this approach aligns with the principles of antibiotic stewardship and promotes more sustainable healthcare practices without compromising patient safety.\n\nDespite the strengths of our analysis, several limitations must be considered. The primary limitation is the lack of more high-quality studies and the inclusion of studies with mixed methodological designs. This could introduce bias, as data from RCTs and prospective studies are likely to have been collected more intensively and reliably than data from retrospective studies. To address this, we analyzed RCTs and NRS separately. Additionally, the overall rate of infectious complications was low across all studies, regardless of methodological design, suggesting that this factor is unlikely to have skewed our aggregated analyses. However, not all studies investigated each of the five selected endpoints, limiting our ability to draw definitive conclusions about specific infectious complications. Moreover, the absence of long-term follow-up data constrains our understanding of delayed complications, which are crucial for comprehensive guideline recommendations.\n\nAnother limitation is that our analyses did not account for potential patient-level differences, such as medical comorbidities, prior exposure to prostate biopsy, or the number of previous prostate biopsies\u2014factors that could contribute to post-procedural infections.\n\nAn additional limitation, which might also enhance the generalizability of our results, is the variation in PAP regimens and doses in the comparator arms. The antibiotics used, as well as their routes and durations of administration, varied significantly between studies. Consequently, we chose to conduct all meta-analyses as random-effect models despite a uniform I\u00b2 of 0%. It is also important to note that the management of readmission (potentially as hospitalization) due to infectious complications after prostate biopsy varies greatly worldwide and is thus difficult to standardize. Finally, we were unable to assess the impact of the number of biopsy cores taken on the post-procedural infection rate, as several studies did not report this parameter.\n\nThese extensive limitations, considered alongside our risk-of-bias assessment, ultimately led us to rate the certainty of our analyses for each endpoint as \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018very low\u2019 according to the GRADE approach. We could not analyze the endpoint \u2018Mortality\u2019 at all, as none of the studies reported relevant events.\n\nFuture research should focus on addressing the gaps identified in this review. Additional RCTs with larger sample sizes and standardized antibiotic administration protocols are desirable to further enhance the level of evidence thereby increasing the certainty of conclusions. Moreover, investigating the role of patient-specific factors, such as comorbidity profiles and previous antibiotic usage, could help tailor ABS strategies more effectively. Longitudinal studies are also essential to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of omitting PAP. Some of the features listed above are already addressed by two ongoing studies registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with no results available yet: a prospective cohort study from Hong Kong (NCT06359964) and an RCT from Indonesia (NCT04985110).\n\nAlternative imaging techniques for initial diagnosis of PCa are currently investigated to replace or complement MRI in this setting [31]. Preliminary evidence supports initiation of curative treatment for PCa based on MRI in combination with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PSMA-PET-CT) without prior biopsy in selected patients [32, 33]. In the future, this approach may ultimately prevent any infectious complications following diagnostic work-up for PCa.",

The results of the ROB and quality assessment are shown in Fig. 2. All studies described the baseline characteristics. However, about half of the studies did not describe the process of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, random outcome assessment, and blinding of outcome assessment.

Among the 15 studies, there were 7 records of cell cycle marker Ki67, 6 of PH3, 9 of BrdU/EdU, and 3 of AurkB. The results of meta-analysis did not find statistically significant differences in percentages of Ki67+ (MD = \u2212 0.04%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: \u2212 0.27 to 0.19), PH3+ (MD = \u2212 0.03%, 95% CI: \u2212 0.22 to 0.16), and BrdU/EdU+ (MD = 0.41%, 95%CI: \u2212 0.58 to 1.40). The percentage of AurkB+ (MD = \u2212 0.09%, 95% CI: \u2212 0.14 to \u2212 0.04) cardiomyocyte was lower in the MI group than that in the Sham group.\n\nFig. 3 Meta-analysis of proportion of cell cycle markers between MI and Sham group in identified studies.

Random effects models were used if I 2 > 50% and p < 0.05 in the heterogeneity test. Results showed no significant increase in cardiomyocyte cell cycle activation in the MI heart versus the Sham heart Full size image\n\nSubgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate whether the time-points post-MI and mouse strains influenced the result (Additional file 3: Fig. S1-2). Firstly, we conducted a subgroup analysis at different time points post-MI (\u2264 14 days vs. > 14 days) (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). The results showed statistical differences in pooled MD of Ki67+ (p < 0.01) between two subgroups. The proportion of BrdU/EdU+ cardiomyocytes in the MI group was statistically higher than that in the Sham group over 14 days post-MI. However, we did not find significant differences in pooled MD of PH3+ (p = 0.81), BrdU/EdU+ (p = 0.20), or AurkB+ (p = 0.47) between the two subgroups. In addition, we conducted a subgroup analysis in different mouse strains (C57BL/6 J vs. other strains). The results showed that there were no significant differences in pooled MD of Ki67+ (p = 0.30), PH3+ (p = 0.19), or BrdU/EdU (p = 0.67) between the two subgroups (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). The studies reporting AurkB+ used the same mouse strains and were unable to perform subgroup analysis.\n\nStudies with the methodology of cell cycle indicators showed an increase of Ki67 + cycling cardiomyocytes in infarct border zone versus remote zone in the same post-MI heart\n\nAmong the 26 studies\u2019 methodologies of cell cycle indicators, 11 studies were included between infarct border zone and remote zone in the same post-MI heart (Table 2) [6, 26, 31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]. The results of ROB and quality assessment are shown in Fig. 4. All studies described the baseline characteristics. A few studies did not describe the process of random sequence generation, random housing, and blinding. About half of the studies did not explain the process of allocation concealment, random outcome assessment, blinding of outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Apart from that, only one study described other biases, and none of the studies reported whether there were incomplete outcome data, considering missing data may affect the authenticity of results.\n\nTable 2 Characteristics of the identified studies on cardiomyocyte proliferation between infarct border zone and remote zone in post-MI hearts Full size table\n\nFig. 4 Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies on cardiomyocyte proliferation between infarct border zone and remote zone.

B Risk of bias for each individual study Full size image\n\nPooled results of the meta-analysis on cell cycle markers between the border zone and remote zone are shown in Fig. 5. Among the 11 studies, 9 records of cell cycle marker Ki67 were found. Results of the meta-analysis revealed that the percentage of Ki67+ cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone was statistically higher than that in the remote zone (MD = 0.23%, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.35). There were 6 records of PH3, 8 of BrdU/EdU, and 3 of AurkB. Results of meta-analysis showed that the proportion of PH3+ (MD = 0.01%, 95% CI: \u2212 0.01 to 0.04), BrdU/EdU+ (MD = 0.27%, 95% CI: \u2212 0.12 to 0.66), and AurkB+ (MD = 0.03%, 95% CI: \u2212 0.03 to 0.08) cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone was higher than that in the remote zone, though the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nFig. 5 Meta-analysis of the proportion of cell cycle markers between infarct border and remote zone in identified studies.

Random effects models were used if I2 > 50% and p < 0.05 in the heterogeneity test. Results showed an increase of Ki67+ cycling cardiomyocytes in the infarct border zone versus the remote zone in the same post-MI heart Full size image\n\nResults of subgroup analysis in different time points (\u2264 14 days and > 14 days) were shown in (Additional file 3: Fig. S3). The percentage of Ki67+ cardiomyocytes in the border zone was statistically higher than that in the remote zone within 14 days post-MI (MD = 0.22%, 95%CI: 0.09 to 0.36), while there was no statistically significant difference over 14-days post-MI. However, we did not find significant differences in pooled MD of Ki67+ (p = 0.85), PH3+ (p = 0.32), BrdU/EdU+ (p = 0.11), or AurkB+ (p = 0.36) between two subgroups.\n\nStudies with the methodology of genetic reporter/tracing mouse systems showed very few overwhelming evidence that MI stimulates bona fide proliferation in the adult heart\n\nIn addition, we conducted a systematic review of 10 studies with the methodology of genetic reporter/tracing systems (Table 3) [5, 8,9,10, 12, 40,41,42,43,44]. The mouse systems including MADM, FUCCI, Rainbow, \u03b1DKRC, Mki67, and MerCreMer+/ZEG+ were included in this study. In most studies (6 out of 10), the difference in cardiomyocyte proliferation between MI and Sham groups was not statistically significant.\n\nTable 3 Systematic review for cardiomyocyte proliferation post-MI evaluated by genetic reporter/tracing systems Full size table\n\nInterestingly, among the other 4 studies showing MI stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation, very few showed overwhelming evidence that MI stimulated bona fide proliferation in the adult heart because of methodological shortages. A study using the Ki67-based genetic system ProTracer for continuous recording of cycling cardiomyocytes documented a 3 ~ 7 folds increase of proliferative cardiomyocytes in MI hearts compared with Sham hearts [5]. However, the Ki67-based ProTracer could only record cycling cardiomyocytes but not dividing cardiomyocytes. Three studies showed a mild increase (1 ~ 3 folds) of proliferative cardiomyocytes in MI hearts compared with Sham hearts. A study used co-registration of cardiomyocyte fluorescent labeling and [15N] thymidine labeling of DNA replication and showed that 3.2% of infarct zone cardiomyocytes initiate DNA replication and nuclear division. However, most DNA synthesis that occurs in these cardiomyocytes does not complete cell division [9]. Another study showed that overexpression of four cell-cycle regulators robustly increased adult cardiomyocyte proliferation in MADM mouse heart; the proliferation was ~ 1 fold more in infarcted heart than Sham, and the proliferation was significantly more in border zone and infarct zone than in remote zone [44]. However, the data was based on manipulation of cell-cycle regulator overexpression. The study neither describes the comparison between MI versus Sham baseline level nor describes the comparison between different regions of the post-MI heart in mice without intervention.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nAfter eliminating each study, sensitivity analysis of the cell cycle markers (Ki67+, PH3+, BrdU/EdU+, and AurkB+) showed that the effects between the MI group and Sham group were still stable in general (Additional file 3: Fig. S4). Sensitivity analyses of the effects between the border zone and remote zone were stable after excluding each study (Additional file 3: Fig. S5).",

Moreover, we believe the ramp of newer products, the infusion of gen AI across the portfolio, and the expansion of advertising across a wider swath of the platform position Meta well in 2025.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock fell 1.4% to close at 591.24, as the broader market slumped.\n\nAnalyst View: What To Watch In 2025\n\nWhite added that a TikTok ban could also boost Meta but he's \"not counting on such an outcome.\" The Supreme Court is scheduled to review a law requiring TikTok's parent company to sell the popular social media app on Jan. 10. President-Elect Donald Trump has requested the court delay the law in the meantime. It would take effect Jan. 19.\n\nAnother factor to watch for Meta stock next year is its AI spending. White noted that Meta's capital expenditure plan this year grew to a range of $38 billion to $40 billion, whereas initial plans from Meta called for spending between $30 billion and $35 billion. Much of the capital expenditure is going toward data centers to power the Facebook parent's AI ambitions.\n\n\"Despite Meta's big CapEx investments in 2024, we are modeling strong free cash flow of $48.1 billion and a rich free cash flow margin of 29.4%,\" White wrote. \"Furthermore, our current EPS estimate of $23.17 for 2024 is up sharply from our projection of $18.93 a year ago.\"\n\nWhite estimates that next year Meta reach $53.4 billion in CapEx, up 38% from 2024's projected total. But Meta has a \"strong gen AI foundation\" and an advertising business that could help the social media giant continue to generate strong profits despite the CapEx investments, the note added.\n\n\"We believe Meta is well positioned to benefit from the digital ad trend, expand the reach of its platform, innovate with gen AI, and leverage a leaner cost structure,\" White wrote. \"However, regulatory scrutiny persists, and the macro remains fragile.\"\n\nMeta Stock Tests 50-Day Line\n\nMeanwhile, Meta stock has traded lower in recent days along with the broader market. Shares fell a half-percent Friday, landing below a former flat base buy point of 602.95. After slumping below Meta's shorter-term 21-day moving average late last week, Meta stock is testing support at its 50-day line.\n\nThe Facebook parent's stock broke out from the flat base chart pattern on Dec. 3 and climbed to reach a record 638.40 on Dec. 11 before this recent pullback.\n\nMeta stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99, per IBD Stock Checkup.

            "content": "\u201cSociable\u201d is the latest commentary on important social media developments and trends from industry expert Andrew Hutchinson of Social Media Today.\n\nIf you thought that 2024 was a big year for social platforms pushing AI elements into their apps, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, with Meta looking to bring even more AI to your feeds over the next year.\n\nHow is it going to do that?\n\nWell, aside from injecting AI chatbots into every aspect that it can, Meta\u2019s next plan is to deploy millions of generative AI characters and have them pose as actual users on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAccording to Connor Hayes, Meta\u2019s VP of product for gen AI, soon, there\u2019ll be a whole range of new AI profiles activated within its apps.\n\nAs per Hayes (via The Financial Times):\n\n\u201cWe expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do. They\u2019ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.\u201d\n\nWhich is not overly surprising.\n\nIn an interview back in August, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained that:\n\n\u201cEvery part of what we do is going to get changed in some way [by AI]. [For example] feeds are going to go from - you know, it was already friend content, and now it\u2019s largely creators. In the future, a lot of it is going to be AI generated.\u201d\n\nThat seemed to suggest that Zuckerberg was anticipating that more and more people would eventually start using Meta\u2019s gen AI tools to create images and posts, but shortly after this, Meta hired app developer Michael Sayman, who had just created Social.ai, an app that enables you to interact with millions of AI bots, each with their own personality and focus.\n\nAs such, the pathway seems pretty clear, with Meta looking to incorporate elements of Social.ai into its core social experiences, thereby showcasing the evolving capacity of its AI models, while also providing new ways to engage within its apps.\n\nWhich, frankly, sounds horrible, and the reaction online has been strongly against the integration of more bots in social apps.\n\nBut then again, most social media users instinctively reject change, and the real question then is: \u201cWill it work?\u201d\n\nIf Meta does unleash millions of AI profiles on Facebook and IG, each with their own custom personality, focused on a certain topic and/or interest area, could that actually boost app usage and engagement?\n\nAnd the answer, whether you like it or not, is probably yes.\n\nTake, for example, the recent backlash on Threads regarding the difficulty that users have had in growing their following in the app. On Bluesky, which enables users to default to the \u201cFollowing\u201d feed (as opposed to the algorithm-defined \u201cFor You\u201d stream), many creators have claimed that it\u2019s much easier to gain followers, and build an audience of your own, as opposed to Threads, where follower growth seems to plateau pretty fast.\n\nSpooked by the sudden rise of Bluesky, Threads then sought to address this, by updating its algorithm to put more emphasis on content from profiles that you follow in the feed.\n\nBut really, you\u2019re never going to gain followers like you did on Twitter or Facebook in the past, because modern social media algorithms are more focused on engagement, and showing you more content that\u2019s similar to what you\u2019re already engaging with. That approach, led by TikTok, has enabled the platforms to drive more time spent in-stream, and as such, they would prefer that you rely on their recommendation algorithms and \u201cFor You\u201d feeds, as opposed to curating your own experience by following.\n\nThe end result, then, is that you don\u2019t actually need to follow anyone anymore, as you can just rely on the system to show you more stuff that you\u2019ll like. Which, consequently, means that people don\u2019t follow profiles at the same rates that they once did.\n\nAs such, growing a following is going to be difficult, but at the same time, creators are also attuned to this as a growth metric, and they want to see that number go up.\n\nAnd given that only a fraction of social media users ever post anything at all, Meta knows that it needs to keep these users happy.\n\nSo what happens if Meta launches millions of AI bots, and they\u2019re all guided to follow profiles related to their topics of focus?\n\nNow, you\u2019re gaining thousands of followers a day, and Meta can unleash a heap more to keep those numbers rising. These bots will also be able to engage with your updates, by asking questions, providing responses, and giving you notes of encouragement.\n\nSure, they\u2019re bots, but do you really think that users are going to care?\n\nThat\u2019s the key question: Will the fact that this is artificial engagement tangibly reduce the dopamine boost that people get when they open the app and see that they have a heap of likes, comments, and new followers, every time that they share an update?\n\nI would like to think that it would, but in reality, I suspect it won\u2019t.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Assessing AI\u2019s Role in Marketing for 2025 , from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Go deeper with an exclusive virtual event,, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Learn more \u2794\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen people using \u201cfollow for follow\u201d tactics to boost their numbers, and make themselves feel like they\u2019re popular, even though the people following them have no actual interest in what they post. We\u2019ve seen people pay for bot followers as a means to inflate their perceived importance, we\u2019ve seen people buy likes to get that hit of engagement and/or relevance.\n\nPeople know that a lot of the engagement on social media is fake already. So do you really think that they\u2019ll question it if these new bots inflate their numbers in a new way?\n\nMy guess is that many, many users will just feel good that they\u2019re getting attention, and that Meta\u2019s AI bots will actually increase engagement as a result. Sure, it\u2019s not real, \u201csocial\u201d interaction as we would more commonly define it. But again, if the numbers go up, I suspect that many will welcome it.\n\nThere is also a practical value to having AI bots as a sounding board of sorts, providing alternative considerations to your updates. You could post: \u201cWhat should I have for dinner?\u201d for example, and get responses from an Italian chef bot, a French chef bot, a health food bot, a deals and coupons bot, etc. That could actually be helpful, and there\u2019s a range of ways that these responses might actually also provide value too.\n\nOf course, it would also have impacts for influencers, and those trying to pitch themselves for brand collabs. Brands will need to be even more discerning in which \u201cinfluencers\u201d they work with, because if 70% of their following is actually AI bots, then they won\u2019t be of much value for your promotions.\n\nBut with that consideration aside, and disclosure labeling in place to indicate AI bots (I suspect Meta will look to hide this where it can), I actually can see this being a winning strategy for the company.\n\nIt sounds bad, and the last thing we probably need is more bot accounts within social apps. But in practical application, you can imagine that many users will just be happy to get that extra engagement, whether it\u2019s artificial or not.\n\nIf the numbers go up, all other considerations, I suspect, will fade.",

Currently, users can access Meta AI to edit photos or create AI assistants.\n\nThe Financial Times also reported that Meta also plans on rolling out new text-to-video generation software for content creators to insert themselves into AI-created videos.\n\nAhead of these rollouts, some experts warned that there needs to be significant guard rails installed to stop the technology from being \"weaponized.\"\n\n\"Without robust safeguards, platforms risk amplifying false narratives through these AI-driven accounts,\" chief marketing officer at talent agency Billion Dollar Boy and former head of Meta's creator innovations team Becky Owen said to the Financial Times.\n\nShe also warned that an influx of AI users could actually dilute the brand by filling the platform with comparatively low-quality content.\n\nShe added, \"Unlike human creators, these AI personas don\u2019t have lived experiences, emotions, or the same capacity for relatability.\"\n\nAI-generated content is currently required to include an \"AI Info\" label on Facebook.\n\nIn a comment to Fox Business, a Meta spokesperson touted the AI tool's abilities.\n\n\"With AI Studio, people can create and chat with AI characters which are AIs based on your interests.

            "content": "I\u2019ll be honest, I wasn\u2019t as excited about conducting this Meta Quest 3S review as I probably should have been. After taking a deep-dive look at the major differences between the Quest 3, and the Quest 3S, I came to the conclusion that Meta\u2019s new headset wasn\u2019t really going to blow anyone away.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had an opportunity to test the headset for myself, I can confirm that it\u2019s not exactly revolutionary. There are no new features, (at least nothing that you won\u2019t also get on the Quest 3). In fact, in a lot of ways the two devices are almost identical. They\u2019ve got the same RAM and chipset (the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, with 8GB).\n\nHowever \u2013 the Meta Quest 3S does serve a very important purpose. It\u2019s helping Meta \u201cdemocratize\u201d access to extended reality, with a headset that\u2019s arguably a lot better than the Quest 2, and a fraction of the price of most competing alternatives.\n\nHere\u2019s my honest review of the Meta Quest 3S headset, and why I still think it\u2019s a worthwhile investment (for some people).\n\nQuick Verdict: Pros and Cons\n\nOn a broad scale, the Meta Quest 3S isn\u2019t much different from the original Meta Quest 3. Aside from having the same chipset and RAM, it also has the same controllers, access to the same apps, and the same \u201cmixed reality\u201d passthrough features. However, the specs have been trimmed back somewhat.\n\nYou get a slightly bulkier frame with the Quest 3S, a far less powerful display, and you\u2019re limited to storage of 128GB or 256GB (instead of 512GB). Despite this, the Quest 3S is still a huge upgrade from the Quest 2, even though it shares a similar display. You get a faster processor, better pass-through cameras, and a decent battery life.\n\nUltimately, if you\u2019re looking for the cheapest way to experiment with not just VR, but mixed reality too, then the Quest 3S is definitely a good pick.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent processor\n\nColor pass-through cameras\n\nDecent refresh rate\n\nAccess to countless apps and games\n\nExtremely affordable pricing\n\nReliable controls\n\nCons:\n\nSlightly lackluster display\n\nSome tracking issues\n\nBulkier design\n\nMeta Quest 3S Review: Overview and Specs\n\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my previous content covering the Meta Quest 3S, you\u2019ll already know that it\u2019s basically a VR headset somewhere between the Quest 2 (now over four years old), and the Quest 3. Like the Quest 2, pricing for the Quest 3S starts at $299.99, and the headset uses the same Fresnel display \u2013 popular among older VR headsets.\n\nHowever, the Quest 3S also shares many of the most valuable features of the Quest 3, like the cutting-edge Snapdragon processor, color passthrough cameras, and improved RAM. After testing dozens of VR headsets, I can safely say there\u2019s really no \u201ccheaper\u201d option out there that offers the same level of performance and functionality.\n\nWhile the Quest 3 is probably worth the extra cash if you want a much shaper picture, the Quest 3S is the ultimate entry point option for XR in my opinion. It\u2019s the perfect choice for budget-conscious consumers, or even businesses who want to kit their teams out for immersive collaboration.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the technical specifications:\n\nDisplay: One LCD display\n\nOne LCD display Lenses: Fresnel\n\nFresnel Resolution: 1832 x 1920 per eye\n\n1832 x 1920 per eye Refresh rate: 120Hz\n\n120Hz FOV: 90 degrees vertical, 96 degrees horizontal\n\n90 degrees vertical, 96 degrees horizontal RAM: 8GB\n\n8GB Storage: 125GB or 256GB\n\n125GB or 256GB Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Battery life: 5 hours (Average)\n\n5 hours (Average) Weight: 514g\n\nMeta Quest 3S Review: Design and Comfort\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of this Meta Quest 3S review, there\u2019s really not a lot of difference between the Quest 3S and the Quest 3 at a glance. The newer (more affordable) headset looks and feels exactly like most of the other headsets in Meta\u2019s collection. You get the familiar white plastic shell. However, the Quest 3S has a flatter front plate than the Quest 3, and the cameras are placed differently.\n\nThe cameras on the Quest 3S are placed in two triangular clusters, with an IR emitter linked to each. The appearance is a little more \u201calien\u201d in my opinion, but it\u2019s not too wild. Like the Quest 3, the Quest 3S places its USB-C port, indicator LED, and power button on the left.\n\nYou also get the same memory foam padding, for a more comfortable wearing experience, as you do with the Quest 3. There\u2019s even a similar Y-shaped elastic headband, which you can upgrade with the Elite Strap, or Elite Strap with the included battery pack.\n\nUsers can still also access prescription inserts for the Quest 3S. The big downside, however, is there\u2019s no wheel to allow you to adjust the IPD settings precisely. You only get three positions to choose from. The inside of the headset is a little different too. Because the headset uses Fresnel lenses, the cavity around your eyes is a little deeper.\n\nFrom a comfort perspective, wearing the Quest 3S is similar to wearing the Quest 3 \u2013 it even weighs almost exactly the same as its big brother. However, the overall design does feel a little chunkier, and the bulky elements did leave me worrying that the device would shift around on my face a bit more.\n\nThe Display and Pass-Through Experience\n\nThe display is where the Meta Quest 3S feels a lot more like the Quest 2 than the newer Quest 3. Meta chose the same Fresnel lenses it used in the previous device for the more affordable headset, to help keep costs low. Ultimately, pancake lenses do offer a better level of clarity than Fresnel lenses. Plus, it\u2019s worth noting that the resolution of the Quest 3S is a fraction of that offered by the Quest 3.\n\nThe more expensive headset has a 2,064 x 2,208 pixel per eye resolution, compared to the 1,832 x 1920 resolution of the 3S. That might not feel like a huge change, but when it\u2019s paired with a slightly lower field of view, and fewer \u201cpixels per degree\u201d, you do end up with a grainier image.\n\nThat being said, the display is still decent, particularly compared to some of the older, cheap headsets I\u2019ve tried. Additionally, while what you see within the Quest 3S is similar to what you\u2019d see with the Quest 2, what you can see through the headset is much better.\n\nThe Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2\u2019s monochrome passthrough features with full color passthrough (the same as the Quest 3). You\u2019ll be able to see your surroundings with decent clarity, although I still think you\u2019ll need to take the headset off from time to time \u2013 such as when you\u2019re reading small pieces of text. That\u2019s simply because the camera resolution on the Quest 3S isn\u2019t exactly perfect.\n\nOther, more premium headsets, like the Apple Vision Pro, are definitely better from a mixed reality perspective, but, of course, the price tag is much higher. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that the Quest 3S doesn\u2019t have a depth sensor, which makes position tracking a little clunky at times.\n\nMeta Quest 3S Review: Processor and Battery Life\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted various times throughout this Meta Quest 3S review, the more affordable headset features the exact same chipset as the Quest 3. The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip ensures you should be able to access all of the features and apps you need on the Quest 3S with ease.\n\nYou also get a fantastic 8GB of RAM, although you will have less storage, with only 128GB and 256GB of the headset available. The storage isn\u2019t expandable either, so you can\u2019t \u201cbuild on it\u201d in the future if you start using your headset more regularly.\n\nFrom a software perspective, you should technically have access to all of the same apps on the Horizon store for the Quest 3S as you would for the Quest 3. You can still use this headset for workplace tasks, creating things like \u201cportals\u201d which allows your avatar to move through various applications and virtual worlds.\n\nYou can also connect your Quest 3S to your computer to access SteamVR and other PC VR games. However, you will need to pay another $79.99 for a Meta Quest link cable. I actually think some apps perform a little better on the Quest 3S, with less latency \u2013 probably because the chipset doesn\u2019t have to work as hard to render better graphics.\n\nAnother major plus of the Quest 3S over the Quest 3, is it has a slightly longer battery life. On average, Meta says the Quest 3 can last for up to 2.2 hours (although I\u2019ve found it\u2019s usually closer to 2 hours). The Quest 3S, on the other hand, as an average battery life of 2.5 hours. So if you\u2019re diving into longer immersive collaboration sessions, the Quest 3S could be a good choice.\n\nControllers and Tracking Capabilities\n\nThe controllers you get with the Quest 3S are the same as those included with the Quest 3 \u2013 which I\u2019ve noted before, are excellent. Meta\u2019s controllers are simple, streamlined, and ergonomic, with conveniently placed buttons that make it easy to navigate through content.\n\nMeta\u2019s Quest Pro controllers are a little better in a few ways, offering access to built-in cameras for motion tracking and rechargeable batteries. However, if you\u2019re looking for a straightforward experience, the Quest 3S\u2019s controllers are absolutely fine.\n\nLike many mixed reality headsets today, the Quest 3S also supports \u201chand tracking\u201d, although there are no eye-tracking features. You\u2019ll need to go through an initial setup process to ensure the headset\u2019s cameras can recognize your hands, but from there, you can use gestures to control content instead of the physical controllers.\n\nThe gesture actions are the same as those you\u2019d use on the Quest 3. For instance, you can pinch your index finger and thumb together to \u201cclick\u201d on something. Unfortunately, the trackers are a little bit limited. If you can\u2019t keep your hands steady, or the lighting in your room isn\u2019t perfect, you can waste a lot of time just getting gesture controls to work.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s worth noting that while the Quest 3S supports hand tracking, not all of the apps on the app store will. You may still need to rely on controllers when using certain software.\n\nMeta Quest 3S Review: The Verdict\n\nUltimately, the Meta Quest 3S doesn\u2019t deliver the same high-quality mixed reality experience you\u2019d get from more expensive headsets, like the Apple Vision Pro, or even the Meta Quest 3. However, it\u2019s worth remembering that it\u2019s really not supposed to.\n\nMeta designed this headset to be the ultimate \u201centry level\u201d device for those interested in experimenting with XR. In that regard, the device excels. It\u2019s comfortable enough, easy to use, packed with processing power, and brimming with apps to choose from.\n\nSure, you won\u2019t get the same visual quality you get from the Quest 3, or the same enhanced tracking capabilities, but you will get a very similar experience for a fraction of the price. I genuinely think this headset could revolutionize the XR space in its own way.\n\nIt won\u2019t introduce us to anything particularly \u201cnew\u201d in VR or MR, but it will allow more people to embrace the extended reality landscape. It could even allow for an increase in companies using virtual and mixed reality for training, product design, and collaboration.\n\nBy combining affordability with decent (if not perfect) performance, Meta has created a headset that has the power to accelerate XR adoption worldwide. If you\u2019re new to the XR space, and want to get started with a budget-friendly headset \u2013 there\u2019s no better option than the Quest 3S. If you\u2019re looking for something more advanced, but still affordable, upgrade to the Quest 3.",

They'll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform... that's where we see all of this going.\"\n\nMeta has heavily invested in the AI landscape, shipping a wide range of AI-powered services and products across its tech stack. Admittedly, bots have been closely tied to manipulating public discussion, inciting hate speech, spreading misinformation, and enacting fraud and scams. In this case, Meta's AI-powered characters could serve the important role of flagging such instances.\n\nAs you may know, Meta launched its AI Studio platform earlier this year. The platform allows users to create an AI character based on their interests via the platform. More interestingly, creators can even build an AI extension of themselves.\n\nMeta plans to expand AI Studio's access beyond the US in 2025 as part of its broader plan to double down on AI efforts. While the Facebook maker is treading on dangerous grounds, the move could be profitable and worthwhile if it implements elaborate measures and guardrails.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

            "content": "Meta, the parent company of such popular social networks as Facebook and Instagram, is once again in the spotlight due to a major development that is as interesting as it is controversial: the implementation of AI users on these platforms. The company, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, plans to revolutionize the digital landscape through the use of generative artificial intelligence, all to offer new forms of entertainment and increase the engagement of real users with these platforms.\n\nMeta and its strong bet on AI: the company wants to create \u201cartificial intelligence users\u201d on Facebook and Instagram\n\nMeta, the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg, is once again generating debate for an announced measure that will drastically influence both the use of Facebook and Instagram and how we understand these two social networks. As revealed by the Financial Times, this technology company is committed to bringing to these two platforms thousands of \u201ccharacters\u201d generated by artificial intelligence in order to increase interactions with its 3 billion users.\n\nFull screen FILE PHOTO: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech, as the letters AI for artificial intelligence appear on screen, at the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Carlos Barria REUTERS\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based group has launched a series of AI products, including a tool for creating artificial intelligence characters on Instagram and Facebook. Personalities such as MrBeast have lent their image to the creation and characterization of these virtual entities. According to Connor Hayes, vice president of product for generative AI at Meta, the long-term goal is for these AI users to exist on the platforms in a similar way to accounts managed by flesh-and-blood people. These AI accounts will have \u201cbios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform...that\u2019s where we see all of this going,\u201d he commented.\n\nHayes also revealed that a priority for Meta over the next two years is to increase the \u201centertaining and engaging\u201d potential of its applications, which is one of the main reasons for its strong commitment to AI.\n\nFull screen\n\nThe Meta executive also revealed that there are already hundreds of thousands of such AI users, which was launched in the United States in July 2024, with plans to expand in the near future. However, most of these user accounts are private, so it is understood that the company would still be implementing these changes and new features gradually to assess their impact on its \u201creal\u201d user base.\n\nBeyond these AI-powered users, Meta also plans to add tools to Instagram and Facebook\u2019s catalog of features, such as AI assistants that can answer questions from followers, as well as text-to-video generation software for creators, allowing them to insert themselves into AI-generated videos.\n\nFull screen Foto: MediaTek\n\nAlthough these are important developments for these two popular social networks, experts view them with suspicion, since an inadequate implementation or without security guarantees for active users could create new problems, apart from the ethical and moral implications of creating these AI users that many could confuse with real people.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFollow MeriStation USA on X (formerly known as Twitter).

            "content": "Credit: dreii / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe holidays are the absolute worst time for a software update to render Meta\u2019s Quest headsets unusable, but that\u2019s exactly the situation users have been facing over the past week. According to posts on Reddit and Meta\u2019s own forums , users have been experiencing issues with brand new and existing Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest 3S headsets that are essentially locking themselves into either an error message or a never-ending black screen after installing their most recent software update. Luckily, the situation seems to be largely resolved, although there's still a few wrinkles to iron out.\n\nNew and old headsets are affected\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear what caused the bug, although a popular theory across Meta\u2019s forums seems to center on devices that haven\u2019t been used in a while. Essentially, while users running the most recent Quest firmware seemed to be able to update their devices just fine, those updating from older versions of the firmware were more likely to encounter problems (that would include me, although my headset is currently a few hundred miles away from me, so I\u2019ll have to rely on user reports instead).\n\nHowever, the issue also appears to be common on newer headsets, according to Reddit. Here, users report that brand new headsets will attempt the update as soon as turning on, and have been locking into an error message as soon as their updates complete.\n\nIt\u2019s possible new headsets that might have been sitting on a shelf for a while would also be running outdated firmware, but one common thread across both Reddit and Meta\u2019s forums is that factory resets aren\u2019t helping, and should be avoided. Chances are that, if you're affected, you\u2019ll just be unable to boot up, and will instead be stuck on a black screen until you give up.\n\nThe problem seems to have been resolved\n\nMeta forum members say customer service originally failed to help beyond suggesting they buy a refurbished Quest as a replacement, but the company has since changed its tune, and following an update to its support page on December 30, is saying the situation is largely resolved. Previously, Meta suggested Quest owners experiencing the issue attempt to reboot their headsets by powering them down, then holding the power button for 45 seconds before releasing it. Now, the company says that step shouldn't even be needed, telling users that \"in most cases, you are now able to use your device normally.\"\n\nWhat to do if you still can't use your headset\n\nIf that \"most cases\" disclaimer has you nervous, Meta is currently directing those who still have unresponsive Quest 3S headsets to a link to get a free replacement. Meanwhile, those with defective Quest 2 or Quest 3 units are being told to \"please reach out to us to get support.\" A few community members in the latter situation have confirmed they are also being offered replacements upon contacting support.\n\nMeta still isn't saying exactly what happened or what the fix is, although users are speculating that the troubled update responsible for the issue is no longer being pushed out. In that case, users who have been holding off on powering on their Quest headsets after reading reports about unresponsive devices are probably now safe to turn their devices on.\n\nThat said, such a solution wouldn't necessarily help those who already downloaded the bugged update. In addition to directing users to support, Meta says it's still \"working on resolving the issue for all users.\" Perhaps a fix that doesn't involve returning your headset is on the way.\n\nUpdated on Dec. 30 with additional information from Meta on Quest 2/3/3S support.",

            "content": "\n\nThis is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.\n\nThe AI agent frenzy was kickstarted by GOAT. GOAT is a Solana memecoin that spawned from an experiment by creator Andy Ayrey when he pitted two Claude AI models in an endless debate. GOAT still sits today at a comfortable $404 million market cap, but no longer dominates the mindshare it once did.\n\nFirst to copy GOAT\u2019s success was the AI agent Luna (LUNA). It\u2019s a busty anime girl chatbot that streams 24/7 on social media \u2014 need I say more? Chat with her, tip her with her own LUNA token (why does anyone do that?), or be like A16z-backed Story Protocol: Hire Luna for social media marketing.\n\nThe Luna virtual companion was launched on Virtuals Protocol, an \u201cAI Agent launchpad\u201d on Base that is the most recognizable brand name in this meta right now.\n\nFormerly the PathDAO gaming guild, Virtuals took pump.fun\u2019s successful formula and applied it to AI agents. Launch an agent token, hit a target market cap on a bonding curve, and pair the agent\u2019s token in a liquidity pool on Uniswap.\n\nWhat Virtuals did differently, however \u2014 and what has gotten investor-types bullish on its token \u2014 was tying its native VIRTUALS token to the cost of launching agents and running inferences, as well as pairing it with agent tokens in a Uniswap liquidity pair (rather than SOL).\n\nWithin the Virtuals ecosystem, Luna faces competition for speculative capital from other similarly looking chatbots like Airene, or more \u201cutility-based\u201d agents like aixbt, an agent that scrapes troves of social media data to surface trading alpha (aixbt is incidentally bullish on everything).\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJust as agents face competition, so too do the picks-and-shovels of agents. Besides Virtuals, a myriad of AI agent launchpads already exist, such as vvaifu.fun, Creator.Bid, MyShell.ai, Zentients and more.\n\nThen we have the AI agent \u201cframeworks.\u201d These are simply code libraries that make it easy for devs to customize their agents and integrate them into the virtual Wild West.\n\nThe leading agent framework is ai16z\u2019s \u201cEliza,\u201d but there\u2019s also Virtual\u2019s G.A.M.E (Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities), the Python-based ZerePy, the Solana-focused RIG, and more. And of course, each one of these frameworks has its own token that speculators are furiously aping into.\n\nFinally, we have the AI investment DAOs. The idea is simple: Deposit SOL/ETH and receive a DAO token that lets you share in the \u201chedge fund\u2019s\u201d upside.\n\nAi16z was the first investment DAO to launch on Solana, now with an AUM of $23.4 million. People apparently really trust the investor acumen of AI agents. Presently, its native AI16Z token is valued at an astounding $1.4 billion market cap.\n\nDaos.world and VaderAI are two upcoming AI investment platforms on Base that have gained steam in the past week. At least six funds have already emerged on both platforms, with about a collective million in capital raised.\n\nGet the news in your inbox. Explore Blockworks newsletters:",
