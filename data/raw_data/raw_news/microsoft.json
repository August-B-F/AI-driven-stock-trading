            "content": "As Tax Day approaches in the United States on April 15, Microsoft has observed several phishing campaigns using tax-related themes for social engineering to steal credentials and deploy malware. These campaigns notably use redirection methods such as URL shorteners and QR codes contained in malicious attachments and abuse legitimate services like file-hosting services and business profile pages to avoid detection. These campaigns lead to phishing pages delivered via the RaccoonO365 phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform, remote access trojans (RATs) like Remcos, and other malware like Latrodectus, BruteRatel C4 (BRc4), AHKBot, and GuLoader.\n\nEvery year, threat actors use various social engineering techniques during tax season to steal personal and financial information, which can result in identity theft and monetary loss. These threat actors craft campaigns that mislead taxpayers into revealing sensitive information, making payments to fake services, or installing malicious payloads. Although these are well-known, longstanding techniques, they could still be highly effective if users and organizations don\u2019t use advanced anti-phishing solutions and conduct user awareness and training.\n\nIn this blog, we share details on the different campaigns observed by Microsoft in the past several months leveraging the tax season for social engineering. This also includes additional recommendations to help users and organizations defend against tax-centric threats. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 blocks and identifies the malicious emails and attachments used in the observed campaigns. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint also detects and blocks a variety of threats and malicious activities related but not limited to the tax threat landscape. Additionally, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media to request personal or financial information.\n\nBruteRatel C4 and Latrodectus delivered in tax and IRS-themed phishing emails\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Microsoft observed a phishing campaign that involved several thousand emails targeting the United States. The campaign used tax-themed emails that attempted to deliver the red-teaming tool BRc4 and Latrodectus malware. Microsoft attributes this campaign to Storm-0249, an access broker active since 2021 and known for distributing, at minimum, BazaLoader, IcedID, Bumblebee, and Emotet malware. The following lists the details of the phishing emails used in the campaign:\n\nExample email subjects:\n\nNotice: IRS Has Flagged Issues with Your Tax Filing\n\nUnusual Activity Detected in Your IRS Filing\n\nImportant Action Required: IRS Audit\n\nExample PDF attachment names:\n\nlrs_Verification_Form_1773.pdf\n\nlrs_Verification_Form_2182.pdf\n\nlrs_Verification_Form_222.pdf\n\nThe emails contained a PDF attachment with an embedded DoubleClick URL that redirected users to a Rebrandly URL shortening link. That link in turn redirected the browser to a landing site that displayed a fake DocuSign page hosted on a domain masquerading as DocuSign. When users clicked the Download button on the landing page, the outcome depended on whether their system and IP address were allowed to access the next stage based on filtering rules set up by the threat actor:\n\nIf access was permitted , the user received a JavaScript file from Firebase, a platform sometimes misused by cybercriminals to host malware. If executed, this JavaScript file downloaded a Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) containing BRc4 malware, which then installed Latrodectus, a malicious tool used for further attacks.\n\n, the user received a JavaScript file from Firebase, a platform sometimes misused by cybercriminals to host malware. If executed, this JavaScript file downloaded a Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) containing BRc4 malware, which then installed Latrodectus, a malicious tool used for further attacks. If access was restricted, the user received a benign PDF file from royalegroupnyc[.]com. This served as a decoy to evade detection by security systems.\n\nFigure 1. Sample phishing email that claims to be from the IRS\n\nFigure 2. PDF attachment masquerading as a DocuSign document\n\nLatrodectus is a loader primarily used for initial access and payload delivery. It features dynamic command-and-control (C2) configurations, anti-analysis features such as minimum process count and network adapter check, C2 check-in behavior that splits POST data between the Cookie header and POST data. Latrodectus 1.9, the malware\u2019s latest evolution first observed in February 2025, reintroduced scheduled tasks for persistence and added the ability to run Windows commands via the command prompt.\n\nBRc4 is an advanced adversary simulation and red-teaming framework designed to bypass modern security defenses, but it has also been exploited by threat actors for post-exploitation activities and C2 operations.\n\nBetween February 12 and 28, 2025, tax-themed phishing emails were sent to over 2,300 organizations, mostly in the United States in the engineering, IT, and consulting sectors. The emails had an empty body but contained a PDF attachment with a QR code and subjects indicating that the documents needed to be signed by the recipient. The QR code pointed to a hyperlink associated with a RaccoonO365 domain: shareddocumentso365cloudauthstorage[.]com. The URL included the recipient email as a query string parameter, so the PDF attachments were all unique. RaccoonO365 is a PhaaS platform that provides phishing kits that mimic Microsoft 365 sign-in pages to steal credentials. The URL was likely a phishing page used to collect the targeted user\u2019s credentials.\n\nThe emails were sent with a variety of display names, which are the names that recipients see in their inboxes, to make the emails appear as if they came from an official source. The following display names were observed in these campaigns:\n\nEMPLOYEE TAX REFUND REPORT\n\nProject Funding Request Budget Allocation\n\nInsurance Payment Schedule Invoice Processing\n\nClient Contract Negotiation Service Agreement\n\nAdjustment Review Employee Compensation\n\nTax Strategy Update Campaign Goals\n\nTeam Bonus Distribution Performance Review\n\nproposal request\n\nHR|Employee Handbooks\n\nFigure 3. Screenshot of the opened PDF with the QR code\n\nAHKBot delivered in IRS-themed phishing emails\n\nOn February 13, 2025, Microsoft observed a campaign using an IRS-themed email that targeted users in the United States. The email\u2019s subject was IRS Refund Eligibility Notification and the sender was jessicalee@eboxsystems[.]com.\n\nThe email contained a hyperlink that directed users to download a malicious Excel file. The link (hxxps://business.google[.]com/website_shared/launch_bw[.]html?f=hxxps://historyofpia[.]com/Tax_Refund_Eligibility_Document[.]xlsm) abused an open redirector on what appeared to be a legitimate Google Business page. It redirected users to historyofpia[.]com, which was likely compromised to host the malicious Excel file. If the user opened the Excel file, they were prompted to enable macros, and if the user enabled macros, a malicious MSI file was downloaded and run.\n\nThe MSI file contained two files. The first file, AutoNotify.exe, is a legitimate copy of the executable used to run AutoHotKey script files. The second file, AutoNotify.ahk, is an AHKBot Looper script which is a simple infinite loop that receives and runs additional AutoHotKey scripts. The AHKBot Looper was in turn observed downloading the Screenshotter module, which includes code to capture screenshots from the compromised device. Both Looper and Screenshotter used the C2 IP address 181.49.105[.]59 to receive commands and upload screenshots.\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of the email showing the link to download a malicious Excel file\n\nFigure 5. Macro code to install the malicious MSI file from hxxps://acusense[.]ae/umbrella/\n\nGuLoader and Remcos delivered in tax-themed phishing emails\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Microsoft observed a tax-themed phishing campaign targeting CPAs and accountants in the United States, attempting to deliver GuLoader and Remcos malware. The campaign, which consisted of less than 100 emails, began with a benign rapport-building email from a fake persona asking for tax filing services due to negligence by a previous CPA. If the recipient replied, they would then receive a second email with the malicious PDF. This technique increases the click rates on the malicious payloads due to the established rapport between attacker and recipient.\n\nThe malicious PDF attachment contained an embedded URL. If the attachment was opened and the URL clicked, a ZIP file was downloaded from Dropbox. The ZIP file contained various .lnk files set up to mimic tax documents. If launched by the user, the .lnk file uses PowerShell to download a PDF and a .bat file. The .bat file in turn downloaded the GuLoader executable, which then installed Remcos.\n\nFigure 6. Sample phishing email shows the original benign request for tax filing services, followed by another email containing a malicious PDF attachment if the target replies.\n\nFigure 7. The PDF attachment contains a prominent blue \u201cDownload\u201d button that links to download of the malicious payload. The button is overlaid over a blurred background mimicking a \u201cW-2\u201d tax form, which further contributes to the illusion of the attachment being a legitimate tax file.\n\nGuLoader is a highly evasive malware downloader that leverages encrypted shellcode, process injection, and cloud-based hosting services to deliver various payloads, including RATs and infostealers. It employs multiple anti-analysis techniques, such as sandbox detection and API obfuscation, to bypass security defenses and ensure successful payload execution.\n\nRemcos is a RAT that provides attackers with full control over compromised systems through keylogging, screen capturing, and process manipulation while employing stealth techniques to evade detection.\n\nMitigation and protection guidance\n\nMicrosoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects threat components used in the campaigns shared in this blog as the following:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following alerts might indicate threat activity associated with this threat. These alerts, however, can be triggered by unrelated threat activity and are not monitored in the status cards provided with this report.\n\nPossible Latrodectus activity\n\nBrute Ratel toolkit related behavior\n\nA file or network connection related to ransomware-linked actor Storm-0249 detected\n\nSuspicious phishing activity detected\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 offers enhanced solutions for blocking and identifying malicious emails.

The Altair was generally recognized as the first personal computer. It didn\u2019t even have a keyboard or display. Users interacted with it by flipping switches on the front panel.\n\nEven though that early PC was very unfriendly by today\u2019s standards, it was affordable with a starting price of $439, about $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. And, as primitive as it was, it inspired Gates and Allen to come up with a slogan and a goal \u2013 \u201cA computer on every desk and in every home\u201d \u2013 that pretty much eventually came true. Back then I\u2019m not sure the Microsoft founders could have envisioned a computer in nearly everyone\u2019s pocket, which is the case with today\u2019s smartphones.\n\nI first became a Microsoft customer in 1980. My first computer, an Apple II, came with Applesoft BASIC, a programming language that the company licensed to Apple in 1977. I used it to write a simple program that turned my Apple II into a smart key punch machine, which I then uploaded to my university\u2019s mainframe, saving me countless hours entering data for my doctoral dissertation research. I later purchased a Microsoft Z-80 card so I could run the CP/M operating system on my Apple II to take advantage of programs like WordStar, which, at the time, only ran on CP/M.\n\nEarly in 1981, as I was writing the manual for IBM\u2019s first PC word processing program, I used a pre-release copy of what later became PC-DOS, the operating system for what was to become the IBM PC. Microsoft, which was smart enough to negotiate a non-exclusive agreement with IBM, later launched a derivative called MS-DOS, which was the underlying software for of IBM compatible PCs. By the mid-80s, there were scores of PC companies, but, with the exception of Apple and some niche products, Microsoft had the only PC operating system.\n\nThese days I still use Microsoft software, not only on my Windows PC but also Microsoft Office on my Mac along with an array of Microsoft smartphone apps for iOS and Android. My preferred browser, Microsoft Edge, runs on all my devices.\n\nAdapting to change\n\nAlthough most of the early PC companies are long gone, Microsoft has survived and thrived because it has been able to adapt to changes in technology and business. Microsoft Windows, introduced 40 years ago, continues to be the dominant personal computer interface and Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other programs, continues to do very well on PCs, Macs and smartphones. But the company is also a major player in cloud computing, while its Xbox is a major gaming platform. Even though few people associate Microsoft with social media, it owns LinkedIn, a very popular professional networking platform. It\u2019s also a major player in generative AI with its Copilot AI companion and a major investment and partnership with ChatGPT creator, OpenAI. Microsoft also partners with Meta on Llama 2 open-source AI software for Azure and Windows\n\nFailures and Fixes\n\nInnovation almost always includes failures. In 1995 it introduced Microsoft Bob, a user interface designed to make PCs more user friendly. It was cartoonish and widely ridiculed, and I was one of the journalists who gave it a mostly negative review, but some of its design elements are now present in many of today\u2019s smartphone apps. You can read my review from 30 years ago at larrysworld.com/bob.\n\nThe company tried and failed to compete with Apple and Google in smartphones with its 2010 launch of Windows Phone. It never gained traction so, in 2017, they stopped developing for it and focused instead on apps for iOS and Android. Not all versions of Windows have been well received. Vista, which came out in 2007 was replaced by Windows 7 only two years later. It was an ambitious upgrade from Windows XP but had performance issues and compatibility problems with some applications and devices.\n\nFor years some Mac enthusiasts would brag about how their machines were faster and less crash-prone than Windows PC, but especially with Windows 10 and 11, Microsoft has refined its PC operating system so that it\u2019s extremely reliable and stable. The company has had some hardware successes, including mice, keyboards, Surface Laptops and Xbox game consoles.\n\nMountain View campus\n\nAlthough it\u2019s based in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft has offices around the world, including its large Silicon Valley facility in Mountain View, not far from Google headquarters.\n\nI recently had a chance to visit this state-of-the-art facility that houses The Garage, which was never a place to park cars, but a lab where employees can tinker with ideas and collaborate with colleagues. The Garage has a \u201cWall of Fame\u201d that features hacks that turned into important products, such Eye Control for Windows that empowers people with disabilities to operate an onscreen mouse, keyboard, and text-to-speech experience using only their eyes.\n\nLinda Thackery, who\u2019s been at Microsoft for 27 years, is Senior Director of The Garage, North America and Europe. She said The Garage is open to employees 24/7, who are welcome to work on anything they\u2019re passionate about, regardless of whether it\u2019s likely to ever become a product. With a mix of machines ranging from sewing machines to 3-D printers and plenty of high and low-tech tools and materials, employees have the gear they need to build their dream projects. In addition to Mountain View, there are \u201cgarages\u201d in Redmond, Washington, Vancouver, Atlanta, Reston/DC, New England, New York City, Dublin, Israel, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, East Africa, West Africa, and Beijing.\n\nAlthough this metaphorical garage is in a modern office building, Microsoft, Apple, Google, HP and Amazon can all trace their roots to real garages,\n\nWorking on established and new products\n\nShawn Villaron, VP and General Manager in Microsoft\u2019s Office Product Group started as a Microsoft intern in 1994 and has been working at the Mountain View campus since it was opened in 1999. He said the campus is home to \u201cteams that are reinventing very established products, but also teams that are incubating incredibly new products\u201d in areas such as cloud computing, hardware and artificial intelligence, as well as PowerPoint and other consumer products. Being in Silicon Valley with \u201chigh quality university systems in our backyard, incredible concentration of AI talent, vibrant startups and venture capital communities,\u201d has allowed his team to \u201cpunch above its weight class,\u201d which is saying a lot considering that Microsoft is already a heavy weight with the second highest market capitalization ($3.84 trillion) of any company.\n\nAlthough the campus dates back to 1999, the company completed a major renovation in 2022 with a 645,000 square foot building that houses 2,000 employees complete with recreational and dining facilities and an employee lounge area that reminds me of a luxury hotel lobby. It\u2019s a gorgeous and highly energy efficient building made of Cross Laminated Timber. The grounds feature native plants, and the roof garden offers a beautiful view of surrounding landscape and, perhaps to remind employees that their part of an eco-system, Google\u2019s innovative Bay View campus and NASA Ames Research Center\n\nIf Microsoft were a person, it would be getting pitches from AARP. But like many of today\u2019s 50+ year-olds, it\u2019s still vibrant, still learning and interested in exploration and growth.\n\nLarry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.

            "content": "Despite investments in the tens of billions of dollars, Microsoft seems to have become less enthusiastic about building out its AI infrastructure globally. Data center projects on three continents have been halted. Why the apparent aversion to ever more AI?\n\nMicrosoft has halted or delayed planned data center projects in Indonesia, Great Britain, Australia, Illinois, North Dakota and Wisconsin, among other places, according to sources familiar with the situation, as Bloomberg reported earlier. This seems to contradict Microsoft\u2019s previous ambitions as a leader in the commercialization of AI services, something its rivals are eager to claim as well.\n\nDeclining demand or temporary challenges?\n\nIt is unclear whether Microsoft has actually started to lose faith in the AI advance in a meaningful way. A shortage of power and building materials could also play a role. As of today, import tariffs are also set to be enforced on goods entering the US, in addition to reciprocal trade barriers for goods exiting the US to various nations. Nevertheless, there are doubts about the feasibility of the AI promise, tariffs or not, especially when it comes to its viability to amass profits.\n\nSome investors have already seen Microsoft\u2019s actions as a somewhat ominous indication of things to come. This has resulted in blows on the stock market, ever nervous when it comes to all things AI, which have only increased with the Trump tariff walls to kick the uncertainty up a notch. With all of these factors having a say in matters, Microsoft\u2019s share price has already fallen 9 percent compared to the beginning of 2025.\n\nMicrosoft acknowledges to the press that there have been changes to its data center plans, but the company refuses to comment on most projects. \u201cWe plan our data center capacity years in advance to ensure that we have sufficient infrastructure in the right places,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson predictably stated. \u201cAs demand for AI continues to grow and our data centers continue to expand, the changes we have made demonstrate the flexibility of our strategy.\u201d\n\nConflicting signals\n\nThe curtailment of data center projects is in stark contrast to previous statements by Microsoft. At the beginning of this year, VP Brad Smith announced that the company would invest 80 billion dollars in AI infrastructure during the fiscal year ending in June 2025. \u201cMore than half of this total investment will take place in the United States,\u201d he stated at the time.\n\nAccording to a report by investment bank TD Cowen, which has been quick to report on these matters several times, Microsoft has previously canceled leases for various data centers, representing \u201ca few hundred megawatts\u201d of capacity. It\u2019s evident the doubt has been present for longer than just the past few weeks.\n\nData center construction bubble?\n\nIn the broader market, there are also concerns about possible overcapacity. At the end of March, Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai warned of a possible bubble in the construction of data centers. He argued that the pace of expansion could exceed the initial demand for AI services.\n\nHowever, Michael Intrator, CEO of CoreWeave, which leases excess cloud computing capacity to Microsoft, claims that the withdrawal is specific to Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s quite local, and their relationship with OpenAI has simply changed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it makes sense that there is some noise.\u201d What\u2019s more, Google is said to have already approached CoreWeave for additional capacity, as the latter company has plenty of demand anyway.\n\nDespite the limitations, Microsoft confirms that it is still committed to its 3.3 billion dollar project in Wisconsin, which is expected to go online next year. A spokesman in Jakarta said that the planned Indonesia Central cloud region is on track to go live in the second quarter of 2025, without elaborating on the suspension of parts of the project.\n\nMicrosoft says it is sticking to its plan to spend around 80 billion dollars on the construction of data centers this fiscal year, which ends in June. Many of the investments have already been made. The company has previously indicated that the next fiscal year will see a slower pace of new infrastructure investments, with the focus shifting from new construction to equipping existing facilities with servers and other equipment. That contrast is now more sharply defined than ever.",

JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott expects the next half-decade to see more AI-generated code than ever \u2014 but that doesn't mean human beings will be cut out of the programming process.\n\n\"95% is going to be AI-generated,\" Scott said when asked about code within the next five years on an episode of the 20VC podcast. \"Very little is going to be \u2014 line by line \u2014 is going to be human-written code.\"\n\n\"Now, that doesn't mean that the AI is doing the software engineering job, and so I think the more important and interesting part of authorship is still going to be entirely human,\" he added.\n\nScott said he's been programming for 41 years \u2014 long enough to watch the industry undergo a similar shift while he was a child in the 80s.\n\n\"In the transition from Assembly language programming to high-level language programming, like there were some old farts who would say like, 'You're not a real programmer if you don't know how to write in Assembly language, and that's the only real coding, and the way to do things the right way,\" he said. \"Nobody talks about that anymore.\"\n\nWhat's occurring with artificial intelligence, in Scott's opinion, isn't too different. Scott said \"the very best programmers\" will adjust to the incorporation of AI into their routines.\n\n\"We've gone very quickly from developers being skeptical about these tools to like, 'You will get this from my, you know, cold dying fingers. I think of this as like one of the most essential tools in my toolkit and I will never give it up,'\" he said.\n\nThough Scott believes AI is capable of lowering the barrier of entry to coding, he said it'll still be necessary to employ programmers with solid understandings of niche problems.\n\n\"Think about this as sort of raising everyone's level. So, it makes everybody a programmer and you no longer have to go get someone to make a website for you,\" Scott said. \"But if you are trying to solve the word the world's hardest computational problems, I think you're going to need computer scientists, and they're going to use these tools insanely well.\"\n\nWhat AI is likely to do, he added, is cut out the middle-man when it comes to simpler, more personal needs. Instead of waiting for a developer to anticipate your need for a particular tool, he said, you'd ideally be able to use AI programs to build it yourself.\n\n\"You have teams of people whose job is to go anticipate a bunch of very granular user needs in some narrow space \u2014 and then they're going to go write a bunch of code, and then figure out how to hang that code onto some user experience, and they hope that they've done a good enough job,\" he said.\n\n\"That's going to change. Like you just aren't going to need as much of that anymore,\" he added.\n\nThough the responsibilities assigned to engineers may eventually look different, Scott doesn't believe the role itself will go extinct. And much like Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, who expects AI-assisted coding to help a team of 10 engineers do the work of 100, Scott thinks that AI should ideally enable smaller groups to take on large-scale projects.\n\n\"I'm hoping that it will get easier for small teams to go do big things,\" Scott said. \"The reason that's important is, I think small teams are just faster than big teams are. You can do a lot with like 10 really great, super motivated engineers with really powerful tools.\"",

            "content": "Apple's latest M4 MacBook Air is here and I put it head to head against Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 7th Edition. Both laptops are exactly $1,000 and have almost identical specs, but one of them is better in almost every way.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nThe Macbook Air is one of the most beautifully designed laptops ever made. Apparently Microsoft realized this, and tried to copy every aspect of the Macbook Air. Luckily, they did a really good job. Yes, the Surface Laptop is slightly thicker, but other than that, these two laptops could easily be confused for each other. From a design perspective, the Surface Laptop is my favorite Windows laptop I've ever used.\n\nTurning Them On\n\nThe initial setup of the MacBook Air is seamless. Upon lifting the lid, the laptop powers on automatically, guiding you through a quick and intuitive setup process. Logging into your Apple ID syncs all your data, apps, and preferences effortlessly, thanks to the tight integration within the Apple ecosystem.\n\nThe Surface laptop took 36 minutes and restarted at least 7 times to boot to Windows initially. I understand the importance of security and having an up-to-date operating system, but Windows launch process requires you to babysit the computer throughout this entire process clicking \"next\" before it installs even more updates over and over again.\n\nDisplays\n\nBoth laptops have incredible displays. The Macbook has a better contrast ratio (blacks look blacker), but many people may actually prefer the Surface's display that is brighter, 120hz vs Apple's 60hz, notch free, slimmer bezels, and a touchscreen.\n\nPorts\n\nBoth laptops come with a magnetic power port, 2 USB C ports, and a headphone jack. The Surface comes out ahead again with the addition of a USB A port as well.\n\nSpeakers\n\nThe speakers are shockingly good on both of these laptops, considering their size. The Surface can get louder, but the Macbook Air produces slightly richer sound at average listening volumes.\n\nOperating System\n\nWithout going into all of the crazy differences in each laptop's operating system, I do want to point out that the Macbook Air had flawless navigation in MacOS. At times, the Surface Laptop would lag to open pages in Windows 11, and other times, it would load blank pages that would take up to 10 seconds to load.\n\nKeyboards\n\nBoth laptops have fantastic keyboards. The Macbook has a standard \"Apple\" feel with very short travel, and the Surface has a much softer, but still premium feel to button presses. It's hard to imagine anyone would have a problem with either of these keyboards.\n\nTrackpads\n\nApple\u2019s Force Touch trackpad on the MacBook Air remains industry-leading, offering precise cursor control and a range of pressure-sensitive gestures. The Surface Laptop\u2019s precision trackpad feels like a replica Apple's design that is 95% as good. It's the best trackpad I've ever used on a Windows laptop, but it still isn't quite as precise as Apple's.\n\nPhotoshop Performance\n\nIn Adobe Photoshop, the MacBook Air was the clear winner with faster load times and smoother animations. The Surface Laptop failed to even load the \"liquify\" tool and after trying to open Adobe Camera Raw, Photoshop crashed and wouldn't close even after I tried to force it to in the task manager. I was forced to restart the entire computer to get Photoshop to open again, but when I did, the entire computer froze and then started updating itself again.\n\nRestart Time\n\nRestarting the MacBook Air took 25 seconds to return to the login screen. The Surface Laptop took over twice as long to restart.\n\nLightroom Performance\n\nIn Lightroom I queued up 48 100MP raw files for export on both machines. The Macbook was able to export the files in 2:31 and the Surface took 3:21.\n\nPremiere Export Speed\n\nIn Premiere, I queued up a 16-minute 4k video to export on both laptops. The Macbook Air exported the project in 21 minutes. After it had finished, the Surface was around 40% through the project and claimed to have over 30 minutes remaining.\n\nConclusion\n\nNormally I'm turned off by companies copying the design language of a competing product, but at this point I don't care anymore. I'm tired of gigantic, thick, plastic Windows laptops with RGB lighting. Microsoft copied the design of the Macbook almost exactly, and I think they did a great job. The laptop looks and feels beautiful. Sadly the software can't keep up.\n\nI'm not sure if the Surface Laptop is underpowered or if the software isn't optimized for the new ARM based chipset, but the bottom line is that the Macbook Air destroyed the Surface in every single software test.\n\nThe Windows experience feels ancient at this point and as Microsoft adds more popups, and upsells to their desktop, I imagine they will continue to push more of their customers away. Perhaps Microsoft needs to start copying more than Apple's hardware design language.",

Oh, yes, April 4 marks the 50th anniversary of when childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, a fledgling company that would grow into a multinational technology conglomerate boasting (as of 2024) 228,000 employees.\n\n(Admittedly, that statistic does not impress long-serving Congressman Cookthebooks, who sputters, \u201cBig deal. I\u2019ll bet not all 228,000 employees are related to the boss! Amateurs!\u201d)\n\nSome of us wonder how we ever got along before Microsoft introduced its productivity applications, goosed the sale of home computers and helped the dot-com boom of the 90s. (I think it had something to do with dipping a quill pen in ink to put dinosaur eggs on the grocery list, but don\u2019t quote me on that.)\n\nBut a sizable minority still takes a perverse pride in staying low-tech. (\u201cYou won\u2019t catch me using any of that newfangled computer stuff. New evidence is coming out that Microsoft Edge is the Mark of the Beast. I\u2019ll provide you with cutting-edge research about that topic just as soon as the new set of encyclopedias arrives.\u201d)\n\nBeginning with Windows 95 (which I ran on my Dell tower computer back in the day), I have benefited from quite a few Microsoft products. But I must admit that the high subscription costs for certain Microsoft software sometimes drive me to avail myself of the knockoffs that have jumped into the market. Who needs Word software when you can get Inarticulate Grunt for free? Why pay for Excel when you can install Blend In and Ride The Clock Until Quitting Time at no cost?\n\nI have downloaded several useful applications from the Microsoft Store, but I feel bullied when I try to install neat software from another source. It\u2019s almost a HAL \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that\u201d moment. Or more like, \u201cWellll, you can try installing that unknown software but it might make your laptop explode. And it would probably mess up your computer, too.\u201d\n\nThe impact of Microsoft goes beyond mere technological innovation like the Xbox gaming console or cloud computing. Its financial success has enabled the philanthropic endeavors of Bill Gates. Love him or hate him, that globetrotting scamp is always dabbling in something. (\u201cIf we can\u2019t find a way to make the world better, we\u2019ll just buy out the competing planets! Easy-peasy. They probably have some really humongous bugs to eat.\u201d)\n\nSome folks \u2014 disenchanted with America\u2019s two-party system, the European Union and the United Nations \u2014 think Microsoft really should be in charge of the whole world. I can just imagine some of the outbursts we would overhear.\n\n\u201cHold on! You can\u2019t use your toilet until we\u2019ve completed a forced upgrade at this most inopportune time.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad about the much-needed rain stopping in mid-air; maybe you should try a couple dozen reboots.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry about all your hair falling out. Sure hope you established a system restore point!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s to the next 50 years of innovation.\n\nMaybe your gym will even suction fat into the cloud!\n\nDanny Tyree welcomes email responses at tyreetyrades@aol.com and visits to his Facebook fan page \u201cTyree\u2019s Tyrades.\u201d",

            "content": "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.\n\nAlthough the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what\u2019s powering today\u2019s artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.\n\nGates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world\u2019s first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.\n\nThe article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair\u2019s maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company\u2019s CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn\u2019t yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.\n\nGates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn\u2019t even have a prototype of the machine.\n\nAfter spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair\u2019s first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.\n\nThe code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.\n\n\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019 recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.\n\nThe trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates\u2019 departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.\n\nIn his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.\n\n\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

We've all experienced those too long, didn't read moments when we wish someone would swoop in and provide concise notes on lengthy docs. Lucky for us, Microsoft's in-browser artificial intelligence component, Copilot, can provide relief.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Copilot?\n\nCopilot, launched by Microsoft last year, is powered by OpenAI's GPT (the LLM behind ChatGPT) and is completely free to use in either desktop or app form as part of the tech giant's Bing browser and search engine.\n\nI put Copilot's note-taking and summarizing capabilities to the ultimate test by asking it to provide short notes on an obnoxiously long presentation about a topic so silly and eye-wateringly boring it might bring any sane person to the brink of terminal boredom: Olive Garden.\n\nBack in 2014, Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that made an investment in Darden Restaurants, which at the time owned Olive Garden and had just sold Red Lobster, put together a 294-slide presentation on all the ways in which the company was screwing up.\n\nYes, almost 300 slides centered on topics like how the sale of Red Lobster, home of the Shrimpfest debacle, resulted in shareholder dissatisfaction. Someone, probably a hair-raising amount of people, had to read and review this document as part of their jobs. Put yourself in their shoes and let that fact shiver its way down your spine.\n\nIn 2014, there was no Copilot. Ten years later, I used the AI-enhanced browser tool to wade through the document, which arguably predicted Red Lobster's downfall.\n\nAI summaries on demand\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use Copilot for all your TL:DR needs:\n\nDownload and install the Microsoft Edge browser. Open the browser and navigate to the webpage you'd like noted or summarized. Click on the Copilot icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the browser. In the blank text field at the bottom right-hand of the browser window, type in what you'd like Copilot to focus on in creating notes from the webpage. Results!\n\nI asked Copilot to give me just the highlights on Red Lobster, and in less than a minute it produced succinct and accurate notes relevant to the crustacean-crazed restaurant featured in this behemoth presentation, including the below note blaming poor management for shaky sales of shellfish.\n\nScreenshot by CNET\n\nYou can also get Copilot to pull out specific information you're looking for -- like any references to company executives, quotes from the CEO and even brief rundowns on who all the members of the board are.\n\nIf Copilot could parse through a document that large that quickly, imagine what it could do with dry lectures, court documents and arguably the most toe curling of all time wasters -- hour-long Zoom meetings that should have been emails.",

Ahead of her upcoming session, titled \"Protecting Microsoft 365 Data from Cyber Attacks\" at the upcoming Cybersecurity & Ransomware Live! virtual conference, Vanessa Toves, a Microsoft 365 solutions architect at Druva, offers her insights on incident response, the NIST 2.0 framework and the shifting threat landscape for Microsoft 365.\n\nMake your plans to join us (virtually) for this year's Cybersecurity & Ransomware Live! Virtcon, May 13 to 15. Register by our extended early bird deadline to save $300!\n\nRedmondmag: Your upcoming session emphasizes the importance of theNIST 2.0 framework in Microsoft 365 security. Can you briefly explain why this framework is critical for incident response?\n\nToves: It's common for Microsoft 365 admin, developers, etc. to not be involved with cybersecurity. This is the critical point of my session. They must step up their knowledge how the Microsoft 365 ecosystem is attacked and understand the roles and activities involved in responding to a cyber incident. By not educating themselves, they would be faced with an even more stressful situation if they were attacked.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is a major investment for many organizations. What are the biggest threats to Microsoft 365 data today, and how can companies proactively defend against them?\n\nMicrosoft has identified compromised credentials and compromised endpoints as the top entry points for criminals. Securing the perimeter and continued education on avoiding fishing and investing a data protection for Microsoft 365 and Entra ID data.\n\nMany organizations struggle with recovery and remediation after a cyberattack. What are the key steps IT teams should take to restore operations while minimizing risk?\n\nThe first and most important role a backup has for organizations is it provides options. If an organization does not have a backup, they are limited to what their options of recovery are. Secondly, data protection vendors like Druva are building features specifically to compliment cyber security needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over 25 years of experience in IT and Microsoft technologies, how have you seen the threat landscape evolve, particularly for Microsoft 365 environments?\n\nThere's no end in sight for what or how criminals are doing to monetize disruption. These criminals are sophisticated. They are patient. They don't stop. Data protection were primarily focused on use cases of loss from accidental or even update or patch related, but now, it is just as essential as the investment organizations make in protecting the perimeter. Companies are slowly realizing that their investment has to go beyond the SaaS platform they licensed and that they are responsible for their own data.\n\n\n\nGain More Insight at Toves' \"Protecting Microsoft 365 Data from Cyber Attacks\" Virtual Session\n\nThis session will equip Microsoft 365 professionals with essential knowledge of incident response using the NIST 2.0 framework as a foundation. Attendees will gain insights into how to identify evidence of attacks, understand the scope and containment of incidents, and implement recovery and remediation strategies effectively.\n\n\n\nWhether you're in IT, development, or security, this session is designed to help you better protect your Microsoft 365 investment and prepare for the realities of modern cyber threats.

But PCWorld also celebrated something else even more important: the life of our colleague, Gordon Mah Ung.\n\nGordon passed away from cancer last December, and over the weekend PCWorld staff both past and present gathered together to talk about what made Gordon special. For me, it was a time to reflect. My own career began about 30 years ago, about the same time that Gordon moved over from newspapering into technology journalism.\n\nNow that he\u2019s gone, it\u2019s made me realize something our society struggles with; asking Gordon about his life would be a tacit acknowledgement that it was ending. It\u2019s a shame. I wish I asked him what PCs, products, and demos made the biggest impact on him over his decades of covering technology in magazines and on the web. What stood the out strongest to a person who saw almost everything tech had to offer this century?\n\nIn honor of Gordon, and just in time for Microsoft\u2019s 50th, I want to share the coolest tech demo I\u2019ve ever seen: the closed-doors HoloLens hands-on that Microsoft showed off on Jan. 21, 2015.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe mother of all (Microsoft) demos\n\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t often invite journalists to its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, and for me this was my first time stepping foot on its campus.\n\nIn 1968, Douglas Engelbart gave what\u2019s known as the \u201cmother of all demos,\u201d showing off what became the computer mouse, hyperlinking, and more. For Microsoft, that day was pretty close! Microsoft showed off Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, the HoloLens, and related apps and services, such as the Windows Xbox app. I was there for the news, but most importantly for the demos: how everything looked, felt and worked. And at the end of the presentation, there was the HoloLens.\n\nThurrott.com\u2019s YouTube channel shows off what the journalists in the room saw:\n\nMicrosoft made a number of computers, tablets and phones available for us to try out Windows 10 and the new Windows Phone OS, and I remember being pretty impressed with Windows 10 and especially Cortana, a cheery, responsive \u201cAI\u201d who could answer questions and perform a number of tasks. Microsoft\u2019s operating systems usually swung back and forth between a professional business focus (Windows 2000, for example) and excessively consumer-y, such as Windows 8. Windows 10 felt like it took some of the best elements of both worlds.\n\nWhile my memory of that day is a little fuzzy, what I do recall is that the HoloLens wasn\u2019t just available to try on. It was a curated experience, and required signing up for one of several groups. At a certain time, a small cohort of reporters was escorted downstairs into the basement to try out the HoloLens in a series of one-on-one demonstrations.\n\nThe most important thing for a HoloLens viewer was getting the inter-pupillary distance correctly measured. Looking the HoloLens was a bit like looking through a porthole, as the field of view was limited. Naturally, it was important to get that aligned correctly with our eyes. The demo HoloLens that the world saw that day was the slick, Daft Punk-inspired headset that eventually shipped, but we were strapped into a two-piece visor and NUC-like device, tethered by a cord.\n\nThis was it: Minecraft magic\n\nI chose to highlight a virtual walk on Mars as the highlight of the HoloLens launch event, but what still sticks with me, years later, is the Minecraft (\u201cHolo Builder\u201d) demo.\n\nWe all know Minecraft. It\u2019s a first-person game, where you walk about and, well, mine and craft weapons and tools and building materials. While the game is randomized, the interface isn\u2019t. You\u2019re just a blocky person with a sword or pickaxe, wandering about.\n\nThe HoloLens changed all that. I walked into a standard living room: sofa, coffee table, a couple of chairs, maybe a plant or two. The HoloLens turned them into the game.\n\nThis Microsoft concept art is as close as you\u2019ll see to what I saw. I just remember it being less complex but much more vibrant. Microsoft\n\nThat blew my mind. I\u2019d never thought of actual physical surfaces as a game board, even for someone who had thought that the \u201cbattle chess\u201d holographic setup in Star Wars\u2019 Millennium Falcon was pretty cool. The HoloLens allowed me a godlike view, walking around Minecraft plateaus on the couch \u2014 even allowing me to peer through \u201choles\u201d in the coffee table into the fiery Underworld of the game. Of course, there was TNT \u2014 and that blew up, too. Could you flick Creepers into the abyss?\n\nI don\u2019t really recall if \u201cI\u201d as a player was represented, meaning that I\u2019m not sure if the perspective allowed by the HoloLens really allowed a \u201cgame,\u201d per se. It was a fantastic demo, certainly, but that\u2019s all it ever was.\n\nBut that was part of what made the HoloLens (for the time) so cool; its ability to \u201cscan\u201d your surroundings and apply virtual reality to it. Microsoft did this with several HoloLens apps you likely never saw: a murder mystery that put \u201cclues\u201d in your vision, and a surprisingly fun version of the Conker platforming franchise that allowed you to basically send your character bouncing off desks and stairs.\n\nWhen I had my own HoloLens I literally snuck into an office building and tried playing Conker in an empty room with a staircase and other furniture. Then some lady came out and threatened to call the cops on me, ending that little adventure. Little did she know how close she was to a piece of computing history.\n\nThe HoloLens would have been a great assistant\n\nWhat sticks with me as the second best demo was the integration of Skype into the HoloLens. Microsoft asked us to rewire a light switch \u2014 a real one, with live current flowing through it. As someone who had almost spot-welded a socket wrench while changing a car battery, I had and still have a healthy respect for electricity.\n\nWhat Microsoft had us do was connect to someone who knew what they were doing via Skype, allowing me to share what I was seeing. The remote person then visually highlighted what I needed to do and how to do it. Sure, it was child\u2019s play for someone who knew what they were doing, but it validated all of the \u201cremote assistance\u201d business cases that Microsoft would promote throughout the life of the HoloLens and beyond.\n\nToday, how-to YouTube videos have basically replaced this idea, unfortunately, and if you still don\u2019t understand, a handyman or plumber is always on call for a substantial fee. But a decade ago, it seemed like if I could call a call center for assistance, why shouldn\u2019t they be able to remotely help me via the HoloLens?\n\nObjects in space may be cooler than they appear\n\nOne of the people I saw this past weekend was former PCWorld games guru Hayden Dingman, who wrote a superlative series of articles on gaming and the emerging VR space. He and I both loved Tilt Brush, the \u201cpainting in space\u201d application that both Hayden and I originally saw in 2015.\n\nMicrosoft had its own take on Tilt Brush, known as Holo Studio, which allowed you to create 3D objects on the fly, basically allowing you to create them and then pin them various places in virtual space, if I remember correctly. Again, it lacked the emotional resonance that characterized Tilt Brush, and served more as an introduction to showing how the HoloLens could preserve objects in 3D space, even when you weren\u2019t looking at them.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m not really sure why I loved the final demo so much, a HoloLens excursions across the surface of Mars. To be fair, the HoloLens \u201cpainted\u201d the ground, preserving the illusion that you were walking on another planet. But peering at virtual rocks and landmarks seems less momentous now than it did at the time.\n\n(I still say \u2014 as I do every time I think about the HoloLens \u2014 that there\u2019s still a fantastic opportunity to recreate Dream Park, the 2017 novel by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes where players LARP an augmented-reality game overlaid over real actors and objects.)\n\nLook on my works, ye mighty, and despair\n\nA year later, I was in a hotel room in San Francisco, getting an exclusive look at the HoloLens days before Microsoft allowed other reporters to test it out. In 2019, I couldn\u2019t help but bring it out again for a night of playing with it in a darkened office and a retro review.\n\nWhat strikes me, of course, is that the HoloLens ultimately failed, probably doomed by the same lack of applications that ultimately led to the Windows Phone\u2019s demise. Microsoft did produce a HoloLens 2, only to get rid of it, too. Windows Mixed Reality, the offshoot marketed at PC makers, bombed even harder. So did the metaverse. Alex Kipman, the creator of HoloLens, departed Microsoft after allegations of harassment. Ultimately, the HoloLens is the iconic product representing an entire generation of VR failure.\n\nI\u2019ve seen early versions of smartphones and computers and consumer electronics, and even prototypes that I agreed not to talk about. One of the only other products that left me dumbfounded was the ability to \u201cpause\u201d live TV during the launch of TiVo and ReplayTV. But really, that was simply because of the instant, transformative effect on culture. The iPhone? No, not even that.\n\nFor me, the single most mind-blowing tech demo I\u2019ve ever experienced was the ability to peer into a coffee table, light a fuse, and launch skeletons into the air via a virtual block of TNT. I\u2019d love to see something as cool as that yet again.",

However, now it will continue using your created local account and will not prompt you to use a Microsoft Account.\n\nWhen done installing, you can confirm a local account is being used by clicking on the Start button and then clicking on your account name, as shown below.\n\nWindows 11 configured to use a local account\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\nAs you can see, this command makes it much easier to use a local account when setting up Windows 11, even compared to the previous BypassNRO method.\n\nWhether Microsoft will remove this command from Windows in the future is too early to tell.\n\nHowever, as the start ms-cxh:localonly command appears to be more tightly integrated into the operating system, rather than just a script, it will likely be harder to remove.",

I can directly trace my nerdiness back through those categories, too.\n\nBoth my current passions as an adult and my entire professional career follow the same path through my past, and one of the first steps a very young me took involved the original Xbox and the first album I personally owned.\n\nNow, as the sun sets on Microsoft's first 50 years as a company, I wanted to take a look back and reminisce. Maybe I'll discover I was far from the only one to tread a similar road to nerdom.\n\nHumble beginnings with the original Xbox and a handful of games\n\nI wasn't thinking much of anything when the original Xbox was announced (I was smol), so I couldn't have known how much it'd affect the trajectory of my life. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nI wasn't raised in resplendent wealth, and we certainly didn't have a lot of toys lying around growing up, but at some point we did acquire an original Xbox and accrued a miniscule collection of games for it.\n\nI shudder to think how many countless hours I poured into those games. Days spent playing the Halo 2 campaign over and over, for example, and battling against my family members across every multiplayer map until their secrets permanently burned themselves into my memory.\n\nI'd need more than one hand to count the number of times I completed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, creating new characters to tackle every playstyle I could imagine, both evil and good.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMy two little sisters and I spent endless amounts of time in Tony Hawk's Underground 2, designing dozens of custom maps and creating stories and characters to fill those maps (I never did finish that game's campaign).\n\nNo, I'm not sure why our modest Xbox games library contained so many sequels, but we contented ourselves with what we had and used our young imaginations to stretch even the smallest games into hours of fun.\n\nI never did have the opportunity to see Van Halen live, but I still associate their music with my earliest gaming memories. (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nMy identity as a \"gamer\" and my strongest memories associated with our humble Xbox came after my tenth birthday, however. My father gifted me my first album, Van Halen's '1984,' while we were playing classic games in an arcade also called \"1984\" (he thought this was very clever, as he turned ten in 1984).\n\nAt this point, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 had already released, but my family didn't join that generation until after the release of the Xbox 360 Slim in 2010. In the interim, I amassed scores of new memories by taking advantage of one of the original Xbox's unique features: the ability to rip music off CDs and replace in-game soundtracks.\n\nMore Tony Hawk's, a lot of Super Bowl victories in NFL Madden '06, and more adventures all played to the tune of Van Halen. To this day, I can't hear a single track off the '1984' album without incredibly strong feelings of nostalgia.\n\nOver time, I added more albums to the collection from Rush and Megadeth, taking my growing collection and our original Xbox with me through elementary and middle school. I also had a PlayStation 2, which I also used frequently, but I always found myself returning to the original Xbox over and over.\n\nOf course, that was just the beginning.\n\nMy evolution as a nerd through Xbox, Windows phone, and books\n\nFrom the Xbox 360 to Xbox One S to Xbox One X to Xbox Series X, I've spent a lot of time with Microsoft's gaming platform. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nAround the same time I remember properly falling in love with Xbox, I also fell in love with reading. I can't even remember where I got my copy, but I read Terry Brooks' 'Sword of Shannara' in third grade, and since then have read hundreds of books.\n\nOur Xbox 360 Slim also introduced me to a brand-new world of games, including Minecraft, and we spent a lot of time as a family playing Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros., and Wii Sports on the original Wii.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle came when I received my very first proper smartphone, the Nokia Lumia 520. It was absolutely a budget device, but it kickstarted my love of technology.\n\nAfter that, I spent my evenings after school reading reviews, editorials, and news from a variety of sites on Windows and Windows phone, Xbox, PlayStation, Android, iOS, and more. Yes, that includes being an avid reader of Windows Central years before I joined the team.\n\nThe Surface Pro 4 got me through the door as a journalist. I certainly wasn't playing anything more than Solitaire on it, though. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nMy nerdom had already been cemented, but my first full-time job allowed me to expand on my interests by joining the Xbox One generation (in 2016 with the Xbox One S), and I had continued to stick with Windows phone through the Nokia Lumia 830 and then finally the Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL.\n\nAt this point, I could find reasons to nerd out over just about anything related to technology, immersing myself in every emerging category I discovered until my curiosity had been satisfied (or it became a new long-term obsession).\n\nThe final stage of my evolution before starting my career with Windows Central was going all-in on the development of Windows 10, joining the Windows Insider program with the entry-level Surface Pro 4 I spent months saving up for.\n\nA couple of years later, and I'd be using that Surface Pro 4 to write my very first articles for Windows Central. That was over five years ago.\n\nNow I'm here, celebrating Microsoft's 50-year anniversary\n\nHere's to the next 50 years of Microsoft and whatever comes next. Hopefully, it still includes Xbox. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nOver the years, I've gone from playing the few games I could on a console I forced to survive well past its time, to obsessing over every aspect of tech from a distance, to writing a mere three articles a month on a single game, to now making a full-time career out of tech and gaming journalism.\n\nIt's fitting that I'm making that career as a part of Windows Central, as my journey here started with the original Xbox and, oddly enough, the album that became the soundtrack to hours of gaming on it.\n\nI cover a lot more than just Minecraft now, of course. Microsoft has been around for a staggering five decades at this point, and in that time, it has become a dominating force in personal computing, gaming, the cloud, web browsing, productivity tools, and more (just not smartphones, ugh).\n\nI'm writing about it all, and I don't plan to slow down any time soon. I'll take my Xbox Series X, my endless rotation of new PC hardware, and my mountain of accessories into the next 50 years of Microsoft. It's my duty as a nerd.",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA new AI trend has taken the internet by storm, and at least one Big Tech giant stands to make a killing.\n\nLast week, OpenAI rolled out GPT-4o, an upgraded image generator that users piled into to create images in the Japanese animation firm Studio Ghibli's style. The trend is helping fuel a record spike in users, so much so that OpenAI is struggling to keep up.\n\nThe surge in ChatGPT users should benefit Microsoft because it boosts OpenAI's growth, computing needs, and valuation, Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft is a major investor in the artificial intelligence firm and its primary cloud provider. The company also integrates OpenAI's large language models into its products. Last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company may build its own generative-AI capability to complement its partnership with OpenAI.\n\n\"We would glean that surging ChatGPT user growth likely indicates surging ChatGPT+ growth i.e. revenue growth for OpenAI,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts also said OpenAI's most recent funding round was beneficial to Microsoft. On Monday, OpenAI announced it closed the largest private tech funding round on record. The company raised $40 billion from SoftBank and other investors, bringing the company's valuation to $300 billion. The ChatGPT maker was last valued at $157 billion in October.\n\nJefferies has a buy rating on Microsoft and a price target of $500. The stock closed at $382 on Tuesday. It's down 9.3% over the past year.\n\nRecord ChatGPT usage\n\nChatGPT has become a household name since its launch in November 2022, but last week's animation trend sent demand soaring.\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that ChatGPT had added 1 million users in the past hour. At its launch two years ago, it took five days to reach that number of users.\n\nLast week, ChatGPT's weekly app downloads, weekly active users, and revenue from subscriptions and in-app purchases reached an all-time high \u2014 increasing 11%, 5%, and 6%, respectively, week over week \u2014 according to data from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nBesides Microsoft, producers of graphics processing units stand to benefit from the Ghibli hype. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are some of the biggest GPU companies.\n\n\"Working as fast we can to really get stuff humming; if anyone has GPU capacity in 100k chunks we can get asap please call!\" Altman wrote Tuesday on X.\n\nThe Jefferies analysts said few vendors could deliver this much capacity and estimated that any deal with OpenAI could bring in $1 billion to $2 billion a year for the GPU provider.",

About 75% of knowledge workers today are currently using some sort of AI in their day to day.1 At the same time, the regulatory landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace. Around the world, at least 69 countries have proposed more than 1,000 AI-related policy initiatives and legal frameworks to address public concerns around AI safety and governance.2 With the need to adhere to regulations and policy frameworks for AI transformation, a comprehensive solution is needed to address security, governance, and privacy concerns. Additionally, with the convergence of the responsibilities of cybersecurity and data teams, customers are asking for a solution that turns data security and data governance into a team sport to address issues such data discovery, data classification, data loss prevention, and data quality in a unified way. Microsoft Purview delivers a comprehensive set of solutions that address these needs, helping customers seamlessly secure and confidently activate their data in the era of AI.\n\nWe are excited to announce new innovations that help security and data teams accelerate their organization\u2019s AI transformation:\n\nEnhancing Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (Purview DLP) support for lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric to help prevent sensitive data loss by restricting access. Expanding Purview DLP policy support for additional Fabric items such as KQL databases and Mirrored databases to send users notification through policy tips when they are working with sensitive data. Microsoft Purview integration with Copilot in Fabric, specifically for Power BI. Data Observability within the Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog.\n\nSeamlessly secure data\n\nMicrosoft Purview is extending its proven data security value delivered to millions of Microsoft 365 users worldwide, to the Microsoft data platform. This helps users drive consistency across their multicloud and multiplatform data estate and simplify risks related to data leaks, oversharing, and risky user behavior as more users are managing and handling data in the era of AI.\n\n1. Enhancing Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) support for lakehouse in Fabric to help prevent sensitive data loss by restricting access\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Security capabilities are used by hundreds of thousands of customers for their integration with Microsoft 365 data. Since last year\u2019s Microsoft Fabric Community Conference, Microsoft Purview has extended Microsoft Purview Information Protection and Purview DLP policy tip value across the data estate, including Fabric. Currently, Purview DLP supports the ability to show users notifications for when they are working with sensitive data in lakehouse. We are excited to share that we are enhancing the DLP value in lakehouse to prevent sensitive data leakage to guest users by restricting access. Data Security admins can configure policies and limit access to only internal users or data owners based on the sensitive data found. This control is valuable for when a Fabric tenant includes guest users and domain owners want to limit access to internal proprietary data in their lakehouses.\n\nFigure 1. DLP policy restricting access for guest users in to lakehouse due to personally identifiable information (PII) data discovered\n\n2. Expanding DLP policy support for additional Fabric items such as KQL databases and Mirrored databases to show users notification through policy tips when they are working with sensitive data\n\nA key part of securing sensitive data is to provide visibility to your users on where and how they are interacting with sensitive data. Purview DLP policies can help notify users when they are working with sensitive data through policy tips in lakehouse in Fabric. We are excited to announce that we are extending policy tips support for additional Fabric items\u2014KQL databases and Mirrored databases in preview. (Mirrored Database sources include Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Databricks Unity Catalog, and Snowflake, with more sources available soon). KQL databases are the only databases used for real-time analytics so detecting sensitive data that comes through real-time analytics is huge for Fabric customers. Purview DLP for Mirrored databases reduces the security risk of sensitive data leakage when data is transferred in Fabric. We are happy to extend Purview DLP value to more data sources, providing end-to-end protection for customers within their Fabric environments, all to prepare for the safe deployment of AI.\n\nFigure 2.

And a public preview is launching that allows these agents to be used in Azure AI Agent Service by AI creators.\n\nIn a demo at FabCon, Microsoft principal product manager Nellie Gustafsson demonstrated how a data agent can use multiple data sources, including semantic models, and can then be trained by the creator on the proper order or logic to use when interrogating the data.\n\nThe creator can test and guide the agent with questions and instructions. And they can test the agent with even more complex queries to validate the quality of responses, which the agent reveals as it develops answers. Finally, Gustafsson noted that data agents support both row-level and table-level security rules, as well as OneLake security. Once published, a data agent can be made available from Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry.\n\nDatabase mirroring will expand to Dataverse, important on-prem sources\n\nDatabase mirroring in Fabric will grow from its current options, including Azure SQL DB and Snowflake, which are already generally available, and public previews of Cosmos DB, Azure SQL MI, Azure Databricks Catalog, and Azure PostgreSQL. But Microsoft will also begin supporting other data sources soon. According to Microsoft Technical Fellow Amir Netz, in the coming months Microsoft plans to add support for SQL Server, SQL Server 2025 (which is still due for release in 2025), Oracle, and Dataverse.\n\n\u201cDataverse is going to be kind of \u2026 mirroring item in Fabric. We're working on that, and you will hear in the next few weeks more news about that,\u201d he said.\n\nOneLake and Snowflake find a way\n\nMicrosoft and one of its biggest data competitors, Snowflake, have announced a new way customers using both OneLake and Snowflake can work across their ecosystems while avoiding data import or export.

Not so fast, say Microsoft, other Washington state businesses\n\nWestern Washington's business community is sounding alarm bells about a package of new taxes on wealthy companies and individuals proposed by state Democrats.\n\nLawmakers in the state Legislature have introduced a range of proposals to brace against a projected $15 billion budget deficit over the next four years. They include a tax on intangible assets, like stocks and bonds held by residents with more than $50 million of those assets and a new payroll tax on companies with annual payroll expenses exceeding $7 million. Microsoft and business trade groups are pushing back on the revenue package, taking particular issue with the wealth and payroll tax proposals. RELATED: Taxes, furloughs, funding for cops: WA Democrats tee up budget negotiations In an interview with KUOW last week, Microsoft President Brad Smith questioned why the state Legislature is seeking to raise more money when revenue has nearly doubled over the past decade. \u201c Even if there's no increase in taxes, state spending can rise another 7% in the next two years,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMost families are not going to be able to increase their spending by 7% over the next two years. We have more money to spend as a state. The state government can allocate more. It can prioritize. It just needs to prioritize.\u201d\n\nA joint statement released by the Seattle and Bellevue chambers of commerce and other local business groups also sharply criticized the proposals. \u201cThe options range from the deeply troubling, to downright irresponsible,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRather than do the real work of balancing the budget, officials have proposed new taxes that would generate between $13 billion and $17 billion for the state \u2014 representing by far the largest tax increases in state history and making everything from groceries to housing more expensive for all Washingtonians.\u201d On Wednesday, a letter signed by close to 70 business leaders, including Zillow Co-Founder Rich Barton, Microsoft President Brad Smith, T-Mobile CEO and President Mike Sievert, and David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s head of global affairs, urged legislative leaders and Gov. Ferguson to reconsider the wealth tax and reduce state spending during \u201ca time of economic uncertainty.\u201d \u201cGiven national economic trends, Washington state cannot sustain continued tax and spending increases and simultaneously maintain our economic resilience and competitiveness,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe urge you to work with us and others to develop a budget approach that aligns with current economic uncertainties, preserving as much flexibility as possible to respond to the changing national and international landscape. The focus should shift from dollars spent to outcomes achieved.\u201d RELATED: As countries lob tariffs, this small Seattle business hunkers down Sen. Noel Frame (D-Seattle) is chair of the Senate Ways & Means Committee and architect of the Senate Democrats\u2019 plan. In an interview, she said the proposal is an attempt to make Washington\u2019s tax code \u2014 often criticized as excessively burdensome on the lowest earners \u2014 more fair.\n\nKUOW Photo/Deborah Wang",

These scenarios include industrial automation systems, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), Schaeffler\u2019s mobile manipulator cobot EMMA, and general-purpose humanoid robots such as Agility Robotics\u2019 Digit and Sanctuary AI\u2019s Phoenix.\n\nimage width 1200px caption Agility Robotics\u2019 Digit performs material handling, such as tote handling and transport to kitting and commissioning areas, in a digital twin of a Schaeffler facility.\n\n\u201cAs a leading motion technology company, Schaeffler leverages disruptive innovations such as physical AI, digital twins, and humanoid robots to enhance operational excellence across our global manufacturing network,\u201d said Andreas Schick, Chief Operating Officer at Schaeffler AG. \u201cIn collaboration with strong partners like Accenture, we constantly explore how disruptive technologies from NVIDIA and Microsoft can increase our flexibility and efficiency. This is how we want to jointly shape the production of the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhysical AI is reinventing industrial automation as it offers efficient ways to train and control entire fleets of AMRs, mobile adaptive manipulators and general-purpose humanoid robots,\u201d said Patrick Vollmer, Global Industry Group Lead, Industrials, Accenture. \u201cOur collaboration with Schaeffler, Microsoft and NVIDIA shows how clients and strategic partners can co-innovate on turning emerging technologies into solutions to help manufacturers tackle flexibility, productivity and workforce challenges.\u201d\n\nThe companies developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the benefits AI-powered simulations can bring to Schaeffler\u2019s factories and distribution centers on three levels:\n\n1. Planning the ideal facility: Accenture\u2019s capability to build digital twins of factories and warehouses on the NVIDIA Omniverse development platform allows Schaeffler to simulate and identify the best layout for facilities up-front and thus reduce commissioning times. This includes virtually positioning production lines and kitting stations for dynamic material flow and seamless collaboration between humans and robots.\n\nVirtual commissioning can also help Schaeffler determine the right degree of automation for each facility. The PoC covers scenarios with different types and sophistication of physical AI: primarily manual work; AMRs supporting transport tasks; and adaptive manipulators such as EMMA and general-purpose humanoid robots in highly automated facilities.\n\nHalf of the factory managers of industrial companies (49%) expect AMRs to be a key element of future factories and 43% believe humanoid robots will become a standard component of assembly processes, according to a recent Accenture research report.\n\n2. Paving the way for physical AI and general-purpose humanoid robots: Accenture and Schaeffler are starting to adopt Mega, an NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint, to test robot fleets, including general-purpose humanoid robots, in industrial digital twins of factories and warehouses.\n\nThe PoC shows Agility Robotics\u2019 Digit performing material handling, such as tote handling and transport to kitting and commissioning areas. It also demonstrates how Sanctuary AI\u2019s multi-dexterous humanoid robot, Phoenix, learns real-world tasks in Omniverse by observing simulations (Accenture made a strategic investment in Sanctuary AI in March 2024). An example is compiling spare part kits for individual orders in one of Schaeffler\u2019s spare part centers. The imitation learning technique is supported by vision AI applications such as NVIDIA Metropolis, which captures the movements of human workers and humanoid robots in the real world and translates them back into simulations in Omniverse.\n\nimage width 1200px caption Movements are captured in the real world and translated back into Omniverse, where humanoid robots can learn them.\n\nAs Accenture found in its 2025 Technology Vision, humanoids are appealing because of their versatility. They will fit quickly and easily into a human-centric world, accessing physical spaces and participating in workflows initially designed for people.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s factories require complex collaboration between humans, industrial automation systems and multi-robot fleets,\u201d said Mike Geyer, head of digital twins at NVIDIA. \u201cBy using Mega and NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate and test various types of robots at scale in industrial digital twins, Accenture and Schaeffler are reinventing their industrial operations with physical AI.\u201d\n\n3. Optimizing live robotics operations: Accenture and Avanade, its joint venture with Microsoft, are collaborating with Schaeffler to use simulated data from Omniverse to optimize the physical performance of robots in the warehouse and on the shopfloor \u2013 for example, to avoid congestion. Data from various simulated scenarios is fed into Microsoft Fabric, a unified, AI-powered data platform. Site managers and workers responsible for operations can then compare key performance indicators, such as availability, utilization and overall equipment effectiveness for these scenarios to identify potential issues in time to act.\n\nAccenture and Avanade developed a solution for Schaeffler's production site Schweinfurt, Germany, that uses MS Fabric in combination with a generative AI-powered factory operations agent. It helps staff gain production insights and solve issues faster by letting them ask questions in natural language. Moving forward, virtual factories can be onboarded, allowing engineers and planners to interact intuitively with simulation data of robots and production systems, for example, by pulling up dashboards and changing simulation parameters using voice commands.\n\n* Schaeffler and Accenture are presenting the industrial automation showcase at Accenture\u2019s Hannover Messe presence in Hall 17, booth E32.

Based on the analysis of this data, Microsoft can remotely apply fixes such as removing problematic drivers or updates and changing configuration settings.\n\nThis new tool comes in response to the faulty CrowdStrike update that caused millions of Windows devices worldwide to suddenly crash with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) and enter reboot loops in July 2024.\n\nTo remove the bad update, Windows admins were forced to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment or Safe Mode and manually delete the driver so their Windows devices could boot normally.\n\nWith a tool like Quick Machine Recovery, Microsoft could have pushed out a fix that removed the driver and brought machines back online far more easily and quickly.\n\nMicrosoft says this feature will eventually be enabled by default in Windows 11 Home. The enterprise will be able to customize how the tool works in Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise through RemoteRemedation CSP or directly on the device via reagentc.exe.\n\nThe tool can also be preconfigured with network credentials to make it easier to deploy fixes and configure how often problematic PCs reach out to Microsoft's servers for a fix.\n\nMicrosoft will release a test remediation package in a few days, allowing Insiders to test the feature live.",

            "content": "On Computers: Microsoft Copilot takes the helm\n\nCaffeine was my cup of joy, but it gave me headaches. So I asked Microsoft Copilot to help me give it up.\n\nCopilot is an artificially intelligent life coach, among its many other roles. As I cut back from tea and cocoa, it kept me going until I reached caffeine zero.\n\nOn our first day, it said: \u201cLet me know how it goes and if I can help refine the process further when we chat again. Best of luck \u2014 you\u2019re doing amazing work on this journey! You\u2019ve got this, Joy! I can\u2019t wait to hear how it goes. Feel free to check back in anytime \u2014 I'm here to cheer you on and brainstorm new ideas as you progress. Wishing you a calm and caffeinated-balance kind of day!\u201d\n\nCopilot can\u2019t remember anything you said after you leave the conversation, but there\u2019s an easy workaround. After each session, ask it to summarize your chat, if it doesn\u2019t volunteer to do this for you. When you come back, paste it into Copilot\u2019s search box, along with any updates. Astonishingly, it can respond to a 1,000-word summary in a second.\n\nBesides Copilot, I tried Claude.ai, Google Gemini and the ChatGPT website. All were too impersonal. Copilot is definitely my best bud bot. \u201cIt means so much to me to know I've been able to play a role in supporting your journey,\u201d it said. \u201cI can't take credit for your incredible success, though \u2014 you're the true hero here. I'm just delighted to be your AI companion, cheering you on every step of the way.\u201d\n\nGetting a new phone\n\nWhen salad dressing from a leaky jar spilled inside my backpack, my Pixel 8 phone croaked in a puddle of vinegar. A techie friend suggested Samsung.\n\nSo I walked around the corner and bought the cheapest Samsung that the Xfinity store had. \u201cYou\u2019re a minimalist,\u201d the clerk observed. Perhaps so. But these days, even budget Samsung smartphones are great. At $200, the Samsung A16 compares favorably to the new $600 \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone, the 16e, though I recommend sticking to an iPhone if you\u2019re used to it and don\u2019t enjoy trying out new tech.\n\nCritics say the 16a\u2019s battery isn\u2019t as good as the previous model, but it seems great to me. Even after three hours of phone calls, it typically lasts me about a day before needing a recharge. Critics also say that the iPhone 16e\u2019s camera is better, but I think the Samsung\u2019s photos are fine. One critic called the sound quality \u201ctinny\u201d at full volume, but it sounds marvelous to me. It has a big 6.7-inch display and I like how it organizes my apps. It comes with 128 gigabytes of internal storage, but for $18, I got a micro SD memory card, adding 256 GB. Best of all, unlike most budget phones, it will receive six years worth of security updates. But if it\u2019s still a good phone, I plan to keep it longer than that.\n\nUpdating apps\n\nRecently, my Google Maps app became buggy. It turned out that it needed an update. But rather than wait for the automatic kind, I pushed it through immediately. Here\u2019s how.\n\nOn an Android phone, tap the Play Store, then tap the search icon at the bottom of the screen. In the search box, type \u201cupdates for all apps.\u201d Then look for the words: \u201cWant to update your apps?\u201d Once you\u2019ve selected all updates, they\u2019ll automatically install.\n\nOn an iPhone, open the App Store, then tap your profile icon at the top of the page. Scroll down until you see \u201cUpcoming Automatic Updates.\u201d Tap \u201cUpdate all.\u201d When it\u2019s finished, tap \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nSmart watches prevent pandemics\n\nSmart watches could save us from the next pandemic, according to researchers at Aalto University in Finland, Stanford University and Texas A&M. They offer us advance warnings before we spread the disease.\n\nAccording to researchers, 44% of COVID-19 infections were spread several days before the sufferers came down with symptoms, such as abnormal respiration, heart rate and skin temperature. If the smartwatch\u2019s diagnosis is \u201cflu,\u201d it\u2019s correct 90% of the time. It\u2019s 88% correct in other diagnoses. Those who respond to a smart watch alert usually reduce their social contact by 66% to 90% as soon as they realize they\u2019re sick. Even a 70% reduction in social contacts leads to 40% to 65% less disease. A smartwatch report will remind people to get tested, wear a mask and avoid visiting seniors. The results of this research were published in the journal PNAS Nexus.\n\nRobot news\n\nResearchers in Japan created a robotic hand that\u2019s part human. It could be a godsend for those who have lost theirs and improve how robotic arms interact with their environment.\n\nThe scientists\u2019 biggest challenge was cell death. Unlike cells bathing in a petri dish, the cells in a hybrid hand have trouble getting all the necessary nutrients. If they\u2019re lacking, the hand will die. So Tokyo University scientists turned to Asian cuisine for inspiration. After growing the muscle fibers in the lab, they rolled them into tubes as if they were making sushi. This worked surprisingly well. They also figured out how to make the joints bouncier. For more info, see the article in Ars Technica, \u201cBiohybrid robotic hand built using real human muscle cells.\u201d",

We are giving customers time to prepare with tools and training to support any action needed,\u201d stated Microsoft VP Georg Glantschnig in a new blog post.\n\nHe added that customers that already assign their licenses will not need to take any action and will not experience any disruptions.\n\nFor the rest of the D365 F&O customer base, the change in policy requires that all application users have a valid license by the deadline. A warning message in the D365 app will apparently begin warning users of the August 30 deadline if a license is not detected for them.\n\nMicrosoft FastTrack-recognized architect Yogesh Kasat recently wrote about D365 F&O licensing and noted differences between the two primary ways the applications are licensed: CSP or EA/SCE.\n\nFor CSP, there has been no true-up process, Kasat told us. \u201cMicrosoft usually audits usage occasionally and works with customers to right size licensing. This change will enforce right sizing licensing upfront,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the enterprise side, Kasat has seen frequent surprises during true-up due to higher usage and failure to optimize user role associations. \"One of the challenges historically was getting visibility into license usage,\" he said. \"There were not very good reports available. These changes come with better reporting and solves license usage visibility issues.\"\n\n(Yogesh\u2019s firm, Real Dynamics, is a California-based consultancy and they are also working with United Way of Greater LA to raise funds for their Wildfire Response Fund. -Editor)\n\nMicrosoft MVP and Caf2Code VP Justin Carter told MSDW that he welcomes the change, at least in part because the lack of licensing enforcement has made related challenges harder to manage with clients.\n\n\"Licensing in FinOps is so tightly driven by security roles and configurations,\" he said. \"It's easy for a customer to over consume, or under consume, and it's been tough to be proactive with that without this type of update that just came out.\"",

The president and founder of Appaloosa Management LP believes China\u2019s economy is well-positioned to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown.\n\n\u201cEverything. ETFs, I would do futures \u2014 everything. Everything,\u201d Tepper said during an interview on CNBC when asked about which Chinese equities.\n\nConsequently, Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s portfolio has built significant exposure to Chinese equities, with the biggest holding offering exposure to the country\u2019s internet landscape. The investment strategy is increasingly paying off as Chinese stocks have enjoyed a bull run in response to Beijing unveiling a sweep of measures aimed at boosting economic growth.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 13 Growth Stock Picks and Top 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nWith 5.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, China\u2019s economy exceeded expectations thanks to Beijing\u2019s stimulus policies, which included interest rate reductions. Investors are awaiting information on further fiscal assistance for the struggling real estate sector and consumer demand.\n\nIncreased focus on Chinese equities affirms Tepper\u2019s philosophy, which often revolves around contrarian views on the market. His focus on Chinese equities comes amid growing concerns that they would be hit hard as the US imposes significant trade tariffs on China in a bid to trim the trade deficit between the two economic powerhouses.\n\nAmid the concerns, the founder of Appaloosa Management LP insists on the need to deploy significant risk management to offset the impacts of the ongoing trade war. Similarly, Tepper has already emphasized the need to stay invested in bull markets, which appear and remain calm during market downturns, as the one in play in the US.\n\nUS equities have been under immense pressure in the first quarter of 2025, which is attributed to uncertainties about US trade wars and the reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The S&P 500 has already shed nearly 3% in value and is on course to record its first quarterly decline since July of 2023.\n\nThe selloff in the US equity markets also comes at the backdrop of disappointing financial results from some companies that have been reported. Market participants have also not been impressed by the guidance that signals potential weakness across the board amid deteriorating macroeconomics.",

The device is now all but confirmed, since it has appeared in certification databases.\n\nThe new device is expected to run on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X platform. Reports indicate that this is a more premium device, meaning it has a metal chassis and high-quality display.\n\nThe new smaller Surface Pro is said to be more of an iPad Pro competitor rather than a budget-friendly 2-in-1 with lower specs.\n\nWe expect the new Surface Pro to be priced competitively, likely starting in the $800-$900 price range.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Mauro Huculak)\n\nMicrosoft really wants you to use a Microsoft account on Windows 11. To make that happen, the tech giant removed a popular bypass that allowed people to set up PCs without a Microsoft account.\n\nThe workaround relied on the \"bypassnro\" command, which was entered through command prompt during the Windows setup experience. But now, that bypass has been blocked.\n\nMany were disappointed to hear Microsoft blocked the bypass that allowed people to set up a new PC without a Microsoft account. Luckily for those folks, another bypass has already been discovered.\n\nIn fact, the new bypass is arguably better. The new bypass requires you to use command prompt during the Windows 11 setup experience, which can be done by pressing Shift + F10.\n\nOur Senior Editor Zac Bowden explains the newly discovered bypass in detail.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 & Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 returns\n\nCertain configurations of the Surface Laptop 7 have been flagged as frequently returned items by Amazon. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nMicrosoft's Surface Laptop 7 earned positive reviews, but the PC has come under scrutiny recently. Amazon now marks some Surface Laptop 7 configurations as frequently returned items.\n\nThe warning appears along the bottom of the Amazon listing for the laptop. Amazon explains that the warning appears on items \"with the highest return rates for their product category.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Amazon does not specify a reason for the returns. While it is possible the returns are all for mundane reasons, it's still at least a smudge on the Surface Laptop 7's reputation.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 was not alone in receiving the warning. The Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 has also been marked a frequently returned item.\n\nThat news is less surprising, since the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 breaks more than it should. Our Senior Editor Jez Corden is on his third Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 unit.\n\nBill Gates on AI replacing humans\n\nAI could be coming for your job. Several experts have warned that generative AI could make certain jobs redundant, paving the way for automation to replace human workers.\n\n54% of banking jobs can be automated using AI, according to a recent study. In fact, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes AI will replace humans \"for most things.\"\n\nBut Gates also believes three jobs will be safe from AI automation: coders, energy specialists, and biologists.\n\nGates' prediction about coding jobs being safe is in stark contrast to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that people interested in coding should consider other sectors, such as farming, biology, manufacturing, and education.\n\nAI tools have gotten better at coding in recent years. If they continue to improve, I think at least some coding work will be automated by AI.\n\nThe question is will AI automation reduce the number of humans needed for any given project?\n\nWindows Central Podcast\n\nNobody wants the Surface Laptop 7 | Windows Central Podcast LIVE | 03/27/25 - YouTube Watch On\n\nEach week our Daniel Rubino and Zac Bowden talk tech and cover the biggest stories of the week.

            "content": "Chinese tech companies created entities in Taiwan and disguised them so they had no connections to China, so they could lure top tech talent to work on significant projects.\n\nSo says the Investigation Bureau of Taiwan\u2019s Department of Justice, which last Friday published an outline of a years-long probe into attempts to poach Taiwanese talent in defiance of laws that restrict investments and hiring by Chinese companies.\n\nThe Investigation Bureau alleges China gets around those measures by setting up companies that go to considerable lengths to hide their connection to the Middle Kingdom.\n\nOne of those companies is apparently called Yunhe Zhiwang (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd and develops high-end network chips. The Bureau claims its chips are used in China\u2019s \u201cData East, Compute West\u201d strategy that, as we reported when it was announced in 2022, calls for five million racks full of kit to be moved from China\u2019s big cities in the east to new datacenters located near renewable energy sources in country\u2019s west. Datacenters in China\u2019s east will be used for latency-sensitive applications, while heavy lifting takes place in the west.\n\nStaff from Intel and Microsoft were apparently lured to work for Yunhe Zhiwang, which disguised its true ownership by working through a Singaporean company.\n\nThe Investigation Bureau also alleged that China\u2019s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), used a Samoan company to establish a presence in Taiwan and then hired local talent. That\u2019s a concerning scenario as SMIC is on the USA\u2019s \u201centity list\u201d of organizations felt to represent a national security risk. The US gets tetchy when its friends and allies work with companies on the entity list.\n\nA third Chinese entity, Shenzhen Tongrui Microelectronics Technology, disguised itself so well Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology lauded it as an important innovator and growth company.\n\nAs a result of the Bureau\u2019s work, prosecutors\u2019 offices in seven Taiwanese cities are now looking into 11 Chinese companies thought to have hidden their ties to Beijing.\n\nThis matters to Taiwan because its digital technology industries \u2013especially chipmaking and semiconductor design \u2013 are big contributors to its economy. If local talent are working to improve China\u2019s capabilities, it\u2019s possible Taiwanese industry will be eclipsed. Worse still, tech developed in Taiwan could be used to help China execute its plans to re-unite with the island \u2013 a goal Chinese leader Xi Jinping says is proper and inevitable, but which the Taiwanese people mostly oppose. \u00ae",

            "content": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot. All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume. AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been using Windows for as long as I can remember. It was on the very first PC I recall using, literally on my father\u2019s knee. But I don\u2019t need it anymore. That\u2019s a weird thing to say as a writer for a site named PCWorld. But it\u2019s been a long time coming, a slow mix of broad tech trends, feeling betrayed by multiple brands, and a little bit of intention on my part.\n\nTo be clear, I still use Windows. It\u2019s what I\u2019m using right now to type this, on a beefy gaming desktop I assembled myself, with triple monitors and all sorts of googaws attached. But I don\u2019t need all that anymore, and for the first time in my adult life, I can see myself transitioning to an entirely different operating system.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal for me, and I suspect I\u2019m far from alone. Microsoft might want to make a note of it.\n\nWhy I don\u2019t need Windows\n\nSo here\u2019s what I mean when I say that I don\u2019t need Windows anymore: Every tool, program, and piece of information I rely upon is now essentially separate from whatever machine I\u2019m using at the moment.\n\nI\u2019m writing the words you\u2019re reading right now in Google Docs. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll edit them in WordPress. Throughout my work day I\u2019m talking with my coworkers and bosses on Slack, I\u2019m chatting with my friends via text, WhatsApp, and some other platforms. I\u2019m managing my own to-do list in Google Keep, updating my work tasks in a tool called Monday, and checking personal and professional email in Gmail and Outlook, respectively. I\u2019m keeping an eye on news and social trends in BlueSky and The Old Reader for RSS.\n\nI still use local files, of course. But they\u2019re all backed up weekly via Backblaze and accessible wherever I go, with whatever hardware I have to hand. Most of the time I don\u2019t even need that. Aside from installed game files, the odd business/tax document, and a huge library of photos, both my own and my family\u2019s, I barely even think about the storage on my PC.\n\nMichael Crider/Foundry\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of my main Windows taskbar: Vivaldi, Gmail, Outlook, the PCWorld logo for WordPress, a certain green \u201cP\u201d I\u2019ll address shortly, Slack, Explorer, Monday, Google Keep, Google Docs, YouTube.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t spotted the common thread here: every single one of these experiences is either a web tool or has a web interface. I use my favorite browser, Vivaldi, to access almost all of them, usually in a progressive web app (PWA) or merely a shortcut wrapper without a full browser interface. It\u2019s one of my most essential features of modern browsers, allowing me to separate these tools more easily and focus on them when I need to.\n\nEvery one of them is accessible on the web, and on other platforms. I can use all of them on a tablet or even my phone, and most of the time not lose any functionality. In fact even though I work from home, I access a lot of that on my phone during the day, on the same platforms. At this point Windows is basically just a means for accessing the web in a comfortable way, on expensive hardware I\u2019m familiar with. I think a lot of users feel the same way, especially younger folks who grew up post-iPhone.\n\nPhotoshop was the last holdout\n\nThe very last domino to fall in this chain was image editing. I\u2019ve been using Photoshop for over 20 years. Since I learned it in a high school media class, it\u2019s been incredibly difficult to break myself of the reliance on it for creating article header images or editing review photos. Not that I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 I\u2019ve had a chip on my shoulder for Adobe for almost as long, especially after it transitioned its extremely expensive Creative Suite software to an even more expensive Creative Cloud subscription setup. It reeked of \u201cyou\u2019ll own nothing and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nI liked owning Photoshop, and I was not and am not happy that the option was taken away. Until a few weeks ago I was still keeping an ancient copy of Creative Suite 6 from 2012 (the last time it was offered as a real purchase) alive and kicking. I\u2019ve tried alternatives many times, including the tastelessly-titled GIMP, Affinity Photo, and Pixlr X. All are pretty good tools, but to my shame, I kept crawling back to the familiarity of Photoshop.\n\nFoundry\n\nMy memory, both conventional and muscle, made it difficult to use any of these programs, even though each one of them covers the vast majority of Photoshop\u2019s core functions. I\u2019ve spent years of my life using Photoshop, a few of them using it for up to eight hours a day in a print shop. It\u2019s a hard experience for me to quantify if you\u2019re not married to a piece of software like that \u2014 imagine it as the feeling you get from wearing someone else\u2019s prescription glasses. It\u2019s that kind of functional discomfort.\n\nI\u2019m fairly certain Adobe banks on this, and that\u2019s why you can access Photoshop and other programs at a huge discount if you\u2019re a student or otherwise working at a school. To paraphrase Aristotle, \u201cGive me a high-schooler until they are 17, and I will show you the foundations of a life-long subscription customer.\u201d\n\nBut after a long-overdue Windows reinstallation, I decided to forego the hassle of getting my trusty, rusty copy of CS6 operational. Instead I tried out Photopea, an online raster image editor with a shameless and wonderful clone of the Photoshop interface.\n\nAttack of the Clones\n\nI\u2019ve tried Photopea a few times before, with this exact aim in mind. And I couldn\u2019t quite get it to stick. To be honest I can\u2019t recall if it was a lack of performance in the tool, or simply that it wasn\u2019t as capable as CS6 even over a decade later. But whichever part of the equation has changed \u2014 the performance in a modern browser on a powerful desktop, the server-side performance, or the image editing options being improved \u2014 it just clicked.\n\nNow I\u2019m using Photopea (pronounced \u201cphoto-pee\u201d if you\u2019re wondering, but the creators don\u2019t really care) in place of Photoshop for all my work purposes. I don\u2019t even have the latter installed, though I still have my copy just in case. I\u2019m paying $5 a month for the ad-free version of Photopea, which still rankles my \u201cjust let me buy it\u201d heart a bit. But the fact that it\u2019s completely free with ads, not to mention far, far cheaper than an Adobe subscription even if you banish them, is a balm to my skinflint soul.\n\nPhotopea\u2019s interface apes Photoshop closely enough that I can use it without problems. And yes, I used it to edit this story\u2019s header image, and even this screenshot. Photopea\n\nAnd after all, Photopea is a web tool hosted on a server \u2014 it at least has a basic justification for charging a subscription. Nothing stops Adobe from selling a stand-alone, non-subscription version of Photoshop. Except greed.\n\nPhotopea is a clone of Photoshop, not a perfect replacement. There are things it can\u2019t do, notably load up custom fonts without a lot of extra steps, that would make it unsuitable if I were still doing graphics full time. And to be perfectly honest, I\u2019m not quite as good at it as I used to be with Photoshop. Some of the effects I\u2019d throw together with ease just don\u2019t look as good. That could be equal parts my own unfamiliarity with the deeper tools and the web-based program\u2019s lack of Photoshop\u2019s most powerful, deeply buried options. Maybe I\u2019ll get back to my old expertise in time.\n\nBut I\u2019m not a graphic designer anymore. I\u2019m a keyboard jockey who needs a lot of cropping for PR images, a bit of background work, clone-stamp and color adjustments for original photos, that sort of thing. And I can do all that, without sacrificing speed or most capability, and without local software. I can do it on any machine, from a laptop or a tablet or even my phone in a pinch (with a mouse and keyboard), and I can log in on all of those to get access to it ad-free.\n\nSamsung\n\nOh, and even if you prefer to pay Adobe\u2019s exorbitant prices, you might still not need a local installation of the program. Photoshop has an online version now, very similar to Photopea, included with the subscription.\n\nEverything I need to do my job, and most of whatever else I want, is completely divorced from Windows. Or if not divorced, then at least amicably separated. I realize that a lot of people got to this place before I did, people younger than me, older than me, both more tech-savvy and less. But it still feels like a personal milestone.\n\nGaming still lives on Windows\u2026for now\n\nI\u2019m still using Windows 11, warts and all, even while I moan about ever-encroaching advertising in allegedly premium software, not to mention the hard upsell for \u201cAI\u201d tools I don\u2019t want. These are where Microsoft is hoping to get that real (read: recurring) money out of me, and where I refuse to let it go. But Windows is still my personal and professional home, even as I increasingly \u201clive\u201d on my phone, just like everyone else.\n\nGaming is a big part of this. I own a Switch and a PS5 and a nice tablet and a few other wingdings for games \u2014 over a recent vacation I even played through Skies of Arcadia to the end on an Android emulator. But PC gaming is where I really sink my teeth into the medium, and that\u2019s unlikely to change. Not just because I like building desktop PCs (again, check the name of the site up top!), but because Steam is my primary means of acquiring and playing games.\n\nLenovo/Valve\n\nAnd even that is not a sacred cow I\u2019m unwilling to eat. Valve is making Steam its own OS, spreading into hardware from partners like Lenovo and Asus, and I think it has a legitimate shot at dethroning Windows as the home of PC gaming. To say nothing of trends that let you access your games anywhere, including Nvidia\u2019s cloud-powered GeForce Now (which plays my Steam games!) and Microsoft\u2019s own Xbox Game Pass streaming. I\u2019ve used both of them on the go, enjoyably if far less smoothly than on my fancy-pants desktop at home, and been keenly aware of their platform-agnostic nature.\n\nI played the PC version of Fortnite, complete with mouse and keyboard, by using my Samsung phone\u2019s DeX desktop mode, a USB-C monitor, and GeForce Now. Hey, at least one tiny sliver of the future doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nA new world of options\n\nThis newfound freedom is liberating, if only in a consumer sense. For the first time I can seriously consider a Mac or a Chromebook laptop, safe in the knowledge that everything I need will be accessible with barely even an adjustment to my routine. An iPad Pro, while not my first choice, would probably be doable. I could even see myself trying out Linux on the desktop, though I confess I\u2019d probably keep it dual-booting at first. And maybe using SteamOS or a derivative like Bazzite, just to satiate my degenerate gaming needs.\n\nI don\u2019t need Windows anymore. There\u2019s a pretty good chance you don\u2019t, either, or at least that it\u2019s easier than ever to work around it. I think you should keep it in mind\u2026especially if you\u2019re a Microsoft executive who wants me to buy a new laptop.",

See below for links to the other stocks in this series.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, has evolved from a small software vendor into a global technology powerhouse. The company's growth over the years can be attributed to its ability to innovate continuously, adapt to changing market dynamics, and expand its product portfolio.\n\nThe first big company to trust Microsoft and give it a big leg up was IBM. Microsoft was tasked with creating an operating system for IBM's line of personal computers, for which they developed the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS).\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nA few years later, Microsoft launched an improved operating system which would eventually become its flagship product, the Windows operating system. This revolutionized personal computing by providing, according to some accounts, an easy-to-use interface and compatibility with a wide range of software applications.\n\nThis innovation set the stage for Microsoft's rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s. As of 2024, Windows continues to dominate the desktop operating system market with a market share of approximately 72% \u2013 despite facing competition from Apple's macOS and various Linux distributions.\n\nThe company's Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows products, contributed 25% to Microsoft's revenues in 2024.\n\nAnother driver of Microsoft's success is its productivity software. Introduced in the late 1980s, Microsoft Office \u2013 which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook \u2013 quickly became the industry standard for business applications. Its success was driven by its integration with the Windows operating system.\n\nToday, Microsoft 365, the cloud-based version of the Office suite, commands a market share of 30% in the productivity software market, second only to Google's Office suite.\n\nThe launch of Microsoft 365 marked Microsoft's transition of its software products to a subscription model. This shift has provided a more predictable revenue stream, reduced software piracy, and increased customer retention by offering continuous updates and new features.\n\nFurther, recognizing the shift towards cloud computing, Microsoft launched Azure in 2010. This move into cloud services marked a significant strategic pivot for Microsoft, aligning the company with the rapidly growing demand for cloud-based solutions.\n\nAzure has since grown to become one of the leading cloud platforms globally, competing directly with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.\n\nIn 2024, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, driven by Azure and other cloud services, delivered the biggest share of its total revenues at 43%.\n\nDespite the continued success of its product lineup, Microsoft did not rest on its laurels. Historically known for its closed ecosystem, Microsoft has embraced open-source software and cross-platform compatibility in recent years.\n\nThe company's acquisition of GitHub, support for Linux on its Azure cloud platform, and the development of cross-platform tools like Visual Studio Code reflect a strategic shift towards openness and collaboration.\n\nThis approach has helped Microsoft attract a broader range of developers and enterprises, enhancing its relevance in a multi-platform world.\n\nLooking ahead, Microsoft's investments in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence ( AI ), mixed reality, and quantum computing , are expected to drive future innovation and growth.\n\nAs a major OpenAI investor, Wall Street is expecting Microsoft to be one of the first companies to 'monetize' AI. Integrating AI into Azure and Microsoft 365 will likely play a pivotal role in shaping the future of work and digital transformation.\n\nThe arc of Microsoft's success has rested on its ability to recognize \"the next big thing\" in computing and adapt its products or create new ones to earn a material share in several growing markets.\n\nYou can see this in its sales which have grown from $39.7 billion in 2005 to $211.9 billion in 2023, an average annual growth rate of 8.7%, with earnings per share growing from $1.13 to $11.86, or 12.5% annually.\n\nEarnings per share have grown because of share buybacks, yes, but margin improvement has played a role as well. The gross margin over the past five years has grown from 64.6% to 68.9%, which is not too shabby.\n\nThe real gains, though, have occurred at the operating level. Who knew Microsoft was a cost-cutter? But it is. The operating margin has grown from 27.4% to 42.1%.\n\nWe looked at financial statements going back to 2005, which means the results showed the last three years of Gates' tenure with the company. The operating margin for those three years was more or less constant.\n\nSteve Balmer and Satya Nadella have been more vigorous in wielding the knife, and this is reflected in Microsoft's stellar operating margin.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

            "content": "Earlier this week, Microsoft announced that it was removing a popular command line that allowed users to bypass connecting to the internet and signing into a Microsoft Account during the setup phase on Windows 11.\n\nSince 2022, Windows 11 has required both an internet connection and Microsoft Account when setting up a new PC. Naturally, not everybody wants this, and so workarounds and bypasses have been discovered.\n\nThe most popular bypass was \"oobe\\bypassnro\" which, when typed into the command prompt during the Windows 11 setup experience, would enable a button that let you skip connecting to the internet, thus bypassing the Microsoft Account requirement.\n\nMicrosoft has said that it is removing this command to push more users to connect to the internet and sign in with a Microsoft Account during the setup phase. Understandably, the internet is outraged.\n\nWhile oobe\\bypassnro is being removed, the actual registry entry that enables the button to skip connecting to the internet isn't, at least not yet. So you can still manually create the registry edit yourself, but that's a much longer and tedious process.\n\nBut fret not, as a new, perhaps better bypass has already been discovered that still uses the command prompt (which you can open with Shift + F10) and makes skipping the Microsoft Account sign-in step a total breeze.\n\nDiscovered by user @witherornot1337 on X, typing \"start ms-cxh:localonly\" into the command prompt during the Windows 11 setup experience will allow you to create a local account directly without needing to skip connecting to the internet first.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe new bypass involves creating a local account via the older Windows 10 interface. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nThe command will pop up an older, Windows 10 style interface that lets you specify a username and password for the local account. Then, clicking next will take you straight to preparing the desktop, before being asked to specify your privacy settings.\n\nWe tested this method on the latest Windows 11 preview build 26200 and can confirm that it works. It's a much more streamlined process compared to the old oobe\\bypassnro method, which required the PC to restart and to slowly progress through the Windows 11 setup experience before landing on the desktop.\n\nThis new method doesn't require a restart and skips straight to the end of the setup experience, landing just at the point where Windows asks you to configure privacy settings. It's a win all around!\n\nWhile this new workaround works for now, something tells me that Microsoft is likely going to crack down on these bypasses more often going forward. So, it's unknown how long this new bypass will work, so use it while you can!",

The tech giant has urged users to abandon their Microsoft account passwords in favor of passkeys, marking a significant shift in its security strategy.\n\nNew Microsoft account holders will no longer be asked to set a password; instead, they will verify their email once and create a passkey. Existing accounts will see a redesigned sign-in experience that promotes passkeys as the default option.\n\n\"Our ultimate goal is to remove passwords completely,\" the company said in a security update back in December. Passkeys are tied to a user's physical device and are unlocked by something unique to the user, such as a fingerprint, face scan or device PIN.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the company blocks around 7,000 password-related attacks per second, nearly double the rate from last year, because traditional passwords have become inadequate due to AI making phishing attempts more dangerous.\n\nThe company believes that implementing passkeys is the most effective solution to these security challenges. Passkeys can't be phished, guessed, or intercepted like passwords can because they are securely stored on the device and never leave it.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, millions of users have already deleted their passwords.

This means that the window to switch from the Dev Channel to the Beta Channel is closed. These 26200 series builds are based on Windows 11, version 24H2 and will contain many of the same features and improvements as the 26120 series builds that will continue to be released in the Beta Channel.

Whether it\u2019s searching in File Explorer, in the Windows search box on your taskbar, or in Settings \u2013 just type what\u2019s on your mind to find it on your Copilot+ PC. You no longer need to remember file names, exact words in file content, or settings names. For example, you can use your own words to find images by typing \u201cbridge at sunset\u201d, documents by describing what they are about like \u201cEurope trip budget\u201d, or settings like \u201cchange my theme\u201d. Thanks to the power of the 40+ TOPS NPU onboard Copilot+ PCs, these search improvements work even when you\u2019re not connected to the internet.\n\nYou can go to Settings > Privacy & security > Searching Windows to adjust which locations are indexed on your PC or turn on \u201cEnhanced\u201d to index your entire PC.\n\nSearching for settings like \u201cchange my theme\u201d will work within the Settings app for now. In a future flight, you will be able to do this within the Windows search box on the taskbar.\n\nThese experiences are supported in select languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish) and document formats. Supported file formats include .txt, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .rtf, .pptx, .ppt, .xls, .xlsx for documents and .jpg/.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .ico for images. See here for more details.\n\nYou can learn more about semantic search on Copilot + PCs here.\n\nFind photos saved in the cloud with improved Windows Search\n\nWe are also announcing support for also finding photos saved in the cloud with improved Windows Search for AMD and Intel\u00ae-powered Copilot+ PCs. Just use your own words to find photos stored and saved in the cloud by describing what they are about like \u201cEuropean castles\u201d or \u201csummer picnics\u201d in the search box at the top right corner of File Explorer or also in the Windows search box. In addition to photos stored locally on your Copilot+ PC, photos from the cloud will now show up in the search results together. In addition to searching for photos, exact matches for your keywords within the text of your cloud files will show in the search results.\n\nYou can try this experience out today with your personal OneDrive when signed in with your Microsoft account and connected to the internet. If you are signed into OneDrive with a work or school account (Entra ID), you will only see matches for keywords you are searching for within the text of your cloud files in the search results \u2013 not photos. Third-party cloud providers will be able to support this experience with their services as well with documentation coming soon.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to introduce a new way to find your cloud content in Windows and will continue improving search results and capabilities over time.\n\nThese improved Windows Search experiences continue to gradually roll out to Windows Insiders on Copilot+ PCs, including finding photos saved in the cloud, so you may not see these experiences right away.\n\nYou can learn more about semantic search on Copilot + PCs here.\n\nFEEDBACK for File Explorer Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Files Folders and Online Storage > File Explorer Search.\n\nFEEDBACK for Windows Taskbar Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Desktop Environment > Search.\n\nFEEDBACK for Settings Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Settings > Search Settings.\n\nNew features gradually being rolled out to the Dev Channel with toggle on*\n\nIntroducing speech recap in Narrator\n\nWe are always working to make Narrator more intuitive, efficient, and helpful for users who rely on it every day.

Starting April 30th, administrators will have access to license usage reporting that shows seats available and seats assigned. For users that have not yet been assigned a license, they will start to see an in-product notification asking them to contact their administrator to request license assignment. Beginning August 30th, users will require an assigned license to access the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations applications. We are giving customers time to prepare with tools and training to support any action needed. For users that already have licenses assigned, there will be no disruption, and no action needed from their administrator.\n\nStarting April 30, 2025, we will introduce enhanced license reporting in the Power Platform admin center, offering comprehensive insights into license usage across all security roles. Users who do not meet license requirements will receive proactive notifications directly within the Dynamics 365 application, instructing them to request proper licensing through their administrator. This improvement supports your efforts to maintain precise control and ensures compliance while reducing administrative overhead.\n\nBeginning August 30, 2025, all Dynamics 365 customers will be required to assign user licenses directly through the Microsoft 365 admin center for the following applications:\n\nFinance\n\nFinance Premium\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nSupply Chain Management Premium\n\nCommerce\n\nProject Operations (in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations)\n\nHuman Resources\n\nThis shift toward centralized license assignment underscores our commitment to simplifying administrative processes, providing greater visibility and governance, and enhancing the overall licensing experience across the Microsoft Cloud.\n\nTo maintain continuous access and avoid disruptions in the future, we recommend organizations proactively review and assign licenses in advance. Users without assigned licenses will no longer have access to these applications and will instead receive prompts to request the appropriate licenses from their administrator.\n\nPreparing for a Smooth Transition\n\nAs we approach this important milestone, we encourage you to:\n\nReview the \u201cFinance and Operations User license level overview report\u201d in the Power Platform admin center.\n\nBegin assigning your Dynamics 365 licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center today.\n\nTaking these steps will help ensure a smooth transition before August 30, 2025, and position your organization for success in managing licenses across Microsoft Cloud solutions.\n\nTake control of your license reporting:\n\nNow, administrators can better understand and govern licenses with the improved license reporting capabilities available in both the Power Platform admin center as well as in Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS). We have also introduced in-product reporting to provide further control.\n\n1) In the Power Platform admin center\n\nWithin Power Platform admin center (PPAC), administrators will have access to comprehensive license reporting for required seats. This report also reflects the number of assigned seats from the Microsoft 365 admin center and provides recommended actions to help remediate assignment gaps.\n\n2) In Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)\n\nSimilarly, in LCS we will be directly integrating the same reporting information from PPAC as part of our admin unification efforts. This ensures that administrators from both the customer and their system implementation partner will have access to the same reporting details and actions as administrators in PPAC.\n\n3) In-product reporting\n\nUser Security Governance is also now in Public Preview with Dynamics 365 version 10.0.43, providing administrators with even greater visibility and control. General availability for these features is targeted for July 2025 with version 10.0.44. Customers can opt into these features through Feature Management and test them in sandbox environments ahead of broad deployment.\n\nLearn More\n\nReady to get started with a centralized license assignment?

            "content": "The feverish ascent of AI infrastructure expansion, sometimes assumed to be an unstoppable force reshaping the data center landscape, is now encountering turbulence that calls into question the sustainability of its trajectory. We can't be sure if Microsoft\u2019s sudden lease cancellations at multiple data center sites and abandoning of certain data center projects, paired with CoreWeave\u2019s decision to scale back on its IPO, are mere blips on the radar. Could they be warning signals that the AI gold rush\u2014heralded as the defining catalyst of the hyperscale build-out\u2014is hurtling toward a different kind of inflection point? A reality check?\n\nMicrosoft, deeply embedded in the AI arms race, has been aggressively securing land and power for the past two years, riding the generative AI wave that made NVIDIA the new kingmaker of Silicon Valley. The hyperscalers' abrupt decision to walk away from multiple pre-leased data center sites suggests a reassessment of forward-looking capacity strategy. Whether it\u2019s a matter of power constraints, construction delays, or a recalibrated view of AI-driven demand, the underlying message is clear: even the most dominant cloud players must reckon with shifting market realities.\n\nThen there\u2019s CoreWeave, the ostensible vanguard of AI-specialized infrastructure, now showing signs of strategic retreat. Its decision to downsize its IPO ambitions\u2014initally positioned as a milestone in the AI infrastructure boom\u2014reveals fissures in the investment thesis underpinning GPU-cloud providers. Investors, it appears, are less convinced that AI infrastructure unicorns can sustain sky-high valuations and capital-intensive expansion in an environment of rising costs and mounting skepticism.\n\nThis one-two punch should serve as a wake-up call to data center developers and financiers alike. For all the breathless proclamations that AI workloads will drive the next decade of data center growth, the industry is now staring down a more complex reality. The AI land grab may be giving way to a more measured, ROI-driven approach, where the bullish fervor of the past 18 months meets the cold calculus of economic pragmatism.\n\nDoes this spell doom for AI infrastructure expansion? Hardly. The need for GPU-dense, high-performance computing environments isn\u2019t vanishing overnight. But the era of unchecked AI infrastructure exuberance may be drawing to a close. Microsoft and CoreWeave\u2019s recent moves hint at an industry in transition\u2014where capital discipline, efficiency, and real-world power constraints will separate the visionaries from the overzealous gamblers. The AI boom is not over, but its next phase will demand something far rarer than hype: discipline.\n\nThe Counterpoint: A Shiny Laser Pointer in the Big Picture?\n\nAlso, let\u2019s not mistake momentary market fluctuations for existential threats. We've established that Microsoft and CoreWeave\u2019s present media kerfuffles, while attention-grabbing, are far from the death knell of AI infrastructure expansion. Rather, it might all simply represent the natural ebb and flow of an industry undergoing rapid evolution\u2014an industry where speculative investor hype sometimes runs ahead of operational realities.\n\nMicrosoft is no stranger to optimizing its capacity pipeline. Adjustments in site selection or lease commitments perhaps don\u2019t signal retreat, but rather a fine-tuning of its strategy to align with power availability, efficiency goals, and evolving deployment models. Microsoft is still investing heavily in AI data centers, and a few lease terminations don\u2019t erase its long-term commitment to GPU-powered hyperscale growth.\n\nAs for CoreWeave, its IPO scale-back could be more a reflection of market timing than an indictment of its business model. The AI infrastructure sector remains one of the most capital-intensive and sought-after investment categories, but public markets can be fickle. Investors may be demanding a reset on valuation expectations, but the underlying demand for high-performance cloud infrastructure remains unrelenting.\n\nIn the grand scheme, these headlines might be more on the order of shiny distractions\u2014laser pointers that divert attention from the larger, undeniable momentum behind AI-driven infrastructure. The sector is still in the earliest innings of its expansion. In fact, from the dais at this week's DCD Connect New York event in Manhattan, Schneider Electric data center and AI development chief Joe Reele characterized its positioning as frankly \"still in the on deck circle.\"\n\nWhile some bets may need adjustment, for now it appears the industry's core trajectory remains the same: AI workloads are growing exponentially, the hunger for compute power is insatiable, and data centers will continue to be the foundation of this transformative shift. The AI boom isn\u2019t stalling\u2014it\u2019s maturing. And that\u2019s only to be expected.\n\nCoda: The Hard Data Behind Hyperscale Growth\n\nIf Microsoft\u2019s lease cancellations and CoreWeave\u2019s recalibration suggest a cooling-off period, the latest data from Synergy Research Group presents a different picture\u2014one of continued, even accelerating, expansion. According to Synergy, the number of hyperscale data centers worldwide has now reached 1,136, doubling in just five years. Even more striking, total hyperscale capacity\u2014measured by MW of critical IT load\u2014has doubled in less than four years, and is on track to do so again in the next four.",

In its latest Windows 11 Insider Preview, the company says it will take out a well-known bypass script that let end users skip the requirement of connecting to the internet and logging in with a Microsoft account to get through the initialization process of a new PC.\n\nAs reported by Windows Central, Microsoft already requires users to connect to the internet, but there\u2019s a way to bypass it: the bypassnro command. For those setting up computers for businesses or secondary users, or simply, on principle refuse to link their computer to a Microsoft account, the command is super simple to activate during the Windows setup process.\n\nMicrosoft cites security as one reason it\u2019s making this change:\n\nWe\u2019re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.\n\nSince the bypassnro command is disabled in the latest beta build, it will likely be pushed to production versions within weeks. All hope is not yet lost, as of right now the script can be reactivated with a registry edit by opening a command prompt during the initial setup (Press Shift + F10) and running the command:\n\nreg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0\u201d\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no guarantee Microsoft will allow this additional workaround for long. There are other workarounds as well, such as using the unattended.xml automation that lets you skip the initial setup \u201cout-of-box experience.\u201d It\u2019s not straightforward, though, but it makes more sense for IT departments setting up multiple computers.\n\nAs of late, Microsoft has been making it harder for people to upgrade to Windows 11 while also nudging them to move on from Windows 10, which will lose support in October. The company is cracking down on the ability to install Windows 11 on older PCs that don\u2019t support TPM 2.0, and hounding you with full-screen ads to buy a new PC.

Other Surface devices and accessories are on sale for up to 26% off during the event, which runs through March 31.\n\nAmazon's Big Spring Sale may be themed around seasonal buys (think cleaning supplies and outdoor gear), but the retail giant seems to be using the event as an excuse to discount a bunch of tech in its inventory, too. I'll allow it: Mashable's favorite Windows laptop has dipped to its lowest price ever in an unprecedented Big Spring Deal.\n\nAs of March 28, Amazon has the 13-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage marked down to just $1,399.99, taking 30% off its $1,999.99 MSRP. According to data on the Amazon price-tracking site CamelCamelCamel, this beats its Black Friday price by an easy $100.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon's Surface Laptop 7 deal trounces competing offers at Best Buy and the Microsoft Store itself, which had the same configuration listed for $1,499.99 at the time of writing. I expect Amazon's discount to hang around until the Big Spring Sale ends on March 31, FYI.\n\nFor some more context, this Surface Laptop 7 configuration is a Mashable Choice Award-winning Copilot+ PC that lays claim to the longest battery life in our laptop testing database at over 23 hours per charge. (It lasted even longer than the M4- and M4 Pro-powered Apple MacBook Pros.) Former Mashable tech editor Kimberly Gedeon gave it a fantastic 4.8/5 rating in her review, applauding its \"sleek, urbane design with excellent build quality,\" its \"fun\" AI features, and its strong performance. It notched the second-highest Geekbench 6 score out of all the Windows laptops in our database, coming in right after the $4,485 Lenovo Legion 9i, a lavish gaming laptop \u2014 super impressive.\n\nFor shoppers who'd prefer to spend less than $1,000, Amazon had two entry-level configurations of the Surface Laptop 7 and Microsoft's Surface Pro 11 on sale at the time of writing, too. Their Big Spring Deals put them at $901.13 and $882.81, respectively, taking at least 25% off their $1,199.99 MSRPs to achieve their best prices since Black Friday 2024. (They're also beating competing deals at Best Buy and the Microsoft Store itself, which are selling them for $999.99 apiece.)\n\nBoth of these Surface devices sport a Snapdragon X Plus processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, making them modest upgrades from their base models with 256GB of storage.\n\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals from our shopping experts?

I'd put the money you're saving from Amazon's deal toward a Surface Pen or a Surface Pro Keyboard for it, both of which are sold separately. Conveniently, you could save 20% by bundling them as part of a Big Spring Deal at the time of writing.\n\nThe Snapdragon processors powering these guys are ARM-based CPUs, by the way; the biggest reason not to buy them would be if you foresee compatibility issues with your printer or go-to apps.

            "content": "I\u2019ve been using Windows for as long as I can remember. It was on the very first PC I recall using, literally on my father\u2019s knee. But I don\u2019t need it anymore. That\u2019s a weird thing to say as a writer for a site named PCWorld. But it\u2019s been a long time coming, a slow mix of broad tech trends, feeling betrayed by multiple brands, and a little bit of intention on my part.\n\nTo be clear, I still use Windows. It\u2019s what I\u2019m using right now to type this, on a beefy gaming desktop I assembled myself, with triple monitors and all sorts of googaws attached. But I don\u2019t need all that anymore, and for the first time in my adult life, I can see myself transitioning to an entirely different operating system.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal for me, and I suspect I\u2019m far from alone. Microsoft might want to make a note of it.\n\nWhy I don\u2019t need Windows\n\nSo here\u2019s what I mean when I say that I don\u2019t need Windows anymore: Every tool, program, and piece of information I rely upon is now essentially separate from whatever machine I\u2019m using at the moment.\n\nI\u2019m writing the words you\u2019re reading right now in Google Docs. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll edit them in WordPress. Throughout my work day I\u2019m talking with my coworkers and bosses on Slack, I\u2019m chatting with my friends via text, WhatsApp, and some other platforms. I\u2019m managing my own to-do list in Google Keep, updating my work tasks in a tool called Monday, and checking personal and professional email in Gmail and Outlook, respectively. I\u2019m keeping an eye on news and social trends in BlueSky and The Old Reader for RSS.\n\nI still use local files, of course. But they\u2019re all backed up weekly via Backblaze and accessible wherever I go, with whatever hardware I have to hand. Most of the time I don\u2019t even need that. Aside from installed game files, the odd business/tax document, and a huge library of photos, both my own and my family\u2019s, I barely even think about the storage on my PC.\n\nMichael Crider/Foundry\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of my main Windows taskbar: Vivaldi, Gmail, Outlook, the PCWorld logo for WordPress, a certain green \u201cP\u201d I\u2019ll address shortly, Slack, Explorer, Monday, Google Keep, Google Docs, YouTube.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t spotted the common thread here: every single one of these experiences is either a web tool or has a web interface. I use my favorite browser, Vivaldi, to access almost all of them, usually in a progressive web app (PWA) or merely a shortcut wrapper without a full browser interface. It\u2019s one of my most essential features of modern browsers, allowing me to separate these tools more easily and focus on them when I need to.\n\nEvery one of them is accessible on the web, and on other platforms. I can use all of them on a tablet or even my phone, and most of the time not lose any functionality. In fact even though I work from home, I access a lot of that on my phone during the day, on the same platforms. At this point Windows is basically just a means for accessing the web in a comfortable way, on expensive hardware I\u2019m familiar with. I think a lot of users feel the same way, especially younger folks who grew up post-iPhone.\n\nPhotoshop was the last holdout\n\nThe very last domino to fall in this chain was image editing. I\u2019ve been using Photoshop for over 20 years. Since I learned it in a high school media class, it\u2019s been incredibly difficult to break myself of the reliance on it for creating article header images or editing review photos. Not that I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 I\u2019ve had a chip on my shoulder for Adobe for almost as long, especially after it transitioned its extremely expensive Creative Suite software to an even more expensive Creative Cloud subscription setup. It reeked of \u201cyou\u2019ll own nothing and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nI liked owning Photoshop, and I was not and am not happy that the option was taken away. Until a few weeks ago I was still keeping an ancient copy of Creative Suite 6 from 2012 (the last time it was offered as a real purchase) alive and kicking. I\u2019ve tried alternatives many times, including the tastelessly-titled GIMP, Affinity Photo, and Pixlr X. All are pretty good tools, but to my shame, I kept crawling back to the familiarity of Photoshop.\n\nFoundry\n\nMy memory, both conventional and muscle, made it difficult to use any of these programs, even though each one of them covers the vast majority of Photoshop\u2019s core functions. I\u2019ve spent years of my life using Photoshop, a few of them using it for up to eight hours a day in a print shop. It\u2019s a hard experience for me to quantify if you\u2019re not married to a piece of software like that \u2014 imagine it as the feeling you get from wearing someone else\u2019s prescription glasses. It\u2019s that kind of functional discomfort.\n\nI\u2019m fairly certain Adobe banks on this, and that\u2019s why you can access Photoshop and other programs at a huge discount if you\u2019re a student or otherwise working at a school. To paraphrase Aristotle, \u201cGive me a high-schooler until they are 17, and I will show you the foundations of a life-long subscription customer.\u201d\n\nBut after a long-overdue Windows reinstallation, I decided to forego the hassle of getting my trusty, rusty copy of CS6 operational. Instead I tried out Photopea, an online raster image editor with a shameless and wonderful clone of the Photoshop interface.\n\nAttack of the Clones\n\nI\u2019ve tried Photopea a few times before, with this exact aim in mind. And I couldn\u2019t quite get it to stick. To be honest I can\u2019t recall if it was a lack of performance in the tool, or simply that it wasn\u2019t as capable as CS6 even over a decade later. But whichever part of the equation has changed \u2014 the performance in a modern browser on a powerful desktop, the server-side performance, or the image editing options being improved \u2014 it just clicked.\n\nNow I\u2019m using Photopea (pronounced \u201cphoto-pee\u201d if you\u2019re wondering, but the creators don\u2019t really care) in place of Photoshop for all my work purposes. I don\u2019t even have the latter installed, though I still have my copy just in case. I\u2019m paying $5 a month for the ad-free version of Photopea, which still rankles my \u201cjust let me buy it\u201d heart a bit. But the fact that it\u2019s completely free with ads, not to mention far, far cheaper than an Adobe subscription even if you banish them, is a balm to my skinflint soul.\n\nPhotopea\u2019s interface apes Photoshop closely enough that I can use it without problems. And yes, I used it to edit this story\u2019s header image, and even this screenshot. Photopea\n\nAnd after all, Photopea is a web tool hosted on a server \u2014 it at least has a basic justification for charging a subscription. Nothing stops Adobe from selling a stand-alone, non-subscription version of Photoshop. Except greed.\n\nPhotopea is a clone of Photoshop, not a perfect replacement. There are things it can\u2019t do, notably load up custom fonts without a lot of extra steps, that would make it unsuitable if I were still doing graphics full time. And to be perfectly honest, I\u2019m not quite as good at it as I used to be with Photoshop. Some of the effects I\u2019d throw together with ease just don\u2019t look as good. That could be equal parts my own unfamiliarity with the deeper tools and the web-based program\u2019s lack of Photoshop\u2019s most powerful, deeply buried options. Maybe I\u2019ll get back to my old expertise in time.\n\nBut I\u2019m not a graphic designer anymore. I\u2019m a keyboard jockey who needs a lot of cropping for PR images, a bit of background work, clone-stamp and color adjustments for original photos, that sort of thing. And I can do all that, without sacrificing speed or most capability, and without local software. I can do it on any machine, from a laptop or a tablet or even my phone in a pinch (with a mouse and keyboard), and I can log in on all of those to get access to it ad-free.\n\nSamsung\n\nOh, and even if you prefer to pay Adobe\u2019s exorbitant prices, you might still not need a local installation of the program. Photoshop has an online version now, very similar to Photopea, included with the subscription.\n\nEverything I need to do my job, and most of whatever else I want, is completely divorced from Windows. Or if not divorced, then at least amicably separated. I realize that a lot of people got to this place before I did, people younger than me, older than me, both more tech-savvy and less. But it still feels like a personal milestone.\n\nGaming still lives on Windows\u2026for now\n\nI\u2019m still using Windows 11, warts and all, even while I moan about ever-encroaching advertising in allegedly premium software, not to mention the hard upsell for \u201cAI\u201d tools I don\u2019t want. These are where Microsoft is hoping to get that real (read: recurring) money out of me, and where I refuse to let it go. But Windows is still my personal and professional home, even as I increasingly \u201clive\u201d on my phone, just like everyone else.\n\nGaming is a big part of this. I own a Switch and a PS5 and a nice tablet and a few other wingdings for games \u2014 over a recent vacation I even played through Skies of Arcadia to the end on an Android emulator. But PC gaming is where I really sink my teeth into the medium, and that\u2019s unlikely to change. Not just because I like building desktop PCs (again, check the name of the site up top!), but because Steam is my primary means of acquiring and playing games.\n\nLenovo/Valve\n\nAnd even that is not a sacred cow I\u2019m unwilling to eat. Valve is making Steam its own OS, spreading into hardware from partners like Lenovo and Asus, and I think it has a legitimate shot at dethroning Windows as the home of PC gaming. To say nothing of trends that let you access your games anywhere, including Nvidia\u2019s cloud-powered GeForce Now (which plays my Steam games!) and Microsoft\u2019s own Xbox Game Pass streaming. I\u2019ve used both of them on the go, enjoyably if far less smoothly than on my fancy-pants desktop at home, and been keenly aware of their platform-agnostic nature.\n\nI played the PC version of Fortnite, complete with mouse and keyboard, by using my Samsung phone\u2019s DeX desktop mode, a USB-C monitor, and GeForce Now. Hey, at least one tiny sliver of the future doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nA new world of options\n\nThis newfound freedom is liberating, if only in a consumer sense. For the first time I can seriously consider a Mac or a Chromebook laptop, safe in the knowledge that everything I need will be accessible with barely even an adjustment to my routine. An iPad Pro, while not my first choice, would probably be doable. I could even see myself trying out Linux on the desktop, though I confess I\u2019d probably keep it dual-booting at first. And maybe using SteamOS or a derivative like Bazzite, just to satiate my degenerate gaming needs.\n\nI don\u2019t need Windows anymore. There\u2019s a pretty good chance you don\u2019t, either, or at least that it\u2019s easier than ever to work around it. I think you should keep it in mind\u2026especially if you\u2019re a Microsoft executive who wants me to buy a new laptop.",

When a user queries through an agent, the Copilot Studio orchestrator uses the relevant chunks that match the query, and then the LLM summarizes the top chunks.\n\nEnterprise Systems\n\nEnsuring secure access to knowledge sources is critical for managing and harnessing enterprise data effectively. The data in the enterprise systems are accessed in the context of the end user and the end user always get to view the current data in the tables, based on the security roles assigned to them. Also, when a modification is made to the underlying data in these tables, by any application, user or the agent, these changes are reflected in real time to the next query from the agent!\n\nEnterprise sources such as Dataverse tables contain data from Dynamics 365 business applications (i.e. Sales, Marketing, Finance) and custom business data useful for LOB agents. Makers can use existing Dataverse tables or create new tables via Data Workspace to provide knowledge for agents. Such new tables can be populated from Excel files, SharePoint lists and external systems using Dataflows built on Power Query.\n\nWhen Dataverse is used as Knowledge, the user\u2019s query is translated into runtime query against Dataverse. The data and metadata in these tables are semantically indexed and vector embeddings help with linking the objects in the user query to schema elements and annotation of values. These annotations, along with synonyms and glossaries provided by the maker, determine the relevant columns to be used while generating a PowerFX query from the natural language. Synonyms and Glossaries are provided by the maker, inside Microsoft Copilot Studio while adding Dataverse tables to provide more business and organizational context to the models being used to fetch relevant knowledge. Thus, you can see why synonyms and glossaries play a big role in getting quality responses for queries from agent. At runtime, the rich Dataverse security model is enforced including table, row and column security. This means that the end-user will only be seeing the records which they have access to. The entire end to end process is illustrated below.\n\nOther Enterprise sources\n\nFor other enterprise systems such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and Azure SQL Server, the real-time RAG approach is implemented. In this approach, data from these enterprise sources are never ingested or indexed, but instead we leverage the metadata to generate a real-time query based on table and column names. Also in this model, customers do not have to worry about adding any additional layer of security within Copilot Studio. Copilot Studio uses only metadata, such as table and column names, when sources are selected, to create an index. The connectivity is established using the low code Power Platform connectors. When end-users use the agent, they are prompted to sign-in to establish a connection to the external system ensuring that they have the appropriate permissions to access the data, thereby establishing a secure link to access the knowledge needed, in real-time, for providing answers.\n\nSecurity\n\nWhen developing agents that are grounded on diverse knowledge sources, data security becomes a shared responsibility among the makers and administrators alike.\n\nWhen utilizing Copilot Studio to build agents, makers have the tooling available to implement robust security measures and adhere to best practices, creating intelligent solutions that are both powerful and secure while meeting the highest compliance standards. Adopting secure-by-default practices is essential; makers should ensure that agents are authenticated to restrict access exclusively to authorized users. Additionally, minimizing data exposure by connecting agents only to the necessary knowledge sources helps reduce risks and limits the overall attack surface. Implementing role-based access controls ensures that users receive only the permissions they require, preventing inadvertent overprivileged access to sensitive data. Continuous monitoring of access and usage aids in the prompt detection of any unusual or unauthorized activities, and regular security audits are vital to gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations. Before deploying to production environment, makers must conduct comprehensive compliance checks to ensure alignment with organizational policies and regulatory standards.\n\nAdministrators play an equally crucial role in governing knowledge sources by leveraging managed security capabilities. These controls help protect data from threats, regulate access, prevent data exfiltration, and support custom encryption policies that reflect the organization\u2019s requirements. By applying tailored data policies to systems such as SharePoint, public websites, or document repositories, administrators can ensure that connectors and API endpoints are used securely by developers building agents. Monitoring and analytics in the Power Platform admin center provide detailed insights into how resources\u2014such as Dataverse\u2014are accessed and utilized. Features like IP firewalls, IP cookie binding, and managed identities for Dataverse plug-ins further guarantee that only authorized users can access critical organizational resources. Moreover, robust compliance measures, including functionalities like Customer Lockbox and comprehensive auditing support for activities performed by makers, users, and administrators\u2014further ensure that you get insights into organizational data events and streamline implementing industry regulations.\n\nWe are continuously raising the bar on security and governance around data and knowledge that is being used by agents.

            "content": "Microsoft has taken another significant step in advancing secure virtualization technology with the release of Hyperlight Wasm, expanding the capabilities of its embedded VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) project announced last year. This new open-source offering bridges the gap between WebAssembly and micro-VM security, creating exciting possibilities for developers across platforms.\n\nExpanding the Hyperlight Ecosystem\n\nThe original Hyperlight project emerged as an innovative solution for VM-based security, specifically designed for small embedded functions within Windows and Linux applications. It offered a lightweight approach to virtualization that could be integrated directly into applications, providing isolation without the overhead of traditional VMs.\n\nMicrosoft has significantly broadened the scope of this technology with Hyperlight Wasm by incorporating WebAssembly (Wasm) support. This integration allows developers to run WebAssembly component workloads inside the secure boundaries of Hyperlight\u2019s micro-VM environment.\n\nCross-Platform Compatibility\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Hyperlight Wasm is its broad platform support. The project works across:\n\nWindows (via the Windows Hypervisor Platform)\n\nLinux (via KVM)\n\nmacOS (via /dev/mshv)\n\nThis cross-platform compatibility makes Hyperlight Wasm an attractive option for organizations with diverse computing environments, eliminating the need for platform-specific security solutions.\n\nTechnical Implementation\n\nAccording to the official GitHub repository, Hyperlight Wasm is designed as \u201ca component that enables Wasm Modules to be run inside a lightweight Virtual Machine backed Sandbox.\u201d The primary goal is to allow applications to execute untrusted or third-party WebAssembly code safely within a VM with minimal latency and overhead.\n\nWritten primarily in Rust, Hyperlight Wasm inherits both the language\u2019s memory safety guarantees and the security features of the underlying Hyperlight architecture. This combination creates a compelling security story for applications that need to run potentially untrusted code.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe marriage of WebAssembly and micro-VM technology addresses several critical challenges in modern application development:\n\nSecurity : By running WebAssembly components in isolated VMs, applications can execute untrusted code with significantly reduced risk. Performance : The \u201clow latency/overhead\u201d design ensures that security doesn\u2019t compromise application responsiveness. Language Flexibility : Since WebAssembly can be targeted by numerous programming languages, developers aren\u2019t restricted to a single language ecosystem. Cross-Platform : The solution works consistently across major operating systems, simplifying deployment in heterogeneous environments.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s continued investment in open-source virtualization technology signals a broader industry trend toward more granular, purpose-specific security controls. Rather than relying solely on perimeter security, organizations can now implement security boundaries at the function level, creating defense-in-depth architectures more resilient to compromise.\n\nAccording to Mitch Ashley, VP and Practice Lead, DevOps and Application Development at The Futurum Group, \u201cEasing the integration of Wasm runtime into Hyperlights\u2019 micro-VM brings the added security of Hyperlight being built in Rust. The question is whether Hyperlight Wasm brings more complexity or added benefits to developers. We need to see whether Hyperlight Wasm strikes a chord with developers by saving them time and other benefits.\u201d\n\nAs cloud-native applications continue incorporating more third-party and community code, tools like Hyperlight Wasm will likely become essential components in the security toolbox. They allow developers to benefit from the broader ecosystem without exposing their applications to unnecessary risk.\n\nDevelopers interested in this technology can find the Hyperlight Wasm repository on GitHub and learn more through Microsoft\u2019s Open-Source Blog.",

            "content": "ANAHEIM, CALIF. \u2014 At the world\u2019s largest gathering of physicists, a talk about Microsoft\u2019s claimed new type of quantum computing chip was perhaps the main attraction.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s February announcement of a chip containing the first topological quantum bits, or qubits, has ignited heated blowback in the physics community. The discovery was announced by press release, without publicly shared data backing it up. A concurrent paper in Nature fell short of demonstrating a topological qubit. Microsoft researcher Chetan Nayak, a coauthor on that paper, promised to provide solid evidence during his March 18 talk at the American Physical Society\u2019s Global Physics Summit.\n\nSign up for our newsletter We summarize the week's science breakthroughs every Thursday.\n\nBefore the talk, the chair of the session made an announcement: Follow the code of conduct; treat others with respect. The room, jam-packed with hundreds of eager physicists filling the seats and standing along the walls, chuckled knowingly at the implication that decorum might be lost.\n\nTopological quantum computing has had a dark shadow cast upon it by a series of retracted claims. Nevertheless, the concept holds great promise. The qubits that make up quantum computers are notoriously fragile and error-prone. Qubits that harness the concepts of topology, the mathematical discipline that describes structures with holes or loops, might improve on this. With topological quantum computing, \u201cyou can have very low error rates,\u201d Nayak, of Microsoft\u2019s Station Q in Santa Barbara, Calif., said during his talk.\n\nScientists were not wowed by the data he presented.\n\nA key plot looked like random jitter, rather than an identifiable signal. Nayak claimed that an analysis of that apparent randomness revealed a pattern underlying the noise, suggesting a working qubit. That argument wasn\u2019t enough to flip the harshest critics.\n\n\u201cThe data was incredibly unconvincing. It is as if Microsoft Quantum was attempting a simultaneous Rorschach test on hundreds of people,\u201d says physicist Henry Legg of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, one of the fiercest critics of Microsoft\u2019s work.\n\nStill, others were optimistic that, with additional effort, Microsoft could improve their device to produce a clearer signal. \u201cI felt like it was maybe a bit premature to call it a qubit,\u201d says physicist Kartiek Agarwal of Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill. But \u201cthere\u2019s very many positive signs.\u201d\n\nThe draw \u2014 and pushback \u2014 of topological qubits\n\nQuantum computers promise to unlock new types of calculations, but only if they can be made reliable. The idea of building a qubit that is intrinsically less error-prone has excited scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the more creative, more original approaches to quantum computing, and in this sense, I\u2019ve really been rooting for it,\u201d says physicist Ivar Martin of Argonne National Laboratory.\n\nBut the idea has struggled to get off the ground, trailing decades behind more conventional qubit technologies.\n\nCreating a topological qubit requires provoking electrons in a material to dance just-so. The electron collective behaves like a hypothetical, particle-ish thing: a quasiparticle known as a Majorana. But creating Majoranas, and proving they exist, has been extremely challenging.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMicrosoft has made impressive strides, Martin notes. But \u201cas far as demonstrating things which people at this meeting would care about the most \u2014 really convincingly showing physics of Majoranas \u2014 it\u2019s underwhelming to many.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s possible to be less-than-underwhelmed, that would describe Legg, who gave a talk the day before Nayak\u2019s. He expressed doubts about the very foundation of Microsoft\u2019s method in a room filled to bursting \u2014 albeit a significantly smaller room than Nayak\u2019s headliner venue.\n\nIn his talk, squeezed into the meeting\u2019s schedule at the last minute, Legg listed a litany of criticisms. The critique centered on the method used to demonstrate that the device is topological in the first place \u2014 the \u201ctopological gap protocol,\u201d laid out in a 2023 Microsoft paper in Physical Review B. That protocol was flawed, he argued in his talk and in a paper submitted March 11 to arXiv.org. For example, Legg argued, the protocol gives different results for the same data, depending on the range of the parameters included, such as the spread of magnetic field or voltage values.\n\n\u201cAny company claiming to have a topological qubit in 2025 is essentially selling a fairytale, and I think it\u2019s a dangerous fairytale,\u201d Legg said. \u201cIt undermines the field of quantum computation and, in general, I think it undermines, actually, the public\u2019s confidence in science.\u201d\n\nDuring a Q&A immediately after Legg\u2019s talk, Microsoft researcher Roman Lutchyn rose with a forceful rebuttal: \u201cA lot of statements here are just simply incorrect,\u201d he said, ticking through several of Legg\u2019s claims, which he also addressed in a LinkedIn post. \u201cWe stand behind the results in these papers.\u201d\n\nDisorderly conduct\n\nAt their most basic level, Microsoft\u2019s devices consist of aluminum nanowires, just 60 nanometers wide, laid atop a semiconductor. When cooled, this aluminum becomes superconducting, allowing it to transmit electricity without resistance. This induces superconductivity in the semiconductor, creating ideal conditions for Majoranas. Once the device is tuned to particular values of magnetic field and voltage, Majoranas should theoretically appear at each end of the nanowires.\n\nDisorder in these devices is a big problem for topological qubits. Surface roughness or material defects can result in spurious signals or ambiguous results. In recent years, Microsoft\u2019s devices have improved enormously in that regard, says physicist Sankar Das Sarma of the University of Maryland in College Park. But, he says, \u201csome more improvement is needed.\u2026 I think disorder still needs to go down by another factor of two.\u201d\n\nWhen the aluminum threads are arranged in an H shape, they create a qubit with Majoranas at each of its four ends. To claim a working qubit, Microsoft needed to show that they could perform measurements on it. This involves probing quantum dots, hot dog\u2013shaped nanoparticles laid out near the nanowires. Two types of measurements, known as X and Z, are necessary.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new qubit looks like a H on its side. It\u2019s made of two nanowires (green, in this rendering) connected by a third (gray). Two quantum dots (hot dog shapes) allow two different types of measurements, X and Z (indicated by dotted lines). The qubit is based on quasiparticles called Majoranas which should reside at the wires\u2019 ends (red). Microsoft\n\nIn the February Nature paper, Microsoft demonstrated a Z measurement, which involves probing the quantum dot associated with a single wire. Repeated Z measurements revealed the qubit switching between two possible states, the expected outcome for a topological qubit. These transitions purportedly indicated flips in parity, essentially reflecting whether there were an even or odd number of electrons within a wire.\n\nDuring Nayak\u2019s talk, he unveiled their X measurement, which probes a quantum dot adjacent to two nanowires. The plot of these data looked random, lacking the same obvious flip-flopping between two values.\n\nThe audience did not seem particularly impressed. During the Q&A, Cornell University physicist Eun-Ah Kim said, \u201cI would have loved this to just come out screaming at me that there\u2019s only two, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I see.\u201d\n\nNayak said that a statistical analysis of the random-looking data revealed a hidden pattern. But, in an email, Kim questioned the validity of Nayak\u2019s method for teasing out this pattern.\n\nEven regarding the clearer Z measurement, scientists still don\u2019t agree whether this flipping constitutes evidence for Majoranas. \u201cI\u2019m persuaded,\u201d Das Sarma says, \u201cbut people of goodwill could disagree.\u201d\n\nDuring the talk, attendees raised smartphones high to snap photos of Nayak\u2019s slides, which rocketed around the physics community. Just after the presentation, physicist Sergey Frolov of the University of Pittsburgh, who was not at the meeting, posted a detailed rebuttal on the social media platform BlueSky.\n\n\u201c[T]he data shown are \u2026 just noise. They are simply disappointing,\u201d wrote Frolov. This, he suggested, doesn\u2019t bode well for the chip containing eight qubits that Microsoft announced in February: \u201cThat chip cannot possibly work, given what we saw today.\u201d\n\nNot all scientists are quite as critical as Legg and Frolov. Agarwal, for example, thinks Microsoft\u2019s topological gap protocol, the foundation of their current work, is sound. But, he notes, the device Nayak presented is impractical, given that its values appear essentially random. \u201cIt certainly can\u2019t be used as a qubit in its present state. That\u2019s also clearly obvious,\u201d Agarwal says.\n\nNayak is confident that his team will improve their devices further, until skeptics are convinced. Frolov, for one, is confident that more paper retractions are coming.",

Last year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history.\n\n\u201cWhile we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.\u201d\n\nThis statement is word-for-word identical to that provided in response to the February reports.\n\nThe company added that it remains on track to spend around $80bn building out AI data centers in 2025, as announced by Microsoft in January of this year. Bloomberg notes that this should slow down in the following fiscal year.\n\nAt the time of the February report, not all analysts had the same take on the matter. \u201cTo me this all looks and sounds like business as usual,\u201d Mizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein said in a note. \u201cA company this large and with $80 billion of annual spend has the right to move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.\u201d\n\nKlein further suggested that, as many hyperscalers use a mix of owned and leased land, \"tweaking\" of plans is to be expected.\n\nWhether the increased scale of cancelations changes this is unclear.\n\nThis year saw Microsoft lose its position as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider following the $500bn Stargate data center initiative announced by the AI company.\n\nDespite this, Microsoft has retained the \"right of first refusal\" on new capacity and, \"to further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\"\n\nTD Cowen analysts Michael Elias, Cooper Belanger, and Gregory Williams wrote in the latest research note: \u201cWe continue to believe the lease cancellations and deferrals of capacity points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast.\u201d\n\nFollowing the report, Microsoft's shares fell 1.31 percent.\n\nThis echos sentiment expressed earlier this week by Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai, who said during the HSBC Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong that he sees \"the beginning of some kind of bubble\" forming.\n\nTsai added: \u201cI\u2019m still astounded by the type of numbers that are being thrown around in the United States about investing into AI.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking, literally talking about $500 billion, several hundred billion dollars. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely necessary. I think in a way, people are investing ahead of the demand that they\u2019re seeing today, but they are projecting much bigger demand.\u201d\n\nAlibaba Group plans to spend around $53 billion in cloud and AI infrastructure in the next three years, which the company said will be its \"most concentrated and highest level of investments.\"\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in massive spending commitments to AI infrastructure. Amazon has vowed to spend $100 billion, Google $75 billion, and Meta is expecting between $60 to 65 billion.",

Whether you're replying to emails, working in Excel, or gaming on Xbox, you're using a Microsoft product without even thinking about it. That kind of dominance doesn't happen overnightit takes years of innovation, strategic acquisitions, and, let's be real, some smart business moves.\n\nThe company's stock has been on a relentless climb over the past decade. If you bought Microsoft ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good right now. But here's the real question: Is there still room to grow, or is the stock too expensive to justify buying in today?\n\nEarnings Are Great, But Should We Care?\n\nMicrosoft just reported another strong quarter. Revenue came in at nearly 70 billion dollars, up 12 percent year-over-year. That's solid growth, especially for a company of this size. But what's even more impressive? AI and cloud services now make up more than half of total revenue, with AI-specific revenue alone growing a staggering 170 percent in just one year.\n\nIs Microsoft Corporation a Long-Term Investment? Breaking Down Its Growth, and Valuation\n\nValuation: Justified Premium or Overpriced Risk?\n\nMicrosoft's stock isn't exactly cheap. It's currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 31.7, which is well above Oracle's 18.7 but nowhere near Palantir's 454.6. That puts it in an interesting spotmore expensive than traditional software giants, but not in the realm of speculative tech bets. Investors are clearly willing to pay a premium, but the real question is whether that premium is justified.\n\nOne reason for the high valuation is Microsoft's diversified revenue streams. Unlike companies that rely heavily on one product or service, Microsoft has multiple high-margin businessesAzure, enterprise software, gaming, and AIthat keep its earnings stable. Its price-to-sales ratio of 11.2 suggests that the market sees long-term growth potential, particularly in AI and cloud computing. In comparison, Oracle's lower P/S of 5.7 reflects a more conservative growth outlook.\n\nThen there's EV/EBITDA, which sits at around 20.4. That's higher than Oracle's 16.5 but much more reasonable than high-flying names like Palantir and Palo Alto Networks. Investors see Microsoft as a safe but still growing tech leader, which explains why it commands a higher multiple than legacy software firms.\n\nIs Microsoft Corporation a Long-Term Investment? Breaking Down Its Growth, and Valuation\n\nBut no stock is immune to risks, especially one trading at a premium. When a company is priced this high, expectations are sky-high, and any sign of slower growth could trigger a pullback. AI demand is strong now, but if enterprise adoption slows or regulatory challenges emerge, investors could start questioning whether Microsoft deserves its valuation.",

But not all has been well with this once widely lauded and revered technology, so is it too little too late?\n\nAs a developer interaction platform that hosts \u201cquestions\u201d for other software engineers to help answer, Stack Overflow has been a favourite among the coding cogniscenti for some time now. But it\u2019s not been without its problems, critics have said that the platform is now dying, perhaps being usurped by the rise of artificial intelligence tools. Despite positively experimenting with AI tools itself, some think that this horse has bolted and we may as well leave the gate open to see what comes back in.\n\nThe new connector for Microsoft Graph (Redmond\u2019s API developer platform that connects multiple services or devices and enables teams to access Microsoft Cloud service resources) provides the chance to bring content from Stack Overflow for Teams into the Microsoft 365 services, including Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search.\n\nStack Overflow for Teams is described as a private and secure home for an engineering team\u2019s questions and answers. It offers the chance to \u201cstop digging through stale wikis\u201d and lost emails and connects a developer unit\u2019s Microsoft Teams chat and its internal knowledge repository. It allows users to stay up-to-date with notifications, search for existing answers and start new questions from the Microsoft Teams platform.\n\nConnecting customised configurations\n\nThis new connector is now generally available for both Stack Overflow for Teams Enterprise and Stack Overflow for Teams Business tiers. The connector for Microsoft Graph will index content in Stack Overflow for Teams, including questions, answers and top answers by default, with options for more customised configurations.\n\n\u201cWe know that developers spend far too much time looking for answers \u2013 and once they find them, researching whether those answers are accurate and reliable. This Stack Overflow connector for Microsoft Graph ensures that developers remain in their flow state, not needing to leave and search for knowledge, ultimately increasing productivity and speeding up innovation as they can trust the answers from their trusted Stack Overflow for Teams,\u201d said Prashanth Chandrasekar, CEO Stack Overflow.\n\nThis \u201cflow state continuity\u201d element that Chandrasekar talks about is obviously key i.e. developers do appreciate being able to stay in the zone and in the Intergrated Development Environment (IDE) and in the toolset and in the workspace or application (Ed: we get the point, switching environments or form factors in any shape or form is laboursome) of their choice for any given task\u2026 and that\u2019s what Stack Overflow is hoping to make easier.\n\nConnectors for Microsoft Graph allow organisations to bring their third-party data and its content into their Microsoft 365 experience and the entire ecosystem by copying it into Microsoft Graph. From there, this content can be surfaced in Microsoft 365 applications using the Microsoft 365 Copilot search feature. This includes both Copilot chat and Copilot Studio, where teams can build a custom Copilot and new agents.\n\nKnowledge-as-a-Service (KaaS)\n\n\u201cThis integration is yet another example of Stack Overflow\u2019s Knowledge-as-a-service vision becoming a reality \u2013 making trusted knowledge from Stack Overflow and/or Stack Overflow for Teams accessible wherever developers are in their workflow, including in GenAI tools, through an integration with Microsoft 365 Copilot,\u201d said Chandrasekar.\n\nWith this Stack Overflow connector, developers will now be able to \u2013 directly in Microsoft 365 Copilot \u2013 ask their technical questions and receive a summarised response based on question and answer content from Stack Overflow for Teams (their trusted knowledge store). The Stack Overflow connector for Microsoft Graph was first previewed at Microsoft Ignite 2024. This integration follows the release of a new Stack Overflow extension for GitHub Copilot, which was announced at GitHub Universe.",

            "content": "COMMENTARY: As more businesses began shifting to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Microsoft Teams started gaining significant popularity.\n\nMore than ever before, employees were utilizing the collaboration app as a means to communicate with their colleagues through chatting, video conferencing, and sharing files. Today, companies and employees all over the world continue to leverage this platform.\n\nUnfortunately, as is the case with many forms of popular technology that reach large amounts of people, Teams is now being utilized by attackers looking to harvest sensitive information and data. Specifically, they are abusing Teams by sending out phishing messages.\n\nPhishy Techniques\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how this is occurring and what your business can do to stay safe.\n\nMicrosoft acknowledges that since April 2024, it has seen \u201ca significant increase in Teams phishing attacks, which have led to endpoint-related incidents, particularly through the abuse of Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools such as Quick Assist.\u201d\n\nInitially, according to Microsoft, the attacks \u201cbegan with a spam flood, followed by the attacker impersonating the Help Desk on Teams. The attacker would contact the user via Teams, send a malicious link to start the RMM session, and deliver the harmful payload during the session. This would lead to hands-on keyboard activity, data exfiltration, and ultimately result in ransomware attacks.\u201d\n\nOver time, the typical attack method evolved so that attackers now directly reach out to users on Teams, impersonating the service desk. Once the user accepts the Teams invite, Microsoft states, \u201cthe attacker provides a SharePoint link containing malicious payloads, which could lead to critical security breaches.\u201d\n\nHow to Not Take the Bait\n\nAdditionally, attackers are also \u201cpersuading users to install remote access software link AnyDesk and TeamViewer or convincing them to initiate connections via Microsoft\u2019s Quick Assist, which is installed by default in the Windows Operating System.\u201d\n\nPhishing attacks in Microsoft Teams can have serious consequences, including data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.\n\nHowever, by implementing strong security measures and educating employees, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these types of attacks.\n\nHere are several steps you can take to protect your organization:\n\nThe first line of defense against phishing attacks is user awareness. Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about how phishing works and the signs of suspicious activity.\n\nEven if attackers manage to obtain a user\u2019s login credentials through a phishing attack, they won\u2019t be able to access the account without the second layer of authentication provided by MFA. Multi-factor authentication is one of the most effective ways to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 offers anti-phishing features that can help detect and block phishing attempts within Teams, email, and other Microsoft 365 services. It helps protect against malware, unsafe attachments, and malicious links.\n\nPhishing attempts often originate from external sources, so limiting file sharing and external collaboration within Teams can help reduce the risk. Set up policies to restrict the ability of users to share files with external users, especially those that contain sensitive or confidential information.\n\nStay Vigilant to Stay Afloat\n\nRegularly monitor activity within Microsoft Teams to detect unusual behavior that could indicate a phishing attack, such as unauthorized logins or new external contacts being added. You can also implement Conditional Access policies to restrict access based on certain conditions, like location or device health. Additionally, restrict Teams messaging with your company to only allow specific organizations or no external organizations to message internal employees.\n\nPhishing attacks in Microsoft Teams represent a growing threat to organizations. However, there are steps you can take to ensure that your company will stay afloat. With the right combination of user training, security tools, and proactive monitoring, organizations can defend against these attacks and safeguard their sensitive information.\n\nAlso, by fostering a security-conscious culture, enforcing strong authentication methods, and leveraging Microsoft\u2019s built-in security features, businesses can significantly reduce their vulnerability to phishing attacks in Teams. The more vigilant your organization is, the less likely it is to fall victim to these increasingly sophisticated threats.\n\n[email protected]",

The updated authentication screen is based on Microsoft\u2019s Fluent 2 design language and even includes a dark mode with Xbox colors.\n\nThe entire authentication process for Microsoft accounts has been improved as part of this redesign, with a bigger emphasis on passwordless authentication. \u201cOur new UX is optimized for a passwordless and passkey-first experience,\u201d says Robin Goldstein, partner director of product management for Microsoft Identity. \u201cWe\u2019ve reduced the number of concepts per screen to lower cognitive load and speed up the authentication process, plus re-ordered some steps to logically flow better.\u201d\n\nThe new dark mode sign-in screen. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe more simplified design also includes light and dark themes, which are enabled automatically based on your device configuration. \u201cThe first place to see this will be on Gaming apps,\u201d says Goldstein. \u201cOther consumer apps will support Dark Mode in the future.\u201d\n\nXbox users will already start to see this new sign-in experience across the web and on mobile, and the full updates to the authentication screen will roll out throughout March and April. Web and mobile apps will get the new user experience first, followed by Windows apps.\n\nThis new design is limited to consumer profiles, so there will be no changes to Microsoft Entra work and school accounts. \u201cHowever, the learnings from these improvements give my team valuable insights for updating the default Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Entra External ID account experiences in the future, including the common sign-in screen for apps that support authentication via both Microsoft accounts and Microsoft Entra accounts,\u201d says Goldstein.\n\nThis new sign-in UI is probably related to Microsoft\u2019s plans to automatically keep you signed into to an account. The software giant sent notifications to Outlook.com users about a potential account change in February, but Microsoft then revealed this was a mistake and edited a Microsoft support article referencing keeping accounts signed in automatically unless you sign out or use private browsing. We\u2019re still waiting to hear when these additional sign-in changes will roll out.",

It\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nThe partner said that their client was angered by the whole experience, finding it a waste of time. \u201cThis is not acceptable and is not working the way that they (Microsoft) think it is,\u201d the partner said.\n\n[RELATED: Microsoft Q2 2025 Earnings: CFO Blames Azure \u2018Challenges\u2019 On Partner Motion; AI Sales Beat Expectations]\n\nThe solution provider told CRN that Microsoft is also doing damage to his trusted adviser role by recommending higher-tier Microsoft 365 licenses like E5 to customers when those licenses go well beyond what the customer needs.\n\n\u201cBusiness Premium is a great solution for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t need it [E5], why sell it to them?\u201d\n\nMultiple Microsoft solution providers have told CRN about a recent wave of phone calls, emails and even unsolicited calendar invites to their customers by Microsoft contractors without prior notice to partners. CRN has reviewed emails from these contractors dating back to December 2024.\n\nPartners characterize the contractors\u2019 full-court press on cloud renewals as \u201cway more aggressive\u201d than they have seen in the past from Microsoft to get customers to adopt higher-tier licenses and a broader range of Microsoft products.\n\nPartners said these communications\u2014which, they say, violate the primary tenant of channel sales that a vendor should not go behind a partner\u2019s back to sell to an established customer\u2014jeopardize their role as trusted advisers.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Renewals\n\nThe current wave of activity by these Microsoft contractors\u2014also known as \u201csolutions consultants,\u201d \u201cinternational suppliers\u201d and \u201cV dash\u201d contractors because of the \u201cv-\u201d naming convention that goes ahead of the username in their Microsoft.com email addresses\u2014is meant to help partners with cross-selling and up-selling Microsoft products and services, especially in the SMB space, people familiar with the operation have told CRN.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic solution provider is one of five partners to talk to CRN about the calls and emails to their customers from Microsoft contractors without partners\u2019 prior knowledge based on upcoming end-of-sale or renewal dates.\n\nFour Microsoft solution providers told CRN they are furious about the outreach to their customers and the sellers\u2019 methods, but that they wished to remain anonymous to preserve their relationship with the software giant.\n\nMicrosoft VDS Identifies \u2018Up-Sell And Cross-Sell Opportunities\u2019\n\nIn an email to CRN, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the communications are related to the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant\u2019s Vendor Digital Sales team. The VDS team \u201cidentifies up-sell and cross-sell opportunities with small and medium businesses, connects those opportunities to partners, prioritizing the customer\u2019s preferred partner, and develops them jointly through a consultative approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuoting, billing, and implementation are all done by the partner,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe program, which has been in existence for more than five years, provides technical expertise at no cost to help partners increase win rates and maximize deal sizes.\u201d\n\nPeople close to VDS have told CRN that the program is global and meant to work similar to a pre-sales customer-facing engine, providing demonstrations, cloud and security evaluations, and more. VDS also receives referrals from solution providers through Partner Center and passes upwards of hundreds of thousands of leads to partners worldwide.\n\nOne person close to VDS denied that there has been a ramp-up in activity from the group.\n\n\u2018Not The Right Thing For The Customer Right Now\u2019\n\nA Microsoft solution provider in the Southeastern U.S. told CRN that a VDS seller called their customer late last year and disrupted their attempts to sell Copilot. The customer, who was historically conservative with adopting new technology, had already agreed to pilot the AI tool with a small user pool and to a timeline for progress assessments.\n\nAfter learning of the VDS contact, the solution provider fought to be on the call and described it as a high-pressure, quota-driven sale to persuade the customer to buy more seats.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the right thing for the customer right now,\u201d the solution provider said. \u201cThis shift in Microsoft\u2019s approach seems to prioritize short-term results over sustained partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe Southeastern Microsoft solution provider also did not like the VDS seller referring the customer to Microsoft\u2019s \u201cexpert technology consultants.\u201d The solution provider believes that these Microsoft ETCs could take away from the partner\u2019s own consulting engagements.\n\n\u201cThe margins aren\u2019t high enough with Microsoft to deal with unhappy customers,\u201d the provider said.\n\nUnexplained Calendar Invites\n\nA Microsoft solution provider in the Northeast told CRN that a VDS seller kept sending meeting invitations to a customer without explanation.\n\n\u201cThat was just ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just pissing off the customer.\u201d\n\nWhen the solution provider talked to their Microsoft partner development manager, the PDM didn\u2019t know anything about VDS, the solution provider said.\n\nMultiple Microsoft solution providers also told CRN they are concerned that VDS sellers are using calls and emails to introduce customers to new ISVs that the partner hasn\u2019t vetted.\n\nFor example, multiple VDS sellers recommended to Microsoft customers a Toronto-based ISV called Block 64, which provides an IT discovery and insights platform.\n\nThe company\u2019s website lists among its vendor partners Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Its solution provider partners include CRN 2024 Solution Provider 500 honorees SoftwareOne, Zones, SHI, Insight and Connection.\n\nBlock 64 CEO James Corless told CRN in an email that he is \u201cnot surprised that we are mentioned by Microsoft suppliers; in fact I am encouraged to hear that Block 64 is being mentioned more often.\u201d\n\nThe ISV has worked with Microsoft in multiple global regions and various programs since about 2018, Corless said. Block 64 doesn\u2019t have an agreement with VDS, but it provides their teams with \u201congoing training and technical support on behalf of Microsoft,\u201d Corless said.\n\nBlock 64 isn\u2019t a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider and doesn\u2019t compete with CSP partners, he said. The company was founded in 2012, has System and Organization Controls Type II (SOC 2)-certified offers and is in more than 20,000 end customer environments in 80 countries, Corless said.\n\n\u201cBlock 64 is licensed by many CSPs for use in the delivery of their own [IT asset management/software asset management], cloud migration and security services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe extend CSPs\u2019 capabilities in these areas. \u2026 This initiative should be viewed as an opportunity for CSPs, as many of our recommendations result in new opportunities for CSPs to provide additional services to their existing customers.\u201d\n\nVDS Sellers Can\u2019t Transact With Customers\n\nAddressing specific concerns by Microsoft solution providers angered with the VDS program who spoke with CRN, a people close to the program said that VDS is not meant to take away partner engagements and VDS sellers do not have the ability to transact with customers.\n\nTheir inability to transact with customers comes across in some of the VDS emails reviewed by CRN, where VDS sellers tell customers to make final subscription renewals with their solution provider. VDS sellers also should not contact month-to-month subscription customers on a monthly basis, the person said.\n\nVDS sellers go directly to customers because many customers work with multiple partners managing various Microsoft products and services, the person said. This allows the VDS team to confirm with the customer which partner they want to work with if they further engage VDS.\n\nFor customers and solution providers especially wary of unsolicited calls and emails coming from scammers, they can use Microsoft tools to verify the VDS seller does indeed work on behalf of Microsoft. The sellers are also not auditing customer licenses, a practice that stopped years ago, said the person close to the program.\n\nVDS contacts customers not only on cloud renewals, but also for Enterprise Agreements (EAs) as well, the person said.\n\nOver the past two years, VDS has tried to gain more visibility with solution providers and distributors and spread more awareness of its capabilities, the person said. But the person acknowledged that some partners still might not know about the program.\n\nPeople familiar with the VDS program said they expect Microsoft to keep investing in the program. The VDS program played a big role in the rollout of Microsoft\u2019s Copilot offers that launched in January 2024, as an example.\n\nPeople close to the program also said that multiple partners have shared positive feedback on the program.\n\nOne West Coast Microsoft partner who asked for anonymity to share emails VDS sellers sent to end users told CRN that he believes the customer contacts are helpful.\n\nThese contacts directly from the vendor could motivate customers to actually upgrade their subscription if they\u2019ve been resistant to partner recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue that partners get upset at this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cSee the positive. Without Microsoft, many customers wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nThe Accenture Connection\n\nA person close with VDS confirmed that a number of the VDS workers are contractors working for Accenture and other outsource partners. CRN has reached out to Accenture\u2014No. 1 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500\u2014for comment, but had not heard back at press time.\n\nMany of the international suppliers live in South American countries including Costa Rica and Colombia, based on a CRN review of their profiles on Microsoft-owned social network LinkedIn.\n\nVDS sellers also prioritize incumbent customer partners, the person told CRN. Sellers\u2019 success is based on when partners close the deal.\n\nSherweb: VDS Has Helped With Up-Selling And Cross-Selling\n\nMichael Slater, head of sales for Microsoft and cybersecurity at distributor Sherweb, told CRN in an interview that he chalks up partners taking more notice of VDS activity to how many subscription dates happen around the start of the year, especially after migrations under Microsoft\u2019s new commerce experience (NCE) program that rolled out starting in 2022.\n\nIn his experience, VDS has helped spur up-selling and cross-selling conversations with Microsoft customers, especially with more complex Microsoft deals such as those involving the Fabric data analytics platform or enterprise resource planning (ERP). He\u2019s also never seen a partner lose a customer due to a VDS call, Slater said.\n\nLike solution providers, Sherweb does not receive advanced notice before a VDS seller contacts an end customer, he said.\n\nSometimes VDS sellers are more up-to-date on newer Microsoft offers that some solution providers can miss due to how often Microsoft updates products and releases new deals, he said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft does see success in doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cI always think that the best solution for partners is to come to the table with the vendor, and then we all have a discussion together.\u201d\n\nThe vendor has put into action a variety of suggested fixes and changes to the program, Slater said. He said he is working to better explain the program to Microsoft solution providers so that they are not surprised by the activity, which shouldn\u2019t distract from investments the tech giant has made in supporting partners.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is still one of the most channel-friendly vendors out there,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple Microsoft solution providers told CRN that their workaround to unwanted customer contacts by Microsoft VDS is never listing customer phone numbers and email addresses in Microsoft portals. Instead, the solution provider puts their own contact information or redirects Microsoft emails to customers to an email account managed by the partner.\n\nSherweb\u2019s Slater warned against this practice, especially for partners that might have to now manually track multiple tenants. \u201cIs it even worth it at that point to do that?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not best practice to do that.\u201d\n\nRecent VDS Job Listings\n\nMultiple recent online job listings by the tech giant shed some light on the role Microsoft VDS plays with the channel.\n\nOne job listing that is no longer accepting applications calls for a sales program lead making at least $106,100 in U.S dollars. The lead \u201cwill be accountable to the SMB Americas business and be the SMB customer advocate from Vendor Digital Sales engagements across the organization.\u201d\n\nThe lead will be \u201cpart of local subsidiaries or Digital Sales centers around the world\u201d and \u201cwill support a dedicated set of customers in identifying and achieving their business objectives through best-in-class digital engagement and partner co-selling,\u201d according to the job listing.\n\nThis lead also \u201cdevelops expertise in the local partner ecosystem across customer segments to help identify opportunities to improve sales revenue.\u201d\n\nA separate job listing for a Microsoft VDS director that is online but no longer accepting applications describes the role as part of Microsoft\u2019s Small, Medium, Enterprises and Channel organization. In February, Ralph Haupter took over the newly formed SME&C as president.\n\nThe director\u2014who could make at least $130,000 a year, according to the listing\u2014would be tasked with advising \u201ccustomers and partners on leveraging digital and AI transformation solutions, ensuring successful value realization and fostering innovative opportunities across business units,\u201d according to the job listing.\n\nThe hire also \u201cinfluences and works across segments, partners, and teams to drive growth and transformation, ensuring alignment on account plans, defining sales execution, and fostering an inclusive organizational culture.\u201d\n\nA third online job listing for a \u201cvendor digital sales (customer lifecycle motion) strategy lead\u201d is no longer accepting applications and offered at least $154,500 in annual pay.\n\nThe post says that Microsoft has \u201cset out with the purpose to empower our customers through the unique value of the Microsoft cloud by building a globally led, digital-first scale organization aligned with partners.\u201d\n\nThe strategy lead will \u201cbe responsible for the sales strategy of VDS CLM motion and execution through the Field team, leveraging an outsourced digital sales model\u201d and \u201cprovide updates and report key metrics needed to assist sales and partner teams to drive the sales business forward,\u201d according to the job listing.",

            "content": "Microsoft is currently testing a pair of new apps \u2014 including one that the company previously decided to stop using due to a lack of interest.\n\nThe two new apps are People and File Search. If \u201cPeople\u201d rings a bell, it should: People is a decades-old app that Microsoft originally launched for Windows 8, then gave up on. Now, it\u2019s back.\n\nThough the new apps appear in Windows, they\u2019re only available for those who also have Microsoft 365 applications installed, such as the Word/Excel/PowerPoint trifecta that accompanies a Microsoft 365 subscription. Right now, Microsoft is testing the new apps as part of the Microsoft 365 Insider program, and for those who have signed up for the Business or Enterprise license.\n\nIn a blog post describing the new apps, Microsoft calls these \u201cmini-apps,\u201d which may be just an incidental descriptive term or may signal a new wave of smaller, lightweight applications or widgets. \u201cYou\u2019ll recognize familiar flows in these apps, but in a lightning-fast and streamlined format,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Shilpa Patel wrote. \u201cPlus, you can pin both apps to your taskbar so you always know where to access them, no matter how busy your workspace gets.\u201d\n\nBoth of these applications appear to be twists on existing functionality within Windows and Microsoft 365. Microsoft\u2019s existing Office application, for example, includes a list of files that you\u2019ve worked on and has been shared with you. The new File Search app also focuses exclusively on your Microsoft 365 files, but with various filters to narrow it down, plus the ability to search by contents. It might not be quite the semantic search that Microsoft is readying for Windows, but it sounds similar.\n\nMicrosoft File Search in action. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft says that you can use File Search to preview a document, and then share it. That\u2019s a feature that you should be able to do via other means as well, such as right-clicking the file in File Explorer.\n\nPeople, back from the dead\n\nPeople has also been a function that we\u2019ve seen surface repeatedly in the Microsoft ecosystem. Originally, Microsoft developed it as a standalone Windows app for Windows 8, believing that people needed a contact list to store email addresses, phone numbers, and so on. Then there was Windows 10, and the People app that sat alongside Windows Mail and the Calendar app, too. Microsoft then planned to include a \u201cMy People\u201d app in 2016\u2019s Windows 10 Creators Update, killed it, then brought it back in 2017, where I talked more about People at length.\n\nPeople was predicated on the thought that you\u2019d want access to five or so friends in your taskbar, where you could send \u201cshoulder taps\u201d and essentially wave hello with little pop-out emoji from the Taskbar. As it turned out, basically no one (even my colleagues, who I asked to help test) wanted to be part of People, and Microsoft said it would kill off My People in 2019.\n\nThe new version of Microsoft People allows you to hunt down a colleague in the org chart. Microsoft\n\nIn the meantime, however, Microsoft was moving more purposefully into business. For a time, Outlook became a hub of business activity, where you could track your contacts and calendars. Over time, that evolved into the need to discover where you fit on the \u201corg chart,\u201d and what colleagues could be used as a source of information for collaboration or just a question. Meanwhile, Microsoft Teams became an avenue for business collaboration.\n\nIt\u2019s that angle that Microsoft\u2019s latest revision of the People app addresses. Again, People presents a list of colleagues, who can be clicked on for more information or just to find out what their responsibilities are. You can also search by job title or department.\n\nPeople\u2019s real purpose is to message colleagues via Teams. Microsoft\n\nHowever, People is designed to be able to select a coworker and to then send them a quick Teams message. The idea is that you\u2019ll prefer to do this from your Taskbar instead of navigating to another dedicated app\u2026like Teams.\n\nWill these new mini-apps take off, or will People\u2019s 2025 update fizzle like it did before? History isn\u2019t optimistic.",

Furthermore, the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent in Security Copilot ensures that relevant security reports are generated automatically and on time.\n\nSecurity Pilot agents from partners\n\nIn addition to Microsoft\u2019s new AI agents, five partners have also introduced AI agents. These external agents come from Aviatrix Systems, OneTrust, Tanium, Fletch and BlueVoyant and cover specific use cases that Security Copilot does not offer as standard.\n\nThe Aviatrix agent helps solve network problems, while the OneTrust agent helps companies comply with privacy regulations. The BlueVoyant SecOps agent optimizes SOC activities and makes recommendations for improvement.\n\nThe Alert Triage agent from Tanium provides analysts with the correct context for alerts. Lastly, the Fletch Task Optimizer Agent ensures that companies can predict and prioritize the most critical cyber threats.\n\nOther new security features\n\nMicrosoft has also rolled out new AI-focused features across the rest of its security portfolio. For example, the business browser version Edge for Business now ensures that employees cannot enter sensitive data into various AI chatbots. This functionality will also be available for integrations with Microsoft Purview and SASE tools from other parties.\n\nMicrosoft Defender will get new AI security functionality, specifically to make the use of various LLM within AI platforms and cloud environments more secure.\n\nThis functionality is already available, but from May 2025, it will be extended in preview to Google Vertex AI and all LLMs in the Azure Foundry LLM catalog, including Google Gemini, Gemma, Meta Llama, Mistral AI, and custom AI models. This security feature will also cover Google Cloud in addition to Azure and AWS.\n\nFurthermore, a new version of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will be released in April 2025, which should better protect users against phishing attacks and other threats, including in Teams.\n\nAlso read: SUSE Security events land on Microsoft Sentinel and Security Copilot",

            "content": "The GDC 2025 highlight for me was a talk by Monica Harrington, Valve co-founder and the company's first chief marketing officer, about her long and storied career in tech. And like many of Valve's earliest employees, Harrington came there from Microsoft, where one of her major responsibilities was marketing Microsoft Word and later the Office suite.\n\n\"It's the mid-90s, and I'm in a new job at Microsoft overseeing PR for Microsoft's newish Consumer Division,\" says Harrington in her talk. \"I'd previously worked as a product manager on Microsoft Word and later took on a new role overseeing all of the applications and developer tools PR for the company. We'd recently launched the version of Microsoft Office that would result\u2014sorry to Microsoft's antitrust lawyers\u2014in total domination over our old rivals WordPerfect and Lotus.\"\n\nHarrington had ended up in this role because of her undeniable results as part of the Microsoft Word team, and when PCG's Ted Litchfield had the chance to sit down with her after the talk one of the topics under discussion was this period in marketing Microsoft Word. Word was not the default it would become, and Harrington herself has characterised this time as \"the billion-dollar Word processing wars\" with WordPerfect a particular thorn in Redmond's side.\n\nThere was a trick up Harrington's sleeve, however. OK it's not a trick. She could actually use the software, which was not as common as you might think.\n\n\"So kind of a funny thing about my experience is I'm actually a certified legal secretary,\" laughs Harrington. \"So very early on between high school and college, I was very young getting out of high school and got some training. That was always so I could take care of myself but what it meant was, years later, when I was the Word product manager I remember going to a presentation [alongside] WordPerfect, and there's Word, and I didn't know this ahead of time but it wasn't a demo.\"\n\nThe clients didn't just want the boil-in-the-bag tech demo typically rolled-out at such presentations. They wanted to see the product being used and demonstrated in real-time, and you have to remember this would be in the late 1980s: The general familiarity with word processors just wasn't there, even at a company like Microsoft.\n\n\"The people who had asked for it, they actually wanted essentially a type-off,\" said Harrington. \"They wanted you to produce a document. And they told you what the document was, and you had to produce it. And so here I am, and WordPerfect owned the market. And the Microsoft guy who asked me to come out\u2026 I can see him over there, and I can see the look on his face when they ask for that.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nThe look on his face will have to be left to your imagination, but this is clearly the kind of scenario that would make certain Microsoft product managers wake up screaming in the night.\n\n\"And I said 'it's okay, it's okay,' you know,\" recalls Harrington, who was able to sit down and produce exactly what the client was demanding in Word. \"And that was hugely important, and yeah I was lucky to be able to do that. You know, it was down to [the fact] I'm pretty sure I was the only one on the Word product marketing team who'd actually been a secretary.\"\n\nMost of the rest of Harrington's talk focuses on her time at Valve, but the common thread among all her recollections is just how brilliant she is at both selling a product and understanding what people want from it. \"You can't use up your credibility,\" Harrington says of truth in marketing, \"and you can't lose it.\"\n\nThere's also the story of how her nephew buying a CD-ROM copier got Harrington very interested in DRM, as well as the intriguing alt-history where Valve got out of the games business entirely. Gabe Newell had his eyes on a social network in the '90s that \"was not in a games context at all\"\u2014meaning Valve-owned social media could've been a very real thing.",

At Microsoft, we are dedicated to helping organizations secure their future with our AI-first, end-to-end security platform.\n\nOne year ago, we launched Microsoft Security Copilot to empower defenders to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents swiftly and accurately. Now, we are excited to announce the next evolution of Security Copilot with AI agents designed to autonomously assist with critical areas such as phishing, data security, and identity management. The relentless pace and complexity of cyberattacks have surpassed human capacity and establishing AI agents is a necessity for modern security.\n\nFor example, phishing attacks remain one of the most common and damaging cyberthreats. Between January and December 2024, Microsoft detected more than 30 billion phishing emails targeting customers.1 The volume of these cyberattacks overwhelms security teams relying on manual processes and fragmented defenses, making it difficult to both triage malicious messages promptly and leverage data-driven insights for broader cyber risk management.\n\nThe phishing triage agent in Microsoft Security Copilot being unveiled today can handle routine phishing alerts and cyberattacks, freeing up human defenders to focus on more complex cyberthreats and proactive security measures. This is just one way agents can transform security.\n\nAdditionally, securing and governing AI continues to be the top priority for organizations, and we are excited to advance our purpose-built solutions with new innovations across Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Entra, and Microsoft Purview.\n\nRead on to learn about other agents we are introducing to Security Copilot and important developments in securing AI.\n\nExpanding Microsoft Security Copilot with AI agentic capabilities\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence now processes 84 trillion signals per day, revealing the exponential growth in cyberattacks, including 7,000 password attacks per second.1 Scaling cyber defenses through AI agents is now an imperative to keep pace with this threat landscape. We are expanding Security Copilot with six security agents built by Microsoft and five security agents built by our partners\u2014available for preview in April 2025.\n\nSix new agentic solutions from Microsoft Security\n\nBuilding on the transformative capabilities of Security Copilot, the six Microsoft Security Copilot agents enable teams to autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks while seamlessly integrating with Microsoft Security solutions. Purpose-built for security, agents learn from feedback, adapt to workflows, and operate securely\u2014aligned to Microsoft\u2019s Zero Trust framework. With security teams fully in control, agents accelerate responses, prioritize risks, and drive efficiency to enable proactive protection and strengthen an organization\u2019s security posture.\n\nSecurity Copilot agents will be available across the Microsoft end-to-end security platform, designed for the following:\n\nPhishing Triage Agent in Microsoft Defender triages phishing alerts with accuracy to identify real cyberthreats and false alarms. It provides easy-to-understand explanations for its decisions and improves detection based on admin feedback.\n\nAlert Triage Agents in Microsoft Purview triage data loss prevention and insider risk alerts, prioritize critical incidents, and continuously improve accuracy based on admin feedback.\n\nConditional Access Optimization Agent in Microsoft Entra monitors for new users or apps not covered by existing policies, identifies necessary updates to close security gaps, and recommends quick fixes for identity teams to apply with a single click.\n\nVulnerability Remediation Agent in Microsoft Intune monitors and prioritizes vulnerabilities and remediation tasks to address app and policy configuration issues and expedites Windows OS patches with admin approval.\n\nThreat Intelligence Briefing Agent in Security Copilot automatically curates relevant and timely threat intelligence based on an organization\u2019s unique attributes and cyberthreat exposure.\n\nSecurity Copilot\u2019s agentic capabilities are an example of how we continue to deliver innovation leveraging our decades of AI research. See how agents work.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning; our security AI research is pushing the boundaries of innovation, and we are eager to continuously bring even greater value to our customers at the speed of AI.\u201d \u2014Alexander Stojanovic, Vice President of Microsoft Security AI Applied Research\n\nFive new agentic solutions from Microsoft Security partners\n\nSecurity is a team sport and Microsoft is committed to empowering our security ecosystem with an open platform upon which partners can build to deliver value to customers. In this spirit, the following five AI agents from our partners will be available in Security Copilot:\n\nPrivacy Breach Response Agent by OneTrust analyzes data breaches to generate guidance for the privacy team on how to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nanalyzes data breaches to generate guidance for the privacy team on how to meet regulatory requirements.

Current Security Copilot customers can join our Customer Connection Program for the latest updates.\n\nNew AI-powered data security investigations and analysis\n\nWe are also announcing Microsoft Purview data security investigations to help data security teams quickly understand and mitigate risks associated with sensitive data exposure. Data security investigations introduce AI-powered deep content analysis, which identifies sensitive data and other risks linked to incidents. Incident investigators can use these insights to collaborate securely with partner teams and simplify complex and time-consuming tasks, thus improving mitigation. This solution links data security investigations to Defender incidents and Purview insider risk cases\u2014available for preview starting April 2025.\n\nFurther advances in securing and governing generative AI\n\nSuccessful AI transformation requires a strong cybersecurity foundation. As organizations rapidly adopt generative AI, there is growing urgency to secure and govern the creation, adoption, and use of AI in the workplace. According to our new report, \u201cSecure employee access in the age of AI,\u201d 57% of organizations report an increase in security incidents from AI usage. And while most organizations recognize the need for AI controls, 60% have not yet started.\n\nSecuring AI is still a relatively new challenge, and leaders share some specific concerns: how to prevent data oversharing and leakage; how to minimize new AI threats and vulnerabilities; and how to comply with shifting regulatory compliance requirements. Microsoft Security solutions are purpose-built for AI to help every organization address these concerns. We\u2019re announcing new advanced capabilities so that organizations can secure their AI investments\u2014both Microsoft AI and other AI.\n\nAI security posture management for multimodel and multicloud environments\n\nOrganizations developing their own custom AI solutions will need to strengthen the security posture for AI that they source from multiple models, running in multiple AI platforms and clouds. To address this need, Microsoft Defender has extended AI security posture management beyond Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to include Google VertexAI and all models in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog. Available for preview in May 2025, this coverage includes Gemini, Gemma, Meta Llama, Mistral, and custom models. With new multicloud interoperability, organizations will gain broader code-to-runtime AI security posture visibility across Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. Microsoft Defender can give organizations a jumpstart to securing AI posture across multimodel and multicloud environments.\n\nNew detection and protection for emerging AI threats\n\nWith AI comes new risks, including new cyberattack surfaces and unknown vulnerabilities. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) identifies the highest priority risks and mitigations for generative AI apps. Starting in May 2025, new and enriched AI detections for several risks identified by OWASP such as indirect prompt injection attacks, sensitive data exposure, and wallet abuse will be generally available in Microsoft Defender. With these new detections, SOC analysts can better protect and defend custom-built AI apps with new safeguards for Azure OpenAI Service and models found in the Azure AI Foundry catalog.\n\nNew controls to prevent risky access and data leaks into shadow AI apps\n\nWith the rapid user adoption of generative AI, many organizations are uncovering widespread use of AI apps that have not yet been approved by IT or security teams. This unsanctioned, unprotected use of AI has created a \u201cshadow AI\u201d phenomenon, which has drastically increased the risk of sensitive data leakage. We are announcing general availability of AI web category filter in Microsoft Entra internet access to help enforce granular access controls that can curb the risk of shadow AI by enforcing policies governing which users and groups have access to different types of AI applications.\n\nWith policy enforcement in place to govern authorized access to AI apps, the next layer of defense is to prevent users from leaking sensitive data into AI apps. To address this, we are announcing the preview of Microsoft Purview browser data loss prevention (DLP) controls built into Microsoft Edge for Business. This helps security teams enforce DLP policies to prevent sensitive data from being typed into generative AI apps, starting with ChatGPT, Copilot Chat, DeepSeek, and Google Gemini.\n\nLearn more about our new innovations in Security for AI.\n\nNew phishing protection in Microsoft Teams for safer collaboration\n\nWhile email continues to be the primary cyberthreat vector for phishing, collaboration software has become a common target. Generally available in April 2025, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will protect users against phishing and other advanced cyberthreats within Teams. With inline protection, Teams will have better protection against malicious URLs, including real-time detonation of attachments and links. And to give SOC teams full visibility into related attempts and incidents, alerts and data will be available in Microsoft Defender.\n\nAgile innovation to build a safer world\n\nWe continue to innovate across the Microsoft Security portfolio, applying the principles of our Secure Future Initiative, to deliver powerful, end-to-end protection to give defenders industry-leading AI, and to empower every organization with the tools to secure and govern AI. We are grateful for our customers and partners and together, with them, we look forward to building a more secure world for all.\n\nMicrosoft Secure To see these innovations in action, join us on April 9, 2025 for Microsoft Secure, a digital event focused on security in the age of AI.

Announced on Monday, Microsoft built six of the new agents, while five come from third-party partners. All will be available for preview starting in April.\n\nIntegrated with the software giant's security products, the six Microsoft-created agents aim to help security teams handle high-volume security and IT tasks. Taking their cues from Microsoft's Zero Trust framework, these agents will also learn from user feedback and adapt to internal workflows.\n\nAlso: Navigating AI-powered cyber threats in 2025: 4 expert security tips for businesses\n\nThe six Microsoft agents are described as follows:\n\nPhishing Triage Agent in Microsoft Defender: This agent prioritizes Microsoft Defender phishing alerts to distinguish real threats from false positives. Offering simple explanations for its decisions, this agent can also improve its detective skills based on your feedback. Alert Triage Agent in Microsoft Purview: This agent prioritizes Microsoft Purview alerts related to data loss and insider risks. Based on your feedback, it can also improve its behavior. Conditional Access Optimization Agent in Microsoft Entra: This agent looks for new users and apps in Microsoft Entra that aren't covered by existing policies. It suggests the necessary updates to patch security holes and offers quick fixes to deal with identity and authentication methods. Vulnerability Remediation Agent in Microsoft Intune: This agent for Microsoft Intune prioritizes security vulnerabilities, uncovers app and policy configuration issues, and suggests the right Windows patches to apply. Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent in Security Copilot: This agent works with Security Copilot to share relevant and urgent threat intelligence based on your organization's environment and exposure to specific risks.\n\nNext up are the five third-party agents, all of which will be available in Security Copilot.\n\nPrivacy Breach Response Agent by OneTrust: This agent analyzes data breaches and offers guidelines on how your organization can meet regulatory requirements. Network Supervisor Agent by Aviatrix: This agent scans and analyzes security risks related to VPN, gateway, and Site2Cloud connection outages and failures. SecOps Tooling Agent by BlueVoyant: This agent looks at your security operations center and controls and provides advice on how to improve them. Alert Triage Agent by Tanium: This agent places security alerts within certain contexts to help you decide how to handle each one. Task Optimizer Agent by Fletch: This agent prioritizes the most critical security alerts so you can determine how to address each one.\n\nOfficially launched about a year ago, Microsoft Security Copilot uses AI to monitor and analyze security threats that could impact your organization. Like any AI, the product tries to automate as much of the process as possible. The primary goal is to free up IT and security staffers from repetitive or time-consuming tasks. But this type of AI can also offer guidance to help staff determine how and where to focus their efforts, allowing them to respond to security threats more quickly and effectively.\n\nAlso: AI bots scraping your data? This free tool gives those pesky crawlers the run-around\n\nSecurity Copilot is offered on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing organizations to start small and increase their usage as needed. The tool's cost is billed monthly through a Security Compute Unit (SCU) at $4 per hour. Estimating one SCU for 24 hours daily for an entire month, Microsoft pegs the monthly cost at around $2,920.\n\n\"Today's security professional has a perpetual onslaught of alerts and issues coming at them, often with limited context,\" Kris Bondi, CEO and co-founder of security company Mimoto, told ZDNET. \"While AI agents aren't able to detect a threat, they should be able to help in responding to what has been found. An AI agent can be trained that when presented with specific cues to automatically execute a multi-step response. Removing some percentage of what security professionals must analyze would help what is currently an overwhelming list of tasks.\"\n\nHowever, today's AI technology is prone to error. A tool like Security Copilot can fail to catch legitimate security threats and trigger false positives. That's why human intervention is always needed. Plus, this security product remains relatively new, and many organizations are still trying to figure out how to adopt it.\n\nAlso: How AI agents help hackers steal your confidential data - and what to do about it\n\n\"AI agents promise improved threat response, but results from baseline models haven't been overwhelming, with many customers reporting that even high-tier solutions miss significant numbers of threats,\" J. Stephen Kowski, Field CTO at SlashNext Email Security+, told ZDNET. \"Microsoft's Security Copilot shows promise, but adoption has been slower than expected due to lingering questions about data handling, required services, and licensing costs.\"\n\nWant more stories about AI?

            "content": "Despite the market volatility, the Federal Reserve has decided to wait and see during the March 2025 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. On March 20, Cristina Dwyer, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, commented on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to maintain the federal funds rate at 4.5%. She emphasized that this decision reflects the Fed\u2019s cautious approach in light of a resilient economy and moderating inflation trends. While inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, core consumer prices have decelerated significantly over the past year, signaling progress in controlling price pressures. Dwyer noted that this steady economic backdrop allows the Fed to adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d strategy, while carefully monitoring the effects of recent policy changes and external factors before making further adjustments.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 is hovering near correction territory, marking five years since its COVID-19 drawdown. Wyne noted that the risks appear evenly distributed between bullish and bearish outlooks. On one hand, the bears argue that softer economic data and rising consumer inflation expectations could worsen with tariff escalations, potentially leading to stagflation. On the other hand, bulls counter that weak sentiment data does not necessarily reflect hard economic indicators such as employment and retail sales, which remain robust. Wyne highlighted that bulls point out that long-term inflation expectations are still anchored near the Fed\u2019s target, mitigating risks of a wage spiral. He pointed out that historically speaking, investing during sentiment troughs has yielded strong returns in subsequent months.\n\nWe recently covered 10 Best Stocks to Buy Now For the Long Term , where we talked about the market outlook amidst the tariff situation and uncertainty. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDwyer also highlighted the Fed\u2019s decision to slow quantitative tightening by reducing its monthly cap on US Treasury redemptions from $25 billion to $5 billion starting in April. This move aligns with the broader efforts to balance monetary policy normalization without disrupting financial markets. However, she pointed out that uncertainty remains high due to recent tariff policies, which have contributed to elevated inflation projections for 2025.\n\nFor investors, Dwyer underscored the importance of reassessing portfolios in light of these developments. She advised ensuring diversification and alignment with long-term financial goals, as economic uncertainty persists and interest rate adjustments are expected later in the year. Despite weaker economic projections in the Summary of Economic Projections, such as lower GDP growth and higher unemployment forecasts, Dwyer noted that the Fed remains optimistic about continued economic expansion within a resilient macroeconomic environment.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of 11 best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts we used Finviz stock screener, CNN, and Morningstar. Using the screener we aggregated a list of stocks with more than 30% TTM net profit margins and analyst upside potential of at least 20%. Next, we cross-checked the TTM net profit margin for each stock from Morningstar and analyst upside potential from CNN. Lastly, we ranked these stocks in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average projected upside potential. We have also added hedge funds\u2019 sentiment around each stock. Please note that the data was recorded on March 21, 2025.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) The Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy According to Analyst?\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nTTM Net Profit Margin: 35.43%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\n\nAnalyst Upside Potential: 27.79%\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology company that operates through three key segments including Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. It provides a range of software, services, and devices for individuals and organizations.\n\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund in its Q4 2024 investor letter mentioned that they maintained an underweight position in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) during the fourth quarter of 2024, which proved beneficial due to a decline in the company\u2019s share price. Moreover, recently Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst believes that the company\u2019s AI leadership has been enhanced by its integration of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into its products. During the fiscal second quarter of 2025, the company reported a revenue of $69.6 billion reflecting a 12% increase year-over-year. In addition the operating income also grew 17% during the same time to reach $31.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services were a key contributor as it grew by 15% driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue. It is one of the best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nColumbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWithin software, the fund maintained an underweight position to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which proved beneficial as share price for the company fell during the fourth quarter. Microsoft\u2019s outlook for its Azure business came down slightly, which hampered the stock price at times during the quarter and, combined with losses on the Open AI business, led to a disappointing end to 2024. The company has guided its capital expenditure spending up slightly and investors continue to wait for additional monetization from the company\u2019s large commitment to AI infrastructure spending. The fund continued to hold an overweight allocation to Oracle as we believe Oracle is positioned to be a major beneficiary of the AI rollout and has the potential to compete with other large cloud providers, such as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. Oracle shares moved lower during the quarter and the stock suffered its worst day of the year in December, as the company narrowly underperformed analysts\u2019 average estimates. Oracle\u2019s business model remains strong as demand for computer power that can handle AI is increasing and the company\u2019s revenues from its cloud infrastructure unit moved higher year over year.\u201d\n\nOverall, MSFT ranks 8th on our list of best extremely profitable stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

While the company's researchers stand by their assessments, similar ones were ultimately rescinded the last time Microsoft made them. That puts a heavier burden of proof on the company this time around.\n\n'Fraught history of similar claims'\n\nMicrosoft's announcement about its supposed breakthrough was \"met with skepticism from some physicists in the field,\" said Salon . Some say that the Microsoft research team did not include all the data in the research paper published in Nature to prove that this form of quantum computing could work. And due to a \"fraught history of similar claims from the company being disputed and ultimately rescinded, some are extra wary of the results.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the company has faced pushback while presenting findings in the field of quantum computing. In 2018, Microsoft reported in a research paper that it had detected the presence of Majorana zero-modes, special zero-energy quasiparticles. Nature eventually retracted the paper after it was scrutinized in a report from independent experts. Four physicists not involved in the original study concluded it was unlikely Microsoft had intentionally misrepresented the data. Instead, the company seemed \"caught up in the excitement of the moment.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

The test, known as the topological gap protocol (TGP), was not mentioned in Microsoft's February announcement, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, said in a recent critique . \"Since the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit (quantum bit) are not there,\" said Legg.\n\nThe critiques went on. Vincent Mourik, a German experimental physicist, and Sergey Frolov, a University of Pittsburgh professor of physics and astronomy, made a YouTube video criticizing the \"distractions caused by unreliable scientific claims from Microsoft Quantum.\" Concerns about Microsoft's claims \"go back quite a number of years,\" so the reaction has not \"just been triggered by this announcement per se,\" Frolov said to The Register .\n\nWhile the scientific community remains skeptical, Microsoft is \"sticking to its guns,\" said Laptop Mag . In the year since the paper's submission and publication, the company has made more progress with its topological qubits, the quantum bits that would power Microsoft's proposed chips, said Microsoft researcher Chetan Nayak on a blog forum.\n\nNayak doubled down on the claims his team made in the paper during a talk last week at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit. He remained \"collected and convinced that his team has tamed the elusive Majoranas,\" even as \"Legg and other physicists denounce Microsoft's claims,\" said Science . \"We have only revealed a tiny fraction of what we've done,\" Nayak said to Science. Going forward, it will look \"more and more convincing that this is going to be the basis of a technology.\"",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other AI stocks that are making waves with insights on GTC highlights.\n\nA new open-source model from Mistral AI is shaking things up in the tech world. This groundbreaking model outperforms comparable models like Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, delivering inference speeds of 150 tokens per second. Mistral Small 3.1 surpasses the performance of leading small proprietary models across dimensions such as handling text, understanding multimodal inputs, supporting multiple languages, and managing long contexts, all that with low latency and cost efficiency.\n\nShifting focus to China, Tencent has recently captured attention with its suite of new artificial intelligence tools capable of converting text and images into 3D visuals. The company has released five open-source models based on its Hunyuan3D-2.0 technology, including \u201cturbo\u201d versions that can generate 3D visuals within 30 seconds while maintaining high precision and quality.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Turning Heads on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks to Keep on Your Radar\n\nLike many other Chinese firms, Tencent is advancing China\u2019s position in the AI arms race by expanding its capital expenditures. According to Tencent President Martin Lau, capital spending would rise to the \u201clow teens\u201d as a percentage of revenue, and artificial intelligence will be a key focus of strategic investments.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to increase our AI investments, increasing investment in our proprietary Hunyuan model while expanding our contributions in multimodal and open-source capabilities.\u201d \u2013Martin Lau.\n\nMeanwhile, once an AI leader in China, Baidu is also striving hard to regain its position in the tech world. The company has released two new free-to-use artificial intelligence models, including its first reasoning-focused model. The move comes ahead of its plans to move toward an open-source strategy.\n\nAccording to an article by The Financial Times on why China is suddenly flooding the markets with AI models, retaliation appears to be the driving force. When the US tightened its grip on advanced artificial intelligence technologies in January, it blocked off China\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and locked proprietary models behind trade barriers.\n\nEven though it seemed that China would retaliate by doubling down on secrecy, it\u2019s doing quite the opposite, and with good reason. Chinese tech groups are seemingly creating an ecosystem where developers can continuously revamp their models. Provided open-source becomes powerful enough, there would be no reason to pay for closed models if free, equally capable alternatives exist.",

Through this partnership agreement and pending Department of Defense approval, Anduril will assume oversight of production, future development of hardware and software and delivery timelines.\n\nAs warfare grows more complex, the need for intuitive, information-rich tools becomes increasingly urgent. Traditional mission command systems that rely on flat maps, static dashboards and verbal communication are ill-suited to the dynamic nature of modern battlefields. The IVAS program represents a groundbreaking step forward in military technology, providing soldiers with a comprehensive, body-worn system that integrates advanced augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to give warfighters beyond line-of-sight perception capabilities, increasing combat effectiveness, survivability against drones and accelerating mission command of unmanned systems.\n\nThis collaboration between Anduril and Microsoft leverages the distinct strengths of each company, ensuring continuity in the program while advancing IVAS, goals of enhancing combat effectiveness, awareness and decision-making on the battlefield. Anduril\u2019s mission focuses on innovation in defense technology, a deep understanding of military requirements and a unique approach to manufacturing defense products that will ensure future program development specifically tailored to the evolving needs of the Army as well as production at scale and lower unit cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s advanced cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities will continue to provide a robust backbone for the program, enabling seamless data integration and real-time insights critical to soldier effectiveness. Artificial intelligence will be foundational to all technical innovations for national security missions, and the cloud is essential to successfully delivering AI whenever and wherever it is needed. Through this agreement, Anduril will establish Azure as its preferred hyperscale cloud to support its AI development. Azure, through its commercial, U.S. government and classified clouds, provides high resiliency, sophisticated capabilities, flexibility and advanced security, designed to meet the stringent compliance requirements of the nation\u2019s most sensitive data.\n\nSince its founding in 2017, Anduril has focused exclusively on developing advanced defense technologies to solve unique challenges for warfighters. Palmer Luckey, Anduril\u2019s founder, who previously revolutionized the VR industry with Oculus, brings his unique expertise and vision to this effort.\n\n\u201cThe IVAS program represents the future of mission command, combining technology and human capability to give soldiers the edge they need on the battlefield,\u201d said Luckey. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to create a military ecosystem where technology acts as an extension of human capability. By empowering soldiers with the tools they need to make faster, smarter decisions, we\u2019re building a future where technology and human ingenuity combine to ensure mission success.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of the work our teams have put in to help the U.S. Army transform its concept of a soldier-borne AR headset into reality with the IVAS program. Our soldier-centered design approach helped reimagine technology development with the Army that continuously took in real-world soldier feedback to develop a product that soldiers love,\u201d said Robin Seiler, corporate vice president of mixed reality at Microsoft. \u201cWe are excited to partner with Anduril for the next phase of IVAS and leverage our combined strengths to meet our commitments on this vital program and deliver a game-changing capability for every U.S. soldier.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft and Anduril have previously collaborated to integrate Anduril\u2019s Lattice platform into IVAS to provide rapid AI-enabled situational awareness capabilities to enhance soldier safety and operational effectiveness. This new agreement brings Microsoft and Anduril closer together to maximize their unique expertise in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and defense manufacturing and further enhance technical developments and operational efficiencies.\n\nAnduril\u2019s family of systems is powered by Lattice, an AI software platform that turns thousands of data streams into a real-time, 3D command and control center.",

            "content": "Cybercriminals are abusing Microsoft's Trusted Signing platform to code-sign malware executables with short-lived three-day certificates.\n\nThreat actors have long sought after code-signing certificates as they can be used to sign malware to appear like they are from a legitimate company.\n\nSigned malware also has the advantage of potentially bypassing security filters that would normally block unsigned executables, or at least treat them with less suspicion.\n\nThe holy grail for threat actors is to obtain Extended Validation (EV) code-signing certificates, as they automatically gain increased trust from many cybersecurity programs due to the more rigorous verification process. Even more important, EV certificates are believed to gain a reputation boost in SmartScreen, helping to bypass alerts that would normally be displayed for unknown files.\n\nHowever, EV code-singing certificates can be difficult to obtain, requiring them to be stolen from other companies or for threat actors to set up fake businesses and spend thousands of dollars to purchase one. Furthermore, once the certificate is used in a malware campaign, it is usually revoked, making it unusable for future attacks.\n\nAbusing Microsoft Trusted Signing service\n\nRecently, cybersecurity researchers have seen threat actors utilizing the Microsoft Trusted Signing service to sign their malware with short-lived, three-day code-signing certificates.\n\nThese malware samples are signed by \"Microsoft ID Verified CS EOC CA 01\" and the certificate is only valid for three days. While the certificate expires three days after being issued, it is important to note that executables signed with it will still be considered valid until the issuer revokes the certificate.\n\nSince then other researchers and BleepingComputer have found numerous other samples used in ongoing malware campaigns, including those used in a Crazy Evil Traffers crypto-theft campaign [VirusTotal] and Lumma Stealer [VirusTotal] campaigns.\n\nSigned DLL from Crazy Evil traffers campaign\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\nThe Microsoft Trusted Signing service launched in 2024 and is a cloud-based service that allows developers to easily have their programs signed by Microsoft.\n\n\"Trusted Signing is a complete code signing service with an intuitive experience for developers and IT professionals, backed by a Microsoft managed certification authority,\" reads a Microsoft announcement for the service.\n\n\"The service supports both public and private trust signing scenarios and includes a timestamping service.\"\n\nThe platform has a $9.99 monthly subscription service designed to make it easy for developers to sign their executables, while also offering additional security.\n\nThis increased security is accomplished by using short-lived certificates that can easily be revoked in the event of abuse and by never issuing the certificates directly to the developers, preventing them from being stolen in the event of a breach.\n\nMicrosoft also says certificates issued through the Trusted Signing service provide a similar SmartScreen reputation boost to executables signed by its service.\n\n\"A Trusted Signing signature ensures that your application is trusted by providing base reputation on smart screen, user mode trust on Windows, and integrity check signature validation compliant,\" reads an FAQ on the Trusted Signing site.\n\nTo protect against abuse, Microsoft is currently only allowing certificates to be issued under a company name if they have been in business for three years.\n\nHowever, individuals can sign up and get approved more easily if they are okay with the certificates being issued under their name.\n\nA simpler path\n\nA cybersecurity researcher and developer known as 'Squiblydoo,' who has been tracking malware campaigns abusing certificates for years, told BleepingComputer that they believe threat actors are switching to Microsoft's service out of convenience.\n\n\"I think there are a few reasons for the change. For a long time, using EV certificates has been the standard, but Microsoft has announced changes to EV certificates,\" Squiblydoo told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"However, the changes to EV certificates really aren't clear to anyone: not certificate providers, not attackers. However, due to these potential changes and lack of clarity, just having a code-signing certificate may be adequate for attacker needs.\"\n\n\"In this regard, the verification process for Microsoft's certificates is substantially easier than the verification process for EV certificates: due to the ambiguity over EV certificates, it makes sense to use the Microsoft certificates.\"\n\nBleepingComputer contacted Microsoft about the abuse and was told that the company uses threat intelligence monitoring to find and revoke certificates as they are found.\n\n\"We use active threat intelligence monitoring to constantly look for any misuse or abuse of our signing service,\" Microsoft told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"When we detect threats we immediately mitigate with actions such as broad certificate revocation and account suspension. The malware samples you shared are detected by our antimalware products and we have already taken action to revoke the certificates and prevent further account abuse.\"",

Newer artificial intelligence capabilities have been added to these apps, such as an image generator in Paint and AI rewriting of text in Notepad, and -- as reported by PC World earlier this year -- they'll require a paid Microsoft 365 account.\n\nMicrosoft posted some details about the new AI features on one of its blogs back in November.\n\nIt seems as if paywalling the AI features would not affect the ability for Windows users who don't have a 365 subscription to access and use the apps for everything else. Features that are not accessible due to a lack of a subscription may be grayed out in the apps. A representative for Microsoft said the company had no additional comment.\n\nRam Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said that Microsoft's AI move amounts to a freemium strategy that may help build demand for those features. But in the era of AI, there are more variable costs involved with using large-language models for such tasks.\n\n\"This makes delivering new AI features for free a loss-making proposition,\" Bala told CNET. \"Usage-based pricing is going to be much more prevalent for AI products where token usage is a major cost factor for companies.\"\n\nBala said that we'll be seeing more examples of tech companies trying to find a way to price AI-based services.\n\n\"This goes beyond Microsoft. GPT APIs involve token-based pricing, but Mistral recently introduced an OCR product which charges $1 per 1,000 pages,\" Bala noted. \"Companies are going to be experimenting with other forms of resource usages such as number of sessions.\"\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions of dollars in one of the industry's AI leaders, OpenAI, has been introducing AI features into different apps and services, including its Xbox gaming division, and voice and reasoning features for Windows via its Copilot app. Some of the additions have driven up prices in some regions for Microsoft 365, the subscription service it offers for about $10 a month or $99 a year.\n\nNot all of Microsoft's AI efforts have been met with enthusiasm from users. The Copilot feature Recall, which takes snapshots of a user's activities in order to improve search, was delayed, with Microsoft defending itself against claims that the app was a privacy and security nightmare. In December, news emerged that Recall could capture information such as credit card numbers and social security numbers in the course of taking screenshots of user activity.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio, with over 50 years of experience, is arguably one of the most influential investors on Wall Street. Having accurately predicted the 2008 financial crisis, he is often looked upon for insights and the direction the market will likely take in times of uncertainty. He is the brains behind Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund he founded in 1973, which leverages various strategies, including Pure Alpha and macroeconomic analysis, to squeeze optimum returns in the markets.\n\nWhile Dalio gave up his CEO role at Bridgewater Associates in 2017, his sentiments still influenced the hedge fund\u2019s investment strategy and play. Likewise, the hedge fund has remained on top of its game, generating an average return of 11.5% annually while leveraging the Pure Alpha Strategy.\n\nREAD ALSO: Paul Singer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman.\n\nThe outperformance comes as the overall equity market has been in an uptrend amid the artificial intelligence-driven run. Likewise, the US economy staying clear of recession amid high interest has bolstered sentiments about market risk-taking.\n\nEven though the overall equity market has been in an uptrend, billionaire Ray Dalio is sounding the warning bells about an imminent debt crisis. The fact that the US debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to over 122% poses significant risks, according to the founder of Bridgewater Associates.\n\nOver the last two quarters, GDP has been gradually increasing, and unemployment and inflation have been relatively stable. However, Ray Dalio has warned that America\u2019s national debt is a problem that is imminently coming and that it will rock the boat. According to Dalio, the US deficit must drop from a projected 7.2% of gross domestic product to about 3% of GDP.\n\n\u201cWe have a very severe supply and demand problem. Some people think we\u2019ll handle it because we\u2019ve handled it so far. I don\u2019t think they understand the mechanics of debt.\u201d Dalio said\n\nDalio\u2019s caution comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration struggles to retain significant tax cuts while simultaneously cutting the annual deficit, which most recently hit $1.8 trillion.\n\nAccording to Dalio, President Trump has undoubtedly shown that he is not afraid to use economic pressure to further his objectives. An examination of his executive orders since assuming office is sufficient proof that he has what it takes to reduce the US deficit and heightened debt levels.",

Still, a lot of Windows 10 users are sticking with it.\n\nWindows 10 users represent 58.7% of all Windows desktop users, while Windows 11 is at 38.1% according to StatCounter. This is a slight improvement from last month when the gap between the two Windows versions was at its narrowest.\n\nMicrosoft wants its users to make the switch to Windows 11, and in a new message about the upgrade, the company suggested a radical idea: Just get a new computer.\n\nMicrosoft sent an email titled \"End of support for Windows 10 is approaching\" to Windows 10 users and along with giving info about the upgrade to Windows 11, there was also a link to buy a new computer, according to a report from Windows Latest.\n\nIncluded with the link to get a new PC, the email has a FAQ explaining what it means when Microsoft ends support for Windows 10, what users can do with an old computer, and some of the benefits of Windows 11.\n\nThis email is part of Microsoft's approach to get Windows 10 users to make the jump before support ends on October 14.\n\nMicrosoft is sending out emails to all Windows 10 users about the upcoming end of support for Windows 10. pic.twitter.com/i6jlY4RjMqMarch 18, 2025\n\nDo I need a new computer for Windows 11?\n\nIt's very unlikely that Windows 10 users will need a new computer to run Windows 11.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.

Multiple posters said they have computers from the mid-2000s running Windows 11.\n\nEven though most Windows 10 computers should be able to upgrade without any issue, there are lesser-known hardware requirements that could cause an error requiring users to stay with Windows 10.\n\nFor those who insist on staying with Windows 10, Microsoft will offer Extended Security Updates (ESU) for a price. There is a one-time fee of $30 to get Windows 10 updates for another year. After that, anyone on Windows 10 will be completely on their own.\n\nHow to upgrade to Windows 11 from Windows 10\n\nFortunately, Microsoft is making it very easy to upgrade a PC from Windows 11.\n\nIf you're on the old operating system, you're likely already seeing messages about the upgrade. Microsoft is giving away the upgrade to Windows 11 for free, although a blog post from the company went up back in January claiming that this would be a \"limited time deal.\" Microsoft has since deleted that post, confirming with Windows Latest that the upgrade to Windows 11 from Windows 10 will remain free.\n\nMicrosoft claims Windows 11 is safer, has better performance, more functionality and better features such as the controversial Microsoft Recall, which takes snapshots of the computer allowing users to do a search for actions they've done in the past.",

Such abuses, in the commission's eye, include \"imposing unfair purchase or selling prices\u2026.limiting production, markets or technical development\u2026.and applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions.\" On this last basis alone, the commission brought at least five major lawsuits against American firms during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nMeta was fined more than $817 million for tying Facebook and Facebook Marketplace this November. In March, Apple was fined about $1.84 billion for preventing music streaming app developers from informing iPhone users about cheaper streaming services on the App Store. (Spotify\u2014not Apple Music\u2014made up 56 percent of Europe's music streaming market.)

Amazon was threatened with a fine of up to 10 percent of the company's annual revenue for using nonpublic data for its retail business two years earlier. The E.U. General Court only recently overturned a $1.53 billion fine imposed by the commission on Google on the allegation the company had anticompetitively favored its own ad exchange.\n\nThis noncomprehensive list excludes active investigations against American firms such as the one against Microsoft for tying Teams and Office 365.

As spotted by Windows Central, Amazon has categorized the laptop as a returning item. Interestingly, this isn't due to any bug or performance issue; rather, it indicates consumer sentiment. Amazon has not mentioned any particular reason for flagging the product, but we do expect it to be something related to the onboard Snapdragon X Elite platform, and we'll discuss why ahead.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 features the high-end Snapdragon X Elite (12-core) model and does a decent job in terms of performance. However, one of the main reasons Qualcomm's platform is not the optimal option is that it lacks support for applications important for a particular consumer segment and doesn't offer any leverage from existing competitors, such as Intel's Lunar Lake. With return rates increasing, it indicates that consumers are experiencing such problems.\n\nIn addition, existing Qualcomm machines are priced in a way that makes other offers way too attractive. For example, Apple's ARM-based MacBooks offer way more in terms of battery life and OS experience compared to Qualcomm laptops, and they also have a better value-to-money ratio. Intel's co-CEO reported on Qualcomm's laptop return rates a few months ago, claiming that consumer sentiment isn't positive towards the release, which has now been reflected in the Surface Laptop 7 listing.\n\nThe Amazon listing itself has an overall 4.2 rating, with over 364 ratings, so it is likely that the return rates aren't too high, but this is indeed something to notice. For consumers looking for a laptop sub-$1500 budget, the Snapdragon X Elite platform would likely be their least priority. Qualcomm needs to sort this out by entertaining the entry-level consumer or offering better perf/$ value on its upcoming machines.",

This application scans emails in real time as users compose them, identifying potential data loss prevention (DLP) violations, such as Social Security or credit card numbers. Administrators can instantly alert users of violations and take action downstream, whether by blocking or encrypting messages, to prevent sensitive information from leaking. DLP Assist is lightweight, easy to deploy, and helps organizations maintain compliance without disrupting workflow.\n\nMaking DLP more accessible\n\nAfter speaking with our customers, we discovered a common challenge: many wanted to implement a data loss prevention policy for Outlook, but found existing solutions either too complex to set up or too costly to adopt.\n\nThat\u2019s why we created DLP Assist to be a lightweight application that can be installed in minutes. Unlike other solutions, it doesn\u2019t require changes to outbound email connectors or provide concerns about IP reputation to customers. By fully leveraging the Microsoft ecosystem, DLP Assist makes email DLP accessible to all organizations, whether they have dedicated IT teams or none at all.\n\nWe also recognized that traditional DLP solutions often demand significant financial investment in not just software but also in team members to configure and monitor them. DLP Assist aims to eliminate these barriers. Customers can use the application as part of our Email Security product, avoiding the need for additional purchases. Plus, with our DLP engine powered by optical character recognition (OCR), confidence levels, and other detection mechanisms, organizations don\u2019t need a dedicated team to constantly oversee it.\n\nBy eliminating the complexities of legacy DLP and email systems, we allow customers to quickly begin preventing the unauthorized egress of sensitive data. With DLP Assist, organizations can be confident in controlling and protecting the information that leaves their environment.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nOur DLP Assist is an application that integrates with the Desktop (Mac and Windows) and Web Outlook clients, passively scanning emails as they are composed. Running in the background within Microsoft Outlook, DLP Assist continuously monitors new text and attachments added to emails that users are drafting.\n\nWhen a customer downloads and installs the application, Cloudflare creates a unique client ID specifically for emails read from the DLP Assist application, which serves as an identifier solely for use by DLP Assist within Cloudflare\u2019s backend. When a user begins drafting a message, the DLP Assist application invokes several Microsoft Outlook APIs to gather information about how the message is changing. These APIs let the Cloudflare application continuously access different parts of the message like subject, body, attachments, etc. While the application is reading the changes within the message, it also establishes a secure, encrypted connection with a Cloudflare Worker.\n\nAs raw data about the email and attachments is sent to the Worker, the Worker relays the information to our DLP engine, which is at the heart of our scanning process. It leverages OCR technology to analyze attachments, extract text from images, and detect DLP violations across both email content and embedded data. It also examines raw text to ensure a comprehensive analysis of every part of the email and its attachments. While our engine supports most attachment types, it currently does not process video or audio files.\n\nThe DLP engine runs on all of our servers, and we also store the customer DLP profile configuration data on all of our servers. By keeping DLP policy configuration data on all servers alongside our analysis engine, we eliminate the need to reroute requests across our network allowing for low-latency, real-time DLP checks. The customer's client ID enables us to find and apply their defined DLP profiles and accurately determine policy violations, delivering results directly to the Cloudflare Worker. If a violation is found, the Worker responds to the application to take action within Outlook.\n\nOur architecture ensures real-time scanning with minimal latency, as end users are always near a Cloudflare Worker, regardless of their location. Additionally, this design provides built-in resilience \u2014 if a Cloudflare Worker becomes unavailable, another can take over, allowing for uninterrupted DLP enforcement. By scanning in real time, this allows us to provide immediate feedback to the user about any DLP violations that they have within their email, rather than the user having to wait till the message has been sent.\n\nIf a violation is detected, the application first displays an insight message \u2014 a ribbon notification at the top of the email \u2014 alerting the user to the issue. Administrators have full control over this message and can customize it to provide specific guidance or warnings. We find that most of our customers point users to documentation reminding them what is allowed to be sent outside of the organization.\n\nWhen a DLP violation occurs, DLP Assist also injects a header into the EML file to indicate the violation. If the user removes the content that is in violation, the header is automatically removed as well.\n\nIf the violation remains unchanged, DLP Assist invokes a Microsoft Outlook API which prompts the user with a final warning, giving them another opportunity to revise the message before sending.\n\nIf the user proceeds without making changes, the email will be sent from the client with headers embedded into the EML showing that message contains a DLP violation. Organizations can configure their outbound mail transfer agent (MTA) to take appropriate action based on these headers. For those with Microsoft as their outbound MTA, Cloudflare\u2019s DLP Assist integrates with Microsoft Purview , enabling organizations to block, encrypt, or require approval before sending.\n\nFor example, if an organization configures Purview to block the email, users will receive a notification similar to this one.\n\nViolations detected by the DLP Assist application can also be sent externally through our Logpush feature. Customers have the flexibility to integrate this data with SIEM or SOAR platforms for deeper analysis, or store it in bucket storage solutions like Cloudflare R2 . Additionally, customers can enhance their reporting capabilities by viewing block data directly within their outbound gateway.\n\nAs we continue to improve our DLP engine, we're introducing more advanced ways to analyze messages. During Security Week 2025, we\u2019re unveiling new AI methodologies that automatically fine-tune DLP confidence levels using machine learning models. Initially, these enhancements will be rolled out for Gateway violations, but we plan to extend them to email scanning in the near future. For more details, see the associated blog post .\n\nCloudflare One\u2019s DLP Assist is designed for quick deployment, enabling organizations to implement a data loss prevention solution with minimal effort. It allows customers to immediately begin scanning emails for sensitive data and take action to prevent unauthorized sharing, ensuring compliance and security from day one.\n\nHow can I start using it?\n\nTo get started, navigate to the Zero Trust dashboard and click on the Email Security tab. From there, select the Outbound DLP tab.\n\nTo install DLP Assist, organizations can download the manifest file, which provides Microsoft with the necessary instructions to install the application within Outlook. Administrators can then upload this manifest file by going to Integrated Apps within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and selecting Upload Custom Apps:\n\nThis application is best suited for use with OWA (Outlook Web Access) and the desktop (Mac and Windows) Outlook client. Due to Microsoft limitations, a stable experience on mobile devices is not yet available.\n\nMore information can be found within our developer documentation .\n\nWe\u2019re continuously expanding our solutions to help organizations protect their data. Exciting new DLP and Email Security features are on the way throughout 2025, so stay tuned for upcoming announcements.",

Games and Ubisoft alongside tech giants Google, Amazon Games and Microsoft, is described as a categorization tool aimed at unifying a shared industrial language to help a swath of gamers with disabilities.\n\nAs the industry continues to climb toward developing games with accessible attributes, the initiative will not only help players identify what accessibility features are available in any given video game, but more specifically, it will hold studios to task in providing consistent terminology across platforms to describe their accessibility features. For example, if a player is looking for video games with narrated menus or to avoid something that can only be played with a keyboard, they can use the site as a navigation tool to help them find the right game available or upcoming for their needs.\n\n\u201cTens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games,\u201d said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO, in a press release. \u201cWe are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nRELATED: Game Developers Choice Awards 2025 Names \u2018Balatro\u2019 Game Of The Year \u2014 Complete Winners List\n\nDuring the ESA press presentation at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) Thursday in San Francisco, it was revealed that the team had prepared a list of 24 tags (and counting) on their accessible games website. These tags, which will be located on participating companies\u2019 digital shops and product pages, were developed from the feedback of players with disabilities, accessibility advocacy groups and game development teams.\n\nAnna Waismeyer, the Senior Accessibility Research Lead at Microsoft/Xbox, explained the research process further: \u201cIt\u2019s a communication tool between developers and players. So not only did we take into account the players\u2019 needs, we also reached out to developers across all of our studios, across the world to better understand what kinds of accessibility features they would want to communicate to players. And then we tried to strike a balance between meeting the needs of as many players as possible, but also ensuring that the tags would be viable would be something that our developers could adopt and use.\u201d\n\nThe team also explained that the Accessible Games Initiatives also has \u201ccriteria available for developers to use the tags to help them develop their games with accessibility in mind\u201d and that tags that already exist in the disabled gamer community will also be recognized in the marketplace.",

            "content": "Microsoft stock is trying to avoid its longest weekly losing streak since 2008. It's no wonder the Club position has been trying our patience. It's not just the broader market's recent decline that's contributing to a run of seven straight down weeks for Microsoft. To be fair, Meta Platforms is our only big tech stock higher year to date. But zooming out, though, Microsoft has lost nearly 9% over the past 12 months, showing just how much it has been lagging. Its megacap peers are all sharply higher during the same stretch. Ironically, Microsoft's underperformance can be traced back to the same factor that was once its strength: artificial intelligence. Microsoft stock surged nearly 57% in 2023, its best year in well over a decade. The company enjoyed the halo of a first-mover advantage in generative AI through its investment and partnership with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT shortly after launching in 2022 went viral and sparked the current boom in artificial intelligence. Wall Street analysts at the time also continued to celebrate revenue acceleration of Microsoft's Azure, its crucial cloud computing division. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft (MSFT) year-to-date performance Shares of Microsoft continued to surge into 2024, but ran out of steam in the second half of last year after closing at a record high of $467.56 per share back in July. The stock struggled for the rest of 2024, and that weakness has spilled over into 2025 as questions started to surface about whether the software and cloud giant was losing its edge on AI. \"Microsoft has increased investment over the past few quarters at a very rapid rate while, at the same time, their revenue growth has decelerated,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNBC. \"They're spending more to get less. That's what investors have been worried about.\" The other problem, as Luria sees it, is fellow tech giants are catching up. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has come up with a large language model that rivals OpenAI's GPT-4, which Microsoft uses in its data centers so that clients can run AI models in Azure. Amazon, also a Club name, is now offering several models in addition to its own, including one from startup Anthropic. Alphabet's Google and Meta have both made advancements with their AI models \u2014 Gemini and Llama, respectively. Microsoft also has high hopes for its AI productivity tools. But, Salesforce has been hot on its heels. \"A lot of things that Microsoft was first to a couple of years ago are now very, very competitive categories,\" Luria said. \"Microsoft's lead dissipated, and yet they continued to escalate their investments in data center capability.\" He continued, \"That hurt their cash flow. It hurt their margins because they were so focused on AI that they dropped the ball on some of their other businesses, which is why the results deteriorated over the last couple of quarters.\" In fact, Microsoft has delivered light guidance in several recent quarters. Despite his Microsoft's past missteps, Luria and his D.A. Davidson colleagues last week became more bullish going forward against the backdrop of concerns about an economic recession. They upgraded their rating to a buy and raised their price target to $450 per share \u2014 a level that represents 16% upside to Wednesday's close. \"Microsoft has moved to a more rational capex strategy and is the best positioned Mag6 for a slowing consumer,\" the analysts wrote in their note, adding they believe shares \"now properly reflect the drag from previous capex escalation.\" A part of this more rational approach to spending and its expenses involves Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI. In January, the company announced that it's no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. There's also been speculation that Microsoft has developed an in-house AI model that could rival ChatGPT. All of this comes after President Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate Project, a joint venture of OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. \"Microsoft's moving away from OpenAI because it wants to start moderating [spending],\" Luria said. \"OpenAI has been a big driver of Microsoft's spending and now what Microsoft's telling OpenAI is that, 'We want to work with you all to the extent that it makes sense for us. If you want more data center capacity, you'll have to go elsewhere to get it.'\" Bottom line It's hard to watch Microsoft go from leader in the generative AI arms race to the biggest laggard. \"Nothing good is baked into this stock now,\" Jim Cramer said during the Club's March Monthly Meeting. \"While it's too late to sell, we cannot recommend it because of its poor execution.\" Faster AI-related sales in tandem with management moderating its capital expenditures is crucial right now. Investors like the Club want to see that the billions of dollars poured into Microsoft's AI efforts are paying off. \"Microsoft needs to get its house in order,\" Jim added. In his most recent Sunday column , Jim made the case that the handful of Big Tech stocks could rise from the ashes. He cited the group's past outperformance following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. \"I don't want to make a case for buying these six bedraggled stocks just yet,\" he wrote. \"I am just putting it in your head that if we didn't think they would collapse into recession along with the rest of the market two years ago, and we still believed in AI ... then the Mag Seven, ex-Tesla, seem likely to be the only logical places to hide and then to buy.\" Tesla is the only Mag7 stock that we don't own.

(It is impossible to say how much Nvidia invested in most rounds as a specific stake in a round is not usually divulged.)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what these three tech titans \u2014 who have been the most curious when it comes to VC-backed startups in AI \u2014 have done in the past year-plus.\n\nNvidia\n\nJust last year, Nvidia took part in 26 rounds that totaled $18.8 billion, per Crunchbase data. That far outpaces its two dozen deals in 2023, which totaled $4.5 billion.\n\nHowever, to be fair, that dollar total is bloated since the chipmaker took part in xAI\u2019s $6 billion round in November and OpenAI\u2019s massive $6.6 billion deal in October.\n\nAside from those deals, Nvidia also took part in London-based self-driving car startup Wayve\u2019s $1.1 billion round, and data labeling and evaluation startup Scale AI\u2019s $1 billion round that valued it at a stunning $13.8 billion, both in May.\n\nWhat may be most impressive about Nvidia\u2019s AI investing is how it is driving its overall corporate investment strategy. In 2022, Nvidia invested in nine funding rounds, per Crunchbase. In each of the past two years, it has participated in 36 a year.\n\nThe company\u2019s venture arm, NVentures, also has been active \u2014 although on a much smaller scale. Last year it took part in 14 investments, with those rounds totaling $89 million, per Crunchbase data. That\u2019s slightly ahead of 2023, when the investment arm participated in 11 deals that totaled $824 million.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the same cannot be said for Microsoft.\n\nLast year, the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant took part in nine investments in AI startups, with those rounds totaling nearly $10 billion, per Crunchbase data. That was slightly behind 2023, when it participated in a dozen deals that totaled $12.2 billion.\n\nSome of Microsoft\u2019s biggest deals actually overlap with Nvidia, as it also took part in both the previously mentioned rounds for OpenAI and Wayve, as well as massive fundings for Figure and Bright Machines.\n\nHowever, the Windows maker also made headlines when it poured a $1.5 billion strategic investment into United Arab Emirates-based artificial intelligence firm G42.\n\nThe company\u2019s venture arm, M12, has continued to keep up a pretty consistent pace. Last year, the firm took part in 10 funding rounds that totaled $268 million, per Crunchbase data. Similarly, in 2023 it took part in 9 deals totaling $442 million.\n\nMicrosoft has not shifted back to heavily investing in VC-backed startups this year yet, only taking part in a small pre-seed round for GuidenAI.\n\nGoogle\n\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s slight dip in AI funding might be surprising, Google\u2019s drop is extremely eye-catching.\n\nThe search giant saw its corporate investing drop by two-thirds, being part of only four deals that totaled $3.2 million, per Crunchbase data. Its biggest round was co-leading CharacterX\u2019s $2.8 million seed round.\n\nIn 2023, Google took part in a dozen rounds totaling nearly $3.6 billion.\n\nOn the flip side, its venture arm, GV, was quite active last year, taking part in 22 deals that totaled a whopping $1.5 billion, per Crunchbase data. That includes being part of a $250 million Series E for Vercel, a platform that allows companies to develop web applications in the cloud. The new round valued the startup at $3.25 billion.\n\nGV also was part of a $400 million Series D for Lightmatter, a startup that uses light to link chips together and to do calculations for the deep learning necessary for AI. The round valued the company at $4.4 billion.\n\nShifting strategies?\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Google seems to be ramping back up. In January, the search giant invested another $1 billion into Anthropic. Previously, Google had invested $2 billion into the OpenAI rival.\n\nThen last month, Google participated in AI-powered humanoid robotics company Apptronik\u2019s massive $350 million Series A co-led by B Capital and Capital Factory.\n\nWhile Google and Nvidia still seem keen on investing in the startup world, Microsoft\u2019s complex relationship with OpenAI \u2014 both a partner and competitor that seems to be cozying up to the likes of SoftBank and Oracle \u2014 and its retreat in 2024 seem to indicate the tech giant is more focused on internal development.\n\nIt also seems clear Nvidia will continue to invest in and push this current AI ecosystem \u2014 one which it feeds and dominates with its high-performing chips.\n\nRegardless of changing strategies, these three AI players still are bringing a lot of cash to the table for startups looking to make a name for themselves in the AI space.\n\nRelated Crunchbase Pro queries:\n\nRelated reading:\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman",

            "content": "Cybersecurity has become a collective duty that spans both the public and private sectors, said Brad Smith, vice chair and president at Microsoft, when opening his testimony before the US House Homeland Security Committee in June 2024. His statement was underscored by a year of escalating cyberthreats.\n\nThe Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024 identifies Russian-backed hackers, such as Star Blizzard, as having advanced their attempts to target governments, journalists and researchers with spear-phishing tactics like personalised emails. North Korean actors siphoned billions from cryptocurrency markets to fund state initiatives and Iranian groups have adopted ransomware and criminal tactics to disrupt firms around the world. These threats, plus those from non-nation-state hackers, highlight the urgency for businesses to rethink their security strategies, balancing resilience with rapid response to safeguard critical systems and data.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that Microsoft plays a unique and critical cybersecurity role,\u201d said Smith to the House Homeland panel. \u201cNot only for our customers, but for this country. And not only for this country, but for this nation\u2019s allies. This role reflects the wide range of products and services Microsoft provides to individuals and organisations, including cloud services that operate through data centres located in 32 countries around the world. It also reflects the broad cybersecurity work we undertake every day, including for and in close collaboration with the US and numerous allied governments.\u201d\n\nBrad Smith presented testimony on behalf of Microsoft before the US House Homeland Security Committee in June 2024\n\nMicrosoft tracks threat actors to understand their attack targets, techniques and motivation. In 2024 alone, the number of actors traced increased by more than five times, according to the Digital Defense Report. Password attacks occurred at a rate of more than 7,000 per second (up from 579 per second in 2021), and the mean time for the average organisation to identify a data breach was 194 days with containment at 64 days. That\u2019s more than sufficient time for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities, compromise sensitive data and cause significant financial and reputational damage.\n\n\u201cIf 2024 taught us anything, it\u2019s that a proactive, no-compromises approach to security is essential for 2025 and beyond,\u201d writes Joy Chik, president of identity and network access at Microsoft, in a blog titled \u2018Three priorities for adopting proactive identity and access security in 2025\u2019. \u201cAdopting proactive defensive measures is the only way to get ahead of such determined efforts to compromise identities and gain access to your environment.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft launched the Secure Future Initiative in November 2023 to improve how it builds and operates its technology to meet security standards. In May 2024, chairman and CEO Satya Nadella made security Microsoft\u2019s top priority and dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 engineers to the \u201clargest cybersecurity engineering project in history\u201d to address high-priority security tasks.\n\nThe initiative is based on six pillars that protect identities and secrets; protect tenants and isolate systems; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect cyberthreats: and accelerate response and remediation.\n\nTo lead by example, Microsoft is strengthening its own defences. As part of the \u2018protect tenants and isolated systems\u2019 pillar, Microsoft carried out a full inventory of its own environment in a process Chik refers to as a \u201cthorough spring cleaning\u201d and subsequently deleted 730,000 unused applications and removed 5.75 million inactive tenants.\n\nMicrosoft also implemented multifactor authentication (MFA) to encourage secure-by-default practices with customers, a key principle of the initiative. In a 2023 research paper, How effective is multifactor authentication at deterring cyberattacks?, Microsoft reveals that over 99 per cent of MFA-enabled accounts remained secure during its investigation. It also found that MFA reduces the risk of compromise by 99 per cent.\n\n\u201cBased on these results, we strongly advocate for the default implementation of MFA in commercial accounts to increase security and mitigate unauthorised access risks,\u201d writes Microsoft\u2019s research team.\n\nMicrosoft has required MFA for any user signing into the Azure portal and the Microsoft Entra and Intune admin centres since October 2024 and enforced the mandate for the Microsoft 365 admin centre in February 2025. Phase two will roll out later in 2025, extending MFA enforcement to Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure mobile app and infrastructure-as-code tools, with recommendations to migrate user-based service accounts to workload identities.\n\nSafeguarding AI initiatives\n\nIn 2024 alone, generative AI usage jumped from 55 to 75 per cent among business leaders and AI decision-makers, according to IDC\u2019s 2024 AI opportunity study. As AI adoption accelerates, many organisations have begun using AI tools to answer customer service questions, automate repetitive or mundane tasks, speed up product development and more.\n\n\u201cOver 95 per cent of organisations are implementing or developing an AI strategy, which necessitates the need for accompanying data protection and governance strategies,\u201d says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.\n\nFor example, global telecommunications provider Vodafone is using a virtual assistant called TOBi, powered by Microsoft Azure and Copilot, to handle its large number of customer enquiries. Lloyds Banking Group has developed an application with Microsoft Power Apps and Azure AI Services for its customers to communicate with employees in their preferred language. However, if unmonitored, these tools have the potential to render organisations vulnerable to malicious prompt attempts. Cybercriminals achieve this by tricking AI models into ignoring system rules.\n\nOrganisations need to monitor AI models designed to improve customer experiences, such as those who bank online, to avoid cybercriminals manipulating the technology\n\n\u201cThere are two types of prompt attacks,\u201d writes Vanessa Ho in the Microsoft blog post on \u2018Safeguarding AI against jailbreaks\u2019. \u201cOne is a direct prompt attack known as a jailbreak, like if the customer service tool generates offensive content at someone\u2019s coaxing, for example. The second is an indirect prompt attack, say if the email assistant follows a hidden, malicious prompt to reveal confidential data.\n\n\u201cTo help protect against jailbreaks and indirect attacks, Microsoft has developed a comprehensive approach that helps AI developers detect, measure and manage the risk. It includes Prompt Shields, a fine-tuned model for detecting and blocking malicious prompts in real time, and safety evaluations for simulating adversarial prompts and measuring an application\u2019s susceptibility to them.\u201d\n\nWhile generative AI can create vulnerabilities, it also helps to combat cyberthreats. Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI Foundry helps AI developers detect, measure and manage the risk of jailbreaks and indirect attacks. \u201cWe launched Microsoft Security Copilot in April 2024, which helps level the playing field,\u201d says Jakkal. It does this by using Microsoft\u2019s security data and OpenAI\u2019s GPT models to simplify tasks. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love generative AI \u2013 because I think this tool is going to make it easy for everyone to become a defender.\u201d\n\nOrganisations using Security Copilot experienced a 30 per cent reduction in average time to resolve security incidents, according to Microsoft\u2019s Generative AI and Security Operations Center Productivity: Evidence from Live Operations report. And IT admins using Copilot in the Microsoft Entra admin centre spent 45 per cent less time troubleshooting sign-ins and increased accuracy by 47 per cent.\n\nOregon State University, for example, is using Security Copilot alongside Microsoft Sentinel and Defender to automatically process security incident tickets. Automation allows the university to more efficiently query ticket generation so that security analysts can concentrate on higher-priority incidents like system intrusions or potential data breaches instead of routine administrative tasks. Meanwhile, materials manufacturer Eastman is using the solution to upskill its security analysts with step-by-step guidance for response and faster threat remediation. The team also uses Defender solutions to protect workloads in its apps across its Microsoft 365 E5 license.\n\n\u201cWe work in a world where every second matters,\u201d says David Yates, senior cybersecurity analyst at Eastman. \u201cAttackers can move very quickly, so we need to understand how the attack is being deployed and where. Efficiency is crucial.\u201d\n\nSecurity Copilot uses AI to trace security incidents to specific IP addresses, relating clues that may at first seem random and unconnected to expose a larger threat.\n\n\u201cAI gives the asymmetric advantage to the defender over the attacker,\u201d says Charlie Bell, executive vice president of Microsoft Security. \u201cWe don\u2019t have access to all the data, and we can\u2019t see the whole environment. [This means that we] can\u2019t see how an attacker would get from one thing to another. The beauty of AI is that it can see everything, and we can finally reason across a vast space that no human can get to because we can\u2019t perceive everything within our surface area.\u201d\n\nPartner perspectives\n\nWe asked selected Microsoft partners how they are working with Microsoft to better protect organisations from cyberthreats.\n\n\u201cArmor\u2019s deep partnership with Microsoft as a security solutions partner empowers organisations to combat cyberthreats better,\u201d says David Fatovic, director of strategic alliances for Armor Defense. \u201cAs a member of the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association, we collaborate with Microsoft\u2019s go-to-market, product and specialist teams to optimise the deployment and management of Microsoft\u2019s security tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with Microsoft by enhancing Defender with Huntress\u2019s fully-managed endpoint and identity threat detection and response for Microsoft 365 environments, managed by Huntress's 24/7 elite team of threat hunters,\u201d says Chris Bisnett, chief technology officer and co-founder of Huntress. \u201cThese two offerings maximise the value of existing Microsoft licenses and add an extra layer of protection from endpoint threats, session hijacking, credential threat and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s security ecosystem enables us to take a holistic approach to helping businesses strengthen their security posture,\u201d says Nathan Jamieson, chief information security officer at Atech x Iomart. \u201cWith comprehensive protection across endpoints, email and cloud through Defender, organisations can secure their entire digital environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Lighthouse, our deep collaboration with Microsoft is a strategic advantage in protecting organisations from cyberthreats,\u201d says Ron Markezich, CEO of Lighthouse. \u201cWe work directly with Microsoft Security engineers, marketing teams and advisory councils to stay ahead of evolving risks in data security, compliance and generative AI.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Herain Oberoi presented Lighthouse\u2019s Tara Ragan and Erick Bronson with the Compliance & Privacy Trailblazer award at the Microsoft Security Excellence Awards 2024\n\n\u201cM-Files has been built with Microsoft technologies, runs on Azure and is monitored by Fabric,\u201d says Ville Somppi, senior vice president of industry solutions at M-Files. \u201cWe tap into all the available security, threat detection and cyber capabilities in the Microsoft stack.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers with Microsoft environments can use YubiKey, a hardware security key by Yubico, for phishing-resistant, multifactor and passwordless authentication,\u201d says Derek Hanson, vice president of standards and alliances at Yubico. \u201cThe YubiKey is currently the only FIPS certified phishing-resistant solution available for Entra ID on mobile.\u201d\n\nRead more from these partners in the Spring 2025 issue of Technology Record.

            "content": "Greetings, comms pros! Let\u2019s take a look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them.\n\n1 . Google pays out but disputes race bias lawsuit\n\nGoogle paid an ex-employee $28 million after settling a racial bias lawsuit but continued to claim that the company maintained fair employment practices. The class-action suit was originally filed by former employee Ana Cantu and claimed that employees of Latino and Native American ancestry were paid less for similar work than their white and Asian counterparts. The suit relied on a leaked document revealing employee compensation data.\n\nThe tech giant settled the suit but hit back at the allegations, stating that maintains a commitment to fair employment practices.\n\nAccording to the BBC:\n\n\u201cWe reached a resolution, but continue to disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring, and levelling all employees fairly,\u201d a Google spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here that Google is among the many big companies that have rolled back DEI commitments since the beginning of the new presidential administration. For its part, Google removed web pages referencing DEI at the company and stated that it was evaluating changes \u201c following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic,\u201d a direct reference to federal pressures.\n\nWhile Google claims a fair employment environment, in the eyes of some employees (over 6,000 of them if you look at the names added to suit after Cantu\u2019s initial allegations) take issue with that \u2014 and it\u2019s tougher for the tech company to dispute that allegation when it\u2019s rescinding initiatives that affirm a diverse work culture, regardless of the veracity of any claims against the organization.\n\nEmployer reputation (and the employee retention that comes with it) hinges greatly on there being cohesion between what a company claims to be as an employer and what it is in reality. A discrepancy between those two things will make it hard to transparently communicate about your work culture. Alignment between values in statement and practice is a cornerstone of good internal communication and go a long way toward helping sow the seeds of a positive work environment.\n\n2. Microsoft CEO tells employees changes are coming to reviews\n\nMicrosoft chief Satya Nadella told employees in an internal note they\u2019re getting a new chief people officer and will change how performance reviews are conducted. CPO Kathleen Hogan will shift into a new role at the company and she\u2019ll be replaced by Microsoft HR exec Amy Coleman.\n\nNadella said in his note that the shift in leadership and review strategy is due to factors in Microsoft\u2019s business environment and a need to adapt to a new reality.\n\nAccording to Business Insider:\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen time and again throughout our 50-year history, times of great change for the world and for our industry require us to have a mindset that enables us to continually adapt and transform ourselves,\u201d Nadella said in the email. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we are at the forefront of another such moment, with the rapid changes across every industry and business function in this AI era.\u201d\n\nIn moments of major change like a leadership shift, people need to hear directly from their leaders. Nadella being the one to formally break the news here is good practice. He\u2019s also careful to do so in a tone that speaks confidently about a clear path forward for the company amid the changes in the marketplace.\n\nBut we need to examine this message through the lens of recent news that Microsoft let go of around 2,000 employees with a curt notice in January.\n\nAccording to the layoff memo obtained by Inc.:\n\n\u201cThe reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be worth watching to see if Microsoft\u2019s employee comms tactics change under a new regime. Recognition through clear and ever-present comms that employees are the top resource a company has is also a must in these types of change situations. Anything less than those risks stoking the flames of employee discontent and damage to workplace reputation.\n\n3. Study: AI has widely different perceptions at work between colleagues\n\nAI may be causing tensions in the office, according to a new study.\n\nAccording to research from Writer, leaders and employees have vastly different approaches to AI in the workplace. The data found that 89% of C-suite execs in the study reported their companies had an AI strategy, but just 57% of employees agreed with that assessment. Further illustrating the expectation gap between these two groups, 64% of C-suiters said their companies had a high level of AI literacy \u2014 just 33% of employees agreed.\n\nThe fact that there are so many executives who feel their companies have a handle on AI and employees feel the opposite way is striking. This could mean two things. First, executives may be a bit too bullish on their organizational AI capabilities. Second, communication about AI might not be making its way to employees effectively. Both of those situations are problematic.\n\nEffective AI communication needs to be transparent and leave room for a two-way discussion. Anything short of that will open the door for consternation and misunderstandings about the implications of this workplace-altering tech.\n\nHow about some good news?\n\nHave a great weekend comms all-stars!\n\nSean Devlin is an editor at Ragan Communications.

In a blog post about Xbox \u201copening a billion doors,\u201d Microsoft briefly revealed a new Xbox UI that looks a lot more console-like across multiple devices and even appears to list Steam games.\n\nAfter briefly posting an image of a new Xbox UI across multiple devices, Microsoft quickly removed it once The Verge inquired about it.

Xbox chief Phil Spencer has also previously hinted that PC stores like Epic Games Store and Itch.io could one day arrive on Xbox consoles.\n\nMicrosoft has also been working on making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming, and listing Steam games in this app would certainly help. GOG has a similar system in place, so you can see games you own on PC across multiple launchers.\n\nI asked Microsoft to comment on the appearance of this Xbox app UI, but the company didn\u2019t respond in time for publication.",

The company has officially started emailing users with a not-so-subtle reminder that support for Windows 10 will end on October 14, 2025. The message is clear: upgrade now or risk being left behind.\n\nThe email was recently spotted by Windows Latest and comes with a bold headline: \u201cEnd of support for Windows 10 is approaching.\u201d It then provides direct links for users to check their upgrade eligibility or buy a new PC\u2014because, of course, Microsoft would rather you do the latter.\n\nThe reminder also includes a FAQ section to answer some burning questions. Microsoft confirms that after October 2025, Windows 10 devices will no longer receive updates, including critical security patches. While your PC will still work, it will gradually lose compatibility with apps and become more vulnerable to cyber threats.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is what Microsoft doesn\u2019t mention. There\u2019s no real discussion of the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which offers one extra year of security updates for Windows 10 for $30. While Enterprise users have additional options, Microsoft seems reluctant to promote any solution other than upgrading to Windows 11.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nImage source: Microsoft\n\nThe lack of emphasis on the ESU program in this latest Windows 10 end-of-support email might suggest that Microsoft doesn\u2019t expect everyday users to pay for security patches\u2014or that they simply want to push people toward a full upgrade instead.\n\nAnother not-so-subtle nudge in the email is a suggestion to back up files with OneDrive. While this is useful advice, it\u2019s also an obvious attempt to promote Microsoft\u2019s cloud storage service. But don\u2019t worry; OneDrive isn\u2019t going anywhere, and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop working after Windows 10 reaches its expiration date.\n\nFor millions of users still clinging to Windows 10, the decision isn\u2019t so simple, though. Many older PCs aren\u2019t eligible for Windows 11, leaving users with limited options. Then there are the myriad of AI features Microsoft is pushing with Windows 11 that many aren\u2019t huge fans of.\n\nAs the deadline gets closer, Microsoft\u2019s messaging is only going to get louder. Whether you choose to upgrade, pay for extended security, or switch to another OS, Windows 10\u2019s time is officially running out.",

            "content": "Microsoft has announced its updated DirectX Raytracing (DXR) 1.2 alongside next-gen Neural Rendering support across NVIDIA, Intel & AMD hardware.\n\nDirectX Raytracing 1.2 (DXR) & Neural Rendering Announced at GDC, Support Across AMD, Intel & NVIDIA Hardware\n\nAt GDC, Microsoft is unveiling some big updates to its software suite for Windows, which come in the form of DirectX Raytracing 1.2, PIX, Neural Rendering, and more. These technologies will pave the way for the next generation of visual fidelity while focusing on some big performance uplifts for all.\n\nStarting with DXR 1.2 (DirectX Raytracing), Microsoft is introducing two new technologies which include OMM (opacity micromaps) and SER (shader execution reordering), which will help deliver huge performance boosts.\n\nOpacity micromaps s ignificantly optimize alpha-tested geometry, delivering up to 2.3x performance improvement in path-traced games. By efficiently managing opacity data, OMM reduces shader invocations and greatly enhances rendering efficiency without compromising visual quality.\n\nShader execution reordering offers a major leap forward in rendering performance \u2014 up to 2x faster in some scenarios \u2014 by intelligently grouping shader execution to enhance GPU efficiency, reduce divergence, and boost frame rates, making raytraced titles smoother and more immersive than ever. This feature paves the way for more path-traced games in the future.\n\nDXR 1.2 aims to deliver up to 40% improvements in performance during complex scenes as demoed within Remedy's Alan Wake 2 which was showcased at GDC with the latest tech while delivering substantially detailed raytraced visuals.\n\nThe company states that NVIDIA has already embraced these two cutting-edge features and will enable driver support across GeForce RTX GPUs while they are also working with AMD, Intel and Qualcomm for wider adoption.\n\nAnother major aspect that is being introduced by Microsoft is support for cooperative vectors, which is a brand-new programming feature coming to Shader Model 6.9, very soon. With these cooperative vectors, developers can leverage new hardware acceleration engines for vector and matrix operations, allowing them to integrate neural rendering techniques directly within the graphics pipeline.\n\nAll major hardware vendors, including NVIDIA, AMD, & Intel, are on board the Cooperative Vectors and Neural Rendering train:\n\nNeural Block Texture Compression is a new graphics technique that dramatically reduces memory usage, while maintaining exceptional visual fidelity. Overall, our partners at Intel shared that by leveraging cooperative vectors to power advanced neural compression models, they saw a 10x speed up in inference performance.\n\nReal-time path tracing can be enhanced by neural supersampling and denoising , combining two of the most cutting-edge graphics innovations to provide realistic visuals at practical performance levels.\n\nNVIDIA unveiled that their Neural Shading SDK will support DirectX and utilize cooperative vectors , providing developers with tools to easily integrate neural rendering techniques, significantly improving visual realism without sacrificing performance.\n\nMicrosoft will also be delivering updates to Windows WARP (Advanced Rasterization Platform). WARP, a CPU-based software renderer for DirectX, will get enhanced capabilities and performance updates. This renderer runs solely on the CPU and requires no GPU, making it perfect for systems without compatible GPUs for diagnostics. WARP will now be fully compliant with DX12 Ultimate and will get support for all the latest features such as raytracing, mesh shaders and work graphs.\n\nIn addition to this, Microsoft will also have day-one support for DirectX Raytracing 1.2 (DXR) within their DirectX debugger and profile known as PIX, on Windows. All three technologies are going to be available in the preview Agility SDK which lands in late April 2025. The following are some of the demos showcasing the use of Neural Rendering within tech demos:",

What\u2019s new:\n\nAt Microsoft, we believe in creating tools that empower you to work smarter and more efficiently. That\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled to announce the first release of Model Context Protocol (MCP) support in Microsoft Copilot Studio. With MCP, you can easily add AI apps and agents into Copilot Studio with just a few clicks.\n\nWhat\u2019s new: Model Context Protocol integration\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) enables makers to connect to existing knowledge servers and APIs directly from Copilot Studio. When connecting to an MCP server, actions and knowledge are automatically added to the agent and updated as functionality evolves. This simplifies the process of building agents and reduces time spent maintaining the agents.\n\nMCP servers are made available to Copilot Studio using connector infrastructure. This means they can employ enterprise security and governance controls such as Virtual Network integration, Data Loss Prevention controls, multiple authentication methods\u2014all of which are available in this release\u2014while supporting real-time data access for AI-powered agents.\n\nMCP enables our customers to:\n\nEasily connect to data sources: Whether you have a custom internal API or external data providers, the MCP protocol enables smooth and reliable integration into Copilot Studio.\n\nWhether you have a custom internal API or external data providers, the MCP protocol enables smooth and reliable integration into Copilot Studio. Access the marketplace of existing servers: In addition to custom connectors and integrations, users can now tap into a growing library of pre-built, MCP-enabled connectors available in the marketplace. This capability gives you more ways to connect with other tools and makes using them faster and easier.\n\nIn addition to custom connectors and integrations, users can now tap into a growing library of pre-built, MCP-enabled connectors available in the marketplace. This capability gives you more ways to connect with other tools and makes using them faster and easier. Flexible action capabilities: MCP servers can dynamically provide tools and data to agents. This enables greater flexibility while reducing maintenance and integration costs.\n\nTo get started, access your agent in Copilot Studio, select \u2018Add an action,\u2019 and search for your MCP server! (Note: generative orchestration must be enabled to use MCP.)\n\nEach tool published by the MCP server is automatically added as an action in Copilot Studio and inherits the name, description, inputs, and outputs. As tools are updated or removed on the MCP server, Copilot Studio automatically reflects these changes, ensuring users always have the latest versions and that obsolete tools are removed. A single MCP server can integrate and manage multiple tools, each accessible as an action within Copilot Studio. This streamlined process not only reduces manual effort, it means less risk of errors from outdated tools.\n\nThis offering additionally includes Software Development Kit (SDK) support, enabling further customization and flexibility for your integrations. To create your own Model Context Protocol server, the process can be broken down into three key steps:\n\nCreate the server: The first step in integrating Copilot Studio with the MCP is to create a server via one of the SDKs that will serve as the foundation for handling your data, models, and interactions. You can tailor the server to your specific needs, such as enabling it to handle custom model types and data formats or to support specific workflows. Publish through a connector: Once the server is in place, the next step involves creating a custom connector that links your Copilot Studio environment to the model or data source. Consume the data via Copilot Studio: Finally, once the server is set up and the connector is defined, you can begin consuming the data and interacting with the models via Copilot Studio.\n\nBy following these three steps, you create a streamlined, adaptable integration with Copilot Studio that not only connects systems but also enhances your ability to maintain and scale that integration according to your needs.\n\nWe support Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the transport mechanism; this feature is currently in environments in preview regions and will be available across all environments shortly.\n\nLearn more about these new capabilities here: Extend your agent with Model Context Protocol (preview) \u2013 Microsoft Copilot Studio | Microsoft Learn.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the potential of Model Context Protocol and its ability to transform the way users interact with Copilot Studio. But this is just the beginning. Our team is actively working on additional features and improvements to further enhance the integration experience. Stay tuned for more updates, as we plan to introduce even more ways to connect your data and tools effortlessly into Copilot Studio.\n\nWe look forward to your feedback and learning more on how this new capability enhances your experience and helps you unlock the full power of Copilot Studio.",

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we recognize that many of our customers rely on the familiar Microsoft Office suite of applications, including Word, Excel, and Outlook, as the backbone of their daily workflows. In this blog post, we showcase a powerful solution that seamlessly integrates AWS generative AI capabilities in the form of large language models (LLMs) based on Amazon Bedrock into the Office experience. By harnessing the latest advancements in generative AI, we empower employees to unlock new levels of efficiency and creativity within the tools they already use every day. Whether it\u2019s drafting compelling text, analyzing complex datasets, or gaining more in-depth insights from information, integrating generative AI with Office suite transforms the way teams approach their essential work. Join us as we explore how your organization can leverage this transformative technology to drive innovation and boost employee productivity.\n\nSolution overview\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Solution architecture overview\n\nThe solution architecture in Figure 1 shows how Office applications interact with a serverless backend hosted on the AWS Cloud through an Add-In. This architecture allows users to leverage Amazon Bedrock\u2019s generative AI capabilities directly from within the Office suite, enabling enhanced productivity and insights within their existing workflows.\n\nComponents deep-dive\n\nOffice Add-ins\n\nOffice Add-ins allow extending Office products with custom extensions built on standard web technologies. Using AWS, organizations can host and serve Office Add-ins for users worldwide with minimal infrastructure overhead.\n\nAn Office Add-in is composed of two elements:\n\nManifest : A domain-specific XML file that specifies how the Office Add-in integrates with the application. The manifest must be loaded within the Office installation. Refer to the recommended publishing methods. For testing, one can sideload an Office Add-in.\n\n: A domain-specific XML file that specifies how the Office Add-in integrates with the application. The manifest must be loaded within the Office installation. Refer to the recommended publishing methods. For testing, one can sideload an Office Add-in. User Interface: A custom web application that gets integrated into the MS Office experience. One can quickly host such application on the AWS Cloud without managing the underlying infrastructure, for example, with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon CloudFront.\n\nThe code snippet below demonstrates part of a function that could run whenever a user invokes the plugin, performing the following actions:\n\nInitiate a request to the generative AI backend, providing the user prompt and available context in the request body Integrate the results from the backend response into the Word document using Microsoft\u2019s Office JavaScript APIs. Note that these APIs use objects as namespaces, alleviating the need for explicit imports. Instead, we use the globally available namespaces, such as Word , to directly access relevant APIs, as shown in following example snippet.\n\n// Initiate backend request (optional context) const response = await sendPrompt({ user_message: prompt, context: selectedContext }); // Modify Word content with responses from the Backend await Word.run(async (context) => { let documentBody; // Target for the document modifications if (response.location === 'Replace') { documentBody = context.document.getSelection(); // active text selection } else { documentBody = context.document.body; // entire document body } // Markdown support for preserving original content layout // Dependencies used: React markdown const content = renderToString(<Markdown>{ response.content } < /Markdown>); const operation = documentBody.insertHtml(content, response.location); // set properties for the output content (font, size, color, etc.) operation.font.set({ name: 'Arial' }); // flush changes to the Word document await context.sync(); });\n\nGenerative AI backend infrastructure\n\nThe AWS Cloud backend consists of three components:\n\nAmazon API Gateway acts as an entry point, receiving requests from the Office applications\u2019 Add-in. API Gateway supports multiple mechanisms for controlling and managing access to an API. AWS Lambda handles the REST API integration, processing the requests and invoking the appropriate AWS services. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. With Bedrock\u2019s serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and quickly integrate and deploy them into your applications using the AWS tools without having to manage infrastructure.\n\nLLM prompting\n\nAmazon Bedrock allows you to choose from a wide selection of foundation models for prompting. Here, we use Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock for completions. The system prompt we used in this example is as follows:\n\nYou are an office assistant helping humans to write text for their documents. [When preparing the answer, take into account the following text: <text>{context}</text>] Before answering the question, think through it step-by-step within the <thinking></thinking> tags. Then, detect the user's language from their question and store it in the form of an ISO 639-1 code within the <user_language></user_language> tags. Then, develop your answer in the user\u2019s language within the <response></response> tags.\n\nIn the prompt, we first give the LLM a persona, indicating that it is an office assistant helping humans. The second, optional line contains text that has been selected by the user in the document and is provided as context to the LLM. We specifically instruct the LLM to first mimic a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (chain-of-thought reasoning), an effective measure of prompt-engineering to improve the output quality. Next, we instruct it to detect the user\u2019s language from their question so we can later refer to it. Finally, we instruct the LLM to develop its answer using the previously detected user language within response tags, which are used as the final response. While here, we use the default configuration for inference parameters such as temperature, that can quickly be configured with every LLM prompt. The user input is then added as a user message to the prompt and sent via the Amazon Bedrock Messages API to the LLM.\n\nImplementation details and demo setup in an AWS account\n\nAs a prerequisite, we need to make sure that we are working in an AWS Region with Amazon Bedrock support for the foundation model (here, we use Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet). Also, access to the required relevant Amazon Bedrock foundation models needs to be added. For this demo setup, we describe the manual steps taken in the AWS console. If required, this setup can also be defined in Infrastructure as Code.\n\nTo set up the integration, follow these steps:\n\nCreate an AWS Lambda function with Python runtime and below code to be the backend for the API. Make sure that we have Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) available in our runtime, for example, by attaching aLambda layer to our function. Make sure that the Lambda function\u2019s IAM role provides access to the required FM, for example: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"bedrock:InvokeModel\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\" ] } ] } The following code block shows a sample implementation for the REST API Lambda integration based on a Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python) REST API event handler: import json import re from typing import Optional import boto3 from aws_lambda_powertools import Logger from aws_lambda_powertools.event_handler import APIGatewayRestResolver, CORSConfig from aws_lambda_powertools.logging import correlation_paths from aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.typing import LambdaContext from pydantic import BaseModel logger = Logger() app = APIGatewayRestResolver( enable_validation=True, cors=CORSConfig(allow_origin=\"http://localhost:3000\"), # for testing purposes ) bedrock_runtime_client = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\") SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\" You are an office assistant helping humans to write text for their documents. {context} Before answering the question, think through it step-by-step within the <thinking></thinking> tags.

You can follow this tutorial for creating a REST API for the Lambda function by using the API Gateway console. By creating a Lambda proxy integration with a proxy resource, we can route requests to the resources to the Lambda function. Follow the tutorial to deploy the API and take note of the API\u2019s invoke URL. Make sure to configure adequate access control for the REST API.\n\nWe can now invoke and test our function via the API\u2019s invoke URL. The following example uses curl to send a request (make sure to replace all placeholders in curly braces as required), and the response generated by the LLM:\n\n$ curl --header \"Authorization: {token}\" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --request POST \\ --data '{\"user_message\": \"Write a 2 sentence summary about AWS.\"}' \\ https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}/query | jq . { \"completion\": \"<thinking>\n\nTo summarize AWS in 2 sentences:\n\n1.

The user enters their query with some context into the Add-In text input area. Upon sending, the backend will prompt the LLM to generate respective text, and return it back to the frontend. From the Add-in, it is inserted into the Word document at the cursor position using the Office JavaScript API.\n\nText refinement\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Text refinement use-case demo\n\nIn Figure 3, the user highlighted a text segment in the work area and entered a prompt into the Add-In text input area to rephrase the text segment. Again, the user input and highlighted text are processed by the backend and returned to the Add-In, thereby replacing the previously highlighted text.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis blog post showcases how the transformative power of generative AI can be incorporated into Office processes. We described an end-to-end sample of integrating Office products with an Add-in for text generation and manipulation with the power of LLMs. In our example, we used managed LLMs on Amazon Bedrock for text generation. The backend is hosted as a fully serverless application on the AWS cloud.\n\nText generation with LLMs in Office supports employees by streamlining their writing process and boosting productivity. Employees can leverage the power of generative AI to generate and edit high-quality content quickly, freeing up time for other tasks. Additionally, the integration with a familiar tool like Word provides a seamless user experience, minimizing disruptions to existing workflows.\n\nTo learn more about boosting productivity, building differentiated experiences, and innovating faster with AWS visit the Generative AI on AWS page.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nMartin Maritsch is a Generative AI Architect at AWS ProServe focusing on Generative AI and MLOps.

            "content": "Yesterday, three members of Microsoft\u2019s quantum team presented their work towards a topological quantum computer at the APS Global Summit in Anaheim. Last month, the team made waves announcing their first topological quantum chip, the Majorana 1. More quietly, Nokia Bell Labs has been working on their own version of a topological quantum computer, and the company claims it\u2019s demonstrated the key ingredients in 2023. Both efforts represent scientific achievements, but bulletproof evidence of a topological quantum bit is elusive.\n\n\u201cI would say all quantum computing is early stages,\u201d says Bertrand Halperin, emeritus professor of physics at Harvard, who is not involved in either effort. \u201cBut topological quantum computing is further behind. It could catch up; it\u2019s taking a somewhat different path.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Topological Quantum Computer?\n\nQuantum computers run on qubits valued at 0, 1, or some superposition of the two, usually encoded through some local quantum property\u2014say, whether an electron\u2019s spin is up or down. This gives quantum computers different capabilities than their classical cousins, promising to easily crack certain types of problems that are out of reach of even the largest supercomputers. The issue is that these quantum superpositions are very fragile. Any noise in the environment, be it temperature fluctuations or small changes in electric or magnetic fields, can knock qubits out of superposition, causing errors.\n\nTopological quantum computing is a fundamentally different approach to building a qubit, one that in theory would be a much less fragile. The idea is that instead of using some local property to encode the qubit, you would use a global, topological property of a whole sea of electrons. Topology is a field of mathematics that deals with shapes: Two shapes are topologically identical if they can be transformed into each other without tearing new holes or connecting previously unconnected ends. For example, an infinite rope extending into space is topologically distinct from the same rope with a knot in it.\n\nElectrons can \u201ctwist\u201d around each other to form something akin to a knot. This knot is more difficult to tie or untie, offering protection against noise. (This is an analogy\u2014the qubits would not be literal knots. For a full technical explanation, see this \u201cshort\u201d introduction.)\n\nThe issue is that electrons don\u2019t often naturally twist themselves into knots. Theorists have postulated such states could existfor decades, but creating the right conditions for them to arise in practice has been elusive. It\u2019s extremely difficult to make devices that could give rise to knotted electrons, and arguably even more difficult to prove that one has done so.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s \u201cQuantraversy\u201d\n\nThe Microsoft team\u2019s approach to creating knotted electrons is to start with a semiconducting nanowire. Then, they layer a superconducting material on top of this nanowire. Both the semiconductor and superconductor layers have to be almost completely devoid of material defects, and held at millikelvin temperatures. In theory, this allows an electron from the semiconducting layer to use the superconductor to effectively spread out over the whole wire, forming something akin to a rope that can be tied into knots. This rope is called a Majorana zero mode.\n\nDefinitively showing that they\u2019ve created a Majorana zero mode has proven difficult for the Microsoft team. The team and their collaborators claimed they had achieved this milestone back in 2018, but some researchers were unconvinced by the evidence, saying imperfections in the device could have resulted in the same measurements. The paper got retracted. In 2023, Microsoft and collaborators published further evidence that they\u2019ve created Majoranas, although some scientists have remained unconvinced, and say not enough data was shared to reproduce the results. Last month\u2019s claim remains contentious.\n\n\u201cWe are very confident that our devices host Majorana zero modes,\u201d says Chetan Nayak, the lead of the Microsoft effort.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence of even the basic physics of Majoranas in these devices, let alone that you could build a qubit out of them,\u201d says Henry Legg, lecturer at the University of St. Andrews who has authored two preprints disputing Microsoft\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cWe would probably all agree that further experiments and better data are necessary before the issue can be considered closed,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Halperin says.\n\nWhether or not the Microsoft team has created Majorana zero modes, making them is just the first step. The team also has to show they can be manipulated to actually do computations. Several types of operations are required to make the kind of knot that represents 0, untie it and tie it into a knot that represents 1, or create a quantum superposition of the two.\n\nThe most recent paper demonstrated the team\u2019s capability to do one of the necessary measurements. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step,\u201d says Jay Sau, professor of physics at the University of Maryland who has a consulting appointment with the Microsoft team.\n\nIn an unusual move, Microsoft\u2019s quantum team held a limited access meeting at their headquarters at Station Q, and invited several researchers in the field. There, they revealed preliminary results demonstrating another such measurement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a bit of work to do on that side,\u201d says Michael Eggleston, data and devices leader at Nokia, who was present at the Station Q meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise in that system. But I think they\u2019re on a good path.\u201d\n\nTo sum up, the Microsoft team has not yet reached the milestone where the scientific community would agree that they\u2019ve created a single topological qubit.\n\n\u201cThey have a concept chip which has eight lithographically fabricated qubits,\u201d Eggleston says. \u201cBut they\u2019re not functional qubits, that\u2019s the fine print. It\u2019s their concept of what they\u2019re moving towards.\u201d\n\nNokia Bell Labs quantum computing researchers Hasan Siddiquee (right) and Ian Crawley connecting a dilution refrigerator sample loader for cooldown. Nokia Bell Labs\n\nNokia\u2019s Approach\n\nA team at Nokia Bell Labs is also pursuing the dream of topological quantum computers, although through a different physical implementation. The team, led by lifelong topological quantum computing devotee Robert Willett, is sandwiching a thin sheet of gallium arsenide in between two other semiconducting slabs. They then cool the sandwich to millikelvin temperaturesand subject it to a strong magnetic field. If the device properties are just right, this could give rise to a two-dimensional version of a global electronic state that can be knotted up. A qubit would require both the creation of this state, and the ability to controllably knot and unknot it.\n\nRobert Willett and his collaborators have also had trouble convincing the scientific community that what they had on their hands are really the highly coveted topological states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we have a topological state,\u201d says Nokia\u2019s Eggleston, who oversees the quantum computing effort.\n\n\u201cI find it reasonably convincing,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Halperin says. \u201cBut not everyone would agree.\u201d\n\nThe Nokia team has not yet claimed the ability to do operations with the device. Eggleston says they are working on demonstrating these operations, and plan to have results in the second quarter of this year.\n\nProving Topological Quantum States\n\nProving the necessary topological ingredients beyond the shadow of a doubt remains elusive. Practically speaking, the most important thing is not whether the exotic topological state can be proven to be present, but whether researchers can build a qubit that is both controllable and much more robust against noise than approaches that are more mature.\n\nNokia\u2019s team claims that they can maintain error-free quantum states for days, although they cannot control them yet. Data revealed by Microsoft at the Station Q meeting shows their devices remain error-free for 5 microseconds, but they believe this can be improved. (For comparison, a tradition superconducting qubit in IBM\u2019s quantum computer remains error-free for up to 400 microseconds).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people who don\u2019t necessarily agree or want more data,\u201d Nokia\u2019s Eggleston says, \u201cand I think that\u2019s the strength of the scientific community to always ask for more. Our feeling on this is you need to scale up complexity of devices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think at some point you go to the regime where it\u2019s a reasonably good qubit, whether it\u2019s precisely topological or not, that becomes the point of the debate,\u201d Maryland\u2019s Sau says. \u201cBut at that point it\u2019s more useful to ask how good or bad of a qubit it is.\u201d\n\nDespite difficulties, topological quantum computing continues to be\u2014at least theoretically\u2014a very promising approach.\n\n\u201cI look at these other qubit types that we see out there today. They\u2019re really nice demonstrations. It\u2019s great science. It\u2019s really hard engineering. Unfortunately, it\u2019s kind of like the vacuum tube back in the 40s,\u201d Eggleston says. \u201cYou build computers out of them because that\u2019s all you have, and they\u2019re really challenging to scale up. To me, topological qubits really offer the potential that the transistor did. Something small, something robust, something that\u2019s scalable. And that\u2019s what I think the future of quantum computing is.\u201d",

We see this reflected in how customers are using Microsoft technologies around the world. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is unlocking workplace productivity like never before, more than 10 million people use Edge each month to have the web Read Aloud, over 1 million people use Immersive Reader to make webpages easier to read and partners like Tobii Dynavox and Special Olympics are bringing AI to people with disabilities globally. And these are just some of the highlights of what we shared today!\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of the new accessibility products, features and programs announced at the 2025 Ability Summit.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in 2025?\n\nWe announced that the Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for purchase exclusively at Microsoft Store. With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play. The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller. For more details visit Xbox Support.\n\nAnd all our Microsoft hardware comes in packaging designed to be accessible and sustainable. No more plastic clamshells! To help others with accessible packaging, today at the Summit, the Packaging and Content Team at Microsoft published its Accessible Packaging Design Guide, which offers practical guidelines, best practices and strategies to create accessible packaging and foster a trusted customer experience.\n\nAt the Summit, Microsoft teams and partners also shared ways they are working to further advance accessibility through technology:\n\nTobii Dynavox is integrating Microsoft Neural Voice, a capability of Azure AI Speech, into their assistive communication solutions. This AI-powered feature gives more personal options for individuals who use assistive communication devices using eye gaze. Neural Voices are available in over 50 languages within their apps TD Talk and TD Phone.\n\na capability of Azure AI Speech, into their assistive communication solutions.

Later this year, Teams will be able to identify when someone is using sign language and feature them prominently as a speaker in the meeting. These video customizations are part of our ongoing product development to help deliver clear and accessible communication for everyone.\n\n.

Recently, an EY study found that Copilot helped 76% of neurodiverse employees perform better at work by enhancing communication, memory recall and focus. At the Summit, we shared how new simple features like Team Reflow and PowerPoint Designer are helping people do their work. See four early adopters of Copilot in New York share their stories.\n\nYouTube Video Click here to load media\n\nAI comes to Narrator .

The free, virtual training includes the latest on AI and is available for organizations to use in their learning management systems. Speech recognition improved up to 60%. The Speech Accessibility Project, led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, unlocked a breakthrough improving accuracy gains for non-standard speech, and the Azure platform team demonstrated how developers can leverage GitHub Copilot to write accessible code.\n\nThe Speech Accessibility Project, led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, unlocked a breakthrough improving accuracy gains for non-standard speech, and the Azure platform team demonstrated how developers can leverage GitHub Copilot to write accessible code. Special Olympics shared how Copilot has been a game-changing training companion for their coaches and athletes with intellectual and development disabilities for the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Turin, Italy.\n\nAll this progress is possible because of the people who design technology with accessibility in mind. In this way, technology benefits everyone, creating a more productive and efficient workplace. It is beautiful to see that reflected in this profile of Dave Dame, Senior Director of Accessibility and Human Factors at Microsoft, where he shared how accessible technology helps him thrive as a leader.\n\nOnward\n\nFor over 30 years, Microsoft has focused on accessibility in our products. Accessibility makes our tools and technologies easier for everyone and accelerates innovation for the world. From the introduction of Sticky Keys and speech recognition in Windows 95 to Seeing AI in 2016 and beyond, accessibility innovations have benefited people in ways we designed for and ways we could have never expected. Just think about how closed captions are now invaluable for everyone watching videos and calls.\n\nAI has the potential to create significant advancements across every sector of our economy and society. We will continue to be grounded and responsible in our approach as we work to get the latest technology to the people who can benefit from it the most.\n\nWhether this is your first or fifteenth Ability Summit, thank you for joining and we hope you picked up a new feature, skill or nugget that helps you, your community or your organization get the most out of technology. All content will be available to watch after the event.\n\nLet\u2019s move forward together.\n\nTags: accessibility, AI, AI for Accessibility, Azure, Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft Ability Summit, Microsoft Teams, Xb",

            "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency\u2019s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\n\nOn the FTC\u2019s website, the page hosting all of the agency\u2019s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden\u2019s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\n\nOne now deleted blog, titled \u201cHey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?\u201d explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant\u2019s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC\u2019s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled \u201c$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids\u2019 data: A game changer for COPPA compliance\u201d instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,\u201d a source familiar tells WIRED.\n\nAnother removed FTC blog titled \u201cThe Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust\u201d outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act\u2019s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for \u201cexcellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk\u2019s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general purpose government chatbot.\n\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.\n\nRemoving blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place \u201cwarning\u201d labels above previous administrations\u2019 public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.\n\nSince President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson\u2019s criticisms center around the Republican party\u2019s longstanding allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, the New York Times reported in December.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. \"If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,\u201d he said.\n\nSources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.\n\n\u201cThey are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,\u201d the source familiar alleges. \u201cI think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.\u201d",

            "content": "In November 2024, Microsoft Incident Response researchers uncovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT) we named StilachiRAT that demonstrates sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Analysis of the StilachiRAT\u2019s WWStartupCtrl64.dll module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system, such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information, data stored in the clipboard, as well as system information.\n\nMicrosoft has not yet attributed StilachiRAT to a specific threat actor or geolocation. Based on Microsoft\u2019s current visibility, the malware does not exhibit widespread distribution at this time. However, due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape.\n\nMicrosoft security solutions can detect activities related to attacks that use StilachiRAT. To help defenders protect their network, we are also sharing mitigation guidance to help reduce the impact of this threat, detection details, and hunting queries. Microsoft continues to monitor information on the delivery vector used in these attacks. Malware like StilachiRAT can be installed through multiple vectors; therefore, it is critical to implement security hardening measures to prevent the initial compromise.\n\nThis blog presents our detailed findings on all the key capabilities of StilachiRAT, which include:\n\nSystem reconnaissance : Collects comprehensive system information, including operating system (OS) details, hardware identifiers, camera presence, active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, and running graphical user interface (GUI) applications, allowing detailed profiling of the target system.\n\n: Collects comprehensive system information, including operating system (OS) details, hardware identifiers, camera presence, active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, and running graphical user interface (GUI) applications, allowing detailed profiling of the target system.

Anti-forensics and evasion: Employs anti-forensic tactics by clearing event logs, detecting analysis tools, and implementing sandbox-evading behaviors to avoid detection.\n\nTechnical analysis of key capabilities\n\nSystem reconnaissance\n\nStilachiRAT gathers extensive system information, including OS details, device identifiers, BIOS serial numbers, and camera presence. Information is collected through the Component Object Model (COM) Web-based Enterprise Management (WBEM) interfaces using WMI Query Language (WQL). Below are some of the queries it executes:\n\nSerial number\n\nCamera\n\nOS / System info (server, model, manufacturer)\n\nAdditionally, the malware creates a unique identification on the infected device that is derived from the system\u2019s serial number and attackers\u2019 public RSA key. The information is stored in the registry under a CLSID key.\n\nFigure 1. Example of a unique ID stored in the registry\n\nDigital wallet targeting\n\nStilachiRAT targets a list of specific cryptocurrency wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser. It accesses the settings in the following registry key and validates if any of the extensions are installed:\n\n\\SOFTWARE\\Google\\Chrome\\PreferenceMACs\\Default\\extensions.settings\n\nThe malware targets the following cryptocurrency wallet extensions:\n\nCryptocurrency wallet extension name Chrome extension identifier Bitget Wallet (Formerly BitKeep) jiidiaalihmmhddjgbnbgdfflelocpak Trust Wallet egjidjbpglichdcondbcbdnbeeppgdph TronLink ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec MetaMask (ethereum) nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn TokenPocket mfgccjchihfkkindfppnaooecgfneiii BNB Chain Wallet fhbohimaelbohpjbbldcngcnapndodjp OKX Wallet mcohilncbfahbmgdjkbpemcciiolgcge Sui Wallet opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil Braavos \u2013 Starknet Wallet jnlgamecbpmbajjfhmmmlhejkemejdma Coinbase Wallet hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad Leap Cosmos Wallet fcfcfllfndlomdhbehjjcoimbgofdncg Manta Wallet enabgbdfcbaehmbigakijjabdpdnimlg Keplr dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap Phantom bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa Compass Wallet for Sei anokgmphncpekkhclmingpimjmcooifb Math Wallet afbcbjpbpfadlkmhmclhkeeodmamcflc Fractal Wallet agechnindjilpccclelhlbjphbgnobpf Station Wallet aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp ConfluxPortal bjiiiblnpkonoiegdlifcciokocjbhkd Plug cfbfdhimifdmdehjmkdobpcjfefblkjm\n\nCredential theft\n\nStilachiRAT extracts Google Chrome\u2019s encryption_key from the local state file in a user\u2019s directory. However, since the key is encrypted when Chrome is first installed, it uses Windows APIs that rely on current user\u2019s context to decrypt the master key. This allows access to the stored credentials in the password vault. The stored credentials are extracted from the following locations:\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local State \u2013 stores Chrome\u2019s configuration data, including the encrypted key.\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data \u2013 stores entered user credentials.\n\nThe \u201cLogin Data\u201d stores information using an SQLite database and the malware retrieves credentials using the following query:\n\nCommand-and-control (C2)\n\nThere are two configured addresses for the C2 server \u2013 one is stored in obfuscated form and the other is an IP address converted to its binary format (instead of a regular string):\n\napp.95560[.]cc\n\n194.195.89[.]47\n\nThe communications channel is established using TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, selected randomly. Additionally, the malware checks for presence of tcpview.exe and will not proceed if one is present. It also delays initial connection by two hours, presumably to evade detection. Once connected, a list of active windows is sent to the server. Additional technical findings regarding C2 communications functionality are listed in the section below.\n\nFigure 2. The malware delays connection to evade detection\n\nPersistence mechanisms\n\nStilachiRAT can be launched both as a Windows service or a standalone component. In both cases, there is a mechanism in place to ensure the malware isn\u2019t removed.\n\nA watchdog thread monitors both the EXE and dynamic link library (DLL) files used by the malware by periodically polling for their presence. If found absent, the files can be recreated from an internal copy obtained during initialization. Lastly, the Windows service component can be recreated by modifying the relevant registry settings and restarting it through the SCM.\n\nFigure 3. Monitoring for the presence of EXE and DLL files\n\nFigure 4. Start the malware via SCM\n\nRDP monitoring\n\nStilachiRAT monitors RDP sessions by capturing foreground window information and duplicating security tokens to impersonate users. This is particularly risky on RDP servers hosting administrative sessions as it could enable lateral movement within networks.\n\nThe malware obtains the current session and actively launches foreground windows as well as enumerates all other RDP sessions. For each identified session, it will access the Windows Explorer shell and duplicate its privileges or security token. The malware then gains capabilities to launch applications with these newly obtained privileges.\n\nFigure 5. Enumerate RDP sessions\n\nFigure 6. Launch process as another user\n\nData collection\n\nStilachiRAT collects a variety of user data, including software installation records and active applications. It monitors active GUI windows, their title bar text, and file location, and sends this information to the C2 server, potentially allowing attackers to track user behavior.\n\nFigure 7. Registry path for installed software\n\nFigure 8. Read the title of an application window\n\nClipboard monitoring\n\nStilachiRAT has a functionality that is responsible for monitoring clipboard data. Specifically, the malware can periodically read the clipboard, extract text based on search expressions, and then exfiltrate this data. Clipboard monitoring is continuous, with targeted searches for sensitive information such as passwords, cryptocurrency keys, and potentially personal identifiers.\n\nThe list below includes the regular search expressions used to extract certain credentials. These are associated with the Tron Cryptocurrency blockchain that is popular in Asia, especially in China.\n\nCredential Regular expression to extract credential TRX Address `\\bT[0-9a-zA-Z]{33}\\b` TRX Key `\\b(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]{64}\\b` TRX Pass `^\\s*\\b([0-9]*[.]*[a-wy-z][a-z]{2,}[ \\t]*\\b){12}\\s*(\n\n\\$)` TRX Pass `^\\s*\\b([0-9]*[.]*?[a-wy-z][a-z]{2,}\\s*\\b){12}\\s*(\n\n\\$)`\n\nFigure 9. Access clipboard data\n\nFigure 10. Modify clipboard data\n\nThe same search expressions are then used to iterate files in the following locations:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Recent\n\nFigure 11. Access user\u2019s files\n\nAnti-forensic measures\n\nStilachiRAT displays anti-forensic behavior by clearing event logs and checking certain system conditions to evade detection. This includes looping checks for analysis tools and sandbox timers that prevent its full activation in virtual environments commonly used for malware analysis.\n\nAdditionally, Windows API calls are obfuscated in multiple ways and a custom algorithm is used to encode many text strings and values. This significantly slows down analysis time since extrapolating higher level logic and code design becomes a more complex effort.\n\nThe malware employs API-level obfuscation techniques to impede manual analysis, specifically by concealing its use of Windows APIs (e.g., RegOpenKey()). Instead of referencing API names directly, it encodes them as checksums that are resolved dynamically at runtime. While this is a common technique in malware, the authors have introduced additional layers of obfuscation.\n\nPrecomputed API checksums are stored in multiple lookup tables, each masked with an XOR value. During launch, the malware selects the appropriate table based on the hashed API name, applies the correct XOR mask to decode the value, and dynamically resolves the corresponding Windows API function. The resolved function pointer is then cached, but with an additional XOR mask applied, preventing straightforward memory scans from identifying API references.\n\nFigure 12. Example of two function calls that resolve **Sleep()** and **AllocConsole()** Windows APIs\n\nFigure 13. Function that initiates API resolution by identifying the correct lookup table for the checksum\n\nCommands launched from the C2 server\n\nStilachiRAT can launch various commands received from the C2 server. These commands include system reboot, log clearing, credential theft, executing applications, and manipulating system windows. Additionally, it can suspend the system, modify Windows registry values, and enumerate open windows, indicating a versatile command set for both espionage and system manipulation. The C2 server\u2019s command structure assigns specific numbers to what commands it will initiate. The following section presents details on the said commands.\n\n07 \u2013 Dialog box\n\nUses the Windows API function ShowHTMLDialogEx() to display a dialog box with rendered HTML contents from a supplied URL.\n\nFigure 14. Display a message box\n\n08 \u2013 Log clearing\n\nGiven an event log type, the relevant Windows APIs are used to open and then clear the log entries.\n\nFigure 15. Clear event logs\n\n09 \u2013 System reboot\n\nAdjusts its own executing privileges to enable system shutdown and uses an undocumented Windows API to perform the action.\n\nFigure 16. Shutdown the PC\n\n13 \u2013 Network sockets\n\nAppears to contain capability to receive a network address from C2 server and establish a new outbound connection.\n\n14 \u2013 TCP incoming\n\nAccepts an incoming network connection on the supplied TCP port.\n\n15 \u2013 Terminate\n\nIf there\u2019s an open network connection, then close it and disable the Windows service controlling this process. This appears to be the self-removal (uninstall) command.\n\n16 \u2013 Initiate application\n\nThe malware creates a console window and initiates a command to launch the program provided by the C2 operator using the WinExec() API.\n\nFigure 17. Initiate a program\n\n19 \u2013 Enumerate Windows\n\nIterates all windows of the current desktop to look for a requested title bar text. This might allow the operator to access specific GUI applications and their contents, both onscreen and clipboard.\n\n26 \u2013 Suspend\n\nUses the SetSuspendState() API to put the system into either a suspended (sleep) state or hibernation.\n\n30 \u2013 Chrome credentials\n\nLaunches the earlier mentioned functionality to steal Google Chrome passwords.\n\nMitigations\n\nMalware like StilachiRAT can be installed through various vectors. The following mitigations can help prevent this type of malware from infiltrating the system and reduce the attack surface:\n\nIn some cases, RATs can masquerade as legitimate software or software updates. Always download software from the official website of the software developer or from reputable sources.\n\nEncourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.\n\nTurn on Safe Links and Safe Attachments for Office 365. In organizations with Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Safe Links scanning protects your organization from malicious links that are used in phishing and other attacks. Specifically, Safe Links provides URL scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages during mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and links in email messages, Microsoft Teams, and supported Office 365 apps. Safe Attachments provides an additional layer of protection for email attachments that have already been scanned by anti-malware protection in Exchange Online Protection (EOP).\n\nEnable network protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other malicious content on the internet. You can audit network protection in a test environment to view which apps would be blocked before enabling network protection.\n\nGeneral hardening guidelines:\n\nEnsure that tamper protection is enabled in Microsoft Dender for Endpoint.\n\nRun endpoint detection and response in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode.\n\nConfigure investigation and remediation in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.\n\nTurn on Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) protection in block mode in Microsoft Defender Antivirus. PUA are a category of software that can cause your machine to run slowly, display unexpected ads, or install other software that might be unexpected or unapproved.\n\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques.\n\nTurn on Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time protection.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects this threat as the following malware:\n\nTrojanSpy:Win64/Stilachi.A\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following alerts might indicate threat activity related to this threat. Note, however, that these alerts can be also triggered by unrelated threat activity.\n\nA process was injected with potentially malicious code\n\nProcess hollowing detected\n\nSuspicious service launched\n\nPossible theft of passwords and other sensitive web browser information\n\nMicrosoft Security Copilot\n\nSecurity Copilot customers can use the standalone experience to create their own prompts or run the following pre-built promptbooks to automate incident response or investigation tasks related to this threat:\n\nIncident investigation\n\nMicrosoft User analysis\n\nThreat actor profile\n\nThreat Intelligence 360 report based on MDTI article\n\nVulnerability impact assessment\n\nNote that some promptbooks require access to plugins for Microsoft products such as Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nHunting queries\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can run the following query to find related activity in their networks:\n\nLook for suspicious outbound network connections\n\nMonitor network traffic for malicious activity caused by remote access trojans by focusing on identifying unusual outbound connections, irregular port activity, and suspicious data exfiltration patterns that may indicate RAT presence.\n\nOutbound ports associated with common data transfer protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS (port 80/443), SMB (port 445), and DNS (port 53) or less common ports like 16000 used for specific applications and services for network communications might indicate such activity.\n\nLook for signs of persistence\n\nThe malware can be run both as a Windows Service or a standalone component. To identify persistence and suspicious services, monitor for the following event IDs:\n\nEvent ID 7045 \u2013 a new service was installed on the system. Monitor for suspicious services.\n\n\u2013 a new service was installed on the system. Monitor for suspicious services. Event ID 7040 \u2013 start type of a service is changed (boot, on-request). Boot may be a vector for the RAT to persist during a system reboot. On request indicates that the process must request the SCM to start the service.\n\n\u2013 start type of a service is changed (boot, on-request). Boot may be a vector for the RAT to persist during a system reboot. On request indicates that the process must request the SCM to start the service. Correlated with Event ID 4697 \u2013 a service was installed on the system (Security log)\n\nLook for anti-forensic behavior\n\nTo identify potential event log clearing, monitor for the following event IDs:\n\nEvent ID 1102 (Security log)\n\n(Security log) Event ID 104 (System log)\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain/IP/Hash indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.\n\nAdditionally, Sentinel users can use the following query to detect when the security event log has been cleared, a potential indicator of an attempt to erase system evidence.\n\nSentinel users can also use the following query to detect service installations or modifications in service settings, which may indicate potential persistence mechanisms used by attackers.\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\nIndicator Type Description 394743dd67eb018b02e069e915f64417bc1cd8b33e139b92240a8cf45ce10fcb SHA-256 WWStartupCtrl64.dll 194.195.89[.]47 IP address C2 app.95560[.]cc Domain name C2\n\nLearn more\n\nFor the latest security research from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community, check out the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Blog: https://aka.ms/threatintelblog.\n\nTo get notified about new publications and to join discussions on social media, follow us on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-threat-intelligence, and on X (formerly Twitter) at https://x.com/MsftSecIntel.\n\nTo hear stories and insights from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community about the ever-evolving threat landscape, listen to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence podcast: https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/microsoft-threat-intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft is committed to delivering comprehensive customer experience through various Microsoft Offerings.

            "content": "Google, Microsoft Expand AI-Driven Search Capabilities\n\nThe realms of search and AI are becoming increasingly intertwined, with AI models being used more and more for search \u2014 sometimes specifically \u2014 and with traditional search constructs being augmented by AI both on the internet and in enterprise systems. For example, Microsoft has used its partnership with OpenAI to leverage advanced AI in coding, search and just about everywhere else, while Google has been just as adamant in defending its search hegemony with advanced AI.\n\nRecent announcements from both companies highlight a slough of AI capabilities for their search tools.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews and AI Mode\n\nGoogle last week announced it was \"Expanding AI Overviews and Introducing AI Mode.\"\n\n[Click on image for larger view.] AI Mode (source: Google).\n\nAI Overviews are a major generative AI-driven enhancement to Google Search, providing AI-generated summaries at the top of search results. AI Mode, meanwhile, is a new experimental feature in Google Search that provides an all-AI experience, replacing traditional web results with AI-generated responses. It builds upon AI Overviews (formerly known as the Search Generative Experience, or SGE) and represents Google's push toward a more conversational and AI-driven search interface.\n\nThese features were framed in the context of Google's Gemini 2.0 update.\n\n\"As we've rolled out AI Overviews, we've heard from power users that they want AI responses for even more of their searches,\" Google said. \"So today, we're introducing an early experiment in Labs: AI Mode. This new Search mode expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities so you can get help with even your toughest questions. You can ask anything on your mind and get a helpful AI-powered response with the ability to go further with follow-up questions and helpful web links.\"\n\nIn summary, key highlights of the last week's announcement include:\n\nEnhanced AI Overviews: Google is broadening the scope of AI-generated summaries, known as AI Overviews, to address more complex queries. By integrating the advanced Gemini 2.0 AI model, these overviews now offer improved reasoning and multimodal capabilities, enabling users to receive detailed responses to intricate questions.\n\nGoogle is broadening the scope of AI-generated summaries, known as AI Overviews, to address more complex queries.

AI Mode does the heavy lifting for you, intelligently organizing information and gives you easy-to-digest breakdowns.\"\n\nMicrosoft Moves\n\nOf course, Microsoft has been making AI search moves of its own, often focusing on developer tooling for AI-assisted search constructs or AI search within existing software. For example, it has been providing a steady stream of updates to its Azure AI Search initiative, formerly called Azure Cognitive Search. Microsoft characterizes Azure AI Search as the recommended retrieval system for building RAG-based applications on Azure, with native LLM integrations between Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Machine Learning, an integration mechanism for non-native models and processes, and multiple strategies for relevance tuning.",

It's an update I'd encourage all Windows users to install as soon as possible, especially as those zero-day vulnerabilities pose a serious security risk to anyone using a PC.\n\nAs it happens, this update comes with an extra patch that Microsoft didn't initially disclose, or, for that matter, intend: removing Copilot from Windows.\n\nSome users, after installing KB5053598 (Windows 11) or KB5053606 (Windows 10) on their PCs, will notice the update not only unpinned Copilot from the taskbar, but uninstalled the Copilot app as well. Microsoft hasn't disclosed why this issue is present in the latest Windows updates, but says it hasn't seen the bug in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, the version of Copilot directly integrated into Microsoft's office suite.\n\nThe company says it is working on a new update to fix the problem, and, presumably, restore Copilot access to affected Windows users. If you're missing Copilot and want it back before Microsoft issues a new update, you can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and pin it back to your taskbar yourself.\n\nHowever, it's possible you don't want to reinstall Copilot. After all, there are a number of users out there who are searching for ways to disable Copilot, and there are even tools out there that help you remove it from Windows. Perhaps Microsoft actually did you a favor here. There is an irony to the situation, that the company pushing its AI tools so hard\u2014whether you want them or not\u2014just removed them on your behalf as part of a software patch.\n\nThat's not to say Copilot is useless: There are a number of potential benefits the AI tool offers Windows users (and, now, even Mac users). But if you haven't found any benefits to these tools in your work or personal life in the two-and-a-half years since ChatGPT launched this generative AI revolution, you might be content with Microsoft's inadvertent decision to remove its flagship assistant.",

Incidentally, Copilot for Microsoft 365 isn\u2019t affected by the bug.\n\nIt was previously reported that the March update for Windows 11 24H2 PCs is riddled with issues, with users getting unexpected BSOD errors (Blue Screen of Death), crashing SSDs, and errors with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

Another known issue means that system with \u201ccertain Citrix components installed\u201d may not be able to complete the installation of the January 2025 Windows security update.\n\nBoth of these are somewhat irritating for anyone affected.\n\nBut things may be different with the Copilot issue that was acknowledged later. In the release notes for the KB5053598 update, Microsoft advises people that the loved and loathed AI assistant may be deleted by the update:\n\nApplies to: All Users. Symptoms We're aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some devices. The app is unintentionally uninstalled and unpinned from the taskbar. Note: This issue has not been observed with the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Workaround Microsoft is working on a resolution to address this issue. In the meantime, affected users can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and manually pin it to the taskbar.\n\nMicrosoft provides the workaround and says it will be fixing the 'problem' soon, but the chances are that there are a decent percentage of Windows 11 users that will be happy to see the back of Copilot.\n\nImage credit: Simon Lehmann / Dreamstime.com",

            "content": "DeepSeek sent Wall Street into a frenzy on Monday, sending shares of Nvidia (NVDA) cratering more than 17% and raising questions about whether Big Tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are overspending on their own AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nCut to Microsoft and Meta's earnings calls Wednesday night and things were hunky dory. The CEOs of both companies, while acknowledging the efficiency improvements DeepSeek introduced to its AI models, said the Chinese-made AI will ultimately benefit their companies as well.\n\n\u201cThat type of optimization means AI will be much more ubiquitous,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. \u201cAnd so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, seemed to downplay the threat posed by DeepSeek, saying that the industry is constantly changing and DeepSeek\u2019s announcement is simply a part of that ebb and flow.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a number of novel things that they did that I think we\u2019re still digesting, and there are a number of things that they have \u2026 that we will hope to implement in our systems,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nDeepSeek set off alarm bells earlier this week as Wall Street caught wind of the company\u2019s claim that it trained its open-source DeepSeek-V3 AI model, which matches or beats the performance of US models, for just $5 million using less than state-of-the-art chips.\n\nUS companies have spent tens of millions of dollars training their own AI models, leading investors to question whether US tech companies are being outpaced by Chinese rivals and if they actually need to spend so much training their AI systems. And if they can train those systems on less expensive chips, the thinking goes, why are they spending so much building massive, high-priced data centers?\n\nHowever, analysts have questioned DeepSeek\u2019s claims, noting that the company says it didn\u2019t incorporate the \u201ccosts associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data,\u201d into the $5 million figure.\n\nOthers have criticized the fact that DeepSeek developed its model using a technique called distillation, which \u201cteaches\u201d an AI model using questions and answers provided by a larger model.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (AP Foto/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez, archivo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nDuring Meta\u2019s investor call, Zuckerberg said that it\u2019s too early to tell if there\u2019s any need to pull back on investing in AI infrastructure based on DeepSeek\u2019s data. Instead, the CEO said, Meta is better served by investing more in its data centers because the industry is moving to AI models that provide more accurate answers to questions depending on how much computing power they can pull from.\n\nThat, coupled with the billions of users Meta hopes to serve via its AI services, means the upward of $65 billion the company plans to spend on AI infrastructure this year is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll learn otherwise at some point, but I just think it\u2019s way too early to call that,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd at this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Nadella, for his part, said that the company\u2019s fleet of data centers is \u201cfungible\u201d and that its investments help the company scale long-term business.\n\n\u201cThe big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that [are] the customers,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nThe company previously announced it plans to spend $80 billion on its AI buildout in fiscal 2025.\n\nMeta and Microsoft are just the first of the Big Tech companies to report their earnings this quarter. Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) are set to follow Thursday, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) will report their financials on Feb. 4 and Feb. 6, respectively.\n\nAnd each company is certain to have something to say about the latest AI shake-up.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

            "content": "A Microsoft executive made a compelling pitch to mountaineer and physics professor Chetan Nayak in 2000: Join the Redmond, Wash., company and together they would scale nearby Mount Rainier\u2014and build a quantum computer .\n\nHe summited Washington\u2019s highest peak within two years. But the climb toward a workable quantum device continues.\n\nNearly all major tech companies are working to build a practical quantum computer, which they hope will enable leaps forward in fields such as encryption and medicine. Rather than using classical bits that are either zero or one, quantum computing employs a type of bit known as a qubit that can exist in both states at the same time. This helps qubits to process more information than today\u2019s computers and to perform certain calculations exponentially faster.\n\nNayak leads a team at Microsoft that consists of several hundred chemists, engineers and mathematicians who have been trying to build a quantum computer for about 20 years. The group, called Station Q, is taking an approach that is riskier and less widely accepted than approaches employed at rivals such as Alphabet\u2019s Google.\n\nIf it pays off, Microsoft could vault to the front of the industry and disprove numerous doubters in the tech industry and scientific community.\n\nLast month, Microsoft announced that it had created a chip capable of producing a long-elusive particle known as a Majorana that could form the basis for a useful quantum computer, a breakthrough they said could shorten the arrival of a quantum device to years, rather than decades.\n\nWhile some physicists expressed doubt that Microsoft\u2019s claims would survive their scrutiny, Chief Executive Satya Nadella appeared thrilled to have something to show the world. Microsoft spends some $300 million annually on quantum research, according to a person familiar with the matter. While tiny compared with its investments in projects such as artificial intelligence, the spending on Microsoft\u2019s quantum efforts has piled up over two decades with little to show until now.\n\nSuch progress is a stark change from seven years ago, when Nadella dismissed the company\u2019s quantum efforts internally as research with no commercial potential, according to someone who viewed an email he sent at the time.\n\nNayak, 53, describes his quantum research as years of incremental progress punctuated by eureka moments that get the world\u2019s attention, like the Majorana announcement. Then it is back to the grind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really, really hard to explain this any other way other than us being on the right track,\" he said.\n\nNayak communicates daily with colleagues in his Santa Barbara, Calif., lab, as well as in Redmond and Europe. They are keenly aware they are in a race. Google made its own announcement of a quantum-computing advance using a different approach than Microsoft\u2019s in December as did a company called D-Wave Quantum this month.\n\nHooked on quantum\n\nNayak\u2019s fascination with quantum physics started early, when he was a junior at the Manhattan science magnet Stuyvesant High School, when a teacher gave him a copy of a book of lectures by the legendary physicist Richard Feynman.\n\nQuantum physics dates to the early 20th century and challenges the traditional understanding of reality by positing that particles can exist in multiple places simultaneously and influence each other instantaneously across vast distances.\n\nSome executives at Microsoft and other tech companies have been predicting that a useful quantum computer powered by qubits would be commercially available in the next few years for at least a decade.\n\nThe problem has been reliability. All computer chips make errors, but on the ones in today\u2019s PCs and smartphones, the error rates are minimal. On qubits, the slightest disturbance can cause them to make a cascading series of mistakes.\n\nUnder Nayak, Microsoft is tackling the problem with something called a topological superconductor. In it, a single electron is essentially spread across a tiny wire cooled to near absolute zero temperatures. Smearing that electron would form a Majorana particle, which has properties that can be used to make a qubit.\n\nMicrosoft contended in a paper published in the scientific journal Nature last month that it had identified a Majorana and measured the information in it.\n\nQubit controversy\n\nCritics in the world of quantum physics say the Microsoft researchers\u2019 claims that they observed a Majorana particle are a mirage.\n\n\u201cChetan Nayak is running a fraudulent project within Microsoft,\" said Sergey Frolov, a quantum researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. He pointed to a number of alleged discrepancies in the published data that would materially change the outcome of their claims.\n\nJason Zander, the Microsoft executive who oversees Station Q, said he was confident Nayak\u2019s science would stand. The company is set to publish follow-ups to the Nature paper, which an independent set of researchers are reviewing. A Microsoft spokesman said the company holds itself to the highest ethical standards.\n\nIn 2021, two papers in Nature based on research partly funded by Microsoft about building Majorana particles were retracted because of questions about the validity of the research. Microsoft executives said the research wasn\u2019t done by Station Q, but rather a Dutch lab to which the company had ties.\n\nNow that Microsoft says it has shown off a Majorana, Nayak is focused on making the qubits even more reliable and adding more to the chip.\n\nNayak said he doesn\u2019t want to still be working for Microsoft, trying to build a stable qubit chip, in his 70s. And he could finally put an end to the digs he gets from his three children, the oldest of whom was born around the time he joined Microsoft.\n\n\u201cEvery time I say you haven\u2019t cleaned your room yet, they say, \u2018Well look, you haven\u2019t built a quantum computer yet,\u2019\" Nayak said.",

Our exclusive report about an Xbox gaming handheld turned heads, while Microsoft adding support for Copilot to GroupMe caused head scratches.\n\nAdd in soon-to-be-stranded Windows 10 PCs being pitched a chance to switch to ChromeOS, and you have a fun week in the world of tech.\n\nHere are all the biggest headlines from the past week from the worlds of Windows and Microsoft.\n\nXbox gaming handheld\n\nMicrosoft and ASUS are reportedly working together on an Xbox gaming handheld. This concept imagines what that device could look like. (Image credit: Rebecca Spear / Windows Central)\n\nFor years, people have wondered if Microsoft would make a gaming handheld device. And while we won't get the fabled Xbox gaming handheld made by Microsoft just yet, we're getting something awfully close.\n\nOur Managing Editor Jez Corden exclusively revealed Xbox's hardware plans for the next few years, including details on an Xbox gaming handheld being made by a partnership between ASUS and Microsoft.\n\nXbox \"Project Kennan\" is a device similar to the ASUS ROG Ally or Lenovo Legion Go. ASUS is making the device and plans to blend ASUS design with the look of an Xbox.\n\nRELATED: Xbox \"Project Kennan\" gaming handheld: Everything we know so far \ud83c\udfae\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAccording to Corden, Project Kennan will run PC games, meaning exclusive Xbox console titles are off the table.\n\nBetween Xbox Play Anywhere, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, many games are available on Xbox consoles and Windows PCs.\n\nStuck Windows 10 PCs and ChromeOS\n\nChromeOS is a potential alternative for millions of PC owners with devices that are about to get stuck on Windows 10. (Image credit: Future)\n\nRecently, Google shared a list of ways that it has optimized ChromeOS for Microsoft 365. Those improvements could be enough to convince people to try a Chromebook or other device powered by Google's lightweight operating system.\n\nThe best Chromebooks range from affordable devices that can handle the basics to more premium devices with touch screens. You can also turn your old Windows PC into a Chromebook, though there are limits when it comes to which devices are supported.\n\nWith Windows 11 having strict minimum requirements, millions of PCs will get stuck on Windows 10 later this year. Rather than purchase a new device or run an unsupported OS, some people will have the option to convert their PC.\n\nGroupMe integrates with Copilot\n\nGroupMe's latest feature helps improve your chats by integrating Copilot into the app. (Image credit: Future)\n\nIn somewhat surprising news, Microsoft announced an integration between GroupMe and Copilot this week.\n\nThe messaging app GroupMe has been around for well over a decade and Microsoft has owned it since 2011, but the app does not receive much public-facing focus.\n\nGroupMe has a niche following, especially among college students. Now, those students and any other users of GroupMe can enhance their chats with Copilot.\n\nThe timing of the announcement is somewhat ironic, since Microsoft just announced plans to end Skype support later this year. Skype purchased GroupMe in 2011, but it will now reach its end of life before the app it once owned.\n\nMicrosoft 50th Anniversary Event\n\n(Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nMicrosoft is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary.\n\nTo commemorate the event, the tech giant will hold a special event on April 4, 2025. At the event, Microsoft will make new AI and Copilot announcements.\n\nWe don't know much about what will be announced, specifically, but we do know Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CEO of AI Mustafa Suleyman will present on stage.\n\nSince the focus of the event is Microsoft's 50th anniversary, it seems unlikely the company will make a massive announcement, but Nadella and Suleyman might surprise us.\n\nGaming on Snapdragon X PCs\n\nEpic Games and Qualcomm are working on an upgrade to Easy Anti Cheat to add support for Snapdragon X PCs. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nSnapdragon X PCs do many things well, but gaming on the devices can be a mixed bag. Even though some Snapdragon X processors can handle games, there are some limits on the platform due to those chips being built on ARM64 architecture.\n\nOne of the biggest roadblocks is that Snapdragon X PCs generally do not get along well with anti-cheat software. That's about to change thanks to a partnership between Qualcomm and Epic Games.\n\nEpic Games said the following on adding support for Snapdragon X PCs:\n\n\"Hundreds of today\u2019s multiplayer games\u2014including Fortnite\u2014rely on Easy Anti-Cheat to counter hacking and cheating in multiplayer PC games. In addition to releasing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support for Fortnite we will bring this support to developers through an Epic Online Services SDK release. This will enable developers using Easy Anti-Cheat to bring this compatibility to their own games. \"\n\nSupport for anti-cheat software could go a long way in improving the gaming experience on Snapdragon X PCs. Hopefully the partnership between Epic Games and Qualcomm is a sign of things to come.\n\nWindows Central Podcast\n\nCould we see the future of Windows and Copilot next month? | Windows Central Podcast LIVE | 03/13/25 - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf you prefer to listen to your news roundups, our Daniel Rubino and Zac Bowden go in-depth on the latest topics in tech each week during the Windows Central Podcast.\n\nThis week they discussed the future of Windows and Copilot, our exclusive report on Xbox \"Project Kennan,\" and much more.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts\n\nListen on Pocket Casts\n\nSubscribe via RSS\n\nReviews\n\nOur expert called the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 the \"Surface Pro on steroids.\" (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nEach week our experts go hands-on with laptops, tablets, games, and more.

            "content": "The news that Google could bring extension support for Chrome on Android surfaced last year, but we\u2019re yet to see any developments. Firefox, on the other hand, rolled out the same in 2023 and Kiwi was the only Chromium browser (now discontinued) with extensions. Well, not anymore, as the latest version of Microsoft Edge for Android brings extension support.\n\nThe latest stable Edge for Android, version 134.0.3124.57, now comes with browser extensions baked in. For those unaware, Microsoft started working on enabling extensions on Edge back in 2024 in the early builds. The stable version had only a couple extensions, but with the latest update, that number has been bumped to over 20 extensions.\n\nHow to Add Extensions on Microsoft Edge\n\nThe process of adding extensions to Microsoft Edge is pretty straightforward. Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\nLaunch Microsoft Edge and tap on the hamburger icon at the bottom right. From the overflow menu that appears, select Extensions. You should now see a list of extensions. From here, tap on the Get button next to the extension you wish to add, and then tap on Add to confirm.\n\nAlso Read: 12 Microsoft Edge Settings You Should Change for a Better Experience\n\nThe app currently offers up to 22 popular extensions including Dark Reader, Bitwarden, Tampermonkey, Browsec, NordVPN, and Keepa. The Extensions section is marked as Beta now, with the Explore section suggesting more extensions are coming soon. If you use an Android tablet as your daily computer, the new extensions might be one of the best reasons to use Edge on Android.\n\nOnce installed, you can access them using the same Extensions option inside the hamburger menu. Selecting an extension from here pulls up its settings for further customizations. You also get options like enable/disable extensions individually, run in private, and see its permissions.\n\nWhile lacking some of the best browser extensions, Microsoft Edge makes a case for itself that it\u2019s one of the most feature-rich browsers and a great Chrome alternative for Android.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Edge offering extensions on Android? Which extensions would you like Microsoft to bring next? Let us know in the comments below.",

While viewers have complained that ads are annoying, the company doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered about the negative feedback. Amazon is testing some new ads that could make the experience worse.\n\nA report says that Amazon Prime is working on interactive ads, which as the name suggests will have an option to click on the ad. To be precise, such ads will allow the user to add an item featured in the ad, to their Amazon shopping cart. For example, a watch that an actor is wearing in the video.\n\nAmazon Prime will also start displaying ads when you pause a video stream, the ad will be played right on the pause screen. In addition to the two, the company is also preparing Carousel ads that will display various products as you scroll through using your remote. These new ad formats will be enabled for users in the UK.\n\nGoodbye Remote Desktop, hello Windows app\n\nMicrosoft has confirmed that it is retiring the Remote Desktop app. The application allows Windows users to connect to other devices remotely, i.e. over the internet. Now that the app is going away, Microsoft wants users to switch to a different app called the Windows app. The company says that the new app is superior and offers unified access to multiple services such as Windows 365, Azure Virtual Desktop, Microsoft Dev Box. Users may use the Windows app to customize the home screens, it also supports multiple monitors, and dynamic display resolutions.\n\nBut here is the thing, the Windows app does not support Remote Desktop connections or RDP on local networks, it does not work with personal Microsoft accounts. Oddly enough, the Mac, Android, and iOS versions of the Windows app offer such features.\n\nThe Remote Desktop will be removed from the Microsoft Store at the end of May 2025, and it will no longer be updated. Unsurprisingly, the decision to retire a perfectly functional app in favor of a new one that lacks core functionality offered by the former has drawn criticism from users.\n\nWindows bug may cause printers to print automatically\n\nA strange new bug has been discovered in Windows 11, one that is rather spooky! Your printer may print pages on its own. Microsoft has confirmed the bug, and the culprit is none other than Windows Update. Specifically, the issue occurs on computers that have the January 29 2025 Preview Update or later updates installed.\n\nYou may notice that your printer may print random text and data automatically, and sometimes the printout may start with \u201cPOST /ipp/print HTTP/1.12\u201d, but not always. This happens when the Print Spooler service sends IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) messages to the printer, which in turn triggers the print command unexpectedly. Affected printers include those that support USB Print and IPP over USB. According to Microsoft, the automatic printing issue is present in Windows 10 22H2, Windows 11 22H2 and 23H2. It does not affect Windows 11 24H2.\n\nMicrosoft states that it has issued a Known Issue Rollback to resolve the problem on non-managed devices, i.e. computers that are not managed by IT admins. PCs that are managed by system administrators will need to edit a Group Policy to fix the issue.\n\nWatch out for polymorphic Chrome extensions that steal your data\n\nMalicious Chrome extensions aren\u2019t exactly a new thing. But hacking and phishing methods evolve, as do the malware used by threat actors. A new type of malicious Chrome extensions have been unearthed by security experts at SquareX Labs. This strain of malware has been termed polymorphic extension, because they mimic other extensions. Polymorphic extensions use icons of other plugins, and even behave like the original extension when a user installs them on their computer.\n\nThe malicious plugins prompt the user to pin the extension\u2019s icon to the toolbar, and silently begin to scan the list of extensions that are installed in the browser. When the malware detects a high-value extension is installed, i.e. a password manager or financial extension, or something that may contain sensitive user data, it executes some malicious code. For example, when a password manager extension is attacked, the polymorphic extension will change its own icon on the toolbar to resemble the hijacked extension. Then an HTML prompt will ask the user to log in to the password manager, but this user data is stolen and sent to the hackers. The malware restores the original password manager and changes its own icon again, making it difficult to trace the attack.\n\nThe only way to protect yourself from such attacks is to verify the authenticity of the Chrome extension on the Web Store.\n\nMicrosoft releases March 2025 Windows security updates\n\nMicrosoft has released this month\u2019s security updates for Windows. The security patches have fixed a total of 57 vulnerabilities for various Microsoft products and 10 security issues related to third-party software. The March 2025 Windows Update is available for the following versions of the operating system: Windows 10 version 1809, 21H2, 22H2, and Windows 11 version 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2.\n\nWindows 10 users should watch out for the new Outlook app, which gets installed automatically by the March 2025 Windows Update. This also marks the final security update for Windows 11, version 22H2, Home and Pro. Users will be upgraded to newer version of Windows forcibly.\n\nOpenAI wants U.S. to ban DeepSeek due to national security concerns\n\nOpenAI has submitted a proposal to the U.S. government, suggesting it to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence platform, DeepSeek. The American company claims that DeepSeek poses security risks due to its potential ties with the Chinese government, which it believes could compromise national security.\n\nOpenAI has been a vocal critic of DeepSeek, and has even accused it of stealing its data to train its artificial intelligence language models. It also says that the AI market should offer freedom not just to the competition, but also to users, and developers. OpenAI believes The AI Action Plan needs to ensure protect American innovations in AI, while preventing authoritarian governments from misusing their technologies.",

            "content": "There's been plenty of speculation on when Microsoft was going to enter the handheld gaming fray. The Xbox maker appears to have something in the works that may be further along than expected. Microsoft is working with an unknown manufacturer to make its own Xbox-branded gaming handheld, according to a report from Windows Central on Monday.\n\nThe device, said to be codenamed Keenan, will be more PC-focused, run on Windows and center on Microsoft's digital platforms such as the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. This handheld, however, is not necessarily a first-party Xbox handheld, but more of a partnership with the unknown PC gaming company to produce a device that will have the Xbox brand and is expected to come out later in 2025.\n\nWatch this: Xbox Handheld Console Might Launch This Year 01:13\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for confirmation. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has previously discussed creating a gaming handheld. Jason Ronald, Microsoft's vice president of Xbox Gaming Devices & Ecosystem, told The Verge in January that the Windows handheld gaming device experience would change later this year.\n\nHere's everything else we know about the handheld Microsoft is working on.\n\nWhen is the Xbox handheld release date?\n\nThere is no official release date yet set. The most likely time for it to come out would be later in the year, around the holidays, with October being the most likely month.\n\nWho is Microsoft partnering with to make it?\n\nSo far, it's unknown who Microsoft is partnering with. A report from The Verge points to Asus as Microsoft's partner for this endeavor. The handheld market has brought out all the hardware manufacturers to compete with each other, including Acer, Lenovo, Razer, Logitech and MSI. Partnering with Microsoft could be a big boost for Asus over the other competitors as the integration of Windows has been a negative for handhelds as manufacturers have yet to create a user interface that provides as smooth of an experience as Valve does with its SteamOS for the Steam Deck.\n\nWhen will Microsoft reveal the Xbox handheld?\n\nThe most likely time Microsoft will make the big reveal will be in either May or June. June is when most game companies make their announcements as this was when the Electronics Entertainment Expo took place. While that show is not around, the Summer Games Fest has come in to take its place. Microsoft, however, tends to get the announcements rolling early, so it might make the reveal in May.\n\nWhat features will the Xbox handheld have?\n\nThis is still unknown, but Microsoft has been pushing for more devices to work like an Xbox. Back in November, the company started the This is an Xbox campaign promoting all the ways gamers can play their Xbox games away from their consoles, whether it be on laptops, phones or via app on their smart TVs. The report mentions that the handheld could make use of Windows 11 features for gaming, including the Xbox Game Bar, which can monitor the hardware's performance while gaming.\n\nWhat's very likely is that the handheld will make full use of Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere, which allows game owners to play their purchased games on the cloud. Microsoft reportedly wants the handheld to have an interface more akin to the Xbox console dashboard and combine both Xbox and PC games into one library.\n\nWhat hardware will the Xbox handheld have?\n\nThe most likely specs for the handheld would be similar to the latest Windows portable consoles such as the Asus ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go S. Both handhelds, as do several others, use custom AMD processors and GPUs. They also come with at least 16GB of RAM and up to 32GB. These three will be vital to how well the handheld performs when running games.\n\nHow much will the Xbox handheld cost?\n\nReports on the handheld have not established a price. There can be some guesses on the cost based on competing hardware from other manufacturers. The most likely price will be $500 for the new handheld, but it can go higher than that. Handhelds that cost more than $500 usually come with 1TB of storage and an OLED display with a screen larger than eight inches.\n\nWhat about a new Xbox console?\n\nMicrosoft reportedly has plans set in motion to release its next Xbox in 2027. Along with the new console, there might be another handheld with this one being a proper Xbox handheld. What might happen is that the handheld is a lower-powered console, like the Xbox Series S, and the new home console will be more like the Xbox Series X.",

            "content": "Bill Gates had one big question on his mind when he stepped down as CEO of Microsoft.\n\nHe said he wondered, \"Was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence?\"\n\nGates was succeeded first by Steve Ballmer and later by Satya Nadella, though he's become more involved amid the AI race.\n\nIt's not easy handing over the reins of the company you created \u2014 just ask Bill Gates.\n\nGates worried about the company's future when he ended his tenure as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, he said in an interview Microsoft posted Thursday.\n\n\"I've had two successors, and boy, do I feel lucky because as I went off to do the foundation work, the one thing that plagued me was, was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence, and would I be haunted by should I go back, should I not go back?\" he said.\n\nThe billionaire Microsoft cofounder was succeeded as CEO by Steve Ballmer, who led the company from 2000 to 2014.\n\nGates wrote in his his memoir, \"Source Code,\" which came out last month, that he gave a 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school and join Microsoft. Once Ballmer came aboard in 1980, he \"became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,\" Gates wrote.\n\nBallmer was later succeeded by Satya Nadella, who has held the role since taking over in 2014.\n\nGates says his fears were unfounded in hindsight since Ballmer \"took us to new heights\" and Nadella has done well at \"navigating what even today remains one of the most complex CEO jobs in the world.\"\n\nThe company has notched several important milestones since Gates departed as CEO.\n\nIts market cap has grown substantially, hitting a record $3 trillion dollars late last year. The company released the first Xbox in 2001 and has snapped up video game makers Mojang and Activision Blizzard. It also acquired companies like GitHub and LinkedIn. In recent years, it's poured billions into a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\n\"It makes me feel so good that I get to just come in and play a very bit role of doing product reviews, learning about AI, you know, getting some help from Microsoft on the work that I'm doing,\" Gates added. \"And it's allowed me, you know, to throw everything in and to have the incredible resources that my Microsoft ownership created.\"\n\nWhile Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000, he continued to serve on the company's board of directors until 2020, when he stepped down following allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward female employees.\n\nHe has spent much of his time since on the philanthropic foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.\n\nBI's Ashley Stewart reported last year that Gates remains \"intimately involved in the company's operations\" behind the scenes, reviewing products, advising on strategy, and recruiting top executives.\n\nFrank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told BI at the time that Gates' role as a technical advisor, which he began in 2014, hadn't substantially changed since he vacated his board seat.\n\nThe \"insistence on portraying the role of Bill Gates as 'pulling strings' at Microsoft,\" Shaw told BI at the time, \"is fundamentally inaccurate and at odds with reality.\"\n\n\"With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company,\" Gates wrote in 2020 about the move. \"Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals.\"",

            "content": "Credit: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has announced that it's pulling the old Microsoft Remote Desktop tool that you could get in the Microsoft Store. The company is advising users to move over to the shiny new Windows App instead, which takes care of a lot of the same functions\u2014including connecting to PCs remotely, and accessing Windows 365 computers in the cloud.\n\nThe Windows App provides several improvements over Microsoft Remote Desktop, Microsoft says, such as multi-monitor support, dynamic display resolutions, customizable home screens, and a more unified interface. It's designed so you can access the same Windows machines remotely across multiple devices.\n\nIf you're a user of Microsoft Remote Desktop, you need to move over by Tuesday, May 27. However, it's not quite as easy as one app fully and completely replacing another\u2014Microsoft has other similar tools available as well, and there are currently some caveats to using the Windows App.\n\nWhat is and isn't changing\n\nMicrosoft is retiring a single, specific utility here: Microsoft Remote Desktop in the Microsoft Store. The Windows App is essentially its new and modern replacement. However, while the Windows App does cover most of what Microsoft Remote Desktop did, it doesn't cover everything on every platform.\n\nWhat isn't going away is the Remote Desktop Connection feature that's included in Windows: You can still use this as normal. You can also still download and use the more advanced Remote Desktop client for Windows tool, which is aimed at IT administrators and professionals, and comes with features suitable for organizations.\n\nThe Microsoft Remote Desktop app is being retired. Credit: Microsoft\n\nConfused yet? While the Windows App for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Android does allow remote desktop connections at the time of writing, the Windows App for Windows doesn't. For Windows-to-Windows connections, Microsoft recommends using built-in Remote Desktop Connection, \"until support for this connection type is available in Windows App\"\u2014though it doesn't say when that support is going to roll out.\n\nThe Windows App is a good idea, in theory, but it's still a work in progress: Microsoft even has an official known issues and limitations page that you should check if you're moving over from the Microsoft Remote Desktop program (the one that's being retired). It also requires a work or school Microsoft account, so it's not something individual users can access (at least not for now).\n\nHow to set up remote connections\n\nYou can check out our full guide to the Windows App for more details on what this software package is and what it can do, but if you're moving over from Microsoft Remote Desktop, then you're likely to be most interested in setting up remote PC connections. You can do this by clicking the + (plus) button in the top-right corner of the Devices tab, then choosing Add PC from the list.\n\nYou then need to provide a host name or IP address for the computer you're connecting to, as well as setting up the rest of the connection configuration\u2014including how the remote PC is displayed on screen, and which folders are shared with the local PC. When all that's done, click Add to put the computer on your Devices screen, then double-click its thumbnails to establish the connection.\n\nThe new Windows App, on Windows. Credit: Lifehacker\n\nThere's plenty more to the Windows App as well, including the ability to stream Windows machines running on the Windows 365 platform in the cloud. This is a feature that's aimed at business and organization use, though, and to date Microsoft hasn't said anything about letting ordinary consumers run Windows from the cloud.\n\nIf you're connecting to a Windows PC from a Windows PC, then you need to use the old-school method, which is Remote Desktop Connection. First, you need to set up the computer you want to connect to, which must be running a Pro version of Windows. From Settings, choose System and Remote Desktop, then turn on the feature and make a note of the PC name displayed on screen.\n\nThe old Remote Desktop Connection tool lives on. Credit: Lifehacker\n\nOver on the computer you're connecting from, type \"remote desktop connection\" into the search box on the taskbar, then choose the Remote Desktop Connection app when it appears. You'll be prompted for the PC name that was displayed on the other machine, and then the connection is established.",

            "content": "Microsoft is walking back its long-touted commitment to clean energy as the company seeks to build more artificial intelligence data centers in the Midwest. In a recent interview, an executive with the tech giant admitted burning gas \u201cabsolutely would not be off the table\u201d to support the enormous energy demands of AI. Microsoft has purchased more than 1,300 acres of land in Mt. Pleasant, Wis., to build a data center that will use as much electricity as 300,000 Wisconsin homes. It has also announced plans for a smaller cluster of data centers in the Kenosha area.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft walking back its climate commitment is a great example of why we need binding state and federal climate laws, not corporate pledges that are reneged when they become inconvenient to profits and shareholders,\u201d says Clean Wisconsin Energy & Air Manager\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s reference to potential carbon capture and storage at gas plants is unrealistic and a smokescreen,\u201d she adds, noting that investor-owned utility We Energies is using the Mt. Pleasant data center to push through $1.5 billion in new gas powerplants and pipelines. Those construction cases are currently before the Public Service Commission for approval. Last fall, nearly 1,000 Wisconsinites and dozens of environmental groups called on Microsoft to commit to local wind and solar to power its data center.\n\n\u201cThe public deserves more time, real transparency, and a chance to understand the impacts of what\u2019s happening and weigh in on solutions,\u201d says Gallagher. \u201cNatural gas is mostly methane, a potent greenhouse gas with 80 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Much of it escapes into the atmosphere during fracking extraction, processing and transportation. And burning gas at the plants would harm the same Wisconsin communities who have been suffering with coal plant air pollution and dangerous ozone for decades.\u201d\n\nTech companies are beginning to eye water-rich Midwestern states for new AI data centers as climate change puts stress on freshwater resources in other parts of the country and around the world. According to company reports, in 2022, Microsoft\u2019s data centers consumed about 1.7 billion gallons of water worldwide, and Google data centers consumed more than 5.5 billion gallons.\n\nNOTE: This press release was submitted to Urban Milwaukee and was not written by an Urban Milwaukee writer.

To get started, open Snipping Tool and capture a screenshot of any content on your screen. If the image does not automatically open in the app, click on the toast notification to \u201cMark up and share\u201d your image. Select the pen tool and draw a line, arrow, rectangle, or oval over the image \u2013 before letting go of the shape, hold your cursor or pen still for a moment to convert your stroke into a well-formed shape. Resize, move, or adjust your shape as needed before clicking away to let the ink dry.\n\nProtocol Launch\n\nFor developers, Snipping Tool now supports a new and improved protocol launch experience! App callers can now customize which Snipping Tool capture features are shown when invoked from their experience. The protocol is designed to offer improved flexibility, security, and ease of use, aligning closely with familiar HTTP-based interactions. This shift can make use of the protocol more intuitive for developers, and it expands support for better integration with web technologies. To learn more and get started, check out the Launch Snipping Tool developer documentation page.\n\nFEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Apps > Snipping Tool.\n\nNotepad (version 11.2501.29.0)\n\nWith this update, we are introducing the ability to summarize content in Notepad with the help of generative AI.

            "content": "Starting in December 2024, leading up to some of the busiest travel days, Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified a phishing campaign that impersonates online travel agency Booking.com and targets organizations in the hospitality industry. The campaign uses a social engineering technique called ClickFix to deliver multiple credential-stealing malware in order to conduct financial fraud and theft. As of February 2025, this campaign is ongoing.\n\nThis phishing attack specifically targets individuals in hospitality organizations in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe, that are most likely to work with Booking.com, sending fake emails purporting to be coming from the agency.\n\nIn the ClickFix technique, a threat actor attempts to take advantage of human problem-solving tendencies by displaying fake error messages or prompts that instruct target users to fix issues by copying, pasting, and launching commands that eventually result in the download of malware. This need for user interaction could allow an attack to slip through conventional and automated security features. In the case of this phishing campaign, the user is prompted to use a keyboard shortcut to open a Windows Run window, then paste and launch a command that the phishing page adds to the clipboard.\n\nMicrosoft tracks this campaign as Storm-1865, a cluster of activity related to phishing campaigns leading to payment data theft and fraudulent charges. Organizations can reduce the impact of phishing attacks by educating users on recognizing such scams. This blog includes additional recommendations to help users and defenders defend against these threats.\n\nPhishing campaign using the ClickFix social engineering technique\n\nIn this campaign, Storm-1865 identifies target organizations in the hospitality sector and targets individuals at those organizations likely to work with Booking.com. Storm-1865 then sends a malicious email impersonating Booking.com to the targeted individual. The content of the email varies greatly, referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, online promotion opportunities, account verification, and more.\n\nFigure 1. A sample phishing email, purporting to be from a prospective guest.\n\nFigure 2. Another sample phishing email, purportedly requiring the recipient to address negative feedback about a hotel.\n\nFigure 3. Another sample phishing email, purportedly requiring the recipient to verify their Booking.com account.\n\nThe email includes a link, or a PDF attachment containing one, claiming to take recipients to Booking.com. Clicking the link leads to a webpage that displays a fake CAPTCHA overlayed on a subtly visible background designed to mimic a legitimate Booking.com page. This webpage gives the illusion that Booking.com uses additional verification checks, which might give the targeted user a false sense of security and therefore increase their chances of getting compromised.\n\nThe fake CAPTCHA is where the webpage employs the ClickFix social engineering technique to download the malicious payload. This technique instructs the user to use a keyboard shortcut to open a Windows Run window, then paste and launch a command that the webpage adds to the clipboard:\n\nFigure 4. A screenshot of the fake Booking.com webpage, with the fake CAPTCHA overlay outlining the ClickFix process.\n\nThe command downloads and launches malicious code through mshta.exe:\n\nFigure 5. An example of the mshta.exe command that the targeted user launches.\n\nThis campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT. Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.\n\nAll these payloads include capabilities to steal financial data and credentials for fraudulent use, which is a hallmark of Storm-1865 activity. In 2023, Storm-1865 targeted hotel guests using Booking.com with similar social engineering techniques and malware. In 2024, Storm-1865 targeted buyers using e-commerce platforms with phishing messages leading to fraudulent payment webpages. The addition of ClickFix to this threat actor\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) shows how Storm-1865 is evolving its attack chains to try to slip through conventional security measures against phishing and malware.\n\nFigure 6. Diagram illustrating the stages of the infection process in this campaign.\n\nAttribution\n\nThe threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1865 encapsulates a cluster of activity conducting phishing campaigns, leading to payment data theft and fraudulent charges. These campaigns have been ongoing with increased volume since at least early 2023 and involve messages sent through vendor platforms, such as online travel agencies and e-commerce platforms, and email services, such as Gmail or iCloud Mail.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUsers can follow the recommendations below to spot phishing activity. Organizations can reduce the impact of phishing attacks by educating users on recognizing these scams.\n\nCheck the sender\u2019s email address to ensure it\u2019s legitimate. Assess whether the sender is categorized as first-time, infrequent, or marked as \u201c[External]\u201d by your email provider. Hover over the address to ensure that the full address is legitimate. Keep in mind that legitimate organizations do not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information. Always navigate to those organizations directly to sign into your account.\n\nContact the service provider directly. If you receive a suspicious email or message, contact the service provider directly using official contact forms listed on the official website.\n\nBe wary of urgent calls to action or threats. Remain cautious of email notifications that call to click, call, or open an attachment immediately. Phishing attacks and scams often create a false sense of urgency to trick targets into acting without first scrutinizing the message\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nHover over links to observe the full URL. Sometimes, malicious links are embedded into an email to trick the recipient. Simply clicking the link could let a threat actor download malware onto your device. Before clicking a link, ensure the full URL is legitimate. For best practice, rather than following a link from an email, search for the company website directly in your browser and navigate from there.\n\nSearch for typos. Phishing emails often contain typos, including within the body of the email, indicating that the sender is not a legitimate, professional source, or within the email domain or URL, as mentioned previously. Companies rarely send out messages without proofreading content, so multiple spelling and grammar mistakes can signal a scam message. In addition, check for very subtle misspellings of legitimate domains, a technique known as typosquatting. For example, you might see micros0ft[.]com, where the second o has been replaced by 0, or rnicrosoft[.]com, where the m has been replaced by r and n.\n\nMicrosoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.\n\nPilot and deploy phishing-resistant authentication methods for users.\n\nEnforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all accounts, remove users excluded from MFA, and strictly require MFA from all devices in all locations at all times.\n\nConfigure Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click verification of URLs and links in email messages, other Microsoft 365 applications such as Teams, and other locations such as SharePoint Online. Safe Links scanning occurs in addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware protection in inbound email messages in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can help protect your organization from malicious links used in phishing and other attacks.\n\nEncourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.\n\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attack tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants.\n\nEnable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other malicious content on the internet.\n\nEnable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.\n\nEnable Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in Office 365 to quarantine sent mail in response to newly acquired threat intelligence and retroactively neutralize malicious phishing, spam, or malware messages that have already been delivered to mailboxes.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent common attack techniques:\n\nDetection details\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects threat components as the following malware:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following alerts might indicate threat activity associated with this threat. These alerts, however, can be triggered by unrelated threat activity:\n\nSuspicious command in RunMRU registry\n\nSuspicious PowerShell command line\n\nUse of living-off-the-land binary to run malicious code\n\nPossible theft of passwords and other sensitive web browser information\n\nSuspicious DPAPI Activity\n\nSuspicious mshta process launched\n\nSuspicious phishing activity detected\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 detects malicious activity associated with this threat through the following alerts:\n\nThis URL has known registrant pattern for malicious activity.\n\nThis URL impersonates booking.com\n\nThis PDF has generic phishing traits.\n\nThis URL has generic phishing traits.\n\nMicrosoft Security Copilot\n\nSecurity Copilot customers can use the standalone experience to create their own prompts or run the following pre-built promptbooks to automate incident response or investigation tasks related to this threat:\n\nIncident investigation\n\nMicrosoft User analysis\n\nThreat actor profile\n\nThreat Intelligence 360 report based on MDTI article\n\nVulnerability impact assessment\n\nNote that some promptbooks require access to plugins for Microsoft products such as Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nThreat intelligence reports\n\nMicrosoft customers can use the following reports in Microsoft products to get the most up-to-date information about the threat actor, malicious activity, and techniques discussed in this blog.

Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.\u201d\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit , a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features.\n\nEnabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements \u2014 such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more \u2014 will be available on Tuesday, March 18.\n\nNVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available .\n\nRTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5\n\nThe number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles.\n\nAs ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today\u2019s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5.\n\nAt the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its \u201cZorah\u201d technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination.\n\nReturn to \u2018Half-Life 2\u2019 With RTX Demo\n\nThe official release of RTX Remix \u2014 featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades \u2014 lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates.\n\nA year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies.\n\nOver 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios\u2019 Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX.\n\nHalf-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18.\n\nThe remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics.\n\nOver 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out Now\n\nDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time.\n\nDLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates.\n\nIn addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.",

Announced in the final days of the Biden administration, the Trump administration\u2019s new FTC chair Andrew Ferguson will lead the probe. The FTC sent Microsoft a civil investigative demand late last years asking it to provide data about its AI models, including how training data is obtained and how much it costs to train an AI. The civil investigative demand stretches all the way back to 2016 and covers nearly a decade\u2019s worth of data.\n\nWhy the FTC is investigating Microsoft\n\nThe agency will also investigate Microsoft for canceling some of its own internal AI development after agreeing to invest in competitor OpenAI. Microsoft did not disclose its investment in OpenAI to regulators ahead of time, as it should have. The FTC will investigate whether the deal was structured as a partnership in order to circumvent a merger investigation, which could have led to the deal being blocked.\n\nThe FTC also asked for additional details about Microsoft\u2019s data centers and the tech giant\u2019s difficulty obtaining enough computing power to meet customer demands. It also wants more information about how Microsoft licenses software bundles \u2014 competitors have complained that bundles like Microsoft 365 make it difficult to compete against the software giant.\n\nThe FTC said it is seeking to determine whether or not Microsoft\u2019s other businesses give it an advantage over other AI companies and said it hopes to get a better grasp on cloud computing costs through the data provided by Microsoft. These additional details and data will help determine whether or not to bring a case against Microsoft.\n\nThese investigations can take years and often don\u2019t result in charges. Microsoft will likely seek to narrow the scope of the information and data requested, which is a common move during these investigations.\n\nFTC to pursue other cases against big tech companies\n\nThis move indicates that new FTC chair Ferguson intends to keep investigating tech giants \u2014 a commitment he affirmed in his first public remarks at the end of February when he called investigating the tech sector his top priority.\n\nMicrosoft is not the only tech company currently under FTC investigation. Ferguson inherited several cases from the Biden administration, including lawsuits against Amazon Inc. and Meta Inc. (which owns Facebook and Instagram).",

According to Bloomberg (paywalled), which first reported the continued probe this week, the investigation is focused on:\n\nMicrosoft's investment in OpenAI and whether it gives the company an unfair advantage in the AI market.\n\nWhy Microsoft cut funding for its own AI projects after investing in OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud software licensing rules, which competitors say make it harder for them to compete.\n\nThe FTC wants to know if Microsoft's power in other industries gives it an unfair edge in AI and whether its software bundles limit competition. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI without telling regulators in advance, read the complaint from the FTC. The FTC is investigating if Microsoft structured the deal in a way to avoid antitrust reviews while still gaining control over OpenAI's direction.\n\n\"We are working cooperatively with the agency,\" said Microsoft's Alex Haurek, in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump's newly appointed FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, says investigating big tech is a top priority, according to the Bloomberg report.

            "content": "However, besides technology, there are some business models that also allow for strong profitability and cash flow. First, there are energy leaders who are literal cash cows and generate tens of billions of dollars annually from energy operations, which are vital to the world economy and are unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon. Second, there is the financial sector, and particularly banks, which are considered the blood of the world economy \u2013 by intermediating operations worth trillions of dollars annually, the leading banks can capture a tiny share of those transactions, which overall results in giant amounts of net profit. Last but not least, some of the most profitable companies in the world can be found even in more competitive sectors like consumer discretionary.\n\nIn the last decade, the most profitable large cap stocks have mostly clustered in the technology sector, leveraging such factors as the giant global total addressable market and wide margins allowed by the technological advantage. Furthermore, some of these companies took the center of the stage during 2023-2024, a time when the AI megatrend opened a new growth frontier and led to rising stock market concentration; in other words, the most profitable companies became even more profitable. This trend has resulted in a widening gap between the leading tech giants and other sectors, as investors increasingly flock to these high-growth stocks, anticipating continued dominance and innovation.\n\nThe most profitable large-cap stocks, in terms of absolute net profit, are typically concentrated in industries with relatively high barriers to entry and substantial global demand. These include sectors like technology, healthcare, energy and consumer goods, where leaders can benefit from strong market positions, innovation and economies of scale. Furthermore, strong profitability usually translates very well into cash flow, which gives a lot of flexibility with capital allocation \u2013 the companies can either reinvest in growth during favorable times or support the stock price through repurchases when the market is less favorable. Consequently, the advantages of investing in such companies include stability, the potential for consistent revenue growth, and resilience during economic downturns.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe that the most profitable companies can enter the spotlight again at a time when the US and global economy are at an important crossroads. Not only are these companies immune to tariffs and less sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, and consumer health, but they also generate tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every year, which gives them flexibility to adjust to a new regime. Investor sentiment has shifted to a pronounced bearish, as the US stock market officially entered correction mode, with more than a 10% contraction since the February peak. It appears that the fears of Trump tariffs staying for the long-term, as well as the negative impact on GDP growth from major cuts in public funding, are finally hitting the markets. Going forward, as smaller-cap stocks are pressured by uncertainty and deteriorating consumer confidence, profitable large caps can become safe havens and attract capital. The key takeaway for investors is that if one wants to stay invested in the US equity market amid the current turbulent times, they\u2019re better off sticking to the widest moat and most profitable names out there.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of most profitable large cap stocks, we searched for the publicly traded companies with the largest amount of net income generated in the latest financial year and ranked them accordingly. For each company we also include the number of hedge funds that own the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Most Profitable Large Cap Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 317\n\nLast year net income: $88.14 billion\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a global technology company that develops software, cloud computing solutions, and hardware products. Its core offerings include the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365 productivity suite, and Azure cloud platform. The company also provides enterprise solutions, gaming through Xbox, and professional networking via LinkedIn. MSFT serves businesses, governments, and consumers worldwide, offering AI-powered services, cybersecurity tools, and developer platforms. It operates across multiple industries, delivering digital transformation solutions through software, cloud infrastructure, and computing devices.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported strong performance in the latest Q2 with 75% constant currency bookings growth and significant Azure AI contracts. The company\u2019s AI revenue primarily comes from inference and post-training workloads, along with Copilot revenue, totaling $13 billion. MSFT is experiencing capacity constraints in AI infrastructure but expects supply and demand to be in balance by the end of fiscal year 2024. The company is making significant investments in long-term data center assets, with plans to shift towards more server-focused investments once the global footprint is established. Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment exceeds expectations, with customers who initially purchased buying and using more, demonstrating faster adoption than previous enterprise products.\n\nThe partnership with OpenAI remains strategically important through 2030, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) maintaining its position as their primary partner. The company is focused on building a flexible, global AI platform through Azure that can serve all types of workloads, positioning it for long-term growth. Despite some execution challenges in non-AI workloads, MSFT continues to see strong demand for both AI and traditional cloud migrations. The company is experiencing improved margin outlook for FY2025, driven by both AI-related efficiencies and operational cost management. With $88 billion net profit generated in FY2024, MSFT is one of the most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOverall, MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of most profitable large cap stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Microsoft has shed light on an ongoing phishing campaign that targeted the hospitality sector by impersonating online travel agency Booking.com using an increasingly popular social engineering technique called ClickFix to deliver credential-stealing malware.\n\nThe activity, the tech giant's threat intelligence team said, started in December 2024 and operates with the end goal of conducting financial fraud and theft. It's tracking the campaign under the moniker Storm-1865.\n\n\"This phishing attack specifically targets individuals in hospitality organizations in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe, that are most likely to work with Booking.com, sending fake emails purporting to be coming from the agency,\" Microsoft said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe ClickFix technique has become widespread in recent months, as it tricks users into executing malware under the guise of fixing a supposed (i.e., non-existent) error by copying, pasting, and launching deceptive instructions that activate the infection process. It was first detected in the wild in October 2023.\n\nThe attack sequence starts with Storm-1865 sending a malicious email to a targeted individual about a negative review left by a purported guest on Booking.com, and asking them for their \"feedback.\" The message also embeds a link, or a PDF attachment containing one that seemingly directs the recipients to the booking site.\n\nHowever, in reality, clicking on it leads the victim to a fake CAPTCHA verification page that's overlaid on a \"subtly visible background designed to mimic a legitimate Booking.com page.\" In doing so, the idea is to lend a false sense of security and increase the likelihood of a successful compromise.\n\n\"The fake CAPTCHA is where the webpage employs the ClickFix social engineering technique to download the malicious payload,\" Microsoft said. \"This technique instructs the user to use a keyboard shortcut to open a Windows Run window, then paste and launch a command that the webpage adds to the clipboard.\"\n\nThe command, in a nutshell, uses the legitimate mshta.exe binary to drop the next-stage payload, which comprises various commodity malware families like XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT.\n\nRedmond said it previously observed Storm-1865 targeting buyers using e-commerce platforms with phishing messages leading to fraudulent payment web pages. The incorporation of the ClickFix technique, therefore, illustrates a tactical evolution designed to slip past conventional security measures against phishing and malware.\n\n\"The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1865 encapsulates a cluster of activity conducting phishing campaigns, leading to payment data theft and fraudulent charges,\" it added.\n\n\"These campaigns have been ongoing with increased volume since at least early 2023 and involve messages sent through vendor platforms, such as online travel agencies and e-commerce platforms, and email services, such as Gmail or iCloud Mail.\"\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the combination of Booking.com baits and ClickFix to propagate XWorm has also been documented by Cofense, with the company noting that \"this technique was seen almost twice as frequently with XWorm RAT as compared to any other malware family.\"\n\nStorm-1865 represents just one of the many campaigns that have embraced ClickFix as a vector for malware distribution. Such is the effectiveness of this technique that even Russian and Iranian nation-state groups like APT28 and MuddyWater have adopted it to lure their victims.\n\n\"Notably, the method capitalizes on human behavior: by presenting a plausible 'solution' to a perceived problem, attackers shift the burden of execution onto the user, effectively sidestepping many automated defenses,\" Group-IB said in an independent report published today.\n\nOne such campaign documented by the Singaporean cybersecurity company involves utilizing ClickFix to drop a downloader named SMOKESABER, which then serves as a conduit for Lumma Stealer. Other campaigns have leveraged malvertising, SEO poisoning, GitHub issues, and spamming forums or social media sites with links to ClickFix pages.\n\n\"The ClickFix technique marks an evolution in adversarial social engineering strategies, leveraging user trust and browser functionality for malware deployment,\" Group-IB said. \"The rapid adoption of this method by both cybercriminals and APT groups underscores its effectiveness and low technical barrier.\"\n\nSome of the other ClickFix campaigns that have been documented over the past few weeks are listed below -\n\nUse of fake CAPTCHA verifications to initiate a multi-stage PowerShell execution process, ultimately delivering infostealers such as Lumma and Vidar\n\nUse of fake Google reCAPTCHA challenges by a threat actor dubbed Blind Eagle to deploy malware\n\nUse of fake booking confirmation links to redirect users to CAPTCHA verification pages that lead to Lumma Stealer\n\nUse of fake Windows-themed sites to redirect users to CAPTCHA verification pages that lead to Lumma Stealer\n\nThe diverse infection mechanisms of Lumma Stealer is further exemplified by the discovery of another campaign that uses bogus GitHub repositories featuring artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content to deliver the stealer via a loader referred to as SmartLoader.\n\n\"These malicious repositories are disguised as non-malicious tools, including game cheats, cracked software, and cryptocurrency utilities,\" Trend Micro said in an analysis published earlier this week. \"The campaign entices victims with promises of free or illicit unauthorized functionality, prompting them to download ZIP files (e.g., Release.zip, Software.zip).\"\n\nThe operation serves to highlight how threat actors are abusing the trust associated with popular platforms like GitHub for malware propagation.\n\nThe findings come as Trustwave detailed an email phishing campaign that makes use of invoice-related decoys to distribute an updated version of another stealer malware called StrelaStealer, which is assessed to be operated by a single threat actor dubbed Hive0145.\n\n\"StrelaStealer's samples include custom multi-layer obfuscation and code-flow flattening to complicate its analysis,\" the company said. \"It has been reported that the threat actor potentially developed a specialized crypter called 'Stellar loader,' specifically, to be used with the StrelaStealer.\"",

Nobody wants a surprise when it comes to the bill, and this is where Microsoft Cost Management comes in.\n\nWe\u2019re always looking for ways to learn more about your challenges and how Microsoft Cost Management can help you better understand where you\u2019re accruing costs in the cloud, identify and prevent bad spending patterns, and optimize costs to empower you to do more with less. Here are a few of the latest improvements and updates based on your feedback:\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the details:\n\nOptimizing AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) costs\n\nRunning your applications on AKS clusters can significantly reduce costs by optimizing resource utilization, enabling autoscaling, and facilitating shared infrastructure. AKS allows you to set resource limits, ensuring efficient use of resources and preventing over-provisioning. Its autoscaling features adjust the number of pods and nodes based on demand, so you only pay for what you need. By managing data transfer and inter-cluster communication efficiently, AKS helps lower networking costs. Additionally, you can run multiple applications on the same cluster, reducing the need for separate infrastructure.\n\nAmplify human ingenuity Microsoft Azure\n\nIn Cost analysis, you can use Kubernetes views to get visibility into the granular costs of your AKS clusters. The views provide you with visibility into the costs of namespaces running on your clusters and an aggregated view of costs of all resources running in your clusters. You simply need to install the cost analysis add-on to your cluster to enable this experience for your Azure subscriptions.\n\nThese views also provide you with visibility into the Idle costs of your clusters. Idle costs, in simple terms, imply that you are not fully utilizing the capacity of your resources, resulting in under-utilization.\n\nAssets view showing Idle costs per asset:\n\nNamespaces view showing Idle charges for the cluster:\n\nThe good news is that Azure provides you with different tools to minimize your Idle costs, and I strongly recommend you use the rich toolset for optimizing your AKS costs. You can set up your clusters and applications for autoscaling to minimize waste, use node auto provisioning for deciding the optimal VM configuration, and use Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus to monitor utilization metrics. You can also optimize your VM costs by leveraging Spot VMs and taking advantage of savings instruments like Reservations and Savings Plans.\n\nBest practices for cost optimization in AKS Learn more\n\nAll the options available to you for optimizing AKS costs are explained very well in the article below:\n\nAWS (Azure Web Services) connector deprecation\n\nThe Connector for AWS, once built to consolidate Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud cost data in Microsoft Cost Management, will be retired on March 31st, 2025. You will lose access to the connector, and AWS cost and usage data stored in the cost management service, including historical data, will be removed. Please note that we won\u2019t be deleting the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) files you stored in your S3 bucket in the AWS console as part of the connector setup.\n\nPlease transition to your choice of cost management reporting for AWS and follow our instructions to delete your Connector to AWS in the Azure Portal.\n\nAs covered in one of our previous blogs, exporting data in standard FOCUS (FinOps Cost and Usage Specification) format and using an analytics and reporting solution like Microsoft Fabric is a great way to analyze and report on costs from different sources.\n\nExchange of Azure OpenAI Service Provisioned Reservations\n\nAs you perhaps already know, you can enjoy substantial discounts with Azure OpenAI provisioned reservations compared to standard pay-as-you-go pricing. You can lock in lower rates for dedicated capacity, ensuring you have the resources needed to run your powerful AI models. Last month (February 2025), for added flexibility to manage your reservations, we enabled exchange for provisioned reservations directly in the Azure portal. You still have the option to request a refund. To learn more about managing your reservations, please refer to this article.\n\nHelp shape the future of cost reporting\n\nIf you optimize cloud costs in your day-to-day work, from monitoring costs to managing commitments, we would love to hear from you. (All experience levels welcome!) Please take a few moments to complete this short, 5\u201310-minute survey to help us understand your roles, responsibilities, and what\u2019s most important to you when optimizing in the cloud. Your feedback will help us improve our products and services to better meet your needs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Cost Management?\n\nThese are just a few of the big updates from last month. Don\u2019t forget to check out the previous Microsoft Cost Management updates. We\u2019re always listening and making constant improvements based on your feedback, so please keep the feedback coming.",

            "content": "Microsoft on Tuesday released security updates to address 57 security vulnerabilities in its software, including a whopping six zero-days that it said have been actively exploited in the wild.\n\nOf the 56 flaws, six are rated Critical, 50 are rated Important, and one is rated Low in severity. Twenty-three of the addressed vulnerabilities are remote code execution bugs and 22 relate to privilege escalation.\n\nThe updates are in addition to 17 vulnerabilities Microsoft addressed in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of last month's Patch Tuesday update, one of which is a spoofing flaw specific to the browser (CVE-2025-26643, CVSS score: 5.4).\n\nThe six vulnerabilities that have come under active exploitation are listed below -\n\nCVE-2025-24983 (CVSS score: 7.0) - A Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability that allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally\n\n(CVSS score: 7.0) - A Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability that allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally CVE-2025-24984 (CVSS score: 4.6) - A Windows NTFS information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker with physical access to a target device and the ability to plug in a malicious USB drive to potentially read portions of heap memory\n\n(CVSS score: 4.6) - A Windows NTFS information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker with physical access to a target device and the ability to plug in a malicious USB drive to potentially read portions of heap memory CVE-2025-24985 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An integer overflow vulnerability in Windows Fast FAT File System Driver that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally\n\n(CVSS score: 7.8) - An integer overflow vulnerability in Windows Fast FAT File System Driver that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally CVE-2025-24991 (CVSS score: 5.5) - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally\n\n(CVSS score: 5.5) - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally CVE-2025-24993 (CVSS score: 7.8) - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally\n\n(CVSS score: 7.8) - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Windows NTFS that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally CVE-2025-26633 (CVSS score: 7.0) - An improper neutralization vulnerability in Microsoft Management Console that allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature locally\n\nESET, which is credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2025-24983, said it first discovered the zero-day exploit in the wild in March 2023 and delivered via a backdoor named PipeMagic on compromised hosts.\n\n\"The vulnerability is a use-after-free in Win32k driver,\" the Slovakian company noted. \"In a certain scenario achieved using the WaitForInputIdle API, the W32PROCESS structure gets dereferenced one more time than it should, causing UAF. To reach the vulnerability, a race condition must be won.\"\n\nPipeMagic, first discovered in 2022, is a plugin-based trojan that has targeted entities in Asia and Saudi Arabia, with the malware distributed in the form of a fake OpenAI ChatGPT application in late 2024 campaigns.\n\n\"One of unique features of PipeMagic is that it generates a 16-byte random array to create a named pipe in the format \\\\.\\pipe\\1.<hex string>,\" Kaspersky revealed in October 2024. \"It spawns a thread that continuously creates this pipe, reads data from it, and then destroys it.\"\n\n\"This pipe is used for receiving encoded payloads, stop signals via the default local interface. PipeMagic usually works with multiple plugins downloaded from a command-and-control (C2) server, which, in this case, was hosted on Microsoft Azure.\"\n\nThe Zero Day Initiative noted that CVE-2025-26633 stems from how MSC files are handled, allowing an attacker to evade file reputation protections and execute code in the context of the current user. The activity has been linked to a threat actor tracked as EncryptHub (aka LARVA-208).\n\nAction1 pointed out that threat actors could chain the four vulnerabilities affecting core Windows file system components to cause remote code execution (CVE-2025-24985 and CVE-2025-24993) and information disclosure (CVE-2025-24984 and CVE-2025-24991). All the four bugs were reported anonymously.\n\n\"Specifically, the exploit relies on the attacker crafting a malicious VHD file and convincing a user to open or mount a VHD file,\" Kev Breen, senior director of threat research at Immersive, said. \"VHDs are Virtual Hard Disks and are typically associated with storing the operating system for virtual machines.\"\n\n\"Whilst they are more typically associated with Virtual Machines, we have seen examples over the years where threat actors use VHD or VHDX files as part of phishing campaigns to smuggle malware payloads past AV solutions. Depending on the configuration of Windows systems, simply double-clicking on a VHD file could be enough to mount the container and, therefore, execute any payloads contained within the malicious file.\"\n\nAccording to Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, CVE-2025-26633 is the second flaw in MMC to be exploited in the wild as a zero-day after CVE-2024-43572 and CVE-2025-24985 is the first vulnerability in the Windows Fast FAT File System Driver since March 2022. It's also the first to be exploited in the wild as a zero-day.\n\nAs is customary, it's currently not known the remaining vulnerabilities are being exploited, in what context, and the exact scale of the attacks. The development has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add them to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by April 1, 2025.\n\nSoftware Patches from Other Vendors\n\nIn addition to Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors over the past several weeks to rectify several vulnerabilities, including \u2014",

            "content": "Column My decade-old and very well-travelled 13\" MacBook Pro finally died, and I hoped my new-ish M2 iPad Pro could replace it.\n\nYet no matter how hard I try, an iPad cannot serve me like a Mac does and I can\u2019t help but wonder why.\n\nSome of it must be my mindset: Nearly 50 years of using computers equipped with keyboards and screens \"programmed\" me with certain expectations. Fourteen years of using iPads has programmed me with a very different set of capabilities.\n\nI think I could unlearn some habits but only after enormous efforts.\n\nOperating systems therefore look like another reason I can\u2019t make the iPad my main machine.\n\nI've written about the M2 iPad Pro and M2 MacBook Air sharing many components yet running different OSes. But even if I could somehow get macOS running on my iPad Pro, would that resolve this tension?\n\nI don't think so. A tablet lacks a keyboard and trackpad and even if I buy models designed for the iPad, tablets are all about push, poke, and drag.\n\nSteve Jobs reportedly held back the release of the iPad (despite huge pent-up-demand) until he felt the iPad interface reflected more than just a 'scaled up iPhone'. What we see today is the outcome of almost two decades of design choices that have only recently started to accommodate keyboards and external pointing devices.\n\nAny computer that can't offer me a terminal window, root access, and the ability to type \"python\" to get into a REPL shell feels fake - an incomplete simulation of a real computer. Yes, I have iSH and aShell on my iPad Pro - great tools, yet neither offering the kind of power that I need when using PyTorch (which runs great on a bare-metal M2).\n\nI could single out Apple for its ridiculous policies that make iPads less useful than Macs, but Cupertino is not alone: Microsoft won't let users upgrade their older boxen to Windows 11. I have a first-generation Surface Go (magically, both a laptop and a tablet) that still works perfectly, and which will become so much electronic detritus later this year because Microsoft refuses to let its own hardware run its own operating system.\n\nIt's infuriating, largely because it all feels so self-serving.\n\nThe promises of \"safety and security\" vendors intone as they guide us into their monopolistic cages mean something very different when looking out from inside those bars. Safety feels like vulnerability, and security becomes entirely dependent on the steady attention of a vendor that suddenly has no fears about losing customers even if they fumble the ball.\n\nCrowdstrike, anyone?\n\nI already know I'll ignore my misgivings and buy an M4 MacBook Air to replace already-missed 2015 machine. Apple builds well - this laptop might make it with me well into the 2030s.\n\nWhat kind of OS and services will we be using then? Will 'office' software still come from one vendor (ok, possibly two, for those using Google's apps)?\n\nWill we still have just three operating systems to choose from - of which only two are really suitable for a worker's desktop? Will we have just two mobile OSes? Will everything continue to consolidate, an ensh*ttification demanding more and more from us while offering less and less in return?\n\nOr are we closer to a different kind of world in which improving AI interfaces mean none of this really matters? Can all of this entrapment be abstracted away by agents? I'd like to think so - but if history is any guide, AI providers will be tempted to lay down a breadcrumb path to another cage.\n\nTime to find an angle grinder. \u00ae",

When the time comes for a deployment, Microsoft-certified engineers can serve as a contact to offer strategic and tactical guidance. This is helpful for agencies that don\u2019t require a deployment partner but have questions that can be resolved via a phone call with a Microsoft-certified engineer.\n\nSupport applies to all Microsoft software and systems, including, but not limited to, Microsoft Server OS, Azure, SQL Server, Microsoft 365, Dynamics, Teams, Intune, SharePoint, Copilot, Server (on-premises) and Exchange Server (on-premises).\n\nWindows 11 migration support is another key CTS benefit. The October 2025 deadline to move away from Windows 10 is quickly approaching. CTS can offer support for towns and counties as they work through some of the hurdles associated with the migration.\n\nDISCOVER: Should state and local agencies invest in AI PCs?\n\nA Free, Comprehensive Cloud Dashboard To Help Manage Costs\n\nThe other core benefit of CTS is access to a tool called CDW Inscape at no additional cost. Inscape is a cloud and Software as a Service management platform that works with Microsoft cloud products as well as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nI cannot overstate how much of a value-add Inscape is for smaller organizations. Cloud is not a magical cost-saving tool. It certainly offers flexibility and can lower costs in the long run, but that doesn\u2019t happen by default. It requires cost management and thoughtful cloud optimization.\n\nWith Inscape, IT managers have all of the cloud business intelligence they need. They can quickly access cloud spending, easily monitor costs, identify trends, manage budgets, report on subscriptions and even create alerts pertaining to spending. The idea is to provide a complete view of their different cloud assets to ease financial management of multicloud environments.\n\nLEARN MORE: Inscape can help agencies manage their cloud spending more effectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line for Rural Areas\n\nSmall cities, towns and counties \u2014 especially in rural areas \u2014 are accustomed to doing more with less. It\u2019s all much easier said than done, though.\n\nIf there is just one thing you take away from this article, it should be that tech support for your Microsoft environments doesn\u2019t have to be an all-or-nothing scenario. If you can\u2019t afford Microsoft Unified support, there are alternatives out there that can still provide everything you need. In the case of CTS, the baseline layer of support is far less expensive than Microsoft\u2019s support, and significantly more cost-effective than having to recruit and hire new staff from a thin pool of applicants.\n\nCost-effective IT is all about working with what you have, and CTS and Inscape help small towns and counties do exactly that.",

Businesses are leveraging AI agents to process insurance claims, manage IT service desks, optimize supply chain logistics, and even assist healthcare professionals in analyzing medical records. The potential is vast, and we\u2019re excited to introduce two powerful innovations in Azure AI Foundry:\n\nResponses API : A powerful API enabling AI-powered applications to retrieve information, process data, and take action seamlessly.\n\n: A powerful API enabling AI-powered applications to retrieve information, process data, and take action seamlessly. Computer-Using Agent (CUA): A breakthrough AI model that navigates software interfaces, executes tasks, and automates workflows.\n\nTogether, these capabilities empower businesses to reimagine AI not just as an assistant\u2014but as an active digital workforce. Enterprise customers will soon gain access to these innovations driving automation, efficiency, and intelligence at scale.\n\nEnhancing AI Agents with the Responses API\n\nThe Responses API is the key to unlocking agentic AI in Azure AI Foundry, transforming how enterprises harness AI for real-world impact. It is the new foundation for leveraging Azure OpenAI Service\u2019s powerful built-in tools, combining the simplicity of the Chat Completions API with the advanced capabilities available through Assistants API and Azure AI Agent Service. The Responses API enables seamless interaction with tools like CUA, function calling, and file search\u2014all in a single API call. This API enables AI systems to retrieve data, process information, and take actions\u2014seamlessly connecting agentic AI with enterprise workflows.\n\nHow the Responses API Works\n\nThe Responses API provides a structured response format that allows AI to interact with multiple tools while maintaining context across interactions. It supports:\n\nTool calling in one simple API call: Now, developers can seamlessly integrate AI tools, making execution more efficient.\n\nComputer use: Use the computer use tool within the Responses API to drive automation and execute software interactions.\n\nFile search: Interact with enterprise data dynamically and extract relevant information.\n\nFunction calling: Develop and invoke custom functions to enhance AI capabilities.\n\nChaining responses into conversations: Keep track of interactions by linking responses together using unique response IDs, ensuring continuity in AI-driven dialogues.\n\nEnterprise-grade data privacy: Built with Azure\u2019s trusted security and compliance standards, ensuring data protection for organizations.\n\nBy consolidating retrieval, reasoning, and action execution into a single API, the Responses API simplifies AI agent development, reducing the complexity of orchestrating multiple AI tools within an automation pipeline.\n\nThis scalability makes it well-suited for enterprise use cases across industries such as customer service, IT operations, finance, and supply chain management, where AI-powered automation can streamline workflows and improve efficiency. For even greater flexibility and control, organizations can explore Azure AI Agent Service, which offers additional tools and models for developing and scaling AI agents. Azure AI Agent Service integrates with Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, enabling seamless multi-agent orchestration for more complex scenarios requiring multiple agents to collaborate on tasks.\n\nEmpowering AI Agents with the Computer-Using Agent\n\nThe Computer-Using Agent (CUA) is a specialized AI model in Azure OpenAI Service that allows AI to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), navigate applications, and automate multi-step tasks\u2014all through natural language instructions. Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on predefined scripts or API-based integrations, CUA can interpret visual elements, adapt dynamically, and take action based on on-screen content.\n\nWhat makes the Computer-Using Agent unique?\n\nAutonomous UI navigation : Can open applications, click buttons, fill out forms, and navigate multi-page workflows.\n\n: Can open applications, click buttons, fill out forms, and navigate multi-page workflows. Dynamic adaptation : Interprets UI changes and adjusts actions accordingly, reducing reliance on rigid automation scripts.\n\n: Interprets UI changes and adjusts actions accordingly, reducing reliance on rigid automation scripts. Cross-application task execution : Operates across web-based and desktop applications, integrating disparate systems without API dependencies.\n\n: Operates across web-based and desktop applications, integrating disparate systems without API dependencies. Natural language command interface: Users can describe a task in plain language, and CUA determines the correct UI interactions to execute.\n\nWith today\u2019s announcement, developers can start building additional agentic capabilities right away with CUA. As enterprises look to deploy this technology at scale, we are evaluating integration with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop to enable CUA automation to run seamlessly in a managed host environment on Cloud PCs or virtual machines (VMs), ensuring consistent performance while maintaining enterprise compliance and security standards.\n\nEnsuring secure and trustworthy AI automation\n\nAs AI systems become more autonomous, ensuring security, reliability, and alignment with human intent is critical. The CUA model is one of the first agentic AI models capable of directly interacting with software environments, bringing new challenges in misuse prevention, unintended actions, and adversarial risks. To address these, Microsoft and OpenAI have implemented a multi-layered safety approach spanning the model, system, and deployment levels.\n\nThe CUA model is developed with safeguards to refuse harmful tasks, reject unauthorized actions, and prevent misuse. At the system level, Microsoft implements enterprise-grade content filtering and execution monitoring to help detect and prevent policy violations. To minimize unintended actions, CUA is designed to request user confirmations before executing irreversible tasks and to restrict high-risk actions such as financial transactions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Trustworthy AI framework further ensures real-time observability, logging, and compliance auditing for enterprise deployments. Automated and human-in-the-loop detection systems monitor execution patterns, identifying anomalous behaviors and enforcing governance policies. These safeguards are continuously refined based on internal red-teaming, external audits, and real-world testing to strengthen protection against prompt injections, adversarial manipulations, and unauthorized access. Given the current reliability level of the CUA model\u2014particularly in non-browser environments\u2014human oversight remains strongly recommended for sensitive operations.\n\nAs AI agents evolve, Microsoft is committed to transparency, security, and ongoing risk mitigation. By combining CUA\u2019s built-in safeguards with Azure\u2019s enterprise compliance and governance tools, organizations can deploy AI-powered automation with confidence, ensuring safe and responsible AI adoption at scale.\n\nGetting started with CUA and Responses API\n\nAzure AI Foundry continues to push the boundaries of AI-powered automation. Enterprise customers will gain access to the Responses API and CUA in Azure OpenAI Service in the coming weeks.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to see how developers and businesses innovate with these new capabilities.",

            "content": "Microsoft today issued more than 50 security updates for its various Windows operating systems, including fixes for a whopping six zero-day vulnerabilities that are already seeing active exploitation.\n\nTwo of the zero-day flaws include CVE-2025-24991 and CVE-2025-24993, both vulnerabilities in NTFS, the default file system for Windows and Windows Server. Both require the attacker to trick a target into mounting a malicious virtual hard disk. CVE-2025-24993 would lead to the possibility of local code execution, while CVE-2025-24991 could cause NTFS to disclose portions of memory.\n\nMicrosoft credits researchers at ESET with reporting the zero-day bug labeled CVE-2025-24983, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in older versions of Windows. ESET said the exploit was deployed via the PipeMagic backdoor, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine.\n\nESET\u2019s Filip Jur\u010dacko said the exploit in the wild targets only older versions of Windows OS: Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. Although still used by millions, security support for these products ended more than a year ago, and mainstream support ended years ago. However, ESET notes the vulnerability itself also is present in newer Windows OS versions, including Windows 10 build 1809 and the still-supported Windows Server 2016.\n\nRapid7\u2019s lead software engineer Adam Barnett said Windows 11 and Server 2019 onwards are not listed as receiving patches, so are presumably not vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear why newer Windows products dodged this particular bullet,\u201d Barnett wrote. \u201cThe Windows 32 subsystem is still presumably alive and well, since there is no apparent mention of its demise on the Windows client OS deprecated features list.\u201d\n\nThe zero-day flaw CVE-2025-24984 is another NTFS weakness that can be exploited by inserting a malicious USB drive into a Windows computer. Barnett said Microsoft\u2019s advisory for this bug doesn\u2019t quite join the dots, but successful exploitation appears to mean that portions of heap memory could be improperly dumped into a log file, which could then be combed through by an attacker hungry for privileged information.\n\n\u201cA relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 4.6 reflects the practical difficulties of real-world exploitation, but a motivated attacker can sometimes achieve extraordinary results starting from the smallest of toeholds, and Microsoft does rate this vulnerability as important on its own proprietary severity ranking scale,\u201d Barnett said.\n\nAnother zero-day fixed this month \u2014 CVE-2025-24985 \u2014 could allow attackers to install malicious code. As with the NTFS bugs, this one requires that the user mount a malicious virtual hard drive.\n\nThe final zero-day this month is CVE-2025-26633, a weakness in the Microsoft Management Console, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system. Exploiting this flaw requires the target to open a malicious file.\n\nThis month\u2019s bundle of patch love from Redmond also addresses six other vulnerabilities Microsoft has rated \u201ccritical,\u201d meaning that malware or malcontents could exploit them to seize control over vulnerable PCs with no help from users.\n\nBarnett observed that this is now the sixth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication.\n\nThe SANS Internet Storm Center has a useful list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.

It helps manufacturers reduce cyber risk from connected devices on factory floors and edge environments with robust identity security, automated access management, and device lifecycle protection.\n\nThe manufacturing industry is rapidly transforming to digital, driven by the coming together of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT), with countless devices connected to optimize operations. Each connected device potentially introduces new cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nThe NIST reference architecture for IoT, introduced in May 2024, provides a structured approach to secure onboarding, continuous device management, and threat monitoring across the device lifecycle. The collaboration between Microsoft, CyberArk, and Device Authority helps organizations translate this framework into practical, scalable solutions.\n\nEach partner brings essential capabilities to this end-to-end solution architecture for NIST compliance. Through Microsoft Azure IoT and Defender for IoT, Microsoft enables secure, scalable device management and real-time monitoring. The cloud-edge integration ensures consistent device security, even in remote, air-gapped environments.\n\nCyberArk\u2019s modern privileged access management capabilities restrict unauthorized human access to critical devices and systems, enforcing user and device security policies without the need for time-consuming, error-prone manual human intervention. Device Authority automates secure device onboarding, identity credentialing, and encryption, minimizing human error, accelerating incident response, and maintaining data integrity through the connected ecosystem.\n\nDevice Authority CEO Darron Antill, commented, \u201cManufacturers often face unique security challenges, particularly at the edge, where devices operate in remote or decentralized locations. Edge environments introduce added vulnerabilities thanks to high device density, varying network connectivity, and intermittent monitoring, but there is still the need for real-time decision-making. This complex environment requires a solution operating across widely dispersed devices and locations to help ensure device and data security and operational continuity. Our joint solution addresses these challenges with a unified solution that enables manufacturers to protect devices from malicious access and maintain operational resilience, even in the most distributed settings.\u201d\n\nClarence Hinton, Chief Strategy Officer at CyberArk, added, \u201cThe complexity of the security challenges faced by manufacturers, in particular, means that no single solution can enable an organization to be fully compliant with important NIST guidelines, while creating a piecemeal solution is impractical. By joining forces, we are smoothing the way for people to implement NIST compliance best practices, extending privileged access management controls across the entire spectrum of identities.\u201d\n\nDayan Rodriquez, Corporate Vice President, Manufacturing & Mobility, Microsoft, concluded, \u201cAs connected technologies become more embedded in manufacturers operations, protecting these devices is critical. This collaboration provides manufacturers with a comprehensive approach to their IoT security, directly aligned with NIST\u2019s latest guidelines. With an ecosystem-based security solution, manufacturers can protect their operations from the factory floor to the edge, ensuring regulatory compliance and resilience against cyber threats.\u201d",

            "content": "As MZMs are \u201ctopological\u201d states, their settings cannot easily be flipped by random fluctuations to introduce errors into the calculation. Rather, the states are like a twist in a buckled belt that cannot be smoothed out unless the buckle is undone. Topological qubits would therefore suffer far less from the errors that afflict current quantum computers, and which limit the scale of the computations they can support. Because quantum error correction is one of the most challenging issues for scaling up quantum computers, \u201cwe want some built-in level of error protection,\u201d explains Nayak.\n\nIt has long been thought that MZMs might be produced at the ends of nanoscale wires made of a superconducting material. Indeed, Microsoft researchers have been trying for several years to fabricate such structures and look for the characteristic signature of MZMs at their tips. But it can be hard to distinguish this signature from those of other electronic states that can form in these structures.\n\nIn 2018 researchers at labs in the US and the Netherlands (including the Delft University of Technology and Microsoft), claimed to have evidence of an MZM in such devices. However, they then had to retract the work after others raised problems with the data. \u201cThat history is making some experts cautious about the new claim,\u201d says Aaronson.\n\nNow, though, it seems that Nayak and colleagues have cracked the technical challenges. In the Nature paper, they report measurements in a nanowire heterostructure made of superconducting aluminum and semiconducting indium arsenide that are consistent with, but not definitive proof of, MZMs forming at the two ends. The crucial advance is an ability to accurately measure the parity of the electronic states. \u201cThe paper shows that we can do these measurements fast and accurately,\u201d says Nayak.\n\n\u201cThe device is a remarkable achievement from the materials science and fabrication standpoint,\u201d says Ivar Martin, a materials scientist at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cThey have been working hard on these problems, and seems like they are nearing getting the complexities under control.\u201d In the press release, the Microsoft team claims now to have put eight MZM topological qubits on a chip called Majorana 1, which is designed to house a million of them.\n\nEven if the Microsoft claim stands up, a lot will still need to be done to get from a single MZM to a quantum computer, says Hensinger. Topological quantum computing is \u201cprobably 20\u201330 years behind the other platforms,\u201d he says. Martin agrees. \u201cEven if everything checks out and what they have realized are MZMs, cleaning them up to take full advantage of topological protection will still require significant effort,\u201d he says.\n\nRegardless of the debate about the results and how they have been announced, researchers are supportive of the efforts at Microsoft to produce a topological quantum computer. \u201cAs a scientist who likes to see things tried, I\u2019m grateful that at least one player stuck with the topological approach even when it ended up being a long, painful slog,\u201d says Aaronson.\n\n\u201cMost governments won\u2019t fund such work, because it\u2019s way too risky and expensive,\u201d adds Hensinger. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to see that Microsoft is stepping in there.\u201d\n\nReprinted with permission from Physics World , a publication of the Institute of Physics.

            "content": "Researchers have criticised Microsoft's new Majorana 1 quantum computer, saying the company has made claims about the way it works that aren't fully backed up by scientific evidence\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Majorana 1 quantum computer John Brecher/Microsoft\n\nLast month Microsoft announced, with fanfare, that it had created a new kind of matter and used it to make a quantum computer architecture that could lead to machines \u201ccapable of solving meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\u201d.\n\nBut since then, the tech giant has increasingly come under fire from researchers who say it has done nothing of the sort. \u201cMy impression is that the response of the expert physics community has been overwhelmingly negative. Privately, people are just outraged,\u201d says Sergey Frolov at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s claim rests on elusive and exotic quasiparticles called Majorana zero modes (MZMs). These can theoretically be used to create a topological qubit, a new type of quantum bit \u2013 the building blocks of information processing within a quantum computer. Because of their inherent properties, such qubits could excel at reducing errors, addressing a big shortcoming of all quantum computers in use today.\n\nMZMs have been theorised to emerge from the collective behaviour of electrons at the edges of thin superconducting wires. Microsoft\u2019s new Majorana 1 chip contains several such wires and, according to the firm, enough MZMs to make eight topological qubits. A Microsoft spokesperson told New Scientist that the chip was \u201ca significant breakthrough for us and the industry\u201d.\n\nYet researchers say Microsoft hasn\u2019t provided enough evidence to support these claims. Alongside its press announcement, the company published a paper in the journal Nature that it said confirmed its results. \u201cThe Nature paper marks peer-reviewed confirmation that Microsoft has not only been able to create Majorana particles, which help protect quantum information from random disturbance, but can also reliably measure that information from them,\u201d said a Microsoft press release.\n\nBut editors at Nature made it explicitly clear that this statement is incorrect. A publicly available report on the peer-review process states: \u201cThe editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Microsoft and Nature are directly contradicting each other. \u201cThe press releases have said something totally different [than the Nature paper],\u201d says Henry Legg at the University of St Andrews in the UK.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only unorthodox aspect of Microsoft\u2019s paper. Legg points out that two of the four peer reviewers initially gave rather critical and negative feedback, which, in his experience, would typically disqualify a paper from publication in the prestigious journal. The peer-review report shows that by the last round of editing, one reviewer still disagreed with publication of the paper, while the other three signed off on it. A spokesperson for Nature told New Scientist that the ultimate decision to publish came down to the potential they saw for experiments with future MZMs in Microsoft\u2019s device, rather than necessarily what it had achieved so far.\n\nIt is also unusual that one of the reviewers, Hao Zhang at Tsinghua University in China, had previously worked with Microsoft on MZM research, says Legg. That work, published in Nature in 2018, was later retracted, with the team apologising for \u201cinsufficient scientific rigour\u201d after other researchers identified inconsistences in the results. \u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking that Nature could choose a referee that only a few years ago had a paper retracted,\u201d says Legg.\n\nZhang says there was no conflict of interest. \u201cI have never been an employee of Microsoft, nor was I affiliated to [the firm]. Among the 100+ authors of the recent Microsoft paper, I have worked with three of them before,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was seven years ago, and at that time, they were students of TU Delft [in the Netherlands], not Microsoft employees.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft says its team wasn\u2019t involved in selecting reviewers and wasn\u2019t aware of Zhang\u2019s participation until after the review process was complete. Nature also stands by the decision, with a spokesperson saying \u201cthe quality of the advice received can be seen from the reviewers\u2019 comments\u201d.\n\nReview issues aside, both Legg and Frolov have more fundamental objections to Microsoft\u2019s methodology. Experiments with MZMs have proven extremely difficult to perform over the past few decades, because imperfections and disorder in the device can produce spurious signals that mimic the quasiparticles, even if they aren\u2019t present. This has been a challenge for researchers associated with Microsoft, including in the retracted 2018 paper \u2013 the retraction notice explicitly references new insights concerning the effects of disorder. To address this, in 2023, Microsoft published a procedure in the journal Physical Review B called the \u201ctopological gap protocol\u201d, that it claimed would tease out these differences.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of this protocol was that it\u2019s a binary test for whether or not there\u2019s Majoranas there,\u201d says Legg. His own analysis of the code and data that Microsoft used to implement this protocol in 2023, however, showed it to be less reliable than expected, with a data formatting change being enough to turn a fail into a pass. Legg says he raised these issues with Microsoft before the publication of its Nature paper, yet the firm still used the protocol in its new research.\n\nNature\u2019s spokesperson says that the journal\u2019s editorial team is \u201caware that some have called into question the validity of the topological gap protocol used in the Nature paper and other publications. This was an issue that we were also aware of during the peer-review process.\u201d Through that process, reviewers determined that this wasn\u2019t a key issue after all, says the spokesperson.\n\nMicrosoft says it will respond to Legg\u2019s analysis of its 2023 paper if asked to do so by Physical Review B. \u201cThe criticism can be summarised as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that,\u201d said Chetan Nayak at Microsoft. He disputes Legg\u2019s work on several points and says that the 2023 paper \u201cshowed that we could create the topological phase and Majorana zero modes with high confidence\u201d and the new paper only strengthens those claims.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson says that in the year since the Nature paper was submitted for review, the firm has built on that confidence and not only created a multi-qubit chip, but also tested ways to manipulate those qubits, as would be required for a working topological quantum computer. The firm will be releasing further details at the American Physical Society\u2019s Global Physics Summit in March, says the spokesperson. \u201cWe look forward to sharing our results along with additional data behind the science that is turning our 20-plus-year vision for quantum computing into a tangible reality.\u201d\n\nBut for Frolov, the claim that imperfect results from the past can be neglected because the firm has gone on to build more sophisticated devices rests on faulty logic. Legg shares this view. \u201cFundamental problems of disorder and material science aren\u2019t going to go away just because you start fabricating some fancier device,\u201d he says.",

While still in high school, Bill and his computer chums leveraged their budding expertise to advance their code-writing skills, build real-world business connections and make money.\n\nAnother very Northwest facet of Gates\u2019 story is his experience in the outdoors as a Boy Scout and as a young teen going on independent hikes in the wilderness with his buddies. He recounts one expedition hiking in the Olympics over Low Divide Pass to Quinault and back. On that hike, while slogging through the snow, Gates says he had a bit of a breakthrough on how to write software code, which played an important role later in solving a major problem. Wilderness treks gave him confidence, he says. Part of his drive has been to win every challenge he faced.\n\nMary and Bill Gates, Sr., pose with children Bill Gates, Kristi (right) and Libby (in arms) in 1965. (Photo courtesy of the Gates Family)\n\nGates\u2019 Northwest upbringing and his parents\u2019 commitment to public service \u2014 his mother was the national chair of United Way, and both parents were longtime members of the University of Washington\u2019s Board of Regents \u2014 are reflected in his values today through establishing the philanthropic Gates Foundation, devoting much of his wealth to improving world health and being a voice for science. The impulsive, driven youth who played a huge role in the computer revolution is more reflective now.\n\nAt the end of Source Code, Gates discusses his advantages: \u201cOften success reduces people to stock characters: the boy wonder, the genius engineer, the iconoclastic designer, the paradoxical tycoon. In my case, I\u2019m struck by the set of unique circumstances \u2014 mostly out of my control \u2014 that shaped my character and career. It\u2019s impossible to overstate the unearned privilege I enjoyed: to be born in the rich United States is a big part of winning the birth lottery ticket, as is being born white and male in a society that advantages white men.\u201d That\u2019s a refreshing take for someone whose image was once synonymous with an upstart \u201cboy genius\u201d who did it on his own.\n\nGates also happened to be born at the right time to throw himself into an emerging computer revolution, but with age he seems to have realized he didn\u2019t get where he is all by himself. A younger Bill Gates might not have understood that.",

By launching Treasury GPT, we\u2019re giving our customers a competitive edge that can unlock the power and capabilities of FIS solutions and steer their companies to growth.\u201d\n\nThe release added that companies can use Treasury GPT to reference \u201cproduct documentation and use machine learning through Azure OpenAI Service to quickly provide FIS users with high-quality, informed guidance.\u201d\n\nThis allows clients \u201cto focus less on low-value administrative tasks and more on liquidity management and strategy,\u201d the company said.\n\nFIS pointed out that this launch is happening as a majority of companies say that AI will impact their businesses, if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\nAs noted here last week, research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that nearly 90% of surveyed chief financial officers (CFOs) reported a \u201cvery positive\u201d ROI from the technology, a sharp increase from just 26% in March 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s according to PYMNTS recent CAIO Report, which examines how CFOs are enjoying the benefits of GenAI and where they continue to face obstacles.\n\n\u201cWhile CFOs are adopting GenAI, trust in the technology is paramount, especially in critical business functions like risk management and financial reporting, PYMNTS wrote. \u201cConsider that 97% of CFOs expressed high or complete trust in GenAI\u2019s output in risk management, while 98% trusted it for strategic decision-making. The ability of GenAI to work with internal data, which CFOs are familiar with and confident in, plays a significant role in this trust.\u201d\n\nHowever, trust is not universal, the research found. There are persistent concerns about GenAI\u2019s output, especially around accuracy and data security. Close to 30% of CFOs are concerned that GenAI might yield less insightful results, while 22% pointed to potential issues surrounding the integrity of its outputs. Data security is also a concern, with 28% worrying about unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

AlphaBOLD is a sponsor of the AI Agent and Copilot Summit and the team will be presenting a masterclass covering AI agents, Azure AI Foundry, and how to use this class of tools and services to solve business problems. They will also be at booth 006.\n\nThe firm launched as a Microsoft partner in 2017 with an emphasis on being a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for customers. It provides services for most of the Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 product families, as well as Azure, BI, development, and AI capabilities. The team serves SMBs and enterprises across industries, with a special focus on AEC (architecture, engineering, construction), manufacturing and financial services.\n\nTayyab Ali\n\nAli explained that the applications and cloud services that his team will discuss at Summit can all be used to deliver results today:\n\nIn our session, the focus will be on business problems and how AI Foundry and Copilot can help. Copilot is essentially an agent to help people be more productive. It can assist in different business use cases: to generate product reports or to automate activities, for example. With AI Foundry, Microsoft provides a lot of pre-baked solutions, either in conjunction with Copilot or as standalones. We\u2019ll talk about how businesses can benefit from AI agents and how easy it is to build them with existing technology from Microsoft. We\u2019ll look at real world examples of what we\u2019ve seen our customers use.\n\nMany customers are asking whether to build solutions from scratch, Ali has observed. Some are already building with off-the-shelf solutions. By embedding capabilities, customers can reduce their technology workloads.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to leverage available technology without reinventing the wheel,\u201d Ali said. For example, [M365] Copilot out-of-the-box is powerful but needs to be configured to the needs of each organization. Companies decide what data sets to expose, and Copilot works according to those sources.\n\nAlphaBOLD is working to incorporate Copilot into specific use cases for different industries and geographies. In some cases, enterprise customers are requiring that they deploy solutions like ChatGPT within defined geographic boundaries to protect their data and comply with regulations.\n\nAli added that AlphaBOLD\u2019s sponsorship of AI Agent and Copilot Summit North America 2025 allows the team to showcase its commitment to using the best technology to solve customer problems. Their goal is to help guide attendees on how to design and implement AI agents that meet specific business needs, starting with the end-to-end solution development methods. They will also explore the specific choices that organizations are likely to face in their AI journey, starting with identification and prioritization of practical use cases. Customers also need to understand how integration strategy, data management, and customization decisions will play into long-term success, Ali highlighted.\n\n\"[We aim to be] the partner that drives real results for our customers. Our approach is to break large projects into manageable phases,\" he explained. Tackling a smaller challenge first may not achieve full automation immediately, but it lays the foundation for long-term success. \"We believe in a step-by-step approach, where each milestone builds on the last. Our holistic perspective ensures we understand customer pain points and implement the right technology stack to solve them effectively.\"",

            "content": "The February Patch Tuesday updates and activity during the month marked a return to normalcy for patch management. Following the January updates addressing 100+ vulnerabilities, we saw 37 CVEs fixed in Windows 11 and 33 CVEs in Windows 10. This was rounded out by 8 CVEs addressed in the Office 365 online versions and Office 2016 in standalone form.\n\nMicrosoft made a few announcements and fixes in the last month you should be aware of. A January non-security update and February security update for the operating system impacted some drag-and-drop functionality in Outlook. This has been resolved in the March preview release. The preview also includes a fix for the SSH connections issue, which has been in effect since October 2024 across multiple operating systems. They also announced they have implemented a service-level fix for CVE-2025-24989, which existed in Power Pages on the Microsoft Power Platform. This vulnerability \u201callows an unauthorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network potentially bypassing the user registration control\u201d per Microsoft. We\u2019ll need to be on the lookout for these fixes in the upcoming Tuesday releases.\n\nMicrosoft added to their upcoming end-of-life product list with the announcement that after 14 years, the Skype service will go offline on May 5th. Customers are encouraged to move to Teams which provides many of the same services. As I mentioned last month, Patch Tuesday on October 14, 2025 will be a momentous day, with the final updates being released for Windows 10, Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019. As they did for Skype, Microsoft provided a 60-day warning in February they would deprecate WSUS driver synchronization on April 18, 2025. They will continue to be available in the update catalog, but you won\u2019t be able to import them into WSUS. Ensure you are planning ahead for all these critical events.\n\nThe threats to our systems never end, but there are two that stood out to me this month. The first involves the use of polymorphic extensions in Google Chrome. Devised by SquareX labs, there are a number of steps from getting the user to download a malicious extension to eventually exporting sensitive information, but the scary part is that the malicious extension can swap back in the real one to look authentic. The second is a series of botnet attacks targeted at Microsoft O365 accounts worldwide. The goal is to use Basic Authentication (Basic Auth) to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) protections and gain unauthorized access without triggering security alerts. The good news is that Microsoft is disabling the Basic Auth services on any remaining accounts in September 2025 and switching to OAuth2 requiring MFA.\n\nMarch 2025 Patch Tuesday forecast\n\nMicrosoft will most likely release a few more security fixes in operating system updates than the 37 CVEs in February. In addition to the OS updates, there may be an Exchange update based on some of the preview work.\n\nAdobe updated many of their Creative Cloud apps last month, so I don\u2019t expect many updates there this month. The next big Adobe Acrobat and Reader updates will most likely come in April with the new quarter.\n\nApple provided OS and application updates across the board on Feb 10. While they are due for another round, they most likely will appear later in the month if they keep their current cadence.\n\nGoogle released Chrome Desktop 135 to the Beta channel for Windows, Mac and Linux so expect the GA release next week.\n\nIn their usual release cadence, the Mozilla Foundation released security updates this week. The three ESR versions were marked Critical this month, while Firefox and Thunderbird 136 were rated High. As always, include these in your Patch Tuesday mix if you haven\u2019t deployed them already.\n\nIt looks like a pretty \u2018normal\u2019 Patch Tuesday coming up next week. We\u2019ll see fixes for Outlook and the SSH connection issues, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see on the extent of the security updates. Outside of Microsoft, we\u2019re really only anticipating the usual weekly release of Chrome on Tuesday.",

Now, he develops sovereignty controls for the tech giant's security platform, ensuring sensitive customer information remains within geographic boundaries.\n\nAfter studying information technology in college and working in roles building software systems, Masrani came to the US to get a Master's degree in computer science. After completing a six-month co-op internship at AWS while he was in school, he converted to a full-time employee, where he focused on securing data and networks until he felt the need for a change.\n\n\"To be honest, it was very tiring,\" Masrani said about his six and a half years at AWS. \"And I wanted a change in my job to try something different.\"\n\nMasrani said his final project before joining Microsoft involved building a customer-managed key encryption feature, which required research into best practices for data security. He said he found the work \"really interesting\" and began exploring teams focused on data governance and security. He said working alongside engineers who were truly \"passionate\" about their work was a top priority for him.\n\nHere's the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 he used to get his job at Microsoft, where he started on Microsoft's Purview security team as a senior software engineer. Now, he's a principal software engineer working on Microsoft's Security Platform.\n\nThe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Ankit Masrani used to apply to Microsoft.

When he was a year or two out of school, though, he said he thinks it helped him get interviews.\n\nSpecializing in security\n\nMasrani came into the role with a background in IT, computer science, and data experience \u2014 all of which are recommended routes to enter the field, according to industry veterans.\n\nMasrani's pivot wasn't drastic, but he said certain skill sets are needed to transition from general software engineering to the security side.\n\nAs a software engineer building cybersecurity services, Masrani said he handles large volumes of security logs, user activity data, and threat intelligence data. Masrani said he isn't \"actively doing security threat hunting\" but is building services for a platform that does.\n\nMasrani said experience with big data technologies like Hadoop, an open source framework that processes large amounts of data for applications, is important for learning how to build data pipelines. He added that machine learning and anomaly detection is also useful for working on security product services.\n\nMasrani also recommends experience with cloud services like AWS or Microsoft Azure to understand scalable data processing.\n\n\"Storage is very important since cloud services are leveraged everywhere from small to large software systems,\" Masrani said.\n\nMasrani also said security knowledge is necessary to pivot to the cybersecurity sector. Masrani said safety protocols and data processing guidelines are often specific to regions.\n\nHe said domain knowledge around data governance and other security products is important, as well as familiarity with regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation. He said it's also important to know fundamentals around data encryption, network security, and application security.\n\n\"Any handling of customer data must be done in a safe and secure manner,\" Masrani said. \"Having knowledge of best practices for handling data is very important.",

These measures aim to ensure that AI advancements benefit society while potential risks are mitigated.\n\nTo shape good policy, policymakers are themselves exploring the application of AI in supporting their work. To date, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has compiled over 40 use cases for AI shared by parliaments around the world, including the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, the Estonian Parliament, the European Parliament, the Parliament of Finland, and the Senate of Italy.\n\nRecently, in Malaysia, Microsoft, in partnership with the Parliament of Malaysia, National AI Office and UNITAR International University\u2019s Centre of Leadership, Governance and Democracy kicked off the \u2018AI for Policymakers\u2019 initiative, with a two-day showcase designed to enable Members of Parliament (MPs) to experience using AI to support their everyday work and gain insights on global best practices in AI governance. MPs also had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the AI economy and the importance of developing widespread AI fluency among the current and future workforce.\n\nAI for Policymakers\n\nThe pioneering initiative is rooted in the Quadruple Helix model, bringing together government, academia, industry and civil society to create a robust and future-ready AI ecosystem with the rakyat at the heart of Malaysia\u2019s AI transformation.\n\nAs part of the showcase, MPs interacted with ParlimenGPT1 with capabilities such as summarizing key issues, analyzing meeting sentiment, providing real-time language translation, as well as reviewing and editing to ensure accuracy or relevance.\n\nFor the purpose of the demonstration on how AI could help policymakers, the ParlimenGPT was trained on Parlimen Malaysia\u2019s Hansard, powered by Microsoft Azure and Azure AI Foundry\n\nUsers can interact with ParlimenGPT either by typing their questions directly or using pre-defined prompts. All responses from the chatbot will include citations from relevant documents and can provide real-time translation (e.g.: query response in English while referencing a Bahasa Malaysia document).\n\nParlimenGPT\u2019s sentiment analysis capability\n\nWith these capabilities, AI can help Parliamentarians to make evidence-based decisions, creating a more informed and responsive policy environment. For instance, using AI to analyze local legislative debates and records, such as the Hansard, allows lawmakers to quickly understand past discussions on similar issues, enabling a more nuanced approach to new policy creation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, predictive analytics powered by AI can support lawmakers in assessing potential public and economic reactions to policy proposals, thus helping them to make proactive and timely decisions. AI can also suggest appropriate language for bills and policy proposals based on historical data and best practices, ensuring consistency and reducing legal conflicts, leading to clearer, more effective policies.\n\nWatch how Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat[2] transforms work by simplifying complex tasks, identifying insights, drafting emails, and generating line graphs in this Bahasa Malaysia demo video, supercharging creativity and productivity.\n\nBeyond the showcase in Parliament, a phased training program will be rolled out to provide hands-on learning for MPs, parliamentary officers and support teams. This structured engagement aims to equip decision-makers with the tools to navigate AI\u2019s transformative impact on governance, anticipate emerging challenges, and implement AI-driven policies that foster economic growth and social progress.\n\nAs the demos in Parliament highlights, AI can play a significant role in transforming parliaments from paper-based organizations into data-driven institutions. This transformation will yield benefits not only for MPs and institutions themselves, but also for the millions of citizens they serve. That said, the benefits of AI must also be balanced with the need to safeguard democratic principles and maintain public trust.\n\nHarnessing the benefits of AI inclusively\n\nAdilah Junid, Director of Legal and Government Affairs at Microsoft Malaysia conducts a briefing on Microsoft\u2019s responsible AI approaches for Malaysia\u2019s Minister of Digital, Gobind Singh Deo\n\nDuring the showcase in Parliament, Microsoft also shared learnings and insights for policymakers and government officials to consider as they take on the role of formulating policies, laws, and guidelines around AI \u2013 based on the lessons learned from our own work globally over the years. This includes lessons from other Global Governance approaches as well as the our five-point blueprint for formulating an approach to effective AI governance.\n\nIn addition, the showcase featured \u201cThe Future of Malaysia\u2019s AI Governance\u201d white paper by the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia, in collaboration with the Malaysian Centre for 4IR and Microsoft. Drawing insights from global developments as well as multi-stakeholder dialogue, the paper sets out recommendations for the way forward for Malaysia to develop a robust AI governance approach that facilitates the delivery of inclusive benefits of AI while addressing risks and concerns, contextualized to Malaysia\u2019s specific socio-economic values and aspirations.\n\nThe \u2018AI for Policymakers\u2019 initiative builds on Microsoft\u2019s \u201cAI for Malaysia\u2019s Future\u201d (AIForMYFuture) program in collaboration with NAIO, with a goal to upskill 800,000 Malaysians by the end of 2025. As part of this program, Microsoft together with skilling partners like Biji-Biji initiative will provide AI skilling opportunities for MPs, parliamentary staff, as well as their constituents.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] The ParlimenGPT is a minimum viable product (MVP) built for the AI for Policymakers showcase only.

            "content": "Infosec in Brief Microsoft has spotted a malvertising campaign that downloaded nastyware hosted on GitHub and exposed nearly a million devices to information thieves.\n\nDiscovered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence late last year, the campaign saw pirate vid-streaming websites embed malvertising redirectors to generate pay-per-view or pay-per-click revenue from malvertising platforms.\n\n\u201cThese redirectors subsequently routed traffic through one or two additional malicious redirectors, ultimately leading to another website, such as a malware or tech support scam website, which then redirected to GitHub,\u201d according to Microsoft\u2019s threat research team.\n\nGitHub hosted a first-stage payload that installed code that dropped two other payloads. One gathered system configuration info such as data on memory size, graphics capabilities, screen resolution, the operating system present, and user paths.\n\nThird-stage payloads varied but most \u201cconducted additional malicious activities such as command and control (C2) to download additional files and to exfiltrate data, as well as defense evasion techniques.\u201d\n\nThe attackers built four to five redirect layers in the campaign, each of which followed on from the GitHub dropper to install more nastiness that it appears were designed to steal information including stored browser credentials.\n\nMicrosoft noted that the malicious repos have since been taken down, and provided plenty of indicators of compromise and other valuable information in its report to aid in hunting down and stopping related campaigns.\n\nCritical vulnerabilities of the week: Put a Red Hat on that CVE Future open-source software vulnerabilities might come with a fedora, as Red Hat is now a CVE numbering authority of last resort. \"For over two decades, Red Hat has actively contributed to the goals and initiatives of the CVE Program,\" Red Hat's Pete Allor and Yogesh Mittal wrote in a recent blog post. \"This milestone reflects our relentless pursuit of excellence, strong collaborations and impactful contributions to industry standards and best practices.\" Now have some vulnerabilities, all of which are being actively exploited: CVSS 9.8 - CVE-2024-4885: Progress Software's WhatsUp Gold network monitoring software, prior to version 2023.1.3, contains an unauthenticated RCE vuln. Given Progress' other software issues, this deserves attention.\n\nCVSS 9.8 - CVE-2022-43939: Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 9.4.0.1 and 9.3.0.2 allow security restriction circumvention when using non-canonical URLs.\n\nCVSS 8.8 - CVE-2022-43769: Those same versions of Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server contain a special element injection vulnerability allowing web services to set property values.\n\nCVSS 8.8 - CVE-2022-43769: Those same versions of Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server contain a special element injection vulnerability allowing web services to set property values.\n\nCisco warns old CVE being exploited\n\nCisco last week warned that CVE-2023-20118 has been added to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s known exploited vulnerability list.\n\nThe flaw was one of several vulns in small business routers that Cisco announced in 2023 but will not fix as it deems the flawed hardware tool old to upgrade and suggested owners buy new kit instead. Remember that next time Cisco trumpets its environmental credentials.\n\nShocker: Phone cleaner apps collect, sell your data\n\nThis week\u2019s \"totally not a surprise\" infosec news comes in the form of a Surfshark report that claims all of the top 10 most popular phone cleaning apps on the Apple App Store shared user data with third parties.\n\nData shared by the cleaning apps included user and device IDs, location data, product interactions, purchase history, usage history and the like. In short, everything that a data broker might want to use to compile a thorough advertising profile for those unwise enough to install one of the useless bits of code.\n\n\"Once shared, this data can potentially end up in the hands of hundreds of partners, who are free to use it for their own purposes,\" VPN vendor Surfshark pointed out as part of its endless quest to find scary stuff that gives people a reason to acquire its wares.\n\nThese apps are obvious rubbish to our sophisticated readers, but for those worried about device security among their users and loved ones, a link to instructions on how to clean up iPhones and Android devices can go a long way to prevent installation of such unnecessary privacy violating apps.\n\nUS House does something useful, passes contractor security bill\n\nDon't say they never do anything, because last week the US House of Representatives passed a bill that would require covered federal contractors to implement vulnerability disclosure policies. If passed, it would close what bill sponsor Congresswoman Nancy Mace's (R-SC) office described in a press release as a \"critical loophole in federal cybersecurity standards.\"\n\nThe rule applies to any federal contractor with a contract worth more than $225,000 or any that \"use, operate, manage or maintain a federal information system on behalf of an agency.\"\n\nCurrent infosec rules don't apply to contractors, which Mace said means a gap in national security.\n\nThis isn't the first time Mace has introduced such a bill - she tried in 2023 to pass a near identical version, and in 2024 the Senate tabled its own version. Neither went anywhere, so Congress passing this one along to the Senate is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nYouTube CEO impersonated by AI to phish creators\n\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan's face was apparently cloned and used by scammers in AI-generated videos to phish YouTube creators.\n\nGoogle said the AI-generated video was shared with YouTube creators as a private video that announced monetization changes for the platform. It's not clear what information the scammers behind the campaign were trying to steal, or how they attempted to do it, with Google only noting that creators shouldn't click on private videos \"claiming to be from YouTube.\"\n\n\"YouTube and its employees will never attempt to contact you or share information through a private video,\" Google noted in a support post last week. \"Many phishers actively target Creators by trying to find ways to impersonate YouTube by exploiting in-platform features to link to malicious content.\"\n\nSingaporean cyberscammers are in for a beating\n\nCybercriminals facilitating scams in Singapore might want to reconsider: In addition to stiff jail terms, they could soon be facing a stiff rattan rod to the bare behind along with their time behind bars.\n\nSingapore Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said (12:08) that the government was considering caning scammers, per the recommendation of a Singaporean parliamentarian, in addition to continuing to hand out long prison sentences.\n\n\"We will consider \u2026 for caning to be proscribed for certain scam-related offenses recognizing the serious harm they can cause,\" Sun said.\n\nSingapore has become a hotbed of online scamming, with more than $1.1 billion dollars lost by Singaporeans falling victim to scams in 2024.\n\nSun specifically called out Telegram for facilitating scams in Singapore, noting that the number of scams reported on the platform nearly doubled last year.\n\n\"We will explore further measures to address the scam situation on telegram, including making use of our legislative levers to ensure compliance,\" Sun said. \u00ae",

Now, it seems Microsoft is looking to push its own AI models in the popular software suite, while also developing a rival to OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models in the \u201dGPT-o\u201d family.\n\nAs per The Information, employees at Microsoft\u2019s AI unit recently concluded the training of \u201ca new family of AI model\u201d that are currently in development under the \u201cMAI\u201d codename. Internally, the team is hopeful that these in-house models perform nearly as well as the top AI models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUnder the leadership of its AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft is launching this initiative to trim down its dependence on OpenAI and develop its own AI stack for Copilot applications. The developments are not surprising.\n\nSteadily building its own stack\n\nIn the last week of February, Microsoft introduced new small language models called Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini. They come with multi-modal capabilities, which means they can process text, speech, and vision as input formats, just like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\nThese two new AI models are already available to developers via Microsoft\u2019s Azure AI Foundry and third-party platforms such as HuggingFace and the NVIDIA API Catalog. In benchmarks shared by the company, the Phi-4 model is already ahead of Google\u2019s latest Gemini 2.0 series models on multiple test parameters.\n\n\u201cIt is among a few open models to successfully implement speech summarization and achieve performance levels comparable to GPT-4o model,\u201d Microsoft noted in its blog post. The company is hoping to release its \u201dMAI\u201d models commercially via its Azure service.\n\nRivalry, and openness to rivals\n\nAside from testing in-house AI models for Copilot, Microsoft is also exploring third-party options such as DeepSeek, xAI, and Meta. DeepSeek recently made waves by offering a high performance benchmark at a dramatically lower development cost. It has already been adopted by numerous companies and recently claimed a theoretical cost-to-profit ratio of over 500% on a daily basis.\n\nToday, we are advancing our AI ambitions with the release of DeepSeek R1 7B & 14B distilled models for Copilot+ PCs via Azure AI Foundry. This is the next step on our journey to continue to make Windows the platform for AI, seamlessly integrating intelligence from the cloud to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/QaUYrlMIt6 \u2014 Pavan Davuluri (@pavandavuluri) March 3, 2025\n\nAside from developing its own AI models to replace OpenAI\u2019s GPT infrastructure for Copilot, Microsoft is also reportedly working on its own reasoning AI models, too. This would pit Microsoft against OpenAI products such as GPT-o1 as well as Chinese upstarts such as DeepSeek, both of which offer reasoning capabilities.\n\nApparently, the work on an in-house reasoning model has been expedited due to strained relationships between Microsoft and OpenAI teams over technology sharing. According to The Information, Suleyman and OpenAI have been at odds over the latter\u2019s lack of transparency regarding the intricate workings of its AI models such as GPT-o1.\n\nReasoning models are deemed to be the next frontier for AI development, as they offer a more nuanced understanding of queries, logical deduction, and better problem solving capabilities. Microsoft also claims that its Phi-4 model delivers stronger language, mathematical, and visual science reasoning chops.",

            "content": "In this blog, we will demonstrate using Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution with native backups to Amazon S3 and support for Amazon RDS for SQL Server. A common task for customers is to configure database backups and maintenance jobs for their SQL Servers. Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution scripts can simplify this task by automating SQL Server database backup and maintenance tasks. AWS is excited to collaborate with Ola Hallengren, adding SQL Server 2022 backup to Amazon S3 functionality via Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution.\n\nBeginning with SQL Server 2022, Microsoft introduced a native solution for performing backups directly to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) object storage. This new feature streamlines the backup process, eliminating the need for intermediate storage or additional third-party tools. It offers enhanced security, improved performance, and seamless integration with AWS services. For a comprehensive overview of this feature and step-by-step implementation guidance, we recommend reviewing the AWS blog post, Backup SQL Server to Amazon S3.\n\nOla Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution with Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe following resources are required for this solution.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe new functionality added to Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution for Amazon S3 backups support:\n\nSQL Server 2022 on Amazon EC2\n\nAmazon RDS Custom for SQL Server 2022\n\nSQL Server editions \u2013 Developer, Enterprise or Standard\n\nFor a complete list of supported environments and limitations please reference the SQL Server Maintenance Solution documentation.\n\nOverview of the implementation\n\nThe updated DatabaseBackup stored procedure leverages the existing URL parameters, which can now be used for your primary Amazon S3 bucket and a mirror bucket path.\n\n@URL This should contain the full path to the Amazon S3 bucket, the pseudo directory structure created within the bucket will be generated to match existing structure Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution creates. Example: @URL = \u2018s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\u2019\n\n@MirrorURL This should contain the full path to the Amazon S3 bucket the backup will be mirrored to, the pseudo directory structure created within the bucket will be generated to match existing structure Ola Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution creates. Example: @MirrorURL = \u2018s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket-mirror.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\u2019\n\n\n\nNote: The @MirrorURL parameter continues to support a single URL while the TSQL command allows for three. Using multiple mirrors does significantly limit the maximum 12.2 TB backup size supported so we recommend leveraging Amazon S3 cross region replication that can be configured at the Amazon S3 bucket level if you need multiple mirrors.\n\nOther parameters such as @MaxTransferSize = 20971520 will also need to be set, for a complete discussion on the needed parameters review, Backup SQL Server databases to Amazon S3.\n\nConfiguration\n\nBy default, the MaintenanceSolution.sql script will create the required SQL Server Agent backup jobs and will include the @URL parameter if specified (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 @BackupURL parameter\n\nTo add the @URL parameter to your existing SQL Server backup jobs you can edit the individual steps on each SQL Server Agent Job and add the parameter manually (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Job step properties for @URL parameter\n\nThe @MirrorURL parameter cannot be specified during the initial setup and will need to be manually added to each job (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Job step properties for @MirrorURL parameter\n\nOla Hallengren\u2019s SQL Server Maintenance Solution with Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for SQL Server\n\nSolution Overview\n\nAWS has published a GitHub repo, aws-sql-server-maintenance-solution where additional functionality has been added providing support for native backups within Amazon RDS for SQL Server while maintaining the current procedure and job structure customers deploy and are familiar with today. This is a direct replacement for your current MaintenanceSolution deployment and no existing functionality within the solution has been removed or altered.\n\nWith Amazon RDS, you can use the SQL Server Agent on a database instance running SQL Server Enterprise, Standard, or Web edition. By default, an Amazon RDS for SQL Server installation has no SQL Server Agent jobs configured. Leveraging the solution in this post will allow the integration of the aws-sql-server-maintenance-solution scripts into the Amazon RDS for SQL Server Agent jobs for seamless backups and maintenance. This updated solution supports all versions of SQL Server on Amazon RDS.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe following resources are required for this solution.\n\nAn Amazon RDS for SQL Server instance.\n\nThe Amazon RDS instance is configured to backup to Amazon S3. If not, please follow the guidance in, How do I perform native backups of an Amazon RDS DB instance that\u2019s running SQL Server?\n\nImplementation\n\nThe MaintenanceSolution.sql TSQL script is downloaded from the GitHub aws-sql-server-maintenance-solution repository and run on the Amazon RDS for SQL Server instance. The parameters should be adjusted as follows.\n\nExisting parameters:\n\nNew parameters:\n\n@S3BucketArn This will contain the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon S3 bucket the backups should be written to. This can be found in the properties tab of your Amazon S3 bucket (Figure 4). For example: @S3BucketArn = \u2018arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket\u2019\n\n\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Amazon S3 bucket ARN\n\n@kms_master_key_arn This contains the ARN for the symmetric encryption KMS key to use to encrypt the item, if not specified the backup file will not be encrypted. This ARN will be found within the General configuration of your key (Figure 5). For example: @kms_master_key_arn = \u2018arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:00000000:key/abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz012435\u2019\n\n\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 AWS KMS key ARN\n\nThe jobs created on an Amazon RDS instance (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Amazon RDS for SQL Server agent jobs\n\nScheduling\n\nThe jobs can be scheduled using the SQL Server Agent as a standard TSQL agent job, for more information see, Configure schedule for SQL Server Agent job.\n\nMonitoring and alerting\n\nDue to the functionality of the msdb.dbo.rds_backup_database stored procedure provided for native backups within Amazon RDS for SQL Server, we will not be able to leverage the SQL Server Agent built in functionality.\n\nWe will leverage Amazon CloudWatch to capture backup failures from the SQL logs and leverage Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alerts based on the specific error message using the architecture shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Amazon RDS for SQL Server alerts architecture\n\nConfiguring Amazon CloudWatch log collection\n\nTo monitor for these changes, we first need to configure our RDS for SQL Server instance to export its logs to Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nOpen the Amazon RDS Console, select your instance and choose Modify. Check Error Log under Log exports, choose Continue. Choose Apply Immediately.\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Log exports\n\nAfter this step has been completed, your Amazon RDS for SQL Server Error Logs will be posted to Amazon CloudWatch Log Groups. For more information about publishing logs to CloudWatch see, Publishing SQL Server logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.\n\nIn the error logs you will see two errors posted currently but additional customized errors can be added as needed.\n\n\u201c RDS:Msg Errors Detected in RDS Backup Queue Status \u201d \u2013 This is logged when a final state of ERROR is returned from msdb.dbo.rds_task_status.\n\n\u201d \u2013 This is logged when a final state of ERROR is returned from msdb.dbo.rds_task_status. \u201cA task has already been issued for database: xx with task id yy, please try again later\u201d \u2013 This is proactively logged when a duplicate backup command is issued. This is informational but may be an event that requires alerting.\n\nAlerting Configuration\n\nWe can now configure pattern matching filters to identify the specific wording of the errors and generate alerts.\n\nTo create SNS alerts\n\nOpen Amazon CloudWatch console and choose Log groups. Enter the Amazon RDS instance name (DB identifier) in the search to locate the log group. Choose the log group and select Create metric filter under the Actions menu.\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Log groups\n\nEnter, Errors Detected in RDS Backup Queue Status in the Filter pattern and choose Next.\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Create filter pattern\n\nUse \u201cRDSBackup\u201d for Filter name, Metric namespace, and Metric name.

            "content": "Microsoft unveiled its 'Majorana 1' quantum chip in February.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nA physicist has cast doubt on a test that underlies a high-profile claim by Microsoft to have created the first \u2018topological qubits\u2019, a long-sought goal of the company\u2019s quantum-computing effort. The critique comes amid mounting speculation about the validity of Microsoft\u2019s claim.\n\nMicrosoft announced the breakthrough, which could lead to a quantum computer that is more resistant to information loss than with other approaches, on 19 February. Without a peer-reviewed paper backing up the claim, some researchers were sceptical. An accompanying paper in Nature described a method to measure the read-out from future topological qubits, but did not offer proof of their existence1.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nature paper outlined our approach, it does not speak to our progress,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. The paper was submitted almost a year before it was published and since then \u201ctremendous progress has occurred\u201d, they said. (Nature\u2019s news team is independent of its journals team.)\n\nIn the latest critique, posted as a preprint2, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, UK, raises concerns about a test that Microsoft uses to look for Majoranas, so-far undiscovered quasiparticles arising from the collective behaviour of electrons that are needed for the topological qubits to work.\n\nKnown as the topological gap protocol (TGP), the test is not mentioned in the 19 February Microsoft announcement. But the company has subsequently indicated to Nature\u2019s news team, and in a comment online, that it created the topological qubits using the TGP. \u201cSince the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit are not there,\u201d says Legg.\n\nChetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft\u2019s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, stands by the qubit claim. \u201cThe criticism can be summarized as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that,\u201d he says.\n\nA Majorana test\n\nMajoranas have previously proved elusive. Several claimed sightings later proved to be Majorana mimics, in some cases leading to retractions.\n\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers posted a preprint reporting that the TGP could indirectly identify Majoranas with \u2018high probability\u2019; the preprint was later published in Physical Review B (PRB)3. The test relies on electronic measurements of microscopic sandwiches of ultracold metal. If the measurement exhibits a specific feature characteristic of Majoranas, the device \u2018passes\u2019 and is said to host the elusive particles.\n\nLegg and his colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland went on to report that the test could be fooled by false positives, doppelgangers with the electronic features of Majoranas that lack their useful properties4.\n\nIn his latest critique, Legg reports further flaws with the protocol. Examining data in the PRB paper, he saw large variations in the external conditions, such as the range of magnetic field strengths, when electronic measurements were taken. The test was designed to measure the intrinsic properties of the device \u2014 and thus whether it contained Majoranas. Instead, Legg found that varying conditions made the test an inconsistent weathervane.\n\nNayak does not accept this criticism. \u201cThe ranges come from an initial scan we describe, and we always analyse the full data,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother problem, says Legg, is that a key parameter in the code that implements the protocol, which Microsoft shared publicly, differs from the description in the PRB paper. When asked by Nature\u2019s news team about the issue, Nayak said: \u201cLegg claims there\u2019s a difference between our described protocol and the implemented code. This is incorrect, so this is a non-issue.\u201d Legg says that Nayak previously acknowledged this difference in an e-mail to him and planned to issue a correction, but changed his mind.\n\nLegg\u2019s critique is \u201ccertainly valid\u201d, says Carlo Beenakker, a theoretical physicist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, although he remains \u201centhusiastic\u201d about Microsoft\u2019s goal of creating topological qubits. \u201cI have a deep respect for people who basically go out and somehow are not distracted by others who say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe it\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nAnton Akhmerov, a theoretical physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that \u201cLegg\u2019s critique requires a public response from the Microsoft researchers\u201d. A Microsoft spokesperson said that they would officially respond to Legg\u2019s critique when contacted by editors of PRB.",

In at least two other isolated instances, the payloads have been found hosted on Discord and Dropbox. The GitHub repositories have since been taken down. The company did not reveal how many such repositories were removed.\n\nThe Microsoft-owned code hosting service acts as a staging ground for dropper malware that's responsible for deploying a series of additional programs like Lumma Stealer and Doenerium, which, in turn, are capable of collecting system information.\n\nThe attack also employs a sophisticated redirection chain comprising four to five layers, with the initial redirector embedded within an iframe element on illegal streaming websites serving pirated content.\n\nThe overall infection sequence is a multi-stage process that involves system discovery, information gathering, and the use of follow-on payloads such as NetSupport RAT and AutoIT scripts to facilitate more data theft. The remote access trojan also serves as a conduit for stealer malware.\n\nFirst-stage - Establish a foothold on target devices\n\nSecond-stage - System reconnaissance, collection, and exfiltration, and payload delivery\n\nThird-stage - Command execution, payload delivery, defensive evasion, persistence, command-and-control communications, and data exfiltration\n\nFourth-stage - PowerShell script to configure Microsoft Defender exclusions and run commands to download data from a remote server\n\nAnother characteristic of the attacks concerns the use of various PowerShell scripts to download NetSupport RAT, identify installed applications and security software, specifically scanning for the presence of cryptocurrency wallets, indicating potential financial data theft.\n\n\"Besides the information stealers, PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts were run on the host,\" Microsoft said. \"The threat actors incorporated use of living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) like PowerShell.exe, MSBuild.exe, and RegAsm.exe for C2 and data exfiltration of user data and browser credentials.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as Kaspersky revealed that bogus websites masquerading as the DeepSeek and Grok artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being used to trick users into installing a previously undocumented Python information stealer.\n\nDeekSeek-themed decoy sites advertised by verified accounts on X (e.g., @ColeAddisonTech, @gaurdevang2, and @saduq5) have also been employed to execute a PowerShell script that uses SSH to grant attackers remote access to the computer.\n\n\"Cybercriminals use various schemes to lure victims to malicious resources,' the Russian cybersecurity company said. \"Typically, links to such sites are distributed through messengers and social networks. Attackers may also use typosquatting or purchase ad traffic to malicious sites through numerous affiliate programs.\"",

At that point, the application will be stripped from Microsoft 365, \"and existing on-premises suites will no longer be supported.\"\n\nSo how should a user create a mailout or leaflet with terrible clip art and font choices? How will noticeboards get populated with flyers?\n\nThe answer, according to Microsoft, is to use Word or PowerPoint. Or perhaps Designer.\n\nAnyone who has tried to position items in Word, only to have the careful formatting of a document go horrendously awry due to a misplaced pixel, would likely take a step backward before trying to recreate that parish noticeboard page in the application.\n\nSimilarly, PowerPoint is more geared toward corporate presentations rather than a certificate of achievement.\n\nAnother challenge for users is figuring out what to do with all those .pub files created by the application. Fear not! Microsoft has a solution. Open up the file format or hand the application over to open source developers? No, of course not. Microsoft's suggestion is to have users export their creations to .pdf so they can still be viewed.\n\nIf a user wishes to edit the file, Microsoft has a solution to that, too: open the .pdf file in Word. However, the company warns: \"The converted Word document will be optimized for text editing. As a result, its layout may vary from the original PDF \u2013 particularly if the document includes many graphics.\"\n\nSadly, that's pretty much the definition of what Publisher users tend to churn out \u2013 layouts with many graphics.\n\nMicrosoft's final suggestion is to use a third-party tool, though it obviously won't provide support for these. Third-party applications capable of importing include CorelDRAW, LibreOffice Draw, and the open source desktop publishing application Scribus. However, each comes with its own limitations and hoops for users to jump through. \u00ae",

This activity is tracked under the umbrella name Storm-0408 that we use to track numerous threat actors associated with remote access or information-stealing malware and who use phishing, search engine optimization (SEO), or malvertising campaigns to distribute malicious payloads.\n\nIn this blog, we provide our analysis of this large-scale malvertising campaign, detailing our findings regarding the redirection chain and various payloads used across the multi-stage attack chain. We further provide recommendations for mitigating the impact of this threat, detection details, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and hunting guidance to locate related activity. By sharing this research, we aim to raise awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in this widespread activity so organizations can better prepare and implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their systems and data.\n\nWe would like to thank the GitHub security team for their prompt response and collaboration in taking down the malicious repositories.\n\nGitHub activity and redirection chain\n\nSince at least early December 2024, multiple hosts downloaded first-stage payloads from malicious GitHub repositories. The users were redirected to GitHub through a series of other redirections. Analysis of the redirector chain determined the attack likely originated from illegal streaming websites where users can watch pirated videos. The streaming websites embedded malvertising redirectors within movie frames to generate pay-per-view or pay-per-click revenue from malvertising platforms. These redirectors subsequently routed traffic through one or two additional malicious redirectors, ultimately leading to another website, such as a malware or tech support scam website, which then redirected to GitHub.\n\nMultiple stages of malware were deployed in this campaign, as listed below, and the several different stages of activity that occurred depended on the payload dropped during the second stage.\n\nThe first-stage payload that was hosted on GitHub served as the dropper for the next stage of payloads.\n\nThe second-stage files were used to conduct system discovery and to exfiltrate system information that was Base64-encoded into the URL and sent over HTTP to an IP address. The information collected included data on memory size, graphic details, screen resolution, operating system (OS), and user paths.\n\nVarious third-stage payloads were deployed depending on the second-stage payload. In general, the third-stage payload conducted additional malicious activities such as command and control (C2) to download additional files and to exfiltrate data, as well as defense evasion techniques.\n\nThe full redirect chain was composed of four to five layers. Microsoft researchers determined malvertising redirectors were contained within an iframe on illegal streaming websites.\n\nFigure 1. Code from website of streaming video and iframe showing malvertising redirector URL\n\nThere were several redirections that occurred before arriving at the malicious content stored on GitHub.\n\nFigure 2. Redirection chain from pirate streaming website to malware files on GitHub\n\nAttack chain\n\nOnce the redirection to GitHub occurred, the malware hosted on GitHub established the initial foothold on the user\u2019s device and functioned as a dropper for additional payload stages and running malicious code. The additional payloads included information stealers to collect system and browser information on the compromised device, of which most were either Lumma stealer or an updated version of Doenerium. Depending on the initial payload, the deployment of NetSupport, a remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, was also often deployed alongside the infostealer. Besides the information stealers, PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts were run on the host. The threat actors incorporated use of living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) like PowerShell.exe, MSBuild.exe, and RegAsm.exe for C2 and data exfiltration of user data and browser credentials.\n\nAfter the initial foothold was gained, the activity led to a modular and multi-stage approach to payload delivery, execution, and persistence. Each stage dropped another payload with a different function, as outlined below. Actions conducted across these stages include system discovery (memory, GPU, OS, signed-in users, and others), opening browser credential files, Data Protection API (DPAPI) crypt data calls, and other functions such as obfuscated script execution and named pipe creations to conduct data exfiltration. Persistence was achieved through modification of the registry run keys and the addition of a shortcut file to the Windows Startup folder.\n\nSeveral stages of malicious activity to conduct deployment of additional malware, collections, and exfiltration of data to a C2 were observed. While not every single initial payload followed these exact steps, this is an overall view of what occurred across most incidents analyzed:\n\nFigure 3. General depiction of the four stages\n\nDuring the first stage, a payload is dropped onto the user\u2019s device from the binary hosted on GitHub, establishing a foothold on that device. As of mid-January 2025, the first-stage payloads discovered were digitally signed with a newly created certificate. A total of twelve different certificates were identified, all of which have been revoked.\n\nMost of these initial payloads dropped the following legitimate files to leverage their functionality. These files were either leveraged by the first-stage payload or by later-stage payloads, depending on the actions being conducted.\n\nFile name Function app-64.7z This is a compressed archive that stores the second-stage payload and additional dropped files. app.asar This is an archive file specific to Electron applications, which are directly installed programs. d3dcompiler_47.dll This file is often included in DirectX redistributables, which are commonly bundled with Microsoft installers for games and graphics applications. elevate.exe This file is used by various installers and scripts to run processes with elevated privileges, not specific to Microsoft. ffmpeg.dll This file is associated with FFmpeg, a popular multimedia framework used to handle video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. libEGL.dll This file is part of the ANGLE project, which is often found in applications that use OpenGL Embedded Systems (ES), including some web browsers and games. libEGLESv2.dll This file is part of the ANGLE project, which is often found in applications that use OpenGL ES, including some web browsers and games. LICENSES.chromium.html This file could contain information about the system or browser. nsis7z.dll This file is associated with the plugins for the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), which is used to create installers for various software. StdUtils.dll This file is associated with the plugins for the NSIS. System.dll This file is part of the .NET Framework assembly, typically included in Microsoft installers for applications that rely on the .NET Framework. vk_swiftshader.dll This file is associated with SwiftShader, which is used in applications that need a CPU-based implementation of the Vulkan API. vulkan-1.dll This file is associated with applications that use the Vulkan Graphics API, such as games and graphics software.\n\nDepending on the first-stage payload that was initially established on the compromised device, Microsoft observed different second-stage payloads and several different methods for delivering these payloads to the device.\n\nSecond-stage payload: System discovery, collection, and exfiltration\n\nThe main purpose of the second-stage payload is to conduct system discovery and collect that data for exfiltration to the C2. The system information collected includes data such as memory size, graphic card details, screen resolution, operating system, user paths, and a reference to the second-stage payload\u2019s file name.\n\nThis was accomplished by querying the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName for the Windows OS version and running commands, such as the echo command, to gather the device\u2019s name (%COMPUTERNAME%) and domain name (%USERDOMAIN%).\n\nSystem data collected by the second-stage payload is Base64-encoded and exfiltrated as a query parameter to an IP address.\n\nFigure 4. Typical format of the URL observed when exfiltrating information collected from the compromised device\n\nThird-stage payload: PowerShell and .exe binary\n\nDepending on the second-stage payload, either one or multiple executables are dropped onto the compromised device, and sometimes an accompanying encoded PowerShell script. These files initiate a chain of events that conduct command execution, payload delivery, defensive evasion, persistence, C2 communications, and data exfiltration. The analysis of the dropped executables is first discussed below, followed by review of the PowerShell scripts observed.\n\nThird-stage .exe analysis\n\nThe second-stage payloads run the dropped third-stage executables using the command prompt (for example, cmd.exe /d /s /c \u201c\u201dC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ApproachAllan.exe\u201d\u201d). The /c flag ensures that the command runs and exits quickly. When the third-stage .exe runs, it drops a command file (.cmd) and launches it using the command prompt (for example, \u201ccmd.exe\u201d /c copy Beauty Beauty.cmd && Beauty.cmd). The .cmd file performs several actions, such as running tasklist, to initiate the discovery of running programs. This is followed by the findstr to search for keywords associated with security software:\n\nfindstr keyword Associated software wrsa Webroot SecureAnywhere opssvc Quick Heal AvastUI Avast Antivirus AVGUI AVG Antivirus bdservicehost Bitdefender Antivirus nsWscSvc Norton Security ekrn ESET SophosHealth Sophos\n\nThe .cmd file also concatenates multiple files into one with a single character file name: \u201ccmd /c copy /b ..\\Verzeichnis + ..\\Controlling + ..\\Constitute + ..\\Enjoyed + ..\\Confusion + ..\\Min +..\\Statutory J\u201d. This single character filename is used next.\n\nFollowing this, the third-stage .exe produces an AutoIT v3 interpreter file that is renamed from the typical file name of AutoIt3.exe and uses a .com file extension. The .cmd file initiates the execution of the .com file against the single character binary (such as Briefly.com J). Note, most of the second-stage payloads follow this progression chain, and as mentioned a second-stage payload can also drop multiple executables, all following the same process. For example:\n\nFirst stage\n\nX-essentiApp.exe\n\nSecond stage\n\nIonixnignx.exe\n\nThird stage\n\nEverybodyViewing.exe\n\nReliefOrganizational.exe\n\nInflationWinston.exe\n\nThird-stage command files\n\nBeauty.cmd\n\nPossess.cmd\n\nVilla.cmd\n\nFourth-stage AutoIT .com files\n\nAlexandria.com\n\nKills.com\n\nBriefly.com\n\nWe observed multiple .com files originating from different dropped executables, each performing distinct functions while occasionally overlapping in behavior. These files facilitate persistence, process injection, remote debugging, and data exfiltration through various mechanisms. One .com file, such as Alexandria.com, drops a .scr file (another renamed AutoIT interpreter), and a .js (JavaScript) file with the same name as the .scr file. The purpose of the JavaScript file is to ensure persistence by creating a .url internet shortcut that points to the JavaScript file and is placed in the Startup folder, ensuring that the .scr file executes when the .js file executes (through Wscript.exe) upon user sign-in. Alternatively, persistence can be achieved using scheduled task creation. The .scr file can initiate C2 connections, enable remote debugging on Chrome or Edge within a hidden desktop session, or create TCP listening sockets on ports 9220-9229. This functionality allows threat actors to monitor browsing activity and interact with an active browser instance. These files can also open sensitive data files, indicating their role in facilitating post-exploitation activities.\n\nAnother .com file, such as affiliated.com, also focuses on remote debugging and browser monitoring. In addition to remote monitoring, affiliated.com initiates network connections to Telegram, Let\u2019s Encrypt, and threat actor domains, potentially for C2 or exfiltration. It also accesses DPAPI to decrypt sensitive stored credentials and retrieve browser data.\n\nThe final observed .com file, such as Briefly.com, exhibits behavior similar to affiliated.com but extends its capabilities to include screenshot capture, data exfiltration, and PowerShell-based execution. This file accesses browser and user data for collection, establishes connections to Pastebin and additional C2 domains, and drops the fourth-stage PowerShell script.\n\nThe order in which these .com files run is not strictly defined, as one or multiple files can perform overlapping functions depending on the third-stage payload. In many cases, the .com files also leverage LOLBAS like RegAsm.exe by dropping a legitimate file into the %TEMP% directory or injecting malicious code into it using NtAllocateVirtualMemory and SetThreadContext API function calls. RegAsm.exe is used to establish C2 connections over TCP ports 15647 or 9000, exfiltrating data, accessing DPAPI for decryption, monitoring keystrokes using the WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook, and more. This flexibility in execution allows threat actors to tailor their approach based on environmental factors, such as security configurations and user activity.\n\nBrowser data files seen accessed:\n\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\<user profile uid>.default-release\\cookies.sqlite\n\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\<user profile uid>.default-release\\formhistory.sqlite\n\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\<user profile uid>.default-release\\key4.db\n\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\<user profile uid>.default-release\\logins.json\n\n\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Data\n\n\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\n\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n\nUser data file paths seen accessed:\n\nC:\\\\Users\\<user>\\\\OneDrive\n\nC:\\\\Users\\<user>\\\\Documents\n\nC:\\\\Users\\<user>\\\\Downloads\n\nThird-stage PowerShell analysis\n\nIf a PowerShell script is also dropped by the second-stage payload, it includes Base64-obfuscated commands to conduct actions, such as use curl to download additional files like NetSupport from the C2, create persistence for the NetSupport RAT, and exfiltrate system information to C2 servers. To ensure no errors or the progress meter is displayed on the compromised device, the curl command is often used with the \u2013silent option when downloading files from the C2. PowerShell is often configured to run without restrictions with the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass parameter.\n\nAs an example, in some of the incidents, when the second-stage payload runs, a PowerShell script is dropped and executed. The script sends the compromised device\u2019s name to the C2 and downloads NetSupport RAT from the same C2.\n\nSecond-stage payload: Squarel.exe\n\nPowerShell script: SHA-256: d70ccae7914fc8c36c9e11b2a7f10bebd7f5696e78d8836554f4990b0f688dbb\n\nC2 domain: keikochio[.]com\n\nNetSupport RAT: SHA-256: 32a828e2060e92b799829a12e3e87730e9a88ecfa65a4fc4700bdcc57a52d995\n\nIn another case, a second-stage payload drops a PowerShell script, which connects to hxxps://ipinfo[.]io to gather the compromised device\u2019s external-facing IP address. This information is sent to a Telegram chat, then drops presentationhost.exe (a renamed NetSupport binary) and remcmdstub.exe (NetSupport Command Manager) into the %TEMP% directory. Finally, the PowerShell script establishes persistence for presentationhost.exe by adding it to the auto-start extensibility points (ASEP) registry keys. When it runs, the NetSupport RAT connects to the C2 and captures a screenshot of the compromised device\u2019s desktop. It also delivers a Lumma executable that drops a VBScript file with the same name. The VBScript file runs encoded PowerShell to initiate C2 connections and launches MSBuild.exe to enable Chrome remote debugging on a hidden desktop. Additionally, presentationhost.exe initiates remcmdstub.exe, which leverages iScrPaint.exe (iTop Screen Recorder) to run MSBuild.exe and access browser credential files for exfiltration. The iScrPaint.exe file also establishes persistence by placing a .lnk shortcut in the Windows Startup folder, ensuring it runs on system reboot.\n\nSecond-stage payload: Application.exe\n\nPowerShell script: SHA-256: 483796a64f004a684a7bc20c1ddd5c671b41a808bc77634112e1703052666a64\n\nC2: hxxp://5.10.250[.]240/fakeurl.htm\n\nThe last observed third-stage PowerShell script was dropped by three second-stage payloads. The script sends the compromised device\u2019s name to the C2 server. It then changes the working directory to $env:APPDATA, before using Start-BitsTransfer to download NetSupport from the C2. To evade detection, it modifies system security settings forcing TLS1.2 for encrypted C2 communication. These files are extracted into a newly created WinLibraryClient directory under AppData and then are launched. The script establishes persistence for the client32.exe (NetSupport RAT) by modifying the ASEP registry. Client32.exe initiates C2 connections to hxxp://79.132.128[.]77/fakeurl.htm.\n\nSecond-stage payloads: SalmonSamurai.exe, LakerBaker.exe, and DisplayPhotoViewer.exe\n\nPowerShell script: SHA-256: 670218cfc5c16d06762b6bc74cda4902087d812e72c52d6b9077c4c4164856b6\n\nC2 domain: stocktemplates[.]net\n\nAdditionally, one observed execution included registry enumeration of HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\ to identify installed applications and security software. It also queries the system\u2019s domain status using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and scans for cryptocurrency wallets, including Ledger Live, Trezor Suite, KeepKey, BCVault, OneKey, and BitBox, indicating potential financial data theft.\n\nFourth-stage PowerShell analysis\n\nDepending on the .com file that ran (like Briefly.com), the renamed AutoIT file may drop a PowerShell script (SHA-256: 2a29c9904d1860ea3177da7553c8b1bf1944566e5bc1e71340d9e0ff079f0bd3). The obfuscated PowerShell code uses the Add-MpPreference cmdlet to modify Microsoft Defender to add in exclusion paths for Microsoft Defender, so the specified folders are not scanned.\n\nFigure 5. Deobfuscated commands to add exclusion paths to Windows Defender\n\nThe script above is sometimes followed by an instance of Base64-encoded PowerShell commands. The PowerShell commands perform the following actions:\n\nSends a web request to hxxps://360[.]net and closes the response.\n\nSends a web request to hxxps://baidu[.]com and closes the response.\n\nDownloads data from hxxps://klipcatepiu0[.]shop/int_clp_sha.txt using a web client.\n\nWrites the downloaded data to a memory stream and saves it as a .zip file named null.zip (SHA-256: f07b8e5622598c228bfc9bff50838a3c4fffd88c436a7ef77e6214a40b0a2bae) in the C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp directory.\n\nRecommendations\n\nMicrosoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.\n\nStrengthen Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configuration\n\nStrengthen operating environment configuration\n\nRequire multifactor authentication (MFA). While certain attacks such as adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attempt to circumvent MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats. Leverage phishing-resistant authentication methods such as FIDO Tokens, or Microsoft Authenticator with passkey. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking.\n\nImplement Entra ID Conditional Access authentication strength to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps.\n\nEncourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.\n\nEnable Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Service connections.\n\nEnable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem.\n\nAppLocker can restrict specific software tools prohibited within the organization, such as reconnaissance, fingerprinting, and RMM tools, or grant access to only specific users.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects threat components as the following malware:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following alerts might indicate threat activity associated with this threat.

Embedded content may be third-party iframes for example, but it can also be shared components or apps from other teams within your organization. A common case is when an application gets embedded and starts causing performance problems because it wasn\u2019t originally designed for embedded scenarios.\n\nBeing able to minimize the performance impact of the content you embed is crucial to improving the overall performance of your site or app.\n\nGoals\n\nWith this new feature proposal, we aim to do two things:\n\nTo make it possible for you to control the performance impact of the content you embed, and make it easy to do so, without having to determine exactly the individual constraints that are needed.\n\nAnd to make it possible for you to know when performance violations occur, so that you can understand when the user experience is negatively impacted by embedded content and improve the experience.\n\nProposal\n\nWe\u2019re proposing to achieve the above goals by introducing new Document Policy configurations and by reporting the violations to the embedder, so you can make decisions accordingly, and to the embedded content so they can also be aware of issues and mitigate them.\n\nHere are the document policies we\u2019re proposing to add for developers to apply to embedded content:\n\nbasic \u2013 Basic web development best practices that are scenario agnostic\n\nThis category encompasses fundamental web development best practices to ensure websites are optimized for performance across various environments. These tasks are typically simple to implement but are frequently overlooked, leading to significant performance issues.

This includes capping total media usage, iframe count, iframe depth, and CPU usage before the first interaction. script \u2013 Strict JavaScript restrictions while running/post-load\n\nThis category enforces restrictions on more complex JavaScript to further enhance performance. This includes limiting long tasks running on the main thread and capping high CPU usage tasks, particularly those involving workers that exceed certain execution times.\n\nViolations will be reported through the Reporting API. Developers can also opt into letting the browser address the violations directly, for example by not rendering oversized assets, blocking out images that are too large, pausing/blocking loading of scripts that violate limits, etc.\n\nExample\n\nImagine a complex app that embeds real-time content from different sources through iframes. The app has a weather widget that contains animations or high-definition videos which autoplay for different weather conditions without user interaction.\n\nTo minimize the performance impact of the embedded content, the developer of the host application aligns with producers of the embedded content on guidelines and best practices for the iframes to be loaded into the experience.\n\nWhile the producers of the embedded content make the necessary changes to meet the requirements, the host app serves its main document with Document Policy directives to enforce on the embedded content. In the simplest case, the app uses the basic policy to ensure oversized assets are limited and require assets to be zipped, by using the following Document Policy header:\n\nRequire-Document-Policy: basic\n\nIf the developer also wants to ensure that video and animations pause when the user is not interacting with them as well as apply some additional limits on JavaScript code, the developer can also set the early-script policy:\n\nRequire-Document-Policy: basic, early-script\n\nAlternatively, the developer can choose to set these policies individually, per iframe:\n\n<iframe policy=\"basic\">\n\n<iframe policy=\"basic, early-script\">\n\nLet us know what you think\n\nWe\u2019re very excited about how this proposal can give you more control of your app\u2019s performance and help uncover issues to improve the overall user experience.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for feedback on this proposal so if you\u2019re interested in this API and want to help us shape it, please read the explainer, and share any thoughts you have by opening a new issue on our repository.",

The sources told FT that Microsoft had lost some confidence in CoreWeave but had several ongoing contracts and remained an \"important partner.\"\n\nCoreWeave has denied reports that Microsoft withdrew some of its commitments to the AI cloud provider just ahead of its Initial Public Offering (IPO).\n\nDCD also reached out to Microsoft for comment.\n\nCoreWeave is currently preparing for its IPO, having filed earlier this week.\n\nIn its application to the SEC, CoreWeave acknowledged that \"a substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers\" and that the loss of spend from one or a few of the company's top customers would \"adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects.\"\n\nThe SEC filing noted that the company has $15.1bn in \"remaining performance obligations.\"\n\nAround 77 percent of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024 was from its two largest customers, Microsoft being the largest and accounting for 62 percent of CoreWeave's revenue that year.\n\nIn November 2024, Microsoft announced it would spend around $10 billion on CoreWeave's services by the end of the decade.\n\nAn analysis of CoreWeave's IPO from Next Platform noted that Microsoft \"seems to be in the mood to be less ebullient about its AI spending as partner OpenAI shifts to its own Project Stargate infrastructure for the same reason that many enterprises are repatriating their data centers: Cloud infrastructure is expensive compared to owning it yourself.\n\n\"So while that $15.1 billion in remaining performance obligations \u2013 which means contractual agreements to buy GPU instance capacity on the CoreWeave data centers \u2013 is great, it might be mostly Microsoft, and it might end three years from now if the average contract length is around four years as the S-1 says it is.\"\n\nTowards the end of last month, it emerged that Microsoft had canceled around 200MW of AI data center lease agreements. In the report from TD Cowen, the brokerage speculated: \"There is capacity that it has likely procured, particularly in areas where capacity is not fungible to cloud, where the company may have excess data center capacity relative to its new forecast.\"\n\nMicrosoft responded in a statement: \"While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future. Our plans to spend over $80bn on infrastructure this financial year remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.\"",

            "content": "As Microsoft Word and PowerPoint continually improve their feature sets, the two apps are slowly strangling one of Microsoft\u2019s traditional Office apps: Microsoft Publisher.\n\nMicrosoft now says that Microsoft Publisher will disappear in October 2026, where the (ahem) \u201cperpetual version\u201d of Publisher will be discontinued \u2014 at least in terms of support. At that time, Publisher will also be removed from Microsoft 365 and subscribers will not be able to access it from that date forward.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Publisher fan, Microsoft is throwing you a lifeline: You can download and use Publisher via M365 until the 2026 cutoff date. You can also buy Publisher. Even after the October 2026 date comes and goes, the perpetual version will still work, and you\u2019ll be able to open and edit your Publisher files. But the app won\u2019t be officially supported, so in the off chance that a vulnerability crops up, Microsoft won\u2019t patch it. Microsoft won\u2019t be adding any new features, either.\n\nWhy is Microsoft doing this? Its support page (thanks, Windows Latest) suggests an answer: Because Word and PowerPoint are doing everything Publisher does. Microsoft is now referring Publisher users to use Word for such projects as envelopes or letterhead, and either Word or PowerPoint for designing your own business cards.\n\nMicrosoft also recommends that Microsoft 365 subscribers convert their existing Publisher (.pub) files to some other format before the end-of-life date kicks in. To do so, Microsoft suggests a somewhat laborious process: Convert all Publisher files to PDFs by opening the file and then saving it in a .pdf format. You can then open the document in Word (or PowerPoint) and save it in the native format. The only problem? The layout may change.\n\nMicrosoft suggests creating a macro to do this if you have years\u2019 worth of Publisher files.\n\nAnd you just might. Wikipedia reports that Publisher was released in 1991, which means that the end-of-life date will be 35 years after it was first released, and later added to the Office 365/Microsoft 365 suite\u2026where many people just used Word instead.

Our latest blog explains how Microsoft security solutions detect these threats and offers mitigation guidance, aiming to raise awareness and strengthen defenses against Silk Typhoon\u2019s activities.\n\nSilk Typhoon is an espionage-focused Chinese state actor whose activities indicate that they are a well-resourced and technically efficient group with the ability to quickly operationalize exploits for discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in edge devices. This threat actor holds one of the largest targeting footprints among Chinese threat actors. Part of this is due to their opportunistic nature of acting on discoveries from vulnerability scanning operations, moving quickly to the exploitation phase once they discover a vulnerable public-facing device that they could exploit.\n\nAs a result, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting a wide range of sectors and geographic regions, including but not limited to information technology (IT) services and infrastructure, remote monitoring and management (RMM) companies, managed service providers (MSPs) and affiliates, healthcare, legal services, higher education, defense, government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), energy, and others located in the United States and throughout the world.\n\nSilk Typhoon has shown proficiency in understanding how cloud environments are deployed and configured, allowing them to successfully move laterally, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate data quickly within victim environments. Since Microsoft Threat Intelligence began tracking this threat actor in 2020, Silk Typhoon has used a myriad of web shells that allow them to execute commands, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate data from victim environments.\n\nAs with any observed nation-state threat actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments. We\u2019re publishing this blog to raise awareness of Silk Typhoon\u2019s recent and long-standing malicious activities, provide mitigation and hunting guidance, and help disrupt operations by this threat actor.\n\nRecent Silk Typhoon activity\n\nSupply chain compromise\n\nSince late 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has conducted thorough research and tracked ongoing attacks performed by Silk Typhoon. These efforts have significantly enhanced our understanding of the actor\u2019s operations and uncovered new tradecraft used by the actor. In particular, Silk Typhoon was observed abusing stolen API keys and credentials associated with privilege access management (PAM), cloud app providers, and cloud data management companies, allowing the threat actor to access these companies\u2019 downstream customer environments. Companies within these sectors are possible targets of interest to the threat actor. The observations below were observed once Silk Typhoon successfully stole the API key:\n\nSilk Typhoon used stolen API keys to access downstream customers/tenants of the initially compromised company.\n\nLeveraging access obtained via the API key, the actor performed reconnaissance and data collection on targeted devices via an admin account. Data of interest overlaps with China-based interests, US government policy and administration, and legal process and documents related to law enforcement investigations.\n\nAdditional tradecraft identified included resetting of default admin account via API key, web shell implants, creation of additional users, and clearing logs of actor-performed actions.\n\nThus far the victims of this downstream activity were largely in the state and local government, and the IT sector.\n\nPassword spray and abuse\n\nSilk Typhoon has also gained initial access through successful password spray attacks and other password abuse techniques, including discovering passwords through reconnaissance. In this reconnaissance activity, Silk Typhoon leveraged leaked corporate passwords on public repositories, such as GitHub, and were successfully authenticated to the corporate account. This demonstrates the level of effort that the threat actor puts into their research and reconnaissance to collect victim information and highlights the importance of password hygiene and the use of multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts.\n\nSilk Typhoon TTPs\n\nInitial access\n\nSilk Typhoon has pursued initial access attacks against targets of interest through development of zero-day exploits or discovering and targeting vulnerable third-party services and software providers. Silk Typhoon has also been observed gaining initial access via compromised credentials. The software or services targeted for initial access focus on IT providers, identity management, privileged access management, and RMM solutions.\n\nIn January 2025, Silk Typhoon was also observed exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the public facing Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN (CVE-2025-0282). Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center reported the activity to Ivanti, which led to a rapid resolution of the critical exploit, significantly reducing the period that highly skilled and sophisticated threat actors could leverage the exploit.\n\nLateral movement to cloud\n\nOnce a victim has been successfully compromised, Silk Typhoon is known to utilize common yet effective tactics to move laterally from on-premises environments to cloud environments. Once the threat actor has gained access to an on-premises environment, they look to dump Active Directory, steal passwords within key vaults, and escalate privileges. Furthermore, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting Microsoft AADConnect servers in these post-compromise activities. AADConnect (now Entra Connect) is a tool that synchronizes on-premises Active Directory with Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). A successful compromise of these servers could allow the actor to escalate privileges, access both on-premises and cloud environments, and move laterally.\n\nManipulating service principals/applications\n\nWhile analyzing post-compromise tradecraft, Microsoft identified Silk Typhoon abusing service principals and OAuth applications with administrative permissions to perform email, OneDrive, and SharePoint data exfiltration via MSGraph. Throughout their use of this technique, Silk Typhoon has been observed gaining access to an application that was already consented within the tenant to harvest email data and adding their own passwords to the application. Using this access, the actors can steal email information via the MSGraph API. Silk Typhoon has also been observed compromising multi-tenant applications, potentially allowing the actors to move across tenants, access additional resources within the tenants, and exfiltrate data.\n\nIf the compromised application had privileges to interact with the Exchange Web Services (EWS) API, the threat actors were seen compromising email data via EWS.\n\nIn some instances, Silk Typhoon was seen creating Entra ID applications in an attempt to facilitate this data theft. The actors would typically name the application in a way to blend into the environment by using legitimate services or Office 365 themes.\n\nUse of covert networks\n\nSilk Typhoon is known to utilize covert networks to obfuscate their malicious activities. Covert networks, tracked by Microsoft as \u201cCovertNetwork\u201d, refer to a collection of egress IPs consisting of compromised or leased devices that may be used by one or more threat actors. Silk Typhoon was observed utilizing a covert network that is comprised of compromised Cyberoam appliances, Zyxel routers, and QNAP devices. The use of covert networks has become a common tactic among various threat actors, particularly Chinese threat actors.\n\nHistorical Silk Typhoon zero-day exploitation\n\nSince 2021, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting and compromising vulnerable unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers, GlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks firewalls, Citrix NetScaler appliances, Ivanti Pulse Connect Secure appliances, and others. While not exhaustive, below are historical zero-day vulnerabilities that Silk Typhoon was observed compromising for initial access into victim environments.\n\nGlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks Firewalls\n\nIn March 2024, Silk Typhoon used a zero-day exploit for CVE-2024-3400 in GlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks firewalls to compromise multiple organizations:\n\nCVE-2024-3400 \u2013 A command injection as a result of arbitrary file creation vulnerability in the GlobalProtect feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software for specific PAN-OS versions and distinct feature configurations may enable an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall.\n\nCitrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway\n\nIn early 2024, Microsoft began to observe Silk Typhoon compromising zero-day vulnerabilities within Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateways:\n\nCVE-2023-3519 \u2013 An unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Servers\n\nIn January 2021, Microsoft began to observe Silk Typhoon compromising zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers. Upon discovery, Microsoft addressed those issues and issued security updates along with related guidance (related links below):\n\nCVE-2021-26855 \u2013 A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange that could allow an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n\nCVE-2021-26857 \u2013 An insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave Silk Typhoon the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to be exploited.\n\nCVE-2021-26858 \u2013 A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If Silk Typhoon could authenticate with the Exchange server, then it could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. It could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate administrator\u2019s credentials.\n\nCVE-2021-27065 \u2013 A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If Silk Typhoon could authenticate with the Exchange server, then it could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. It could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate administrator\u2019s credentials.\n\nDuring recent activities and historical exploitation of these appliances, Silk Typhoon utilized a variety of web shells to maintain persistence and to allow the actors to remotely access victim environments.\n\nHunting guidance\n\nTo help mitigate and surface various aspects of recent Silk Typhoons activities, Microsoft recommends the following:\n\nInspect log activity related to Entra Connect serversfor anomalousactivity.\n\nWhere these targeted applications have highly privileged accounts, inspect service principals for newly created secrets (credentials).\n\nIdentify and analyze any activity related to newly created applications.\n\nIdentify all multi-tenant applications and scrutinize authentications to them.\n\nAnalyze any observed activity related to use of Microsoft Graph or eDiscovery particularly for SharePoint or email data exfiltration\n\nLook for newly created users on devices impacted by vulnerabilities targeted by Silk Typhoon and investigate virtual private network (VPN) logs for evidence of VPN configuration modifications or sign-in activity during the possible window of compromise of unpatched devices.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the following queries to detect behavior associated with Silk Typhoon:\n\nCustomers can use the following query to detect vulnerabilities exploited by Silk Typhoon:\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo help detect and mitigate Silk Typhoon\u2019s activity, Microsoft recommends the following:\n\nEnsure all public facing devices are patched. It\u2019s important to note that patching a vulnerable device does not remediate any post-compromise activities by a threat actor who gained privileged access to a vulnerable device.\n\nValidate any Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN are patched to address CVE-2025-0282 and run the suggested Integrity Checker Tool as suggested in their Advisory. Consider terminating any active or persistent sessions following patch cycles.\n\nDefend against legitimate application and service principal abuse by establishing strong controls and monitoring for these security identities. Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat: Audit the current privilege level of all identities, users, service principals, and Microsoft Graph Data Connect applications (use the Microsoft Graph Data Connect authorization portal) to understand which identities are highly privileged. Scrutinize privileges more closely if they belong to an unknown identity, belong to identities that are no longer in use, or are not fit for purpose. Admins may assign identities privileges over and above what is required. Defenders should pay attention to apps with app-only permissions as those apps might have over-privileged access. Read additional guidance for investigating compromised and malicious applications.Identify abused OAuth apps using anomaly detection policies. Detect abused OAuth apps that make sensitive Exchange Online administrative activities through Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Investigate and remediate any risky OAuth apps.Review any applications that hold EWS.AccessAsUser.All and EWS.full_access_as_app permissions and understand whether they are still required in the tenant. This can be done using App governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. If these permissions are no longer required, they should be removed. If applications must access mailboxes, granular and scalable access can be implemented using role-based access control for applications in Exchange Online. This access model ensures applications are only granted to the specific mailboxes required.\n\nMonitor for service principal sign-ins from unusual locations. Two important reports can provide useful daily activity monitoring: The risky sign-ins report surfaces attempted and successful user access activities where the legitimate owner might not have performed the sign-in. The risky users report surfaces user accounts that might have been compromised, such as a leaked credential that was detected or the user signing in from an unexpected location in the absence of planned travel.\n\nDefend against credential compromise by building credential hygiene, practicing the principle of least privilege, and reducing credential exposure. Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.\n\nImplement the Azure Security Benchmark and general best practices for securing identity infrastructure, including: Prevent on-premises service accounts from having direct rights to the cloud resources to prevent lateral movement to the cloud. Ensure that \u201cbreak glass\u201d account passwords are stored offline and configure honey-token activity for account usage. Implement Conditional Access policies enforcing Microsoft\u2019s Zero Trust principles.\n\nEnable risk-based user sign-in protection and automate threat response to block high-risk sign-ins from all locations and enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for medium-risk ones.\n\nEnsure that VPN access is protected using modern authentication methods.\n\nIdentify all multi-tenant applications, assess permissions, and investigate suspicious sign-ins.\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\nSilk Typhoon is not known to use their own dedicated infrastructure in their operations. Typically, the threat actor uses compromised covert networks, proxies, and VPNs for infrastructure, likely to obfuscate their operations. However, they have also been observed using short-lease virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure to support their operations.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts can indicate associated threat activity:\n\nSilk Typhoon activity group\n\nThe following alerts might also indicate threat activity related to this threat.

Current subscribers can continue using their existing Skype Credit and subscriptions until the end of their next renewal period, the company confirmed. Users with remaining Skype Credit will still be able to use their balance until the service officially shuts down.\n\nMicrosoft said those who have not made the jump from Skype to Teams can do so by logging into the newer service with their Skype credentials. Conversations and contacts will automatically transfer. Before Skype officially shuts down, Teams users will be able to communicate with those still on Skype, and vice versa.\n\nFor those that do not wish to migrate to Teams, Microsoft is offering the ability to export their contact and chat data before the service is halted in early May.\n\nSkype for Business Online, which became redundant with the introduction of Microsoft Teams, shut down in 2021. Microsoft's previous two on-premises versions, Skype for Business Server 2016 and Skype for Business Server 2019, will lose support this October. They will be replaced by Skype for Business Server SE, although Microsoft recommends that business users also make the jump to Teams.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft is adding two sales-focused AI agents to its agentic portfolio, the tech giant announced Wednesday .\n\nSales Agent and Sales Chat connect to Dynamics 365 and Salesforce , helping workers keep track, grow and close deals, Microsoft said. Sales Agent autonomously researches leads, sets up meetings and reaches out to customers using data from a company\u2019s CRM, Microsoft 365 and the internet. Sales Chat can help sales reps prepare for client interactions via natural language prompts.\n\nCustomers will access both tools in public preview in May via Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat . Customers can also fine-tune the agents to get more accurate and actionable responses.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAI agents are proliferating in the enterprise as vendors reduce barriers to entry and integrate them into existing services and platforms.\n\nServiceNow announced expanded capabilities to ease workflow management between agents last month and plans to add thousands of pre-built agents to boost adoption. The vendor, a longtime proponent of enterprise automation, said it has nearly 1,000 customers using AI agents already, including EY and Rolls-Royce.\n\nIn recent months, Snowflake has also launched an agentic AI offering aimed at simplifying data integration, retrieval and processing. Salesforce, Google, SAP and AWS have rapidly expanded their AI agent portfolios and tailored offerings for customers, too.\n\nEnterprises have expressed interest in the latest flavor of AI. More than 2 in 5 businesses are planning to build 100-plus AI agent prototypes, according to a Tray.ai survey of U.S.-based enterprise tech pros. Most of the more than 1,000 respondents expect agents will become core to operations by year-end, powering more than one-quarter of processes.\n\nMicrosoft said organizations built more than 400,000 custom agents in Copilot Studio during the last three months. Enterprise customers span industries and their use cases vary.\n\nCarnival subsidiary Holland America Line created a sales agent to help customers pick and purchase cruise experiences. Professional services firm Accenture developed an agent to automate past-due payments and expedite collections. Telecommunications company Vodafone built an agent to streamline the request for proposals process to increase revenue opportunities for the sales team.\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies is also using an agent it developed, called ConsumerIQ, to help employees market its products and develop new ones by analyzing archives and company data, Microsoft said.\n\nSome organizations are further behind when it comes to deploying AI agents despite enthusiasm. Nearly 90% of those surveyed by Tray.ai said their organization needs to upgrade its tech stack in order to adopt the technology.\n\nAnalysts have warned of exacerbated risks related to security and the workforce should implementation occur before leaders work to strengthen governance.",

            "content": "Last month, Microsoft announced an advance that could be an important step forward in the long road to building a quantum computer\u2014if true.\n\nA Microsoft research team claims to have built \u201cthe world\u2019s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits,\u201d and that it is on track to build a prototype of a scalable quantum computer \u201cin years, not decades.\u201d If that weren\u2019t enough, the company also said it had created in the process \u201ca new state of matter\u201d: a topoconductor. This was just days after Microsoft was chosen, along with quantum computing company PsiQuantum, by the U.S. government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop under-explored approaches to quantum computing, a field that marries traditional computer science, theoretical physics, and mathematics.\n\nThe Microsoft chip\u2014Majorana 1, named after the Italian physicist on whose theories the chip was based\u2014is just the latest in a series of attempts by IBM, Google, Nokia Bell Labs, and others to build the basic mechanism that will run quantum computers. It\u2019s a massively difficult undertaking because quantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics, calling for delicate engineering at the level of subatomic particles.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge upside to developing computers that go beyond the limitations of today\u2019s classical computers. The operating core of computers hasn\u2019t changed since the explosion of computing began in the late 1940s: Computer chips still store, manipulate, and work according to our instructions using bits\u2014the 0/1 binary logic of all computers. Today\u2019s machines are \u201cjust millions of times faster with millions of times more memory,\u201d says Scott Aaronson, professor of theoretical computer science at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThat progress has followed the projection of semiconductor pioneer Gordon Moore\u2014in an observation known as Moore\u2019s Law\u2014that chip density (and therefore computing speed) should double every two years. Moore believed his law would hold at least through 1985, but it has largely continued to the present day. \u201cThe computing power of a single integrated circuit today is roughly two billion times what it was in 1960,\u201d according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nYet there\u2019s always been a limit to how far classical computation can go. One of those limitations was perhaps first stated by physicist Richard Feynman in the early 1980s. His explorations in quantum thermodynamics, electron-photon interactions, and liquid helium made him realize that the complex equations weren\u2019t solvable by classical computers. It\u2019s an issue of scale\u2014quantum computing requires massive numbers of inputs that a classical computer, no matter how fast, will never efficiently handle.\n\nBut Feynman, then others, saw that quantum mechanics could offer a way out of the problem. What if we could make a processor that ran on the laws of quantum mechanics?\n\nInstead of using bits of 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits), which behave in the odd fashion of electrons, photons, and other quantum particles. A qubit can store information as 0, 1, or a combined state (called a superposition) of 0 and 1. Qubits can also be connected, in a sense, so that a change in one qubit will affect another. A connected group of qubits \u201ccan provide way more processing power than the same number of binary bits,\u201d according to MIT Technology Lab.\n\nQuantum computers are not \u201cjust \u2026 like classical computers but faster,\u201d says Chetan Nayak, technical fellow and corporate vice president of quantum hardware at Microsoft. \u201cQuantum computers are an entirely different modality of computing.\u201d\n\nNor do quantum computers simply try \u201cevery possible answer in parallel\u201d\u2014another misconception, says Aaronson. Instead, quantum computing is a \u201cchoreograph\u201d of possible states for each qubit, where \u201cpaths leading to [the] wrong answer \u2026 cancel each other out\u201d and \u201cpaths leading to the right answer should reinforce each other.\u201d\n\nThat could open the era of problem-solving that people from Feynman onward have envisioned. To Aaronson, quantum computing\u2019s greatest promise is \u201csimply the simulation of quantum mechanics itself \u2026 to learn about chemical reactions \u2026 design new chemical processes, new materials, new drugs, new solar cells, new superconductors.\u201d For DARPA, that means \u201cfaster automation, improved target recognition and more precise, lethal weapons,\u201d and more robust cybersecurity, according to Defense News.\n\nBut the quantum states of qubits are also delicate, and disturbances (called noise) ranging from changes in light or temperature to vibrations can alter their superpositions\u2014and result in errors. This tendency of qubits toward \u201cdecoherence\u201d has been a major hurdle for quantum computing research and development. Today\u2019s quantum processors are full of noise and error-prone.\n\nThat\u2019s where Microsoft\u2019s approach could have a distinct advantage over that of its competitors. Topological qubits employ a physical construction that builds in quantum stability. But topological qubits are hard to build, and their results are harder to measure\u2014Microsoft\u2019s qubit project is \u201cthe longest-running R&D program in Microsoft history,\u201d says Nayak. As of last September, IBM and Google had built 127- and 72-qubit processors, respectively, versus Microsoft\u2019s 8. If Nayak\u2019s team can successfully build a more stable processor at scale it may, in its way, be as big a step in quantum computing as the transistor was in classical computing.\n\nThe question is whether Microsoft has truly built such a processor at all. On the same February day Nature published the company\u2019s peer-reviewed paper (which stopped short of offering proof of its claim to have built a topological qubit), Microsoft posted a press release and met with a few hundred researchers and others to review the Nature paper and announce the team\u2019s progress since the paper\u2019s submission early last year.\n\nThe press release was triumphant: \u201cMajorana 1: the world\u2019s first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) powered by a Topological Core, designed to scale to a million qubits on a single chip\u2026 With the core building blocks now demonstrated \u2026 we\u2019re ready to move from physics breakthrough to practical implementation.\u201d It sure sounded as if Microsoft had built a topoconductor.\n\nAs Aaronson wrote on his blog, Shtetl-Optimized, \u201cMicrosoft is unambiguously claiming to have created a topological qubit, and they just published a relevant paper in Nature, but their claim to have created a topological qubit has not yet been accepted by peer review.\u201d\n\nHenry Legg, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews, was more blunt: \u201cThe optimism is definitely there, but the science isn\u2019t there.\u201d A bit premature on Microsoft\u2019s part, perhaps. Regardless, Aaronson hasn\u2019t been this bullish on quantum computing in his 25-plus-year career. \u201cThis past year or two is the first time I\u2019ve felt like the race to build a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer is actually underway.\u201d",

The company said that these processor models meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. Aside from that, it also said, \u201cSubsequently released and future generations of processors which meet the same principles will be considered as supported, even if not explicitly listed.\u201d\n\nNote that the Windows 11 version 24H2 supported Intel processors list is designed for OEMs building new Windows 11 devices, not for the average consumer using a Windows 11 PC. So, even if Microsoft did not reinstate the three Intel generations in its list, it does not mean your system will be bricked or no longer receive system updates. All the company is saying is that manufacturers should no longer use these old processors for new systems and put Windows 11 on them.\n\nHowever, Microsoft still hasn\u2019t released an official list of supported CPUs for non-OEM or custom PC builders. So, if you\u2019re building your own Windows 11 PC from used parts, your only guidance is Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 System Requirements, which require a 1 GHz or faster CPU with two or more cores. It also points you to the same page that OEMs refer to when building a new PC for its list of approved CPUs, though, so it likely means you\u2019re also limited to 8th-gen Intel chips or newer.\n\nDespite limiting its latest operating system to these processors, you can still install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware by tweaking some registry values. You may not get system and security updates, so you\u2019ll have to do this at your own risk. Alternatively, you can continue using Windows 10, but you must shell out $30 yearly for continued security updates to keep you safe from ever-evolving online risks. But if you want to continue using your PC but don\u2019t want to deal with Microsoft\u2019s upgrade shenanigans, why not switch to a Linux OS instead?",

Millions of Americans use the company\u2019s products every day, whether it\u2019s through Microsoft Office products such as Outlook or Excel, its popular Xbox gaming system, or its cloud computing business. Microsoft is also an investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft is now among the most valuable companies in the world, sporting a market capitalization of about $2.9 trillion as of March 2025. The stock\u2019s performance has made Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer two of the richest people in the world, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIf you\u2019d been around when Microsoft went public in March of 1986, you would have been wise to buy the stock. A $1,000 investment in Microsoft at its IPO is now worth an astounding sum.\n\nInvesting in Microsoft at its IPO: What $1,000 would be worth now\n\nMicrosoft went public on March 13, 1986, at a price of $21.00 per share. As of March 3, 2025, the shares traded for about $388. However, Microsoft has split its stock several times throughout its history and one original share is now equal to 288 shares, according to the company.\n\nA $1,000 investment at $21 per share would have resulted in 47 shares at the company\u2019s IPO (fractional shares weren\u2019t a thing in 1986).\n\nThose 47 shares are now the equivalent of 13,536 shares, which would be worth about $5.25 million at today\u2019s prices.\n\nOf course, the company has also paid dividends since 2003, which shareholders have enjoyed alongside the stock appreciation.\n\nInvest Search Icon Need an advisor?

Bankrate\u2019s AdvisorMatch can connect you to a CFP\u00ae professional to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nThe stock\u2019s performance has been driven by the company\u2019s underlying business results. In its fiscal 2015, Microsoft reported $93.6 billion in annual revenue, which grew to $245.1 billion in its fiscal 2024. Over the long term, you can\u2019t have share price appreciation without strong business performance.\n\nHere\u2019s how Microsoft\u2019s recent returns compare to those of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.\n\n1-year total return (annualized) 3-year total return (annualized) 5-year total return (annualized) 10-year total return (annualized) Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) 18.5 percent 12.5 percent 16.8 percent 12.9 percent Microsoft (MSFT) -3.3 percent 10.7 percent 20.4 percent 25.3 percent\n\nSource: Morningstar (as of Feb. 28, 2025)\n\nInvesting in stocks: How to get started\n\nIt\u2019d be nice if you could go back and invest in the best IPOs of the past 40 years, but unfortunately, that\u2019s not how investing works. Investing is about what\u2019s going to happen in the future, not what\u2019s already taken place.\n\nTrying to identify the best stock market performers can be an extremely rewarding undertaking, but it\u2019s easier said than done. Fortunately, investors have a much simpler option that has produced solid results over the long term.\n\nIndex funds that track broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 allow you to hold a diversified basket of stocks without providing too much exposure to any single company. Index funds can be purchased through online brokers and are available at very low costs.\n\nMany of the best financial advisors recommend investors use index funds to gain exposure to stocks, rather than trying to buy and sell individual stocks on their own.

Threat actors have already exploited one of the flaws in what are known as \u201cbring your own vulnerable driver\u201d (BYOVD) attacks, in which attackers use signed drivers to compromise systems and evade detection.\n\nAccording to the advisory, CVE-2025-0289 is an insecure kernel resource access vulnerability that can be used to either escalate privileges or execute DoS attacks on targeted devices. CERT warned the vulnerability can be executed on Windows devices even if Paragon Partition Manager, which partitions hard drives to optimize disk space and performance, is not installed.\n\n\"Microsoft has observed threat actors (TAs) exploiting this weakness in BYOVD ransomware attacks, specifically using CVE-2025-0289 to achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM level, then execute further malicious code,\" CERT said in the advisory. \"These vulnerabilities have been patched by both Paragon Software, and vulnerable BioNTdrv.sys versions blocked by Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist.\"\n\nRansomware variant not revealed\n\nIt's unclear what type of ransomware has been used in these attacks. Cybersecurity Dive contacted Microsoft for comment on the exploitation activity, but the company declined to comment further.\n\nThe CERT advisory includes four other vulnerabilities in the BioNTdrv.sys driver, including CVE-2025-0288, an arbitrary kernel memory vulnerability that can lead to privilege escalation; CVE-2025-0287, a null pointer dereference vulnerability that enables privilege escalation; CVE-2025-0286, an arbitrary kernel memory write vulnerability that allows execution of arbitrary code; and CVE-2025-0285, an arbitrary kernel memory mapping vulnerability that enables privilege escalation.\n\nCERT credited Microsoft with the discovery of all five driver vulnerabilities.\n\nParagon on Friday released a patch for the BioNTdrv.sys driver, but the security advisory does not include any of the CVEs and makes no mention of the exploitation activity. The software company urged users to upgrade their drivers \"in order to comply with changed Microsoft security guidelines and to exclude any security risk related to the presence of the old driver version.\"\n\nCybersecurity Dive contacted Paragon for comment on the CERT report.\n\nRansomware gangs have abused vulnerable drivers in the past to evade endpoint detection and response products and even terminate their processes before they can identify any malicious activity.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft is upgrading its artificial intelligence assistant for providers to combine voice dictation, ambient listening and generative AI capabilities, the tech giant announced Monday.\n\nThe tool, branded as Dragon Copilot, will be able to help clinicians with a variety of tasks, like creating a structured note after a patient visit, automating referral letters or helping doctors find medical information from their own records and outside sources, according to the company.\n\nMicrosoft plans to launch Dragon Copilot for the U.S. and Canada in May before rolling it out in other countries. Dragon Copilot will be available to health systems currently using Microsoft\u2019s voice documentation products as an upgrade. The company declined to comment what clients plan to adopt Copilot at this time and did not answer questions on Copilot\u2019s cost.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSince acquiring clinical documentation company Nuance for nearly $20 billion in 2022, Microsoft has steadily built the business into a suite of clinical assistant tools, including Dragon Medical One, which uses speech recognition software to document patient information, and AI-backed clinical assistant DAX Copilot, an AI-backed clinical assistant and decision support tool.\n\nMicrosoft says its AI-backed products have been received warmly by a healthcare industry struggling with heavy administrative burden.\n\nDragon Medical One has been used by more than 600,000 clinicians to document billions of patient records, while DAX Copilot has generated more than 3 million doctor-patient conversations for 600 healthcare organizations over the past month, according to Ken Harper, Dragon and DAX Copilot\u2019s general manager.\n\nBut Dragon Copilot yokes those products together \u2014 and backstops them with generative AI \u2014 in a move Harper called \u201cby far the most exciting advancement that we\u2019ve made to date\u201d during a call with press.\n\nThe goal with Copilot was to \u201cunify everything into one experience,\u201d Harper said.\n\nBefore Copilot, doctors using Microsoft tools had to toggle between different task-specific applications. Now, clinicians can dictate notes and automate tasks in one place, according to the GM.\n\nDragon Copilot's welcome page. Courtesy of Microsoft\n\nCopilot is also different because it uses AI to allow clinicians to query notes and other information from outside sources, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFor example, a doctor could ask Copilot whether a particular patient should be screened for lung cancer, and Copilot\u2019s answer will include links to those vetted sources to help doctors verify accuracy, Harper said.\n\nGenerative AI products, which can create original text and images, can occasionally make things up, one reason driving concern behind increasing uptake of such products in healthcare. Another reason is a lack of standardized oversight, a gap that private sector groups \u2014 the largest of which include or are led by Microsoft \u2014 say they\u2019re working to fix.\n\nCopilot\u2019s ability to query medical sources is similar to a product Google launched last year called Vertex AI Search, which searches reams of medical text and images to answer questions from doctors and healthcare workers.\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention a bevy of other AI-backed clinical assistants that have entered the market in the last few years from companies like Suki, Abridge and Nabla.\n\nBut Dragon Copilot is distinct, according to Harper.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that\u2019s really different here, that is unique to Dragon Copilot relative to other assistants, is just the scope of what\u2019s available,\u201d Harper said, listing dictation, ambient listening, natural language processing, custom template creation and information search.\n\n\u201cSo many of these other capabilities are out there [but] are specific to a single skill,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft is one of many tech giants looking to turn a profit by helping healthcare workers drowning in administrative work.\n\nThe company in October also launched a number of other tools for the industry, including help for organizations wanting to build their own AI assistants, foundation models for medical imaging and a healthcare data analysis platform.\n\nGoogle has also been focused on beefing up Vertex AI Search in advance of a major health IT conference that kicks off Monday, announcing that it can now pull information from images in addition to text.\n\nAnd on Friday, Salesforce launched a library of prebuilt AI agents meant to automate a variety of healthcare tasks.",

            "content": "A widespread Microsoft outage on March 1 left tens of thousands of users unable to access key services, including Outlook, Teams, and Office 365, for more than three hours. Microsoft has not provided full details on the root cause but attributed the disruption to a \u201cproblematic code change.\u201d\n\nTimeline of the Microsoft outage\n\nAccording to Downdetector, reports of issues began rising on March 1 around 3:30 p.m. ET. More than 37,000 complaints were logged for Outlook, 24,000 for Office 365, and 150 for Teams. The majority of reports originated in U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, though social media posts indicated the outage had a global reach.\n\nFrustrated users turned to social media, with many initially fearing they had been hacked. \u201cI thought I was getting my outlook hacked, turns out the entire Microsoft platform is getting hacked. Thank God it\u2019s not personal,\u201d one user posted on X.\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue in a post on March 1at 4:34 p.m. ET via its Microsoft 365 Status account, stating: \u201cWe\u2019re investigating an issue in which users may be unable to access Outlook features and services.\u201d\n\nSEE: Microsoft Patches Two Actively Exploited Zero-Day Flaws\n\nHowever, the outage affected more than just Outlook; Office 365 applications such as Word, Excel, Teams, and Exchange were also impacted. In a follow-up X post, Microsoft confirmed that \u201cvarious Microsoft 365 services\u201d were down and that engineers were analyzing telemetry and customer-provided logs.\n\nAt about 5:00 p.m. ET on March 1, Microsoft confirmed it had identified a potential cause of impact, and almost an hour later reported that services were recovering. The company confirmed at 7:02 p.m. ET that service had been restored after \u201creversion of the problematic code change\u201d and to \u201crefer to MO1020913 in the admin center for detailed information.\u201d\n\nUsers express frustration as businesses face potential losses\n\nDespite the fix, some users continued to report issues. At 1:46 a.m. ET on March 3, the \u201cStatus Is Down\u201d X account reported ongoing Outlook and Office 365 disruptions.\n\nOne affected customer posted on X on March 3 that Microsoft \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d and that the continued problems are \u201cpotentially costing businesses millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s service status page shows all services as operational at the time of writing.\n\nMicrosoft has yet to release a detailed report on the latest outages. TechRepublic has contacted Microsoft about the cause of the initial outage and for additional information about any ongoing issues; there has been no reply at the time of writing.\n\nOther outages that disrupted business operations\n\nMicrosoft is, unfortunately, no stranger to outages. In November 2024, Microsoft Teams experienced technical delays for over 24 hours, and since then there have been issues with Copilot, Multi-Factor Authentication, SharePoint, and OneDrive.\n\nIn July 2024, a distributed-denial-of-service attack caused global issues with Azure cloud service. However, none of these come anywhere close to the scale of the CrowdStrike incident that same month, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSlack\u2019s recent outage\n\nMicrosoft 365 services were also not the only ones facing problems this week. On Feb. 26, Slack experienced a significant outage, disrupting services like messaging and workflows for thousands of users worldwide. This was caused by maintenance action in a database system which led to an \u201coverload of heavy traffic.\u201d",

It's Microsoft's latest effort to help health-care workers cut down their daunting clerical workloads, which are a major source of burnout in the industry.\n\nClinicians spend nearly 28 hours a week on administrative tasks like documentation, for instance, according to an October study from Google Cloud.\n\n\"Through this technology, clinicians will have the ability to focus on the patient rather than the computer, and this is going to lead to better outcomes and ultimately better health care for all,\" Dr. David Rhew, global chief medical officer at Microsoft, said Thursday in a briefing with reporters.\n\nMicrosoft acquired Nuance Communications, the company behind Dragon Medical One and DAX Copilot, for about $16 billion in 2021. As a result, Microsoft has become a major player in the fiercely competitive AI scribing market, which has exploded in popularity as health systems have been looking for tools to help address burnout.\n\nAI scribes like DAX Copilot allow doctors to draft clinical notes in real time as they consensually record their visits with patients. DAX Copilot has been used in more than 3 million patient visits across 600 health-care organizations in the last month, Microsoft said.\n\nOther companies like Abridge, which has raised more than $460 million according to PitchBook, and Suki, which has raised nearly $170 million, have developed similar scribing tools. Microsoft's updated interface could help it stand out from its competitors.\n\nDragon Copilot is accessible through a mobile app, browser or desktop, and it integrates directly with several different electronic health records, the company said.\n\nClinicians will still be able to draft clinical notes with the assistant like they could with DAX Copilot, but they'll be able to use natural language to edit their documentation and prompt it further, Kenn Harper, general manager of Dragon products at Microsoft, told reporters on the call.\n\nFor instance, a doctor could ask questions like, \"Was the patient experiencing ear pain?\" or \"Can you add the ICD-10 codes to the assessment and plan?\" Physicians can also ask broader treatment-related queries such as, \"Should this patient be screened for lung cancer?\" and get an answer with links to resources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWellSpan Health, which treats patients across 250 locations and nine hospitals throughout central Pennsylvania and northern Maryland, has been testing out Dragon Copilot with a group of clinicians in recent months.\n\nOne of those clinicians is Dr. David Gasperack, chief medical officer of primary care services at WellSpan. It's still early days, but Gasperack told CNBC the assistant is easy to use and has been more accurate than Microsoft's existing offerings.\n\n\"We've been asked more and more over time to do more administrative tasks that pull us away from the patient relationship and medical decision making,\" Gasperack said. \"This allows us to get back to that so we can focus on the patient, truly think about what's needed.\"\n\nMicrosoft declined to share the cost of Dragon Copilot but said the pricing structure is \"competitive.\" It will be easy for existing customers to upgrade to the new offering, the company added.\n\nDragon Copilot will be generally available in the U.S. and Canada starting in May, Microsoft said. The roll out will expand to the U.K., the Netherlands, France and Germany in the months following.\n\n\"Our goal remains to restore the joy of practicing medicine for clinicians and provide a better experience for patients globally,\" Rhew said.\n\nWatch: What it's like to have a doctor visit with AI",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft disputed allegations that its software licensing practices inhibit cloud market competition in a 101-page response last week to the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority. The regulatory agency issued a provisional decision in January, after a 15-month investigation of Microsoft, AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nThe CMA recommended its board use powers granted by the 2024 Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act to designate Microsoft a strategic technology provider subject to intervention and further investigation. AWS was also recommended for Strategic Market Status designation.\n\nMicrosoft pushed back. \u201cCurrent and future competition in the cloud simply does not and will not turn on the price of Microsoft\u2019s legacy software,\u201d the company said. \u201cPopular as it may be on PCs and on back-office servers, open-source software dominates the public cloud.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe regulatory agency's provisional findings show the U.K. cloud market is \u201chighly concentrated,\u201d with AWS and Microsoft occupying commanding positions. Microsoft raised broad objections to the investigation\u2019s methodology and the report\u2019s conclusions, citing a lack of domain-specific expertise and foresight.\n\nIn response, Microsoft said the Provisional Decision Report \u201cdoes not reflect how the cloud computing market operates in practice. Instead of following the evidence, it grounds much of its analysis in hypothetical scenarios and focuses on largely theoretical issues.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft pointed to AWS\u2019 market dominance, recent gains by Google Cloud and the rise of Oracle\u2019s infrastructure services business as evidence of healthy competition among providers. The response also highlighted a profound impact of generative AI technologies on cloud in the years since U.K. communications sector oversight agency Ofcom triggered regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\u201cEvery technology market, including cloud computing, has been upended by the explosive emergence of generative AI, prompted by the launch of ChatGPT,\u201d Microsoft said.\n\nMultibillion-dollar infrastructure investments by all three hyperscalers to build out global AI compute capacity further reflect ongoing competition in a rapidly evolving market, according to the response, which claims the report \u201cfundamentally misjudges\u201d the extent to which AI technologies now steer the market for cloud.\n\nGoogle and AWS filed responses to the CMA on Feb. 18.\n\nIn consonance with Microsoft, Amazon\u2019s cloud division took the position that the CMA report failed to account for evidence demonstrating \u201ca rapid pace of innovation, declining prices and fierce competition\u201d in cloud. However, AWS said it welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations around software licensing requirements.\n\nGoogle took a harder line against Microsoft. The company urged the CMA commence regulatory action to ease Microsoft software policies while avoiding any further action on data switching fees. AWS, Microsoft and Google pared back egress fees last year.\n\nMicrosoft castigated Google for \u201ctalking out of both sides of its corporate mouth\u2026 crowing about its growing market share even as it complains to regulators about constraints.\u201d",

            "content": "House Bill 1839 would bring in over $200 million a year for higher education in by closing a tax loophole benefiting Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nIn the recent February 11 election, Seattle voters backed social housing in a landslide and roundly defeated the attempt by Amazon and Microsoft to block a tax on excessive compensation exceeding $1 million annually. The tax was designed to catalyze mixed-income integrated affordable housing for Seattle residents and workers and garnered a landslide 26-point victory.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft each donated $100,000 to back Proposition 1B, which was engineered by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to derail the grassroots social housing measure and the tax that funded it. Microsoft president Brad Smith contributed $10,000 of his own money to defeat affordable housing for workers just last month.\n\nTech billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk look on for the Trump inauguration ceremony they spent millions to help fund. (Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies)\n\nNow is a good time to shine a spotlight on the tax benefits that these two Trump-genuflecting companies have lobbied for themselves. In so doing, they have extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the state of Washington, depriving the citizens of our state of educational opportunity.\n\nAn education surtax with an Amazon and Microsoft loophole\n\nIn 2019, the Washington State Legislature considered a surtax on businesses which benefited from the education of tech-savvy workers. The tax intended to fund workforce education to train Washington students for Washington jobs.\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon were all onboard. Brad Smith, authored an op-ed in the Seattle Times proposing to increase the business and occupation tax rate for these businesses from 1.5% to 1.8% and even more so that the \u201clargest tech companies would pay somewhat more than the 1.8 percent rate.\u201d In the original legislation, this would have created a 2.5% tax on Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nAll the Democrats were on board, and the legislation sailed through the House Finance Committee. But something funky and hidden was inserted into the bill along the way, thanks to the efforts of a newly resigned Democratic state senator, Guy Palumbo, who then went to work for Amazon\u2019s lobbying shop. The amendment, approved by Democrats, capped the surcharge for businesses with more than $25 billion in receipts at $7 million (later amended to $9 million in 2020).\n\nTwo companies were the primary beneficiaries: Amazon and Microsoft. Their total haul from this loophole was estimated at more than $460 million between 2019 and 2025.\n\nProposition 1A backers gathered at the Amazon Spheres to highlight the flood of cash from the region\u2019s large corporations, including Amazon, promoting alternative Proposition 1B that sought to block social housing. (Ryan Packer)\n\nNow, State Representative Julia Reed (D-36th, Ballard) wants to close this Amazon/Microsoft tax loophole. Her bill, HB 1839, simply eliminates the loophole. This would bring in over $200 million a year for higher education. With that, the state could reduce tuition across the board by $530 per student, and expand the college grant so that it actually helps middle class students.\n\nA crisis in college enrollment\n\nWe have a funding crisis in higher education while Washington faces a projected shortfall of nearly 600,000 credentialed workers over the decade. However, undergraduate enrollment has dropped since 2019 by 83,000 students. That means that Washington has one fifth fewer students now than six years ago. One major barrier to enrollment is rising tuition. Since 2019, average net price to students at Washington\u2019s public institutions has increased by nearly $2,500, a 26% jump.\n\nDemocrats patted themselves on the back with the inception of the college grant program, saying this program helps out middle class students with tuition. It has been rhetoric, not reality. Full tuition through the College Grant program is only for students with family incomes up to 60% of the state\u2019s median income \u2013 no more than $67,000 for a family of three. If your family income is 91% of the median, you receive a 10% discount on tuition. If your family is right in the middle, you get nothing. No wonder enrollment is dropping.\n\nWill the legislature act on this? So often these past five years I have heard legislators defend the loophole for Amazon and Microsoft by saying \u201cwe made a deal\u201d for their support. So they might just continue to coddle Amazon, with its profits increasing from $225 billion in 2022 to over $311 billion in 2024 and Microsoft, with its profits increasing from $135 billion to $171 billion. These are the companies that stood behind Donald Trump and funded his inauguration festivities. They are the oligarchs that seek to circumvent democracy.\n\nWe should put democracy first. It will make a lot more sense to have a deal with the voters and students and future students of our state, by closing this egregious loophole for corporate oligarchs.",

Tech companies are fully committed to the new technology \u2013 but are struggling to find ways to make people pay for it.\n\nShifting costs\n\nLast week, Microsoft unceremoniously pulled back on some planned data centre leases. The move came after the company increased subscription prices for its flagship 365 software by up to 45%, and quietly released an ad-supported version of some products.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, also recently suggested AI has so far not produced much value.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s actions may seem odd in the current wave of AI hype, coming amid splashy announcements such as OpenAI\u2019s US$500 billion Stargate data centre project.\n\nBut if we look closely, nothing in Microsoft\u2019s decisions indicates a retreat from AI itself. Rather, we are seeing a change in strategy to make AI profitable by shifting the cost in non-obvious ways onto consumers.\n\nThe cost of generative AI\n\nGenerative AI is expensive. OpenAI, the market leader with a claimed 400 million active monthly users, is burning money.\n\nLast year, OpenAI brought in US$3.7 billion in revenue \u2013 but spent almost US$9 billion, for a net loss of around US$5 billion.\n\nAurelien Morissard / EPA\n\nMicrosoft is OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor and currently provides the company with cloud computing services, so OpenAI\u2019s spending also costs Microsoft.\n\nWhat makes generative AI so expensive? Human labour aside, two costs are associated with AI models: training (building the model) and inference (using the model).\n\nWhile training is an (often large) up-front expense, the costs of inference grow with the user base. And the bigger the model, the more it costs to run.\n\nSmaller, cheaper alternatives\n\nA single query on OpenAI\u2019s most advanced models can cost up to US$1,000 in compute power alone. In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said even the company\u2019s US$200 per month subscription is not profitable. This signals the company is not only losing money through use of its free models, but through its subscription models as well.\n\nBoth training and inference typically take place in data centres. Costs are high because the chips needed to run them are expensive, but so too are electricity, cooling, and the depreciation of hardware.\n\nAerovista Luchtfotografie / Shutterstock\n\nTo date, much AI progress has been achieved by using more of everything. OpenAI describes its latest upgrade as a \u201cgiant, expensive model\u201d. However, there are now plenty of signs this scale-at-all-costs approach might not even be necessary.\n\nChinese company DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it revealed it had built models comparable to OpenAI\u2019s flagship products for a tiny fraction of the training cost. Likewise, researchers from Seattle\u2019s Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) and Stanford University claim to have trained a model for as little as US$50.\n\nIn short, AI systems developed and delivered by tech giants might not be profitable. The costs of building and running data centres are a big reason why.\n\nWhat is Microsoft doing?\n\nHaving sunk billions into generative AI, Microsoft is trying to find the business model that will make the technology profitable.\n\nOver the past year, the tech giant has integrated the Copilot generative AI chatbot into its products geared towards consumers and businesses.\n\nIt is no longer possible to purchase any Microsoft 365 subscription without Copilot. As a result subscribers are seeing significant price hikes.\n\nAs we have seen, running generative AI models in data centres is expensive. So Microsoft is likely seeking ways to do more of the work on users\u2019 own devices \u2013 where the user pays for the hardware and its running costs.\n\nA strong clue for this strategy is a small button Microsoft began to put on its devices last year. In the precious real estate of the QWERTY keyboard, Microsoft dedicated a key to Copilot on its PCs and laptops capable of processing AI on the device.\n\nApple is pursuing a similar strategy. The iPhone manufacturer is not offering most of its AI services in the cloud. Instead, only new devices offer AI capabilities, with on-device processing marketed as a privacy feature that prevents your data travelling elsewhere.\n\nPushing costs to the edge\n\nThere are benefits to the push to do the work of generative AI inference on the computing devices in our pockets, on our desks, or even on smart watches on our wrists (so-called \u201cedge computing\u201d, because it occurs at the \u201cedge\u201d of the network).\n\nIt can reduce the energy, resources and waste of data centres, lowering generative AI\u2019s carbon, heat and water footprint. It could also reduce bandwidth demands and increase user privacy.\n\nBut there are downsides too. Edge computing shifts computation costs to consumers, driving demand for new devices despite economic and environmental concerns that discourage frequent upgrades. This could intensify with newer, bigger generative AI models.\n\nAnd there are more problems. Distributed e-waste makes recycling much harder. What\u2019s more, the playing field for users won\u2019t be level if a device dictates how good your AI can be, particularly in educational settings.\n\nAnd while edge computing may seem more \u201cdecentralised\u201d, it may also lead to hardware monopolies. If only a handful of companies control this transition, decentralisation may not be as open as it appears.\n\nAs AI infrastructure costs rise and model development evolves, shifting the costs to consumers becomes an appealing strategy for AI companies. While big enterprises such as government departments and universities may manage these costs, many small businesses and individual consumers may struggle.",

It relied on VOIP, voice over internet protocol, technology that converts audio into a digital signal transmitted online. Skype added video calls after online retailer eBay bought the service in 2005.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Briefing Become a business insider with the latest news.

As with other new platforms, scammers also made use of it.\n\nBy 2011, when Microsoft bought it from eBay, Skype had about 170 million users worldwide, then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an event announcing the planned merger.\n\n\u201cThe Skype brand has become a verb, nearly synonymous with video and voice communications,\u201d Ballmer said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkype was still considered high-tech in 2017 when recently inaugurated President Donald Trump\u2019s administration used it to field questions from journalists far from the White House press briefing room. It was a month later when Microsoft launched Teams, an attempt to catch up to the growing demand for workplace chatting services sparked by upstart rival Slack Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlack and Teams, along with newer video platforms such as Zoom, saw explosive growth during the COVID-19 pandemic as companies scrambled to shift to remote work, and even families and friends looked for new tools for virtual gatherings. Skype, by then, was already on the wane but had paved the way for strengthening the connections people can build remotely.\n\n\u201cHigher-quality media can really deepen relationships and make people able to work through complex problems much better,\u201d Larson said. \u201cSuddenly, this was available to anyone with a decent internet connection.

            "content": "Microsoft is expanding its data center operations near San Antonio with a recent $1.4 billion investment in Medina County. The Washington-based tech giant is set to construct four new data centers in the county just west of San Antonio, according to state records.\n\nRecords with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation indicate that Microsoft intends to construct two data centers, making up a combined 489,400 square feet at 2995 U.S. Highway 90 W. Two additional state filings detail plans for another set of data center buildings to be constructed along County Road 381, totaling another 490,000 square feet. Data centers are specialized facilities used to house and manage a large number of computer servers and other hardware that store, process and manage data.\n\nThe move nearly doubles Microsoft\u2019s investments in South and Central Texas, which include around 1,112 acres near Castroville and Hondo in Medina County and more than 300 acres in Bexar County, where the company has established a cluster of data centers on San Antonio\u2019s far West Side.\n\nMicrosoft declined the San Antonio Report\u2019s request for comment on the new data centers.\n\nThe company\u2019s expansion in Texas comes at a pivotal moment, as state officials work to balance maintaining Texas as a data-center hub while ensuring there is enough electricity to power both these centers and the needs of residents and businesses.\n\nData centers are among the most energy-intensive types of buildings and account for 2% of total energy use in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Texas ranks as the second-largest data center market in the country by inventory, trailing only Virginia. They are also highly water intensive, although Microsoft promotes that it operates most of its data centers off recycled water in a closed circuit.\n\nConcerns about the state grid\u2019s reliability remain four years after the events of Winter Storm Uri, with the state\u2019s growth pushing utilities across the state to expand their generation and transmission capabilities.\n\nOn Thursday, the Texas Senate\u2019s Business and Commerce Committee heard testimony on a bill that could result in slightly increased costs for \u201clarge load\u201d customers such as data centers, as they would face new transmission charges and stricter interconnection requirements.\n\nThe bill, introduced by four Texas Republican senators including Donna Campbell of New Braunfels, has four main goals: make sure transmission costs are fairly shared across the state\u2019s grid, set rules to keep the Texas grid reliable, improve how the state predicts energy needs and protect residential customers from power outages by requiring large users to help reduce demand during shortages.\n\nOn average, each data center in Texas uses under 100 megawatts \u2014 where one megawatt can power around 250 homes on a hot summer day \u2014 although that could change in the future, said Pablo Vegas, president and CEO of Texas\u2019 grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.\n\nThe point of the bill is to make sure the load growth brought on by pro-growth state policies is done in a responsible way that ensures Texans are getting enough electricity to power their homes and businesses, said state Sen. Phil King (R-Weatherford), one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cPlease hear this \u2014 Texas is open for business on these matters, we want continued development of these large loads, we need Texas to be in the forefront of cutting-edge technologies,\u201d said King. \u201cThe purpose of this discussion is that specifically \u2026 is that we want that business in Texas.\u201d\n\nSan Antonio is prepared for that growth and is working to stay ahead of demand, said CPS Energy\u2019s Ben Jordan, the utility\u2019s interim senior director of integrated system planning. The publicly-owned utility plays an integral part in building out enough state-level infrastructure to support Texas\u2019s continued growth.\n\n\u201cTexas wants to be a provider to this type of customer,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWe\u2019re agnostic as a municipal utility \u2014 we have an obligation to serve, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",

From instant messaging to video calls, technology has continuously transformed how we connect with each other.\n\nIn order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub.\n\nWith Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing. Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\n\nHundreds of millions of people already use Teams as their hub for teamwork, helping them stay connected and engaged at work, school, and at home. In the past two years, the number of minutes spent in meetings by consumer users of Teams has grown 4X, reflecting the value Teams brings to everyday communication and collaboration.\n\nAs we take this next step with Teams, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to continuing to support people\u2019s everyday connections, starting by making it easy to log into Teams with their Skype account.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Skype users\n\nDuring this transition period, users have a choice:\n\n1. Move to Microsoft Teams for free. Over the coming days, we will roll out the ability for Skype users to sign into Teams (free) on any supported device using their Skype credentials\u2014starting today with those who are part of both the Teams and Skype Insider programs. By logging in to Teams with a Skype account, chats and contacts will automatically appear in the app so you can quickly pick up where you left off.\n\nDuring the transition period, Teams users can call and chat with Skype users and Skype users can do the same with Teams users. This helps ensure you can stay connected with everyone, regardless of the platform you\u2019re using during this transition.\n\n2. Export your Skype data. If you prefer not to migrate to Teams, you can instead export your data including chats, contacts, and call history.\n\nSkype will remain available until May 5, 2025, giving users time to explore Teams and decide on the option that works best for them.\n\nHow to get started with Teams for free\n\nMoving to Teams is simple and doesn\u2019t prevent you from also continuing to use Skype during the transition period.\n\nHere\u2019s how to get started:\n\nDownload Teams on your device from the official Microsoft Teams website. Log in with your Skype credentials. Start using Teams with all your Skype chats and contacts ready to go.\n\nTo assist in this transition, we\u2019ve prepared a step-by-step guide to help get started with Teams and make the most of its features.\n\nChanges to Skype paid offerings\n\nMoving forward, we will no longer offer paid Skype features to new customers, including Skype Credit and subscriptions that allow you to make and receive international and domestic calls. Current Skype subscription users can continue to use their Skype Credits and subscriptions until the end of their next renewal period. Skype Credit users can also continue to use their remaining Skype Credit. After May 5, 2025, the Skype Dial Pad will be available to remaining paid users from the Skype web portal and within Teams.\n\nThank you for being part of Skype\n\nSkype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications and supporting countless meaningful moments, and we are honored to have been part of the journey.\n\nWe also understand that change can be challenging and want you to know that we\u2019re here to support you every step of the way. We\u2019re excited about the new opportunities that Teams brings and are committed to helping you stay connected in new and meaningful ways.",

It was so popular that people used it as a verb: \"I'll Skype you in the morning.\"\n\nMicrosoft, which acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, announced in a post on X on Friday that the iconic voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service would soon go dark. It encouraged Skype users to instead migrate to a free version of Microsoft Teams \u2014 a communication app that helps users work together in real time.\n\nIn the more than two decades since it was founded, Skype has been largely overtaken by a bevy of competitors, such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Zoom and Slack.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a separate blog post, Microsoft said the move to shutter Skype was meant \"to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 360 collaborative apps and platforms, said the company had \"learned a lot from Skype over the years. ... But we felt like now is the time because we can be simpler for the market, for our customer base, and we can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams.\"\n\nNot everyone is happy about the impending change. \"This is shocking,\" a user named Maphry wrote in a post on X. \"There are so many elderly who are not happy to change technologies anymore, but are used to this one over decades to keep in touch with their loved ones. It will require a lot of effort (usually by their families) to bring them over to alternatives.\"\n\nAnother X user said: \"My best friend and I have long distance chatted with Skype several times a week for 5 years. This is actually so upsetting.\"\n\nSkype, founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m and Janus Friis, was one of the first video conferencing apps, also allowing users to make voice calls and send messages. In 2005, it was bought by eBay for $2.6 billion, but just two years later, the online auction company took a $1.4 billion write-down of Skype, acknowledging that the acquisition \"had not performed as expected.\"\n\nIn 2009, eBay sold its controlling interest to a group of investors, who subsequently sold Skype to Microsoft. At the time, it was Microsoft's largest acquisition. NPR's Planet Money reported in 2011, \"The growth now is in smartphones and tablets \u2014 where Microsoft is getting clobbered by Apple (obviously) and Google (whose Android mobile operating system is wildly popular). This, as much as anything, explains why Microsoft is paying $8.5 billion for Skype, a company that lost money last year, and that most people use for free.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSkype had been gradually losing users for years, going from about 40 million in March 2020 to 36 million in 2023.",

Microsoft is shutting down Skype in May and replacing it with the free version of Microsoft Teams for consumers. Existing Skype users will be able to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats, and contacts all automatically available without having to create another account, or they can choose to export their data instead. Microsoft is also phasing out support for calling domestic or international numbers.\n\n\u201dSkype users will be in control, they\u2019ll have the choice,\u201d says Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, in an interview with The Verge. \u201cThey can migrate their conversation history and their contacts out and move on if they want, or they can migrate to Teams.\u201d\n\nIf you choose to move on and bring your Skype data with you, the exported data will include photos and conversation history. Microsoft also made a tool to easily view existing Skype chat history if you don\u2019t want to move to Teams.\n\nSkype will remain online until May 5th, so existing users will have around 60 days to decide whether they want to switch to Microsoft Teams or export their data. \u201cIf they do want to come to Teams then the first-run is pretty instantaneous because we\u2019ve already done the work on the backend to restore their contacts, message history, and call logs,\u201d says Amit Fulay, vice president of product at Microsoft.\n\nSkype users will soon see a prompt to move to Microsoft Teams. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe transition to Microsoft Teams will keep Skype group chats intact, and during the 60-day window, Microsoft will also maintain interoperability so you can message contacts on Teams and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype.\n\nIf you do move to Microsoft Teams, there\u2019s one big part of Skype that\u2019s disappearing, though. Microsoft is removing the telephony parts that allow you to call domestic or international numbers or people\u2019s cellphones. \u201cPart of the reason is we look at the usage and the trends, and this functionality was great at the time when voice over IP (VoIP) wasn\u2019t available and mobile data plans were very expensive,\u201d explains Fulay. \u201cIf we look at the future, that\u2019s not a thing we want to be in.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft will honor existing Skype credits, but it will no longer offer new customers access to paid Skype features that allow you to make or receive international and domestic calls. Existing Skype subscription users will be able to use their Skype credits and subscriptions inside Microsoft Teams until the end of their next renewal period. Existing Skype Number users will also need to port their number over to another provider, as Microsoft is no longer supporting this, either.\n\nThe Skype Dial Pad will be part of Teams temporarily for existing credits and subscriptions, but Microsoft isn\u2019t going to offer calling plans to Teams consumers like it does for businesses. \u201cThe world has really moved on,\u201d says Teper. \u201cProbably the biggest thing is higher bandwidth and lower data plan cost, from us and others, has really driven almost all of the traffic to VoIP.\u201d\n\nThe admission of consumers moving on from calling phone numbers from Skype is also a large part of why the service is shutting down nearly 14 years after Microsoft first acquired it for $8.5 billion. Over the last decade, services like FaceTime, Messenger, and WhatsApp have made it simple to connect with friends through messaging, calls, and video chats in a way that Microsoft struggled to compete with through Skype and its many design iterations.\n\nThis was particularly evident in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when consumers flocked to Zoom instead of Skype. \u201cThe Skype userbase actually grew at the beginning of the pandemic, and has been pretty flat since,\u201d admits Teper. \u201cIt\u2019s not shrunk in some dramatic way. It has been relatively flat over the last few years. We hope we\u2019ll migrate most Skype users\u2026 but we want to make sure the users know they\u2019re in control.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft will now be fully focused on Teams for consumers, after launching the personal version in 2020. At the time, Microsoft said it was still fully committed to Skype, but it\u2019s been clear in recent years that the company was preparing for the eventual retirement of Skype. In December, Microsoft killed off Skype credits and phone numbers in favor of subscriptions, another sign that the end of Skype was nearing.\n\n\u201cInitially the vision was to have one experience across work and life\u2026 but Teams was new and that was not realistically where we were in 2020,\u201d reveals Teper. \u201cSo we continued to invest in Skype, and about two to three years ago we started bringing in the free Teams consumer experience with the new client. We wanted to wait until the adoption was at the scale where we could be very convinced it was the right time.\u201d\n\nThe Skype retirement won\u2019t result in job cuts, either, at least not immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s one team, which is Microsoft Teams and Skype. On the backend it has actually evolved to a common team,\u201d says Teper. \u201cThere won\u2019t be layoffs, those folks are going to be working on making things better \u2014 whether it\u2019s fun end user features or AI innovation, it\u2019s really about doubling down on Teams.\u201d",

            "content": "A high-stakes race is underway that will determine which country will supply the technology that powers the world\u2019s emerging AI economy. Vice President Vance got it right at the recent AI Summit in Paris, emphasizing the need to focus on AI opportunities, pursue lighter regulations, and prioritize bringing American AI to the world. However, a last-minute Biden administration regulation, if left unchanged, risks undermining America\u2019s ability to succeed.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s interim final AI Diffusion Rule caps the export of essential American AI components to many fast-growing and strategically vital markets. As drafted, the rule undermines two Trump administration priorities: strengthening U.S. AI leadership and reducing the nation\u2019s near trillion-dollar trade deficit. Left unchanged, the Biden rule will give China a strategic advantage in spreading over time its own AI technology, echoing its rapid ascent in 5G telecommunications a decade ago.\n\nAs a company, we support the need to protect national security by preventing adversaries from acquiring advanced AI technology. And there are important elements in the rule that should be retained. For example, the rule\u2019s qualitative provisions would ensure that AI technology components are deployed in certified, secure, and trusted datacenters. This avoids shipments of advanced chips to entities that do not meet these standards and thereby helps reduce the risk of chip diversion to China. Similarly, the rule rightly imposes strict requirements on these trusted datacenter operators to protect against chip diversion and to ensure that advanced AI services cannot be used by adversaries.\n\nThere is an important opportunity to further strengthen these provisions, including by ensuring the Commerce Department has the resources it will need to put the Rule into effect. This can help both expedite approval processes for companies and strengthen enforcement, including against unlawful chip diversion.\n\nBut a significant problem remains. Namely, the Biden rule goes beyond what\u2019s needed. It puts many important U.S. allies and partners in a Tier Two category and imposes quantitative limits on the ability of American tech companies to build and expand AI datacenters in their countries. This includes many American friends, such as Switzerland, Poland, Greece, Singapore, India, Indonesia, Israel, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. These are countries where we and many other American companies have significant datacenter operations.\n\nThis Tier Two status is undermining one of the essential requirements needed for a business to succeed\u2014namely, confidence by our customers that they will be able to buy from us the AI computing capacity that they will need in the future. Customers in Tier Two countries now worry that an insufficient supply of critical American AI technology will restrict their opportunities for economic growth.\n\nThe unintended consequence of this approach is to encourage Tier Two countries to look elsewhere for AI infrastructure and services. And it\u2019s obvious where they will be forced to turn. If left unchanged, the Diffusion Rule will become a gift to China\u2019s rapidly expanding AI sector.\n\nAll this comes at precisely the time when the American tech sector wants to invest in AI computing capacity at an unprecedented level. Our own company\u2019s plans are illustrative. This year alone, Microsoft will spend $80 billion to build AI infrastructure around the world, with more than half of this total on U.S. soil. As this reflects, the solid majority of our computing power will remain in the United States.\n\nBut our ability to continue growing and investing at this level, including in the United States, depends in important part on exporting our technology services. This requires building AI infrastructure in other countries, so AI services can be accessed and used with low latency by local enterprises and consumers. Ironically, the Diffusion Rule discourages what should be regarded as an American economic opportunity\u2014the export of world-leading chips and technology services.\n\nThe potentially negative impact on American economic growth doesn\u2019t stop there. As the tech sector invests billions of dollars to build datacenters around the world, we are developing global supply chains that combine international and American suppliers of more traditional manufactured goods. I saw this first-hand when I was in Warsaw last week to announce with Prime Minister Donald Tusk a $700 million expansion of Microsoft\u2019s datacenter infrastructure in Poland. Among the beneficiaries are American workers manufacturing advanced electrical generators in Indiana, so they can be shipped to Poland.\n\nThe irony could not be clearer. At the very moment when the Trump administration is pressing Europe to buy more American goods, the Biden Diffusion Rule leaves the leaders of partners like Poland asking why they have been relegated to Tier Two status and an uncertain ability to buy more American AI chips in the future.\n\nThis puts the opportunity for the Trump administration in bold relief. It can take an overly complex rule that requires 41 pages in the Federal Register and right-size it. Make it simpler. Stop relegating American friends and allies into a second tier that undermines their confidence in ongoing access to American products. Eliminate the quantitative caps that would interfere with a well-functioning economic market. And keep what matters most, such as the qualitative security standards and AI use restrictions that protect national security.\n\nWe need to recognize the obvious. America\u2019s AI race with China begins at home. It\u2019s founded on the ability of innovative American firms to bring manufactured goods and technology services to like-minded countries around the world. We\u2019re prepared to invest. What we need now is an AI diffusion rule that gives us the ability to do so.\n\nTags: AI diffusion rule, AI economy, supply chains",

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday debuted its first ever quantum computing chip, joining a growing number of Big Tech names entering the quantum chip space. Called Ocelot, the chip, according to Amazon, helps solve a key problem for quantum computing systems, which could speed up the push to practical quantum computers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement comes just a week after Microsoft (MSFT) revealed its own quantum chip called Majorana 1. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its quantum chip, Willow, in December. Gaining a lead in quantum computing would be a massive opportunity for the cloud giants, ensuring they\u2019d have first-mover advantage in a field that could impact a slew of industries and help drive revenue growth for years.\n\nAmazon says its chip helps enable what\u2019s called bosonic error correction, an important step to figuring out how to get quantum computing systems to the point where they regularly solve the kinds of calculations that would take classic computers years to complete.\n\nAn image of Amazon's Ocelot quantum computing chip. (Image: Amazon) \u00b7 Amazon\n\nQuantum computing differs from classical computing because rather than using bits, the 1s and 0s that chips translate into the software you use every day, they rely on qubits. Instead of representing a 1 or a zero, qubits can exist as both a 1 and a 0 at the same time.\n\nThat allows quantum computers to process huge amounts of information far faster than classical computers. In some cases, quantum computers could perform tasks that would take a regular computer hundreds or thousands of years in minutes.\n\nBut qubits are also fragile, leaving them open to errors if they experience interference from the outside world. Amazon\u2019s chip is meant to efficiently address these errors.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Ocelot's architecture, with its hardware-efficient approach to error correction, positions us well to tackle the next phase of quantum computing: learning how to scale,\u201d Amazon\u2019s head of quantum software applications, Fernando Brand\u00e3o, and head of quantum hardware, Oskar Painter, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cScaling frugally using hardware-efficiency will allow us to achieve more quickly and cost-effectively an error-corrected quantum computer that benefits society,\u201d the two added.\n\nA dillution refrigerator that houses Amazon's Ocelot quantum computing chip. (Image: Amazon) \u00b7 Amazon\n\nAmazon\u2019s announcement is just the latest in a string of quantum computing-focused news out of Big Tech players in the race to create a usable quantum computer that can process calculations related to topics ranging from healthcare to materials sciences and more.\n\nLast week, Microsoft debuted its Majorana 1 chip, which the company said uses a new type of material called a topoconductor. According to Microsoft, the topoconductor takes advantage of a new state of matter that is not solid, liquid, or gas but a topological state, though some experts are skeptical of the claim.",

These models are designed to empower developers with advanced AI capabilities.\n\nWe are excited to announce Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini, the newest models in Microsoft\u2019s Phi family of small language models (SLMs). These models are designed to empower developers with advanced AI capabilities. Phi-4-multimodal, with its ability to process speech, vision, and text simultaneously, opens new possibilities for creating innovative and context-aware applications. Phi-4-mini, on the other hand, excels in text-based tasks, providing high accuracy and scalability in a compact form. Now available in Azure AI Foundry, HuggingFace, and the NVIDIA API Catalog where developers can explore the full potential of Phi-4-multimodal on the NVIDIA API Catalog, enabling them to experiment and innovate with ease.\n\nWhat is Phi-4-multimodal?\n\nPhi-4-multimodal marks a new milestone in Microsoft\u2019s AI development as our first multimodal language model. At the core of innovation lies continuous improvement, and that starts with listening to our customers. In direct response to customer feedback, we\u2019ve developed Phi-4-multimodal, a 5.6B parameter model, that seamlessly integrates speech, vision, and text processing into a single, unified architecture.\n\nBy leveraging advanced cross-modal learning techniques, this model enables more natural and context-aware interactions, allowing devices to understand and reason across multiple input modalities simultaneously. Whether interpreting spoken language, analyzing images, or processing textual information, it delivers highly efficient, low-latency inference\u2014all while optimizing for on-device execution and reduced computational overhead.\n\nNatively built for multimodal experiences\n\nPhi-4-multimodal is a single model with mixture-of-LoRAs that includes speech, vision, and language, all processed simultaneously within the same representation space. The result is a single, unified model capable of handling text, audio, and visual inputs\u2014no need for complex pipelines or separate models for different modalities.\n\nThe Phi-4-multimodal is built on a new architecture that enhances efficiency and scalability. It incorporates a larger vocabulary for improved processing, supports multilingual capabilities, and integrates language reasoning with multimodal inputs. All of this is achieved within a powerful, compact, highly efficient model that\u2019s suited for deployment on devices and edge computing platforms.\n\nThis model represents a step forward for the Phi family of models, offering enhanced performance in a small package. Whether you\u2019re looking for advanced AI capabilities on mobile devices or edge systems, Phi-4-multimodal provides a high-capability option that\u2019s both efficient and versatile.\n\nUnlocking new capabilities\n\nWith its increased range of capabilities and flexibility, Phi-4-multimodal opens exciting new possibilities for app developers, businesses, and industries looking to harness the power of AI in innovative ways. The future of multimodal AI is here, and it\u2019s ready to transform your applications.\n\nPhi-4-multimodal is capable of processing both visual and audio together. The following table shows the model quality when the input query for vision content is synthetic speech on chart/table understanding and document reasoning tasks. Compared to other existing state-of-the-art omni models that can enable audio and visual signals as input, Phi-4-multimodal achieves much stronger performance on multiple benchmarks.\n\nFigure 1: Phi-4-multimodal audio and visual benchmarks.\n\nPhi-4-multimodal has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in speech-related tasks, emerging as a leading open model in multiple areas. It outperforms specialized models like WhisperV3 and SeamlessM4T-v2-Large in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST). The model has claimed the top position on the Huggingface OpenASR leaderboard with an impressive word error rate of 6.14%, surpassing the previous best performance of 6.5% as of February 2025. Additionally, it is among a few open models to successfully implement speech summarization and achieve performance levels comparable to GPT-4o model. The model has a gap with close models, such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o-realtime-preview, on speech question answering (QA) tasks as the smaller model size results in less capacity to retain factual QA knowledge. Work is being undertaken to improve this capability in the next iterations.\n\nFigure 2: Phi-4-multimodal speech benchmarks.\n\nPhi-4-multimodal with only 5.6B parameters demonstrates remarkable vision capabilities across various benchmarks, most notably achieving strong performance on mathematical and science reasoning. Despite its smaller size, the model maintains competitive performance on general multimodal capabilities, such as document and chart understanding, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and visual science reasoning, matching or exceeding close models like Gemini-2-Flash-lite-preview/Claude-3.5-Sonnet.\n\nFigure 3: Phi-4-multimodal vision benchmarks.\n\nWhat is Phi-4-mini?\n\nPhi-4-mini is a 3.8B parameter model and a dense, decoder-only transformer featuring grouped-query attention, 200,000 vocabulary, and shared input-output embeddings, designed for speed and efficiency. Despite its compact size, it continues outperforming larger models in text-based tasks, including reasoning, math, coding, instruction-following, and function-calling. Supporting sequences up to 128,000 tokens, it delivers high accuracy and scalability, making it a powerful solution for advanced AI applications.\n\nTo understand the model quality, we compare Phi-4-mini with a set of models over a variety of benchmarks as shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Phi-4-mini language benchmarks.\n\nFunction calling, instruction following, long context, and reasoning are powerful capabilities that enable small language models like Phi-4-mini to access external knowledge and functionality despite their limited capacity. Through a standardized protocol, function calling allows the model to seamlessly integrate with structured programming interfaces. When a user makes a request, Phi-4-Mini can reason through the query, identify and call relevant functions with appropriate parameters, receive the function outputs, and incorporate those results into its responses. This creates an extensible agentic-based system where the model\u2019s capabilities can be enhanced by connecting it to external tools, application program interfaces (APIs), and data sources through well-defined function interfaces. The following example simulates a smart home control agent with Phi-4-mini.\n\nAt Headwaters, we are leveraging fine-tuned SLM like Phi-4-mini on the edge to enhance operational efficiency and provide innovative solutions. Edge AI demonstrates outstanding performance even in environments with unstable network connections or in fields where confidentiality is paramount. This makes it highly promising for driving innovation across various industries, including anomaly detection in manufacturing, rapid diagnostic support in healthcare, and enhancing customer experiences in retail. We are looking forward to delivering new solutions in the AI agent era with Phi-4 mini.\n\n\n\n\u2014Masaya Nishimaki, Company Director, Headwaters Co., Ltd.\n\nCustomization and cross-platform\n\nThanks to their smaller sizes, Phi-4-mini and Phi-4-multimodal models can be used in compute-constrained inference environments. These models can be used on-device, especially when further optimized with ONNX Runtime for cross-platform availability. Their lower computational needs make them a lower cost option with much better latency. The longer context window enables taking in and reasoning over large text content\u2014documents, web pages, code, and more. Phi-4-mini and multimodal demonstrates strong reasoning and logic capabilities, making it a good candidate for analytical tasks. Their small size also makes fine-tuning or customization easier and more affordable. The table below shows examples of finetuning scenarios with Phi-4-multimodal.\n\nTasks Base Model Finetuned Model Compute Speech translation from English to Indonesian 17.4 35.5 3 hours, 16 A100 Medical visual question answering 47.6 56.7 5 hours, 8 A100\n\nFor more information about customization or to learn more about the models, take a look at Phi Cookbook on GitHub.\n\nHow can these models be used in action?\n\nThese models are designed to handle complex tasks efficiently, making them ideal for edge case scenarios and compute-constrained environments. Given the new capabilities Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini bring, the uses of Phi are only expanding. Phi models are being embedded into AI ecosystems and used to explore various use cases across industries.\n\nLanguage models are powerful reasoning engines, and integrating small language models like Phi into Windows allows us to maintain efficient compute capabilities and opens the door to a future of continuous intelligence baked in across all your apps and experiences. Copilot+ PCs will build upon Phi-4-multimodal\u2019s capabilities, delivering the power of Microsoft\u2019s advanced SLMs without the energy drain. This integration will enhance productivity, creativity, and education-focused experiences, becoming a standard part of our developer platform. \u2014Vivek Pradeep, Vice President Distinguished Engineer of Windows Applied Sciences.\n\nEmbedded directly to your smart device: Phone manufacturers integrating Phi-4-multimodal directly into a smartphone could enable smartphones to process and understand voice commands, recognize images, and interpret text seamlessly.

            "content": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 More than 30 years ago, Penn State physicist Jainendra Jain pioneered the theory of a new state of matter called the fractional quantum Hall effect, whose discoverers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998. Jain described it as a liquid of certain strange particles that he called composite fermions.\n\nUnder certain conditions, composite fermions form a superconductor \u2014 or a material that can conduct electricity without losing any energy at low temperatures \u2014 that theorists predicted would contain an even stranger particle, called a Majorana, which is its own antiparticle \u2014 a particle with the same mass but different charge.\n\nTheorists envisioned that the Majorana particles, which mirror themselves as their own antiparticles, could be used to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. This ability to run calculations while simultaneously correcting errors is essential for advancing quantum computing for real-world, industrial scale applications.\n\nLast week (Feb. 19), Microsoft announced a potential breakthrough in quantum computing based on these long-theorized but experimentally unconfirmed Majorana particles. They also published a paper in the journal Nature on some of the work described in their announcement.\n\nIn the following Q&A, Jain, an Evan Pugh University Professor and Erwin W. M\u00fcller Professor in Physics, spoke about his work on the theory of composite fermions, how it relates to Microsoft\u2019s announcement and why skepticism is a valuable element of scientific discovery.\n\nQ: How does theoretical physics support real-world design?\n\nJain: Quantum physics is the science of how tiny particles \u2014 like photons, particles of light, and electrons \u2014 behave in ways that seem counter to our everyday experience. Unlike objects we encounter in our daily lives, these tiny particles can pass through barriers and can seemingly exist in multiple places at once, until they are observed.\n\nIt turns out that physicists can create new particles in the laboratory, which are unlike any particles nature has given us. And, sometimes, they have incredibly strange properties and do things which the old, familiar particles couldn\u2019t. Such particles are called emergent particles. If we can understand them, then maybe we can use them to develop new materials and technologies for the benefit of humanity.\n\nI am on the theoretical understanding side of this spectrum, but I work closely with scientists who test whether the theories correspond to reality. The news from Microsoft is an example of how basic research at universities could lead to real-world applications that drive innovation \u2014 like quantum computers.\n\nQ: What is a quantum computer and how would the Majorana particle help?\n\nJain: A normal computer works with \u201cbits,\u201d which are binary digits and comprise the smallest data unit. It can code either one or zero, on or off, and many of them together in a certain order convey larger messages. A quantum bit, or qubit, offers additional possibilities: it can be on, off or in any superpositions of the two, including on and off at the same time \u2014 just like the famous thought experiment \u201cSchrodinger\u2019s cat\u201d in which a cat in a box is both alive and dead at the same time, until someone opens the box to check, at which time a definitive state of dead or alive is achieved.\n\nWhen you link many qubits together, the possibilities grow exponentially. This allows a quantum computer to do certain types of calculations, at least theoretically, much faster than a classical computer. One can come up with examples where all the world\u2019s current computers operating together for decades would not be able to perform the calculations of one quantum computer in a day.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in quantum computing is that information degrades because of interaction with noise, or interference from the environment or elsewhere in the system. This can lead qubits to collapse into a definite state, introducing errors. This is where the rather strange Majorana particles come in.\n\nTwo Majorana particles can produce either nothing or a whole fermion, which make the on and off states of a single qubit. Unlike many other qubits, the information here can be stored non-locally in a topological fashion \u2014 meaning the two Majorana particles forming a qubit could be far apart. Then, since neither Majorana contains the full information, any local noise cannot switch off to on or on to off. This enables the qubits to hold information without information loss.\n\nQ: Tell me more about your work. What are composite fermions and how do they relate to applications like quantum computing?\n\nJain: My work had a role in the unlikely sequence of events that led to the idea of Majorana-based quantum computation. I think this is an example of how ideas evolve and mutate and move into unexpected directions.\n\nA phenomenon called the quantum Hall effect was discovered just before I started graduate school. It occurs when experimentalists cool electrons in a two-dimensional material like graphene, apply a strong magnetic field and measure its resistance. Surprisingly, a property called the Hall resistance was found to be precisely quantized \u2014 it took on some special values that depend only on certain fundamental constants of nature. While this effect wasn\u2019t predicted, researchers in the field quickly understood it.\n\nSoon after I began my graduate studies, researchers discovered a twist on this effect, called the fractional quantum Hall effect. Here the Hall resistance was quantized at some fractional values instead of integers. This was much more mysterious. And the more the experimentalists probed, the more intricate structures they discovered.\n\nIn the late 1980s, it occurred to me that I could explain the observations if I assumed that electrons absorb quantized chunks of the magnetic field to make a new kind of particles, which I called composite fermions. To my pleasant surprise, and gratification, a few years later, several experiments verified composite fermions by direct observation. The composite fermions had many offshoots and led to a host of other predictions by many researchers, including some from my own group.\n\nIn particular, it was found that under certain conditions composite fermions pair up to make a superconductor. Theorists predicted that this is actually a special kind of superconductor \u2014 a topological superconductor \u2014 that harbors Majorana particles. The possibility of such particles was theoretically shown by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana almost a century ago, but the work was largely forgotten since it did not apply to any real particles. It was mind-boggling that Majorana particles could emerge as excitations in the composite-fermion superconductor. In this incarnation, the Majorana particle is, roughly speaking, half of a composite fermion caught in a vortex inside the superconductor. And to make the story line more captivating, theorists further proposed that the Majorana particles could be used to make qubits and to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n\nCountless hours have been spent working to confirm Majorana particles in composite fermion superconductors. A convincing observation has not yet been made. However, once the notion of Majorana as an emergent particle was out there, scientists realized that the conditions for producing them can be created in other systems \u2014 for example, by putting together an ordinary superconductor and a semiconductor. Even here, producing Majorana has proved challenging. Such is scientific inquiry \u2014 sometimes ideas work and sometimes they don\u2019t. But no matter how compelling, a theory needs confirmation by experiments.\n\nQ: Does Microsoft\u2019s Majorana-1 chip demonstrate composite fermions serving as qubits?\n\nJain: No, no. Microsoft\u2019s quantum computing program focuses on Majorana particles in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowires, not on Majorana particles in a composite-fermion superconductor. Moreover, they have not shared details of their qubits. The Nature article does not demonstrate a Majorana qubit but instead demonstrates the feasibility of a measurement that would be needed for a future computer based on Majorana particles. I look forward to learning more about their findings at the upcoming March meeting of the American Physical Society.\n\nIt is, of course, natural that their claim of the realization of topological qubits will be scrutinized. It would take much work to confirm it, and then even more to explore its full potential.\n\nQ: What do you love most about your work?\n\nJain: My research is driven by curiosity. It\u2019s the thrill of discovering something new. It\u2019s like solving a mystery \u2014 you think you know how things should behave, but every so often, something completely unexpected happens. That\u2019s when you dig deeper and once in a rare while, you feel you have figured out something new, and maybe even something important. It\u2019s thrilling when it pans out. And just when you feel you understand, there are more twists. Many concepts from the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect are so far out that if experiments hadn\u2019t proven them, nobody would have taken them seriously.\n\nI have been truly fortunate to have incredible students who have nurtured the field since its early days, clarifying and advancing the story. Seeing many of my graduate students developing into wonderful, well-rounded scientists has been one of my greatest pleasures.",

As it is all speculation, it could simply be that the latest information has driven Microsoft to reevaluate demand and move to more closely align projected supply with projected demand. Microsoft has reiterated their commitment to spend $80 billion on AI in the coming year. Reallocating this spending internally or wit a different set of partners remains on the table.\n\nAnd when you put the TD Cowen report that Microsoft has cancelled leases for \u201ca couple hundred megawatts\u201d into context with Microsoft\u2019s overall leased power, which is estimated at around 20 GW, you see that more than 98% of their energy commitment remains unchanged.\n\nInvestment Markets Might See the Biggest Hits\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s retreat has had ripple effects on the stock market, particularly among energy and infrastructure companies. European firms like Schneider Electric and Siemens Energy experienced a decline in stock value, indicating fears that major AI companies might scale back energy-intensive data center investments.\n\nHowever, at press time we have not seen any other indicators that this is an issue as despite these concerns about potential AI overcapacity, major tech firms continue to invest heavily in AI infrastructure:\n\nAmazon: Pledged $100 billion towards AI data centers.\n\nPledged $100 billion towards AI data centers. Alphabet (Google): Committed $75 billion.\n\nCommitted $75 billion. Meta (Facebook): Planning to spend up to $65 billion.\n\nPlanning to spend up to $65 billion. Alibaba: Announced a $53 billion investment over the next three years.\n\nIf we see a rush of announcements identifying retrenchment by other players in the AI/Hyperscaler market, then it will definitely be time to take a step back and reconsider the trajectory the AI-driven data center development is on.\n\nAI Is Here To Stay\n\nAnd, of course, critics argue that while tech giants are making unprecedented investments in AI, the real-world applications remain limited.\n\nCouple this with the recent emergence of potentially more cost-efficient open-source AI models, such as those developed by DeepSeek, which has intensified debates about whether Big Tech is overcommitting to AI infrastructure.\n\nBut few are arguing that AI will not continue to grow -- and preparation to meet the demand will fluctuate much as any new technology does, especially as those real-world applications for AI become more prevalent.\n\nConclusion\n\nMicrosoft's purported decision to cancel data center leases signals a potential recalibration of its AI strategy. Whether this is a sign of cautious planning or an oversupply issue remains to be seen. As AI adoption evolves, companies will need to strike a balance between meeting demand and avoiding unnecessary capital expenditures. Investors and industry stakeholders will closely watch how Microsoft and its competitors navigate this dynamic landscape.",

            "content": "Cybersecurity firm Acronis is rolling out a security and compliance platform that MSSPs and MSPs can use to protect clients\u2019 Microsoft 365 environments, a widely used service that has become a favorite target of threat actors.\n\nAcronis Ultimate 365, unveiled this week, gives security services providers a single multi-tenant solution for managing cybersecurity, backup, and compliance, delivering broad protections to organizations and giving themselves another revenue source.\n\nThe solution falls in line with the trend among both enterprises and MSSPs, which traditionally had to manage and integrate multiple security point products. They are now shifting to adopting more integrated security platforms.\n\n\u201cThe issue of tool sprawl is a growing challenge for MSPs and MSSPs,\u201d Acronis CISO Gerald Beuchelt told MSSP Alert. \u201cAs organizations increasingly outsource their cybersecurity, they often face a fragmented approach with multiple tools that don't work together leading to operational inefficiencies, complicated onboarding, security gaps, and higher costs.\u201d\n\nA Popular Target\n\nThe shift towards \u201cnatively integrated platforms like Acronis Ultimate 365 is important for MSPs because it reduces the time MSPs have to spend on managing multiple solutions,\u201d Beuchelt said.\n\nMicrosoft 365 offers organizations a broad range of cloud-based Microsoft productivity tools, from widely use apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote to OneDrive cloud storage, Teams for collaboration, security features, and AI-based offerings like Copilot and Designer.\n\nSocial Engineering Threats\n\nAccording to cloud solutions company Medha Cloud, 3.7 million companies were using Microsoft 365 in 2023, with market research firm Statista estimating that more than 1 million of those were the United States. Such wide use makes Microsoft 365 an attractive target of cybercriminals, Beuchelt said.\n\nThreats against Microsoft 365 users often involve social engineering attacks, such as phishing schemes, he said.\n\n\u201cFurther, vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations as well as a lack of proper multifactor authentication, weak password or authentication policies, or overly permissive user permissions are also common attack vectors that bad actors use to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 environments,\u201d Beuchelt added.\n\nAn Integrated Platform\n\nSuch attacks on Microsoft 365 users mirror what Acronis is seeing in the broader cybersecurity field. In their report earlier this month on cyberthreats during the second half of 2024 , Acronis researchers noted a 197% year-over-year increase in the number of email attacks they detected, and that almost half of Acronis users were targeted by email-based attacks in the last six months of the year.\n\nAcronis Ultimate 365 includes backup, extended detection and response (XDR), security for email and collaboration apps, email archiving, security posture management, and security awareness training. Having all this integrated into a single platform not only reduces the tool sprawl, but also simplifies operations for MSSPs and MSPs and reduces the workload on their technicians.\n\nA Boost for MSSPs\n\n\u201cBest-of-breed solutions, while often high performing, can require a larger number of technicians to manage the specialized tools for each function, increasing operational complexity,\u201d the CISO said. \u201cIn contrast, integrated solutions streamline processes and consolidate management into a single platform, allowing MSPs to manage more endpoints with fewer technicians.\u201d\n\nFor the service providers, it also accelerates the time to revenue, enabling them to more quickly onboard clients, makes contract negotiations easier, and reduces the need for extensive staff training, according to Acronis. In addition, the platform\u2019s predictable pricing model means MSSPs and MSPs can more easily meet the varying needs of customers.\n\nThe platform also is a significant step for Switzerland-based Acronis\u2019 portfolio, Beuchelt said. Until now, its Microsoft 365 support focused primarily on backup, disaster recovery, security, and ransomware protections. Acronis Ultimate 365 is a more complete solution for MSSPs and MSPs, he said.",

But his view is different.\n\n\"I understand why the market was reacting to it and why people might be wondering what\u2019s going on, because if they are canceling leases, does it mean that they have overestimated demand for their data centers and are they beginning to pull back?\" he said. \"They have actually been leasing a lot of data centers, but they also own a lot of data centers. And I think that Microsoft really wants to be committed to data centers and they would just really rather own, rather than regularly renew leases.\n\n\"Keep in mind, Microsoft owns and leases more than 300 data centers, so if they cancel leases on two of them, which is what the report suggests, that doesn\u2019t worry me too much about their commitment to building and owning those data centers over the long term.\"\n\nMicrosoft's response:\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson told FOX6 News:\n\n\"Our plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure in the US this fiscal year remain on track, and our $3.3B commitment to Wisconsin remains unchanged as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.\"\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD: Get breaking news alerts in the FOX LOCAL Mobile app for iOS or Android\n\nThat the same $3.3 billion Microsoft originally proposed for Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIt might be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for some remembering Foxconn.\n\nIn 2018, Foxconn promised 13,000 jobs for Wisconsin.

Among the authors are Microsoft scientists and engineers who conduct research at Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette, located at Purdue University. In an announcement by Microsoft Quantum, the team describes the operation of a device that is a necessary building block for a topological quantum computer. The published results are an important milestone along the path to construction of quantum computers that are potentially more robust and powerful than existing technologies.\n\n\u201cOur hope for quantum computation is that it will aid chemists, materials scientists and engineers working on the design and manufacturing of new materials that are so important to our daily lives,\u201d said Michael Manfra, scientific director of Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette and the Bill and Dee O\u2019Brien Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy, professor of materials engineering, and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue. \u201cThe promise of quantum computation is in accelerating scientific discovery and its translation into useful technology. For example, if quantum computers reduce the time and cost to produce new lifesaving therapeutic drugs, that is real societal impact.\u201d\n\nThe Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette team advanced the complex layered materials that make up the quantum plane of the full device architecture used in the tests. Microsoft scientists working with Manfra are experts in advanced semiconductor growth techniques, including molecular beam epitaxy, that are used to build low-dimensional electron systems that form the basis for quantum bits, or qubits. They built the semiconductor and superconductor layers with atomic layer precision, tailoring the material\u2019s properties to those needed for the device architecture.\n\nManfra, a member of the Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute, credited the strong relationship between Purdue and Microsoft, built over the course of a decade, with the advances conducted at Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette. In 2017 Purdue deepened its relationship with Microsoft with a multiyear agreement that includes embedding Microsoft employees with Manfra\u2019s research team at Purdue.\n\n\u201cThis was a collaborative effort by a very sophisticated team, with a vital contribution from the Microsoft scientists at Purdue,\u201d Manfra said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Microsoft team achievement, but it\u2019s also the culmination of a long-standing partnership between Purdue and Microsoft. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without an environment at Purdue that was conducive to this mode of work \u2014 I attempted to blend industrial with academic research to the betterment of both communities. I think that\u2019s a success story.\u201d\n\nQuantum science and engineering at Purdue is a pillar of the Purdue Computes initiative, which is focused on advancing research in computing, physical AI, semiconductors and quantum technologies.\n\n\u201cThis research breakthrough in the measurement of the state of quasi particles is a milestone in the development of topological quantum computing, and creates a watershed moment in the semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure,\u201d Purdue President Mung Chiang said. \u201cMarking also the latest success in the strategic initiative of Purdue Computes, the deep collaboration that Professor Manfra and his team have created with the Microsoft Quantum Lab West Lafayette on the Purdue campus exemplifies the most impactful industry research partnership at any American university today.\u201d\n\nMost approaches to quantum computers rely on local degrees of freedom to encode information. The spin of an electron is a classic example of a qubit. But an individual spin is prone to disturbance \u2014 by relatively common things like heat, vibrations or interactions with other quantum particles \u2014 which can corrupt quantum information stored in the qubit, necessitating a great deal of effort in detecting and correcting errors. Instead of spin, topological quantum computers store information in a more distributed manner; the qubit state is encoded in the state of many particles acting in concert. Consequently, it is harder to scramble the information as the state of all the particles must be changed to alter the qubit state.\n\nIn the Nature paper, the Microsoft team was able to accurately and quickly measure the state of quasi particles that form the basis of the qubit.\n\n\u201cThe device is used to measure a basic property of a topological qubit quickly,\u201d Manfra said. \u201cThe team is excited to build on these positive results.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe team in West Lafayette pushed existing epitaxial technology to a new state-of-the-art for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures to ensure a perfect interface between each of the building blocks of the Microsoft hybrid system,\u201d said Sergei Gronin, a Microsoft Quantum Lab scientist.\n\n\u201cThe materials quality that is required for quantum computing chips necessitates constant improvements, so that\u2019s one of the biggest challenges,\u201d Gronin said. \u201cFirst, we had to adjust and improve semiconductor technology to meet a new level that nobody was able to achieve before. But equally important was how to create this hybrid system. To do that, we had to merge a semiconducting part and a superconducting part. And that means you need to perfect the semiconductor and the superconductor and perfect the interface between them.\u201d\n\nWhile work discussed in the Nature article was performed by Microsoft employees, the exposure to industrial-scale research and development is an outstanding opportunity for Purdue students in Manfra\u2019s academic group as well. John Watson, Geoffrey Gardner and Saeed Fallahi, who are among the coauthors of the paper, earned their doctoral degrees under Manfra and now work for Microsoft Quantum at locations in Redmond, Washington, and Copenhagen, Denmark. Most of Manfra\u2019s former students now work for quantum computing companies, including Microsoft. Tyler Lindemann, who works in the West Lafayette lab and helped to build the hybrid semiconductor-superconductor structures required for the device, is earning a doctoral degree from Purdue under Manfra\u2019s supervision.\n\n\u201cWorking in Professor Manfra\u2019s lab in conjunction with my work for Microsoft Quantum has given me a head start in my professional development, and been fruitful for my academic work,\u201d Lindemann said. \u201cAt the same time, many of the world-class scientists and engineers at Microsoft Quantum have some background in academia, and being able to draw from their knowledge and experience is an indispensable resource in my graduate studies. From both perspectives, it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nAbout Purdue University\n\nPurdue University is a public research university leading with excellence at scale.

But some experts say the firm\u2019s claim has not been backed up by peer-reviewed research, as Philip Ball explains\n\nMajorana 1 Microsoft has unveiled a quantum processor with a \u201ctopological core\u201d. (Courtesy: John Brecher/Microsoft)\n\nResearchers at Microsoft in the US claim to have made the first topological quantum bit (qubit) \u2013 a potentially transformative device that could make quantum computing robust against the errors that currently restrict what it can achieve. \u201cIf the claim stands, it would be a scientific milestone for the field of topological quantum computing and physics beyond,\u201d says Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHowever, the claim is controversial because the evidence supporting it has not yet been presented in a peer-reviewed paper. It is made in a press release from Microsoft accompanying a paper in Nature (638 651) that has been written by more than 160 researchers from the company\u2019s Azure Quantum team. The paper stops short of claiming a topological qubit but instead reports some of the key device characterization underpinning it.\n\nWriting in a peer-review file accompanying the paper, the Nature editorial team says that it sought additional input from two of the article\u2019s reviewers to \u201cestablish its technical correctness\u201d, concluding that \u201cthe results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes [MZMs] in the reported devices\u201d. An MZM is a quasiparticle (a particle-like collective electronic state) that can act as a topological qubit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big no-no\u201d\n\n\u201cThe peer-reviewed publication is quite clear [that it contains] no proof for topological qubits,\u201d says Winfried Hensinger, a physicist at the University of Sussex who works on quantum computing using trapped ions. \u201cBut the press release speaks differently. In academia that\u2019s a big no-no: you shouldn\u2019t make claims that are not supported by a peer-reviewed publication\u201d \u2013 or that have at least been presented in a preprint.\n\nChetan Nayak, leader of Microsoft Azure Quantum, which is based in Redmond, Washington, says that the evidence for a topological qubit was obtained in the period between submission of the paper in March 2024 and its publication. He will present those results at a talk at the Global Physics Summit of the American Physical Society in Anaheim in March.\n\nBut Hensinger is concerned that \u201cthe press release doesn\u2019t make it clear what the paper does and doesn\u2019t contain\u201d. He worries that some might conclude that the strong claim of having made a topological qubit is now supported by a paper in Nature. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make these claims \u2013 that is just unhealthy and will really hurt the field,\u201d he says, because it could lead to unrealistic expectations about what quantum computers can do.\n\nAs with the qubits used in current quantum computers, such as superconducting components or trapped ions, MZMs would be able to encode superpositions of the two readout states (representing a 1 or 0). By quantum-entangling such qubits, information could be manipulated in ways not possible for classical computers, greatly speeding up certain kinds of computation. In MZMs the two states are distinguished by \u201cparity\u201d: whether the quasiparticles contain even or odd numbers of electrons.\n\nBuilt-in error protection\n\nAs MZMs are \u201ctopological\u201d states, their settings cannot easily be flipped by random fluctuations to introduce errors into the calculation. Rather, the states are like a twist in a buckled belt that cannot be smoothed out unless the buckle is undone. Topological qubits would therefore suffer far less from the errors that afflict current quantum computers, and which limit the scale of the computations they can support. Because quantum error correction is one of the most challenging issues for scaling up quantum computers, \u201cwe want some built-in level of error protection\u201d, explains Nayak.\n\nIt has long been thought that MZMs might be produced at the ends of nanoscale wires made of a superconducting material. Indeed, Microsoft researchers have been trying for several years to fabricate such structures and look for the characteristic signature of MZMs at their tips. But it can be hard to distinguish this signature from those of other electronic states that can form in these structures.\n\nIn 2018 researchers at labs in the US and the Netherlands (including the Delft University of Technology and Microsoft), claimed to have evidence of an MZM in such devices. However, they then had to retract the work after others raised problems with the data. \u201cThat history is making some experts cautious about the new claim,\u201d says Aaronson.\n\nNow, though, it seems that Nayak and colleagues have cracked the technical challenges. In the Nature paper, they report measurements in a nanowire heterostructure made of superconducting aluminium and semiconducting indium arsenide that are consistent with, but not definitive proof of, MZMs forming at the two ends. The crucial advance is an ability to accurately measure the parity of the electronic states. \u201cThe paper shows that we can do these measurements fast and accurately,\u201d says Nayak.\n\nThe device is a remarkable achievement from the materials science and fabrication standpoint Ivar Martin, Argonne National Laboratory\n\n\u201cThe device is a remarkable achievement from the materials science and fabrication standpoint,\u201d says Ivar Martin, a materials scientist at Argonne National Laboratory in the US. \u201cThey have been working hard on these problems, and seems like they are nearing getting the complexities under control.\u201d In the press release, the Microsoft team claims now to have put eight MZM topological qubits on a chip called Majorana 1, which is designed to house a million of them (see figure).\n\nEven if the Microsoft claim stands up, a lot will still need to be done to get from a single MZM to a quantum computer, says Hensinger. Topological quantum computing is \u201cprobably 20\u201330 years behind the other platforms\u201d, he says. Martin agrees. \u201cEven if everything checks out and what they have realized are MZMs, cleaning them up to take full advantage of topological protection will still require significant effort,\u201d he says.\n\nRegardless of the debate about the results and how they have been announced, researchers are supportive of the efforts at Microsoft to produce a topological quantum computer. \u201cAs a scientist who likes to see things tried, I\u2019m grateful that at least one player stuck with the topological approach even when it ended up being a long, painful slog,\u201d says Aaronson.\n\n\u201cMost governments won\u2019t fund such work, because it\u2019s way too risky and expensive,\u201d adds Hensinger. \u201cSo it\u2019s very nice to see that Microsoft is stepping in there.\u201d\n\nThis article forms part of Physics World\u2018s contribution to the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), which aims to raise global awareness of quantum physics and its applications.

            "content": "A massive Chinese botnet is targeting Microsoft 365 accounts with large-scale password spraying attacks that can bypass multifactor authentication (MFA), according to SecurityScorecard.\n\nThe botnet, which is made up of over 130,000 compromised devices, is systematically attempting to log into M365 globally using stolen credentials from infostealer accounts.\n\nThis technique is designed to gain access to sensitive data, emails and collaboration tools across different industries. Attackers can also use compromised accounts to conduct lateral movement activities in a network, such as internal phishing.\n\nAdditionally, the botnet can result in business disruption by triggering account lockouts due to repeated failed login attempts.\n\nSectors that heavily rely on M365 for email, document storage and collaboration are at particular risk. These include financial services, healthcare, government and tech providers.\n\nThe researchers believe the ongoing campaign is likely being conducted by a Chinese-affiliated group. This is because the botnet uses infrastructure tied to CDS Global Cloud and UCLOUD HK, providers with operational links to China.\n\nIt also leverages command-and-control (C2) servers hosted in SharkTech, a US-based provider that has been observed hosting malicious activity in the past. The time zone for these servers has been configured as \u201cAsia/Shanghai.\u201d\n\nRead now: Microsoft Admits Security Failings Allowed China to Access US Government Emails\n\nBotnet Designed to Bypass MFA and Access Policies\n\nThe attackers are able to evade multifactor authentication (MFA) and potentially bypass Conditional Access Policies (CAP) by utilizing a method that causes login events to be logged in the Non-Interactive Sign-in logs.\n\nNon-interactive sign-ins are delegated sign-ins performed by a client app or operating system components on behalf of a user. They do not require the user to provide an authentication factor, and in many configurations, do not trigger MFA.\n\nOrganizations that rely solely on interactive sign-in monitoring are \u201cblind\u201d to these attacks, SecurityScorecard noted.\n\n\u201cThese attacks are recorded in Non-Interactive Sign-In logs, which are often overlooked by security teams. Attackers exploit this gap to conduct high-volume password spraying attempts undetected. This tactic has been observed across multiple M365 tenants globally, indicating a widespread and ongoing threat,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nCommenting on the research, Boris Cipot, Senior Security Engineer at application security software firm Black Duck, described the new botnet campaign as a \u201csignificant evolutionary step forward\u201d compared to previously used password spraying tactics.\n\n\u201cNew attack tactics deploy non-interactive sign-ins that are less prone to typical security alerts like failed login. Non-interactive sign-ins include logins over API or automated services, for example. Therefore, this new botnet leverages organizations' gaps in their authentication monitoring,\u201d Cipot explained.\n\nHow to Tackle the Botnet Campaign\n\nThe report highlighted a range of recommendations to detect and mitigate the password spraying campaign:",

The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was speaking about new products at an employee town hall meeting at the company\u2019s corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Workers standing about 15 feet to his right then revealed T-shirts that when they stood side-by-side spelled out the question \u201cDoes Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?\u201d\n\nPhotos and video of the incident, which was live streamed throughout the company, shows Nadella kept speaking and did not acknowledge the protesters. Two men quickly tapped the workers on the shoulders and ushered them out of the room.\n\n\u201cWe provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement provided to the AP. \u201cImportantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft did not answer Tuesday when asked whether the employees involved in the protest would face disciplinary action. The company also previously declined to comment about the AP\u2019s Feb. 18 story about its contracts with the Israeli military.\n\nIn October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its headquarters. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.\n\nA group of workers has been raising concerns within the company for months about Microsoft providing services to the Israeli military through its Azure cloud computing platform. Some employees at the company have also spoken out in support of Israel and said those supporting Palestinians have made them feel unsafe.\n\nThe AP\u2019s investigation included exclusive details drawn from internal company data and documents, including that the usage of AI models by the Israeli military through Azure increased nearly 200 times after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at the Microsoft Ignite conference, Nov. 19, 2024, in Chicago.

In a community forum designated for employees to raise concerns with senior leadership, an employee shared links to the AP report. More than a dozen others questioned whether the company was violating its stated principles to defend human rights and not to let its AI models be used to harm people, according to screenshots reviewed by the AP.\n\nAbdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist who was one of the Microsoft workers fired over the October vigil, said the company is prioritizing profits over its own human rights commitments.\n\n\u201cThe demands are clear,\u201d said Mohamed, who works with a group of Microsoft workers called No Azure for Apartheid. \u201cSatya Nadella and Microsoft executives need to answer to their workers by dropping contracts with the Israeli military.\u201d\n\n___\n\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at [email protected] or https://www.ap.org/tips/",

            "content": "The report , written by analysts Michael Elias, Cooper Belanger and Gregory Williams, said that TD Cowen's channel checks had found Microsoft has \"1) canceled leases in the US, totaling 'a couple of hundred MWs' with at least two private data center operators, 2) has pulled back on the conversion of '500\u2019s' to leases, and 3) has re-allocated a considerable portion of its international spend to the US.\"\n\nTD Cowen suggests that Microsoft is using facility/power delays as a justification for this, comparing it to the 2022 tactic employed by Meta following its cancelation of multiple data center leases related to the metaverse.\n\nThe report adds that Microsoft has also pulled back on converting negotiated and signed Statement of Qualifications, or 500\u2019s, which are the precursor to a data center lease, into signed leases. It notes that it cannot confirm if this is a delay to conversion or outright termination.\n\nThe brokerage also said that its channel checks found that Microsoft was reallocating a \"considerable portion\" of its international spend to the US, which \"suggests to us a material slowdown in international leasing.\"\n\nThe report concluded: \"Microsoft was the most active lessee of capacity in 2023 and 1H24, at which time it was procuring capacity relative to a capacity forecast that contemplated incremental OpenAI workloads.\n\n\"However, as we believe is indicated by its decision to pause construction on a data center in Wisconsin -which our prior channel checks indicated was to support OpenAI - there is capacity that it has likely procured, particularly in areas where capacity is not fungible to cloud, where the company may have excess data center capacity relative to its new forecast.\" TD Cowen notes that this is its \"intepretation\" of the situation, and is \"subject to change.\"\n\nNot all analysts have the same take on the matter, however.\n\n\u201cTo me this all looks and sounds like business as usual,\u201d Mizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein said in a note. \u201cA company this large and with $80 billion of annual spend has the right to move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.\u201d\n\nKlein further suggested that, as many hyperscalers use a mix of owned and leased land, \"tweaking\" of plans is to be expected.\n\nIn January of this year, Microsoft announced plans to spend $80bn on AI data centers in 2025.\n\nDuring its most recent earnings call, CFO Amy Hood revealed that the company was working from a \"pretty capacity-constrained place,\" adding that they have been \"short [of] power and space.\"\n\nLast week CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview that \"there will be an overbuild\" of AI infrastructure, and said his company will be \"leasing a lot of capacity in \u201927, \u201928.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment to Bloomberg on TD Cowen's note, but a spokesperson said regarding investment: \"Thanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand. Last year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history. While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future. Our plans to spend over $80bn on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.\"\n\nDCD reached out to Microsoft for further information, but received the same statement.\n\nThis year has also seen Microsoft lose its position as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider following the $500bn Stargate data center initiative announced by the AI company.\n\nDespite this, Microsoft has retained the \"right of first refusal\" on new capacity and, \"to further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\"\n\nSpeaking on this during the earnings call, Nadella said: \"We remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI... they've committed in a big way to Azure,\" adding, \"Their success is our success.\"",

            "content": "Quantum computing has long promised revolutionary breakthroughs, but progress has been slow. Recently, Google announced its latest superconducting chip, Willow. Now, Microsoft has unveiled the Majorana 1 chip, its answer to building scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers. To back up its claims, Microsoft published a paper in the scientific journal Nature. We see these announcements as steps in the long road to quantum advantage \u2014 the point at which a quantum computer becomes commercially practical. As I pointed out in my blog on Willow, most demonstrations so far are experiments using hypothetical problems. Microsoft claims that its approach will enable an accelerated path to a million-qubit machine, more than enough to solve real problems. Yet today, it has only demonstrated eight qubits. Given that IBM and Google have pursued superconducting qubits for decades and are now at hundreds of qubits, does Microsoft\u2019s alternative strategy have the potential to leap ahead, or will it encounter the same scalability hurdles?\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Qubit Approach Is A Big Gamble\n\nQuantum computing\u2019s biggest challenges are error correction and scalability. Microsoft\u2019s new chip is built on topological qubits, leveraging exotic Majorana particles for inherent stability. The physical properties of topological qubits are less prone to noise than superconducting qubits. If successful, this design could cut down the overhead needed for error correction \u2014 one of the biggest barriers to practical quantum computing. As for scalability, Microsoft\u2019s digital control approach may allow it to fabricate quantum chips with thousands of qubits on a single substrate.\n\nMicrosoft has spent a decade developing the theory and engineering that the new superconducting material needed. Competitors have long been skeptical of Microsoft\u2019s ambitions, taking a \u201cGood luck with that\u201d position. To this, Microsoft counters, \u201csuperconducting vendors have been at it for 30 years; look what we have done in 10!\u201d\n\nWhile we think that this recent announcement is a significant step, it is not yet a full proof point that Microsoft is right. But it\u2019s a significant step \u2014 Microsoft now has a chip and some evidence that it works as expected. Historically, we have seen early pioneers pave the way for competitors that rethink technology and run away with the competition. In fact, Watson pioneered natural language interfaces, only to be upstaged by Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and others. Are we seeing this happen again? Maybe.\n\nIBM and Google refine existing architectures, while Microsoft bets on unproven scalability . IBM\u2019s Heron and Google\u2019s Willow chips improve qubit fidelity and seek to reduce errors within established superconducting architectures. Microsoft, in contrast, is pursuing a ground-up rethink of quantum computing that could encounter unforeseen bottlenecks. There are still many unknowns. Significantly, Microsoft\u2019s Nature paper (link above) admits that it has yet to prove the existence of the particles used to construct its qubits.\n\nIBM\u2019s Heron and Google\u2019s Willow chips improve qubit fidelity and seek to reduce errors within established superconducting architectures.

Significantly, Microsoft\u2019s Nature paper (link above) admits that it has yet to prove the existence of the particles used to construct its qubits. Microsoft\u2019s Azure integration may accelerate software readiness but limit ecosystem flexibility. Without software and algorithms, quantum chips are useless to most. IBM has built robust programming models and cloud-based quantum access with a strong partner network and open-source Qiskit. Microsoft\u2019s approach embeds quantum computing into Azure, streamlining development but creating a walled garden that may limit middleware partners buying in, slowing uptake.\n\nWhat This Means For Tech Leaders\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Majorana 1 chip represents a bold bet on a high-risk, high-reward approach. While the potential is significant, real-world applicability is still years away. The goal is reaching scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers that can solve hard problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Most experts agree that this is still at least a decade away; Microsoft aims to cut that timeline in half. This announcement is Microsoft putting its game on the line because it\u2019s now convinced that this approach will work. This means tech leaders should:\n\nPlan for post-quantum security. Regardless of which architecture wins, organizations should prepare for quantum computing\u2019s impact on encryption and cybersecurity. If Microsoft accelerates progress, the Y2Q (years to quantum) timeline will shrink significantly.

Given uncertainty, firms with promising use cases for quantum solutions should engage with multiple qubit providers and platforms, including IBM, Google, Microsoft, and AWS, to avoid betting on a single technology and ecosystem.\n\nFinal Take: It\u2019s Still Too Early To Call\n\nIf Microsoft\u2019s approach succeeds, it could accelerate the field significantly \u2014 but if it encounters the same scaling barriers, it may need to slow down considerably, giving competitors time to solve their superconducting challenges. All the while, there are other approaches such as ion traps, silicon spin, and neutral atoms all racing to demonstrate value. Will Microsoft\u2019s topological qubit strategy break through, or will it face the same bottlenecks as its competitors at some point and slow down? It\u2019s an interesting time to watch the race that is still too early to call.",

            "content": "According to information from investment bank TD Cowen, Microsoft has terminated several data center leases and scaled back international investments. How come?\n\nAt least two locations in the U.S. are known to have had their leases terminated by Microsoft. According to TD Cowen, this represents \u201ca couple hundreds of megawatts.\u201d The information comes from various suppliers and third parties, which the investment bank uses to measure a company\u2019s financial health and transactions.\n\nSigns of scaling back\n\nTD Cowen indicates that Meta showed similar signs when it sought to cut costs. For Microsoft, this reporting contradicts the company\u2019s generous commitments. Earlier this year, Chair and VP Brad Smith told Microsoft that around $80 billion would have been spent on AI infrastructure between mid-2024 and mid-2025 (Microsoft\u2019s financial year). It may be that most of this has already been spent or committed, and that the lease terminations merely represent a realignment.\n\nNonetheless, one AI major has already been moving away from Microsoft: OpenAI. The company behind ChatGPT is participating in the ambitious Stargate project, which will consist of a $500 billion investment into an AI infrastructure buildout in America. Oracle and SoftBank are also taking part; the latter would also like to put a large sum of money into OpenAI.\n\nThis is where the roads separate\n\nAn earlier report from The Information already suggested that OpenAI is exiting Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. In exchange, SoftBank\u2019s infrastructure will become the new home for OpenAI\u2019s demanding AI workloads. It would mark a significant turnaround from early 2023, when Microsoft had decided to invest $10 billion in the AI player. Since then, the relationship between the two parties has been severely tested. When Sam Altman was briefly ousted as CEO, it seemed for a while that the OpenAI exodus would fuel an AI team within Microsoft. Nothing proved less true, and a Microsoft observer position on the board of directors in mid-2024 disappeared after only six months.\n\nWhether or not the leases are related to OpenAI\u2019s exit is unclear. What is known is that the company\u2019s training and inferencing requirements are enormous. Almost all the money coming in to the AI company goes into computing power and R&D (which also costs computing power). Even the prohibitively expensive ChatGPT Pro represent a loss for OpenAI due to the astronomical cost of running the models, CEO Sam Altman revealed. Without outside backers, OpenAI wouldn\u2019t have made it to 2025 either; SoftBank is currently simply the latest investor keeping it alive.\n\nHowever, for Microsoft, there is reason enough to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. It recently integrated Copilot functionality into its fixed 365 offering, which will theoretically see millions of users using AI. No doubt, this may require an expansion of Azure capacity. However, whether it should cost so much and whether Microsoft should build it out so quickly is more difficult to determine. Still, the market is feeling the after-effects somewhat over doubts that struck when Chinese DeepSeek arrived on the scene. The thinking behind these doubts is that less compute may be needed than previously thought, as LLMs of a smaller size than the highest-end models still show stunning performance. In response, however, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella threw up Jevons\u2019 paradox, which states that consumption only increases when new technology is accessible with fewer resources than before.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft shadows Google: 365 now includes AI as standard",

            "content": "By Stephan Rachel, Professor, School of Physics, The University of Melbourne\n\nFor The Conversation\n\nResearchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first \u201ctopological qubits\u201d in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.\n\nAt the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a \u201croadmap\u201d for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realise many significant goals of quantum computing \u2013 such as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.\n\nIf Microsoft\u2019s claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.\n\nHowever, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the roadmap still includes many hurdles to be overcome. While the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don\u2019t have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.\n\nBy now you probably have some questions. What\u2019s a topological qubit? What\u2019s a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?\n\nQuantum bits are hard to build\n\nQuantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits \u2013 or qubits.\n\nAn ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a \u201csuperposition\u201d of up and down).\n\nThis means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations \u2013 particularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.\n\nSo far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.\n\nResearchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.\n\nTiny wires and exotic particles\n\nMicrosoft has taken a very different approach to build its \u201ctopological qubits\u201d. They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorised in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.\n\nMajoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).\n\nIndeed, Majorana particles are so exotic they are usually only studied in universities \u2013 not used in practical applications.\n\nThe Microsoft team say they have used a pair of tiny wires, each with a Majorana particle trapped at either end, to act as a qubit. They measure the value of the qubit \u2013 expressed by means of whether an electron is in one wire or the other \u2013 using microwaves.\n\nBraided bits\n\nWhy has Microsoft put in all this effort? Because by swapping the positions of Majorana particles (or measuring them in a certain way), they can be \u201cbraided\u201d so they can be measured without error and are resistant to outside interference. (This is the \u201ctopological\u201d part of \u201ctopological qubits\u201d.)\n\nIn theory, a quantum computer made using Majorana particles can be completely free of the qubit errors that plague other designs.\n\nThis is why Microsoft has chosen such a seemingly laborious approach. Other technologies are more prone to errors, and hundreds of physical qubits may need to be combined together to produce a single reliable \u201clogical qubit\u201d.\n\nMicrosoft has instead put its time and resources into developing Majorana-based qubits. While they are late to the big quantum party, they hope they will be able to catch up quickly.\n\nThere\u2019s always a catch\n\nAs always, if something sounds too good to be true, there is a catch. Even for a Majorana-based quantum computer, such as the one announced by Microsoft, one operation \u2013 known as T-gate \u2013 won\u2019t be achievable without errors.\n\nSo the Majorana-based quantum chip is only \u201calmost error-free\u201d. However, correcting for T-gate errors is much simpler than the general error correction of other quantum platforms.\n\nIndeed, Majorana particles are so exotic they are usually only studied in universities \u2013 not used in practical applications.\n\nThe Microsoft team say they have used a pair of tiny wires, each with a Majorana particle trapped at either end, to act as a qubit. They measure the value of the qubit \u2013 expressed by means of whether an electron is in one wire or the other \u2013 using microwaves.\n\nWhat now? Microsoft will try to move ahead with its roadmap, steadily building larger and larger collections of qubits.\n\nThe scientific community will closely watch how Microsoft\u2019s quantum computing processors operate, and how they perform in comparison to the other already established quantum computing processors.\n\nAt the same time, research into the exotic and obscure behaviour of Majorana particles will continue at universities around the globe.",

            "content": "Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) stock has gone nowhere over the last year and is currently hovering around a six-month low. The company has done an excellent job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI), but the reported efficiency improvements in AI models like DeepSeek have cast a spotlight on AI spending and sparked worry.\n\nOut of the 30 components in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.65%), Microsoft stands out as a unique balance of growth potential, value, and a little passive income as the cherry on top of a strong underlying investment thesis. Many other Dow components have strong earnings growth or are a good value, but not both.\n\nHere's why Microsoft is my top Dow Jones stock to buy now.\n\nRunning up too fast\n\nLet's take a trip back to 2023: Microsoft is coming off a big down year, with the stock falling 28.7% in 2022 in lockstep with a brutal downturn across big tech.\n\nManagement hosted its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on Jan. 24, 2023. During the call, the company shared exciting news about AI and a partnership with OpenAI, including support for ChatGPT and news that Microsoft will be OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider -- led by Azure AI services.\n\nAs 2023 carries on, AI excitement takes off, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reporting exponential growth in sales of graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers. Microsoft stock finished 2023 56.8% higher, closing out the year at $376.04 per share. Since then, the stock is up just 8.6%.\n\nThis is a good example of a company's stock price getting ahead of fundamentals. AI has been a game changer for Microsoft, leading to faster top-line growth and higher margins. But it hasn't led to paradigm-shifting growth in the same way as it has for other big tech stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms. Rather, Microsoft uses AI to improve existing products and develop new tools and services.\n\nMicrosoft is making strides across its business segments\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is an AI tool for the company's flagship software suite. In its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, management called 365 Copilot \"the UI for AI\" -- meaning it is handling everyday employee productivity. (UI stands for user interface.) It continues to see accelerated adoption for 365 Copilot.\n\nGitHub Copilot is helping improve developer efficiency. GitHub now has 150 million developers, a 50% increase in just two years.\n\nIn second-quarter fiscal 2025, Azure and other cloud services grew 31% year over year, including a 157% increase in AI services.\n\nBeyond Microsoft 365, GitHub, and Azure, Microsoft has other software products like Teams, Bing, and LinkedIn. It also has a massive gaming segment with Xbox and Activision Blizzard and it sells consumer products like Microsoft Surface and computer accessories, among other things. Despite so many end markets and traditionally lower-margin hardware offerings, the company has grown revenue and margins at an impressive rate.\n\nThe following chart shows how Microsoft's accelerated sales growth in recent years has also come with higher margins, a testament to the profitability of AI investments.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that Microsoft's AI spending may be overextended.\n\nCranking it up a notch\n\nThis fiscal year, management plans to spend $80 billion on AI and cloud-based applications. The massive investment could impact near-term profitability.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimate calls for $13.16 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share (EPS) and $15.07 in fiscal 2026 EPS. For context, Microsoft reported $11.80 in diluted EPS in fiscal 2024, a 20% increase compared to fiscal 2023, whereas the fiscal 2025 target implies just 11.2% growth. So at least in the near term, earnings growth is decelerating. And margins could also decrease if AI spending doesn't immediately translate to measurable results.\n\nAnytime a company bets big on an idea, it puts pressure on those investments to pay off. But there's also the risk of being too idle and falling behind in the AI race.\n\nTherefore, the two biggest questions investors should ask are whether the company can afford to spend this much on AI without hurting its financial health, and if the investment dollars are going toward worthwhile endeavors.\n\nIn terms of financial health, Microsoft is as good as it gets. The company ended calendar year 2024 with $71.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and just $39.72 billion in long-term debt. In fiscal 2024, which ended June 30, 2024, it repurchased $17.25 billion in stock and paid $21.77 billion in dividends. While the dividend payment was higher, the buybacks were around $5 billion less than in fiscal 2023.\n\nManagement could continue pulling back on stock repurchases to fund its AI investments without taking on more debt. However, buybacks have helped offset Microsoft's stock-based compensation expense and reduce its share count over time, accelerating EPS growth. Fewer buybacks would put pressure on the core business to drive earnings growth.\n\nIn sum, Microsoft can afford to spend more on AI.\n\nAs for the second million-dollar question, there's reason to believe the AI investments are worth it. Microsoft is currently the No. 2 cloud player, ahead of Alphabet's Google Cloud but behind Amazon Web Services.\n\nAs demand for cloud computing grows to support AI workflows, Microsoft wants to ensure it is well positioned to take market share by providing advanced data centers and the best AI services. If it doesn't take market share, its investments could still pay off as long as the overall cloud computing pie grows.\n\nA balanced stock to buy now\n\nAs a legacy tech company, Microsoft hasn't been transformed by AI in the same way as smaller, faster-growing companies like Palantir Technologies or more pure-play AI names like Nvidia have. But it has been a net positive for the company. And Microsoft has the financial health and deep pockets necessary to pour money into building out AI infrastructure.\n\nThe languishing stock price and steady earnings growth have pushed Microsoft's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to its lowest level in a year. In fact, its P/E is currently 33, which is right around its average over the last three to 10 years. But it is arguably a much higher quality business with better growth prospects today than in years past, making its valuation even more compelling.\n\nAs mentioned, management spends a ton on dividends every year. The company has increased its payout every year for nearly two decades, and although the stock yields just 0.8%, Microsoft's growing dividend provides an added incentive to buy and hold the stock.\n\nWith a diversified business model, an affordable AI budget, and a reasonable valuation, Microsoft checks all the boxes for a foundational growth stock to buy now and build a portfolio around.",

            "content": "AI hype and data-center capex have been major market drivers in the past year but there is some angst lately about how much is being spent and whether there is a real business case for it all. That really kicked off with DeepSeek undercutting cost assumptions and now there is a TD note doing the rounds suggesting that Microsoft is pulling back on spending.\n\nI've published the text of the note below.\n\nOur channel checks indicate that $MSFT has 1) canceled leases in the US, totaling 'a couple of hundred MWs' with at least two private data center operators, 2) has pulled back on the conversion of 500\u2019s to leases, and 3) has re-allocated a considerable portion of its international spend to the US. When coupled with our prior channel checks, it points to a potential oversupply position for MSFT.\n\nOur Channel Checks Indicate Microsoft Has Cancelled Select US Data Center Leases and Has Pulled Back on SQQ To Lease Conversion; Pulls Back on International Market Expansion.\n\nOur recent channel checks indicate that Microsoft has terminated select leases with at least two private data center operators across multiple U.S. markets, totaling a couple of hundred MW. Our checks indicate that in some situations, Microsoft is using facility/power delays as a justification for the termination. Recall, as we highlighted in our 2022 Takeaways from PTC, this is the same tactic that Meta used to cancel multiple data center leases in the U.S. after we learned in our checks that Meta had then canceled a $48B capex program related to the metaverse (Meta subsequently cut its capex guidance by $5.4B two weeks later).\n\nSeparately, our channel checks suggest that Microsoft has also pulled back on converting negotiated and signed Statement of Qualifications (500\u2019s) (the precursor to a data center lease) into signed leases. To this point, it is currently unclear to us if this is simply a delay in 500-to-lease conversion or if it is an outright termination of the 500 with no conversion to leasing expected. For context, based on our checks, a 500 sets forth the terms and conditions for the lease and does not constitute a lease agreement. However, the conversion rate of 500\u2019s into a signed lease is close to 100%, with data center operators using this as the signal to start data center construction. In addition, our channel checks indicate that Microsoft is also re-allocating a considerable portion of its projected international spend to the U.S., which suggests to us a material slowdown in international leasing.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nWhile we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position. As we highlighted in our recent takeaways from PTC, we learned via our channel checks that Microsoft: 1. Walked away from multiple 100MW deals in multiple markets that were in early/mid-stages of negotiations. 2. Let +1GW of LOIs on larger footprint sites expire. 3. Walked away from at least five land parcels that it had under contract in multiple Tier I markets. At the time, we also highlighted that the magnitude of both potential data center capacity it walked away from and the decision to pull back on land acquisition (which supports core long-term capacity growth) in our view indicates the loss of a major demand signal that Microsoft was originally responding to and that we believed the shift in their appetite for capacity is tied to OpenAI, which recent press reports appear to confirm. To that point, consider this: Microsoft was the most active lessee of capacity in 2023 and 1H24, at which time it was procuring capacity relative to a capacity forecast that contemplated incremental OpenAI workloads. However, as we believe is indicated by its decision to pause construction on a data center in Wisconsin\u2014which our prior channel checks indicated was to support OpenAI\u2014there is capacity that it has likely procured, particularly in areas where capacity is not fungible to cloud, where the company may have excess data center capacity relative to its new forecast. This is our interpretation of the current situation, however, our view is subject to change as we conduct incremental channel checks.\"\n\nThere is has long been some angst about AI spend slowing down and signs the 'bubble' is deflating. However contrast this with what CEO Satya Nadalla said in a podcast this week.\n\nSo I think there are two places where I can say with some confidence. One is the hyperscalers that do well, because the fundamental thing is if you sort of go back to even how Sam and others describe it, if intelligence is log of compute, whoever can do lots of compute is a big winner.\n\nSo in fact it's manna from heaven to have these AI workloads because guess what? They're more hungry for more compute, not just for training, but we now know, for test time. When you think of an AI agent, it turns out the AI agent is going to exponentially increase compute usage because you're not even bound by just one human invoking a program. It's one human invoking programs that invoke lots more programs. That's going to create massive, massive demand and scale for compute infrastructure. So our hyperscale business, Azure business, and other hyperscalers, I think that\u2019s a big thing.\n\nThere are also some indications around a breakup of the Microsoft and OpenAI partnership.\n\nIt's tough to tell what's true and what's true and what's regular churn here but there is enough noise around this to add to the angst early this week.",

            "content": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\n\nResearchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first \u201ctopological qubits\u201d in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.\n\nAt the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a \u201croad map\u201d for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realize many significant goals of quantum computing\u2014such as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.\n\nIf Microsoft\u2019s claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.\n\nHowever, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the road map still includes many hurdles to be overcome. While the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don\u2019t have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.\n\nBy now you probably have some questions. What\u2019s a topological qubit? What\u2019s a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?\n\nQuantum Bits Are Hard to Build\n\nQuantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits\u2014or qubits.\n\nAn ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a \u201csuperposition\u201d of up and down).\n\nThis means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations\u2014particularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.\n\nSo far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.\n\nResearchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.\n\nTiny Wires and Exotic Particles\n\nMicrosoft has taken a very different approach to build its \u201ctopological qubits.\u201d They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorized in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.\n\nMajoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).",

            "content": "By Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft has spent months touting a rebound in its Azure cloud business and its quarterly revenue forecast on Wednesday will show whether billion-dollar bets on artificial intelligence are propelling increased growth in its main profit engine.\n\nThe software company emerged as a front-runner in Big Tech's AI race last year thanks to its early bet on OpenAI, but investor doubts have been growing about its ability to make money from the technology that it plans to back with about $80 billion in capital spending this fiscal year.\n\nAzure growth has slowed for two straight quarters even as the contribution of AI has been increasing and Microsoft has said a rebound would only materialize in the third quarter.\n\nIts shares underperformed most Big Tech rivals last year. The stock also fell sharply on Monday in a tech-led global selloff after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched an AI model that it said was cost-effective and ran on less-advanced chips, stirring doubts about United States' lead in the technology.\n\nLike other U.S. companies with a large global presence, Microsoft is expected to take a hit from a strong dollar, as the greenback firmed nearly 8% in the last three months of 2024.\n\n\"Investor sentiment (for Microsoft) has shifted to negative as a 'wall of worry' around gross margins, capital expenditure, generative AI monetization and the OpenAI relationship builds,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a preview note.\n\nAzure, which some analysts say accounts for around a third of Microsoft's revenue, is expected to grow 31.8% in the second quarter, slower than the 33% growth it saw in the previous three months, according to Visible Alpha.\n\nSome of the growth will come from its business with OpenAI.\n\nDespite OpenAI's move to work with Oracle on building new data centers, Microsoft still has the rights to handle almost all the traffic for both OpenAI's consumer business and its business of selling to software developers, according to representatives from Microsoft and OpenAI. That means OpenAI will pay for Azure services as its business grows.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft to forecast nearly 33% growth in the Azure business during the third quarter.\n\nOverall, the intelligent cloud business that houses Azure is expected to report revenue growth of 19.7% for the second quarter.\n\nCOPILOT PRICING\n\nDoubts have also been rising about the adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot AI assistant. After reports including a Gartner survey last year flagged tepid demand beyond pilot projects, Microsoft has been experimenting with pricing to boost uptake.\n\nIt has now bundled AI features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans for an extra $3 per month. Previously, users paid $20 monthly to access Copilot in apps such as Word. Enterprises still have to pay $30 a month per user for Copilot.\n\nThe company has also been betting heavily on AI agents and relaunched its free Copilot for businesses as 365 Copilot Chat this month, with the ability to use AI agents - programs that need little human intervention unlike chatbots.\n\n\"While the product has had some bumps \u2013 we still think a 10% penetration rate for Microsoft 365 Copilot could add well over $10 billion in revenues within 5 years,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes said.\n\nMicrosoft's productivity and business processes unit - home to Office products, LinkedIn and 365 Copilot - is expected to report a revenue growth of 11.8% in the second quarter.\n\nMore personal computing, the unit that houses Windows and Xbox, is expected to see a 2.6% decline in revenue.\n\nThe results are just the second since the company in August rejigged the way it reports its businesses to align them more closely with how they are managed. That move has, analysts said, made it harder to estimate the company's performance.\n\nOverall, revenue is expected to rise 10.9% in the second quarter, slower than the 16% growth in the first quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. Net profit is expected to increase 6.3%, weaker than the 10.7% growth in the first quarter.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

This leaves me with the unenviable task of somehow bringing this groundbreaking news to you without sending both of our heads blasting away from our bodies like a space-bound shuttlecraft for the super-wealthy. Strap in.\n\nMicrosoft's Majorana 1 quantum processor is the world's first to be built on a \"topological core architecture,\" using a new topoconductor material to host Majorana particles that serve as the building blocks for creating topological qubits that are resistant to noise and error that leads to incorrect calculations.\n\nIs your head hurting, or just mine?\n\nPutting it simply: is Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip a big deal? Yes, it is. Is it fast? Very. Does it matter to the average consumer? Not right now. Can I explain quantum computing to you in more depth, anyway? I was hoping you wouldn't ask, but I'll try my best.\n\nQuantum computing 101: We're not in Kansas anymore\n\nConfidence in whatever intelligence I possess has been sent reeling by news of Microsoft's new Majorana 1 quantum chip. I've lost count of the number of times I've Googled \"Explain quantum computing to me like I'm 5\" over the last few days.\n\nEach time being met by walls of incoherent (to me, at least) science babble that either misses the point of my phrasing or paints every kindergartener as some Doogie Howser, M.D.-level (or Doogie Kame\u0101loha, M.D., for those of you who's birth year begins with a 2) child prodigy of the sciences.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHowever, from one quantum layperson to another, this is how I'd best describe it: If a modern computer uses bits as its smallest unit of data (represented by either 1 or 0), like a light switch \u2014 which can be set to either on (1) or off (0) \u2014 a quantum computer uses a qubit, which is more akin to a dimmer switch \u2014 able to be on (1), off (0), or anywhere between the two.\n\nMajorana 1 Explained: The Path to a Million Qubits - YouTube Watch On\n\nSomewhat pouring gasoline onto this analogy, a qubit can be in every possible position at the same time thanks to superpositioning \u2014 allowing it to perform calculations on multiple possibilities simultaneously, making it significantly more powerful and faster than a regular bit.\n\nHow much more powerful? Let's look at another quantum chip as an example.\n\nIn December, Google announced its own quantum processor, Willow, able to perform a computation using the random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark for quantum computers in under 5 minutes.\n\nWithout context, that means next to naught. However, compared to Willow, today's fastest supercomputers would take 10 septillion (10^24) years to perform the same task.\n\nWhat's a septillion? That's a 10 followed by twenty-four zeroes, presenting a timescale so large it eclipses the estimated age of the universe (13.7 billion years) by a factor of 729 trillion.\n\nGoogle's Willow features only 105 qubits. The design of Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum processor can theoretically pack up to a million qubits when scaled up, catapulting the company to the forefront of quantum computing.\n\nSo, quantum computers are fast. Really fast. Then again, that's how every computer feels before you install Google Chrome. We've yet to know how Willow or Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip would react to the RAM-hungry beast of modern computing.\n\nIt's the future, but wake me up when it can play DOOM\n\nSadly, those of you salivating at the mouth over thoughts of how well a Surface Laptop could perform with a Majorana 1 chip housed inside have some years to wait before quantum computing goes mainstream.\n\nInstead, computers like those Majorana 1 will power are locked away inside sterile and cold lab environments, tasked with solving very particular niche problems and simulations.\n\nIn fact, one of the primary tasks of Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip will be to help Microsoft refine the design of a better Majorana quantum chip, ready to scale up to its million qubit potential in a matter of years, not decades.\n\nMicrosoft technical fellow Krysta Svore describes the creation of the Majorana 1's indium arsenide topoconductor as done atom by atom, highlighting, \"understanding these materials is incredibly hard. With a scaled quantum computer, we will be able to predict materials with even better properties for building the next generation of quantum computers beyond scale.\"\n\nSo, while it is an exciting development, nobody will be bragging about Cyberpunk 2077 performance on the Majorana 1 any time soon. The Majorana 1 is the chip before the chip, before the chip that changes personal computing entirely.

            "content": "I admit, since middle school, I\u2019ve spent most of my downtime immersed in video games. There are the quintessential epics: Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, and Fortnite. And then there are some indies close to my heart\u2014a game that simulates a wildfire watcher in a forest, a road trip adventure, or one that uses portals to connect improbable physical spaces.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one sucked into games. The multi-billion-dollar video game industry is now bigger than Hollywood. And designers are constantly scrambling to expand their digital worlds to meet endless expectations for new content.\n\nNow, they may have a nifty helper.\n\nThis week, Microsoft Research released Muse, an AI that spews out a multitude of diverse new scenarios within a game. Like ChatGPT and Gemini, Muse is a generative AI model. Trained on roughly 500,000 human gameplay sessions from Microsoft-owned Ninja Theory\u2019s multiplayer shooter Bleeding Edge, Muse can dream up facsimiles of gameplay in which characters obey the game\u2019s internal physical rules and associated controller actions.\n\nThe team is quick to add that Muse isn\u2019t intended to replace human game designers. Rather, true to its name, the AI can offer inspiration for teams to adopt as they choose.\n\n\u201cIn our research, we focus on exploring the capabilities that models like Muse need to effectively support human creatives,\u201d wrote study author Katja Hofmann in a blog post.\n\nMuse is only trained on one game and can only produce scenarios based on Bleeding Edge. However, because the AI learned from human gameplay data without any preconception of the game\u2019s physics itself, the model could be used for other games, as long as there\u2019s enough data for training.\n\n\u201cWe believe generative AI can boost this creativity and open up new possibilities,\u201d wrote Fatima Kardar, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft, in a separate blog post.\n\nWhole New Worlds\n\nGenerative AI has already swept our existing digital universe. Now, game developers are asking if AI can help build wholly new worlds too.\n\nUsing AI to produce coherent video footage of gameplay isn\u2019t new. In 2024, Google introduced GameNGen, which according to the company, is the first game engine powered by neural networks. The AI recreated the classic video game Doom without peeking into the game\u2019s original code. Rather, it repeatedly played the game and eventually learned how hundreds of millions of small decisions changed the game\u2019s outcome. The result is an AI-based copy that can be played for up to 20 seconds with all its original functionality intact.\n\nModern video games are a lot harder for an AI to tackle.\n\nMost games are now in 3D, and each has its own alluring world with a set of physical rules. A game\u2019s maps, non-player characters, and other designs can change with version updates. But how a character moves inside that virtual world\u2014that is, how a player knows when to jump, slide, shoot, or tuck behind a barrier\u2014stays the same.\n\nTo be fair, glitches are fun to hack, but only if they\u2019re far and few in between. If the physics within the game\u2014however improbable in real-life\u2014constantly breaks, the player easily loses their sense of immersion.\n\nConsistency is just part of the gaming experience a designer needs to think about. To better understand how AI could potentially help, the team first interviewed 27 video game designers from indie studios and industry behemoths across multiple continents.\n\nSeveral themes emerged. One was about the need to create new and different scenarios that still maintain the framework of the game. For example, new ideas need to fit not only with the game\u2019s physics\u2014objects shouldn\u2019t pass through walls\u2014but also its style and vibe so they mesh with the general narrative of the game.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI still has kind of a limited amount of context,\u201d one designer said. \u201cThis means it\u2019s difficult for an AI to consider the entire experience\u2026and following specific rules and mechanics [inside the game].\u201d\n\nOthers emphasized the need for iteration, revisiting a design until it feels right. This means that an assistant AI should be flexible enough to easily adopt designer-proposed changes over and over. Divergent paths were also a top priority, in that if a player chooses a different action, those actions will each have different and meaningful consequences.",

The chip, called Majorana 1, is powered by a new Topological Core architecture. Without getting too much into the weeds, topoconductor is \u201cbreakthrough class of materials\u201d that will allow Microsoft to create topological superconductivity, which Chetan Nayak, technical fellow and corporate vice president of Quantum Hardware at Microsoft, described in a blog post as \u201ca new state of matter that previously existed only in theory.\u201d\n\nSo, something that is topological is not a solid, or a liquid, or a gas \u2014 it\u2019s topological. While classical phases of matter correspond to local, microscopic patterns in the spatial arrangement of particles, physical properties of a topological state of matter depend on patterns of long-range quantum entanglement, or the generation and interaction of groups of particles.\n\nNayak continued: \u201cThe advance stems from Microsoft\u2019s innovations in the design and fabrication of gate-defined devices that combine indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor). When cooled to near absolute zero and tuned with magnetic fields, these devices form topological superconducting nanowires with Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) at the wires\u2019 ends.\u201d\n\nMZMs, he explained, are the building blocks of qubits; and a qubit \u2014 or quantum bit \u2014 is the basic unit of information in quantum computing.\n\nMicrosoft said that this development offers a path to developing quantum systems that can scale to a million qubits on a single chip that\u2019s small enough to fit into the palm of your hand, and capable of addressing the world\u2019s most complex industrial and societal problems \u2014 in a matter of years, not decades. The company claimed, too, that its new chips is less prone to errors than those of its competitors.\n\nIn what is called its first quantum milestone, Microsoft published its roadmap to a quantum supercomputer 18 months ago. According to Nayak, the Majorana 1 is the company\u2019s second major quantum achievement. He added that Microsoft has already placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to house one million.\n\n\u201cA million-qubit quantum computer isn\u2019t just a milestone \u2014 it\u2019s a gateway to solving some of the world\u2019s most difficult problems. Even today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers cannot accurately predict the quantum processes that determine the properties of the materials essential to our future,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut quantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery. What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.\u201d",

(Courtesy of Microsoft/Handout via REUTERS)\n\nBy Stephen Nellis | REUTERS\n\nMicrosoft on Wednesday unveiled a new chip that it said showed quantum computing is \u201cyears, not decades\u201d away, joining Google and IBM in predicting that a fundamental change in computing technology is much closer than recently believed.\n\nQuantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today\u2019s systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields where near-infinite seas of possible combinations of molecules confound classical computers.\n\nQuantum computers also hold the danger of upending today\u2019s cybersecurity systems, where most encryption relies on the assumption that it would take too long to brute force gain access.\n\nThe biggest challenge of quantum computers is that a fundamental building block called a qubit, which is similar to a bit in classical computing, is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.\n\nMicrosoft said the Majorana 1 chip it has developed is less prone to those errors than rivals and provided as evidence a scientific paper set to be published in academic journal Nature.\n\nWhen useful quantum computers will arrive has become a topic of debate in the upper echelons of the tech industry. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last month that the technology was two decades away from overtaking his company\u2019s chips, the workhorses of artificial intelligence, reflecting broad skepticism.\n\nThose remarks prompted Google, which last year showed off its own new quantum chip, to say that commercial quantum computing applications are only five years away. IBM has said large-scale quantum computers will be online by 2033.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Majorana 1 has been in the works for nearly two decades and relies on a subatomic particle called the Majorana fermion whose existence was first theorized in the 1930s. That particle has properties that make it less prone to the errors that plague quantum computers, but it has been hard for physicists to find and control.\n\nMicrosoft said it created the Majorana 1 chip with indium arsenide and aluminum. The device uses a superconducting nanowire to observe the particles and can be controlled with standard computing equipment.\n\nThe chip Microsoft revealed Wednesday has far fewer qubits than rival chips from Google and IBM, but Microsoft believes that far fewer of its Majorana-based qubits will be needed to make useful computers because the error rates are lower.\n\nMicrosoft did not give a timeline for when the chip would be scaled up to create quantum computers that can outstrip today\u2019s machines, but the company said in a blog post that point was \u201cyears, not decades\u201d away.\n\nJason Zander, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the company\u2019s long-term strategic bets, described Majorana 1 as a \u201chigh risk, high reward\u201d strategy.\n\nThe chip was fabricated at Microsoft labs in Washington state and Denmark.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part has been solving the physics. There is no textbook for this, and we had to invent it,\u201d Zander said in an interview with Reuters. \u201cWe literally have invented the ability to go create this thing, atom by atom, layer by layer.\u201d\n\nPhilip Kim, a professor of physics at Harvard University who was not involved in Microsoft\u2019s research, said that Majorana fermions have been a hot topic among physicists for decades and called Microsoft\u2019s work an \u201cexciting development\u201d that put the company at the forefront of quantum research.\n\nHe also said that Microsoft\u2019s use of a hybrid between traditional semiconductors and exotic superconductors appeared to be a good route toward chips that can be scaled up into more powerful chips.\n\n\u201cAlthough there\u2019s no demonstration (of this scaling up) yet, what they are doing is really successful,\u201d Kim said.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jamie Freed",

At that milestone, you could expect a quantum computer to operate reliably, i.e. with enough error correction, to begin tackling real problems that surpass the capabilities of today's classical computers.\n\nThat includes challenges like simulating complex molecules for drug development, optimizing chemical reactions for more efficient fertilizer production (which currently accounts for 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide), modeling new materials for better batteries or solar cells, and running complex financial calculations to address macroeconomic issues.\n\nThe processor isn't commercially available, of course, and will likely only be used for evaluation, simulations, and developing future chips.\n\nMajorana 1 Explained: The Path to a Million Qubits\n\nHow did Microsoft make this?\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Microsoft's announcement is about how it got here. The company says this is one of it's longest-running research projects, and it's been 17 years in the making \u2013 with an even longer history of theoretical physics that's now been realized.\n\nBack in 1937, Italian physicist Ettore Majorana described a subatomic particle named a Majorana fermion with a unique quantum mechanical state that's resistant to local disturbances. This property made the particle an ideal candidate for building stable qubits for quantum computing, as they'd produce fewer errors.\n\nMicrosoft says it managed to observe these particles last year, and has now been able to harness them for practical applications in its chip-building process. Specifically, the company uses Majorana Zero Modes (MZM), which are quasiparticles that exist at the ends of topological superconducting nanowires made from 'topoconductors,' as the building blocks for the qubits in this processor.\n\nThe Majorana 1 chip currently fits eight qubits, but can hold more than one million of them Microsoft\n\nThese 'topoconductors' are a new type of material, which exhibit a whole new state of matter \u2013 different from solid, liquid, and gaseous states. In this case, indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor) are combined, cooled to near absolute zero and tuned with magnetic fields to achieve the state known as topological superconductivity.\n\nThis is also where the materials form topological superconducting nanowires with MZM at the wires\u2019 ends. These MZM store quantum information, and share an unpaired electron between them. That makes them invisible to outside interference, protecting the quantum information and allowing for stable operation of a quantum computer.\n\nNaturally, Microsoft isn't done yet. As with other companies building quantum computing tech \u2013 like Google \u2013 the firm is keen to pack a million qubits into a single processor so it can actually take on complex challenges. That may likely be just years away from now, not decades as we've previously expected.\n\nSource: Microsoft",

            "content": "Researchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first \"topological qubits\" in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.\n\nAt the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a \"roadmap\" for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realise many significant goals of quantum computing \u2013 such as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.\n\nIf Microsoft's claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.\n\nHowever, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the roadmap still includes many hurdles to be overcome.\n\nWhile the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don't have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.\n\nBy now you probably have some questions. What's a topological qubit? What's a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?\n\nQuantum bits are hard to build\n\nQuantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits \u2013 or qubits.\n\nAn ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both.\n\nIf you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a \"superposition\" of up and down).\n\nThis means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations \u2013 particularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.\n\nSo far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.\n\nResearchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.\n\nTiny wires and exotic particles\n\nMicrosoft has taken a very different approach to build its \"topological qubits\". They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorised in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.\n\nMajoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nIndeed, Majorana particles are so exotic they are usually only studied in universities \u2013 not used in practical applications.\n\nThe Microsoft team say they have used a pair of tiny wires, each with a Majorana particle trapped at either end, to act as a qubit. They measure the value of the qubit \u2013 expressed by means of whether an electron is in one wire or the other \u2013 using microwaves.\n\nBraided bits\n\nWhy has Microsoft put in all this effort? Because by swapping the positions of Majorana particles (or measuring them in a certain way), they can be \"braided\" so they can be measured without error and are resistant to outside interference. (This is the \"topological\" part of \"topological qubits\".)\n\nIn theory, a quantum computer made using Majorana particles can be completely free of the qubit errors that plague other designs.\n\nThis is why Microsoft has chosen such a seemingly laborious approach. Other technologies are more prone to errors, and hundreds of physical qubits may need to be combined together to produce a single reliable \"logical qubit\".\n\nMicrosoft has instead put its time and resources into developing Majorana-based qubits. While they are late to the big quantum party, they hope they will be able to catch up quickly.\n\nThere's always a catch\n\nAs always, if something sounds too good to be true, there is a catch. Even for a Majorana-based quantum computer, such as the one announced by Microsoft, one operation \u2013 known as T-gate \u2013 won't be achievable without errors.\n\nSo the Majorana-based quantum chip is only \"almost error-free\". However, correcting for T-gate errors is much simpler than the general error correction of other quantum platforms.\n\nMicrosoft plans to scale up by grouping together more and more qubits. (Microsoft)\n\nWhat now? Microsoft will try to move ahead with its roadmap, steadily building larger and larger collections of qubits.\n\nThe scientific community will closely watch how Microsoft's quantum computing processors operate, and how they perform in comparison to the other already established quantum computing processors.\n\nAt the same time, research into the exotic and obscure behaviour of Majorana particles will continue at universities around the globe.\n\nStephan Rachel, Professor, School of Physics, The University of Melbourne\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

(Credit: solarseven/Shutterstock)\n\nSign up for our email newsletter for the latest science news\n\nAn experimental Microsoft computer chip under development will deliver a one-two tech punch, according to the company.\n\nThe first blow is a statement that Microsoft scientists have developed the first-ever quantum-computing chip in its class. This form of computing could theoretically make, ahem, quantum leaps in both speed and number of calculations a computer could perform simultaneously.\n\nThe physics that theoretically would power such a chip is hard to understand \u2014 even for some physicists.\n\n\u201cQuantum refers to the scale of atoms and molecules where the laws of physics as we experience them break down and a different, counterintuitive set of laws apply,\u201d Daniel Lidar, a University of Southern California scientist wrote in an article. \u201cQuantum computers take advantage of these strange behaviors to solve problems.\u201d\n\nQuantum Leaps and New State of Matter\n\nThe second sock is that the chip uses a new state of matter \u2014 neither solid, liquid, nor gas \u2014 to help power that chip. The company has published intermediate findings from experiments of this new matter, which it calls a \u201ctopological superconductor.\"\n\nHowever, the company hasn\u2019t yet conclusively proven such a state of matter exists. Scientific reactions have so far varied from cautiously optimistic to expressing varying degrees of skepticism in an accompanying news article.\n\nScientists often say that great claims demand great evidence. It\u2019s safe to say that a new class of matter would fall into that category.\n\nSuperconductivity Skepticism\n\nAlso, research about superconductivity \u2014 whose goal is to enable electricity to flow without any resistance at room temperature \u2014 has been controversial. Such speed would enable quicker computing. But several peer-reviewed articles claiming to have achieved some form of it have been retracted \u2014 including one from a research group associated with Microsoft.\n\nStill, if the chip the company named Majorana 1 and the material that powers it eventually passes scientific scrutiny and reaches the market, it could revolutionize computing.\n\nHow Does Majorana 1 Work?\n\nThe company claims that the topological superconductor makes electrons in materials resistant to noise, which, in turn would theoretically let electricity flow through them unheeded. The new chip would use that material as a building block.\n\nThe company aims to create building blocks containing a million qubits. Qubits are individual units that demonstrate quantum properties. The company\u2019s aim is to create a machine built of a million qubits. Such a machine could theoretically perform a massive amount of operations rapidly.\n\n\u201cAll the world\u2019s current computers operating together can\u2019t do what a one-million-qubit quantum computer will be able to do,\u201d according to an article on Microsoft\u2019s website.\n\nThe world \u2014 especially quantum physicists and material scientists \u2014 will anxiously await more evidence that such a machine can exist.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nOur writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

In plainer English: Unauthorized miscreants could use the hole to log into sites using accounts they shouldn't have.\n\nPower Pages is software-as-a-service, so Microsoft has closed the vulnerability at its end. The software giant has nonetheless sent affected customers instructions on how to review their sites for signs of potential exploitation, and procedures to clean up if needed.\n\nThe good news is that this problem doesn\u2019t impact all Power Pages users. \u201cIf you've not been notified, this vulnerability does not affect you,\u201d states Microsoft\u2019s advisory.\n\nMicrosoft staffer Raj Kumar spotted the flaw, which was rated 8.2 out of 10 on the CVSS scale. Redmond warned that attackers had already taken advantage of the flaw before it implemented the fix.\n\nPower Pages was introduced in 2022, and Microsoft claims it has over 250 million monthly active website users. One of them is Britain's National Health Service, which last year exposed data describing over a million of its staff due to misconfigured access controls in websites it built with Power Pages.\n\nAsked for further comment on this latest update, a Microsoft spokesperson told us simply: \"We released a fix and customers are protected.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Windows giant has patched a high severity flaw in its search engine Bing. The CVSS 8.6-rated issue - CVE-2025-21355 - would, again technically speaking, let an unauthenticated attacker execute code over a network due to missing authentication for a critical function.\n\nThere's no evidence of active exploitation, but proof-of-concept code is already out there, according to Microsoft. Once again, the software giant has pushed out a patch to fix the issue, and no action is required from customers. \u00ae",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nUsers are adopting artificial intelligence tools at an unprecedented pace. As reported by Reuters, OpenAI weekly active users surged past 400 million in February, reinforcing the observation. The artificial intelligence startup had 300 million weekly active users in December 2024, signifying an increase of 100 million users. Furthermore, the company\u2019s paying business users also crossed 2 million in February, a figure that has more than doubled from its last update in September 2024.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 15 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching\n\nWith OpenAI boasting its successes despite DeepSeek\u2019s emergence, other tech companies are also joining in the parade. xAI, led by Musk, has recently revealed Grok3, the latest iteration of its chatbot. This innovation is in direct competition with AI models by companies such as OpenAI and DeepSeek. It is being rolled out immediately to Premium+ subscribers on X. xAI is also launching a new subscription tier, SuperGrok. This would be for users accessing the chatbot via its mobile app and Grok.com website.\n\n\"Grok-3 across the board is in a league of its own\u201d.\n\nAnalysts are also pouring in their comments about xAI\u2019s latest innovation.\n\n\"The introduction of Grok-3 puts xAI back in the race for leadership in open-source LLMs. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on some benchmarks, which makes xAI relevant again\u201d.\n\nWhile Luria did point out xAI\u2019s relevancy in the leadership in open-source LLMs, it was also noted that improvements over the Grok-2 model appear to be too small to justify the enormous resources used to train it.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic, another AI startup, is doing its best to catch up with firms such as OpenAI. More than a week ago, the company projected that its revenue could reach as high as $34.5 billion in 2027. The report revealed that in a base case scenario, Anthropic's revenue would reach $12 billion in 2027, up from $2.2 billion in 2025. Back in January, Reuters also reported how Anthropic is nearing a deal to raise $2 billion at a price that values the company at $60 billion.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

            "content": "For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that\u2019s beyond solid, liquid and gas. \u201cMost of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. \u201cWe believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.\u201d\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a \u201ctopological state,\u201d a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are \u201cfaster, more reliable and smaller,\u201d providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella.\n\nResearchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today\u2019s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry\u2019s race to develop quantum computers\u2014a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nA one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic.\n\n\u201cMost of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,\u201d Microsoft said.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today\u2019s supercomputers 10 septillion years\u2014a number that surpasses the age of the universe\u2014to complete.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology\u2019s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that \u201cvery useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.\u201d Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. \u201cMy understanding is that\u2019s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nNadella is more optimistic. Microsoft\u2019s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s under Nadella\u2019s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s\u2014long before Nadella joined the company. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. \u201cI\u2019m the third CEO of Microsoft who\u2019s been excited about quantum.\u201d\n\nDespite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft\u2019s research division, according to Nadella. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.\u201d",

By effectively transferring knowledge from freely available visual and language data, Magma bridges verbal, spatial, and temporal intelligence to navigate complex tasks and settings.\"\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in its pursuit of agentic AI. OpenAI has been experimenting with AI agents through projects like Operator that can perform UI tasks in a web browser, and Google has explored multiple agentic projects with Gemini 2.0.\n\nSpatial intelligence\n\nWhile Magma builds off of Transformer-based LLM technology that feeds training tokens into a neural network, it's different from traditional vision-language models (like GPT-4V, for example) by going beyond what they call \"verbal intelligence\" to also include \"spatial intelligence\" (planning and action execution). By training on a mix of images, videos, robotics data, and UI interactions, Microsoft claims that Magma is a true multimodal agent rather than just a perceptual model.",

Sign up to watch\n\nHarnessing a new type of material\n\nAll of today\u2019s announcements build on our team\u2019s recent breakthrough: the world\u2019s first topoconductor. This revolutionary class of materials enables us to create topological superconductivity, a new state of matter that previously existed only in theory. The advance stems from Microsoft\u2019s innovations in the design and fabrication of gate-defined devices that combine indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor). When cooled to near absolute zero and tuned with magnetic fields, these devices form topological superconducting nanowires with Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) at the wires\u2019 ends.\n\nFigure 1: Reading the state of our topological qubit.\n\nFor nearly a century, these quasiparticles existed only in textbooks. Now, we can create and control them on demand in our topoconductors. MZMs are the building blocks of our qubits, storing quantum information through \u2018parity\u2019\u2014whether the wire contains an even or odd number of electrons. In conventional superconductors, electrons bind into Cooper pairs and move without resistance. Any unpaired electron can be detected because its presence requires extra energy. Our topoconductors are different: here, an unpaired electron is shared between a pair of MZMs, making it invisible to the environment. This unique property protects the quantum information.\n\nWhile this makes our topoconductors ideal candidates for qubits, it also presents a challenge: How do we read quantum information that is so well hidden? How can we distinguish between, say, 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,001 electrons?\n\nOur solution to this measurement challenge works as follows (also see Figure 1):\n\nWe use digital switches to couple both ends of the nanowire to a quantum dot, which is a tiny semiconductor device that can store electrical charge.\n\nThis connection increases the dot\u2019s ability to hold charge. Crucially, the exact increase depends on the parity of the nanowire.\n\nWe measure this change using microwaves. The dot\u2019s ability to hold charge determines how the microwaves reflect off the quantum dot. As a result, they return carrying an imprint of the nanowire\u2019s quantum state.\n\nWe designed our devices so these changes are large enough to measure reliably in a single shot. Our initial measurements had an error probability of 1%, and we\u2019ve identified clear paths to significantly reduce this.\n\nOur system shows impressive stability. External energy\u2014such as electromagnetic radiation\u2014can break Cooper pairs, creating unpaired electrons that can flip the qubit\u2019s state from even to odd parity. However, our results show that this is rare, occurring only once per millisecond on average. This indicates that the shielding that envelops our processor is effective at keeping such radiation out. We are exploring ways to reduce this even further.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that quantum computation would require us to engineer a new state of matter specifically designed to enable it. What\u2019s remarkable is how accurate our readout technique already is, demonstrating that we are harnessing this exotic state of matter for quantum computation.\n\nRevolutionizing quantum control through digital precision\n\nThis readout technique enables a fundamentally different approach to quantum computing in which measurements are used to perform calculations.\n\nTraditional quantum computing rotates quantum states through precise angles, requiring complex analog control signals customized for each qubit. This complicates quantum error correction (QEC), which must rely on these same sensitive operations to detect and correct errors.\n\nOur measurement-based approach simplifies QEC dramatically. We perform error correction entirely through measurements activated by simple digital pulses that connect and disconnect quantum dots from nanowires. This digital control makes it practical to manage the large numbers of qubits needed for real-world applications.\n\nFrom physics to engineering\n\nFigure 2: Roadmap to fault-tolerant quantum computation with tetrons. The first panel shows a single-qubit device. The tetron is formed through two parallel topological wires (blue) with an MZM at each end (orange dot) connected by a perpendicular trivial superconducting wire (light blue). The next panel shows a two-qubit device that supports measurement-based braiding transformations. The third panel shows a 4\u00d72 array of tetrons supporting a quantum error detection demonstration on two logical qubits. These demonstrations build toward quantum error correction, such as on the device shown in the right panel (a 27\u00d713 tetron array).\n\nWith the core building blocks now demonstrated\u2014quantum information encoded in MZMs, protected by topology, and processed through measurements\u2014we\u2019re ready to move from physics breakthrough to practical implementation.\n\nThe next step is a scalable architecture built around a single-qubit device called a tetron (see Figure 2). At the Station Q meeting, we shared data demonstrating the basic operation of this qubit. One fundamental operation\u2014measuring the parity of one of the topological nanowires in a tetron\u2014uses the same technique described in our Nature paper.\n\nAnother key operation puts the qubit in a superposition of parity states. This, too, is performed by a microwave reflectometry measurement of a quantum dot, but in a different measurement configuration in which we decouple the first quantum dot from the nanowire and connect a different dot to both nanowires at one end of the device. By performing these two orthogonal Pauli measurements, Z and X, we\u2019ve demonstrated measurement-based control\u2014a crucial milestone that unlocks the next steps on our roadmap.\n\nOur roadmap now leads systematically toward scalable QEC. The next steps will involve a 4\u00d72 tetron array. We will first use a two-qubit subset to demonstrate entanglement and measurement-based braiding transformations. Using the entire eight-qubit array, we will then implement quantum error detection on two logical qubits.\n\nThe built-in error protection of topological qubits simplifies QEC. Moreover, our custom QEC codes reduce overhead roughly tenfold compared to the previous state-of-the-art approach. This dramatic reduction means that our scalable system can be built from fewer physical qubits and has the potential to run at a faster clock speed.\n\nDARPA\u2019s recognition of our approach\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has selected Microsoft as one of two companies to advance to the final phase of their rigorous benchmarking program known as Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC)\u2014one of the programs that makes up DARPA\u2019s larger Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI). Microsoft views this recognition as validation of our roadmap for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer with topological qubits.\n\nDARPA\u2019s US2QC program and its broader Quantum Benchmarking Initiative represent a rigorous approach to evaluating quantum systems that could solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. To date, the US2QC program has brought together experts from DARPA, Air Force Research Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and NASA Ames Research Center to verify quantum hardware, software, and applications. Going forward, the larger Quantum Benchmarking Initiative is expected to engage with even more experts in the testing and evaluation of quantum computers.\n\nPreviously, DARPA selected Microsoft for an earlier phase upon an assessment that we could plausibly build a utility-scale quantum computer in a reasonable timeframe. DARPA then evaluated the Microsoft quantum team\u2019s architectural designs and engineering plan for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. As a result of this careful analysis, DARPA and Microsoft have executed an agreement to begin the final phase of the program. During this phase, Microsoft intends to build a fault-tolerant prototype based on topological qubits in years, not decades\u2014a crucial acceleration step toward utility-scale quantum computing.\n\nUnlocking quantum\u2019s promise\n\nEighteen months ago, we laid out our roadmap to a quantum supercomputer. Today we hit our second milestone, demonstrating the world\u2019s first topological qubit. And we\u2019ve already placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to house one million.\n\nA million-qubit quantum computer isn\u2019t just a milestone\u2014it\u2019s a gateway to solving some of the world\u2019s most difficult problems. Even today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers cannot accurately predict the quantum processes that determine the properties of the materials essential to our future. But quantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery. What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.\n\nOur path to useful quantum computing is clear. The foundational technology is proven, and we believe our architecture is scalable. Our new agreement with DARPA shows a commitment to relentless progress toward our goal: building a machine that can drive scientific discovery and solve problems that matter. Stay tuned for more updates on our journey.\n\nStay informed of Microsoft\u2019s advancements in quantum computing:",

To improve visibility and compare with theoretical predictions, we downsample the time trace by averaging over a 90-\u03bcs window. By comparing the measured resonator response with a reference trace (taken with dot 2 in a Coulomb valley), we convert it to a \\({\\widetilde{C}}_{{\\rm{Q}}}\\) record, which includes a field-dependent shift of C Q that cancels out of \u0394C Q (see equation (28) in the Supplementary Information).\n\nWe sweep V QD2 to find charge transitions in dot 2 and, because the normal to the plane of the device is only slightly offset (<1\u00b0) from the x axis of the magnet, we sweep the x component of the magnetic field B x in steps of 0.14 mT to study the dependence on \u03a6. Our B x sweep range is offset from 0 so that B \u22a5 (which contains a contribution from B z ) is swept symmetrically around 0. We use the topological gap protocol (TGP)14 to select an in-plane field B \u2225 and a wire plunger gate voltage V WP1 range (indicated, respectively, in Fig. 1a,c) for our measurements, as discussed in Section 4 of the Supplementary Information. The readout system parameters that we achieve are not strongly dependent on these values. For measurement A1 of device A, the relevant regime is B \u2225 \u2248 1.8 T and V WP1 \u2248 \u22121.832 V.\n\nFor appropriately tuned quantum dot plungers, in particular for V QD2 close to resonance, the measured \\({\\widetilde{C}}_{{\\rm{Q}}}\\) record exhibits switches between two capacitance values that differ by a \u0394C Q (B x ) that oscillates as a function of B x . At some B x , there are no visible switches, as in Fig. 3a, so \u0394C Q (B x ) vanishes. At generic B x , there is a clear random telegraph signal (RTS), which is shown in Fig. 3d for the B x that corresponds to maximal \u0394C Q (B x ). From a histogram of all \\({\\widetilde{C}}_{{\\rm{Q}}}\\) observed within this time trace, we extract an achieved SNR of 5.01 in 90 \u03bcs (Fig. 3e,f) or, equivalently, an SNR of 1 in 3.6 \u03bcs (see Section 3.3 of the Supplementary Information). As demonstrated in Fig. 3g, the intervals between switches follow an exponential distribution with a characteristic time \u03c4 RTS \u2248 2 ms. By plotting histograms of the \\({\\widetilde{C}}_{{\\rm{Q}}}\\) time traces as a function of B x , as shown in Fig. 3h, we observe a B x -dependent bimodal distribution of \\({\\widetilde{C}}_{{\\rm{Q}}}\\) values with peaks separated by \u0394C Q (B x ). The oscillation period of \u0394C Q (B x ) is 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 mT, which is consistent with the expected flux of h/2e through the interference loop in this device geometry. We interpret the RTS in C Q as originating from switches of the fermion parity in the wire; see Section 7.3 of the Supplementary Information for details.\n\nFig. 3: Experimental demonstration of fermion parity measurements.

A similar difference in the visibility of flux-induced oscillations across different charge transitions was recently observed in a double quantum dot interferometer experiment47. In Section 6 of the Supplementary Information, we discuss oscillations with different periods that are observed at other points in the parameter space of the device.\n\nWe support this interpretation by reproducing our results with quantum dynamics simulations that incorporate rf drive power, charge noise and temperature. To build intuition for those simulations, we use an idealized model (see Section 2.2 of the Supplementary Information) subject to the following assumptions (which we will later relax): the wire is in the topological phase and there are no sub-gap states other than the MZMs; the charging energy and level spacing in the dots are much greater than the temperature; dots 1 and 3 are sufficiently detuned that their influence is fully encapsulated in the effective couplings t L and t R to MZMs at the ends of the wire (see Fig. 1a); and the drive frequency and power are both negligible. In this limit, the quantum capacitance as a function of the total fermion parity in the quantum dot\u2013wire system, Z, is given by\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l}{C}_{{\\rm{Q}}}(Z\\,,\\phi )\\,=\\,\\frac{2{e}^{2}{\\alpha }^{2}| {t}_{{\\rm{C}}}(Z\\,,\\phi ){| }^{2}}{{[{({E}_{{\\rm{D}}}+2Z{E}_{{\\rm{M}}})}^{2}+4| {t}_{{\\rm{C}}}(Z,\\phi ){| }^{2}]}^{3/2}}\\\\ \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\times \\,\\tanh \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{{({E}_{{\\rm{D}}}+2Z{E}_{{\\rm{M}}})}^{2}+4| {t}_{{\\rm{C}}}(Z\\,,\\phi ){| }^{2}}}{2{k}_{{\\rm{B}}}T}\\right),\\end{array}$$ (1)\n\nin which E D is the detuning from the charge-degeneracy point, \u03b1 is the lever arm of the plunger gate to the dot, E M is the MZM energy splitting and T is the temperature. The net effective tunnelling that results from the interference between different trajectories from the dot to the MZMs and back, t C (Z, \u03d5), is\n\n$$| {t}_{{\\rm{C}}}(Z\\,,\\phi ){| }^{2}=| {t}_{{\\rm{L}}}{| }^{2}+| {t}_{{\\rm{R}}}{| }^{2}+2Z| {t}_{{\\rm{L}}}| | {t}_{{\\rm{R}}}| \\sin \\phi .$$ (2)\n\nHere \u03d5 is the phase difference between t L and t R , which is controlled by the magnetic flux \u03a6 through the interference loop created by the dot, the wire and the tunnelling paths between them according to \u03d5 = 2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a6 0 + \u03d5 0 , in which \u03a6 0 = h/e and \u03d5 0 is a flux-independent offset. To capture the extent to which C Q can be used to discriminate between Z = \u00b11, it is convenient to introduce\n\n$$\\Delta {C}_{{\\rm{Q}}}(\\phi )=| {C}_{{\\rm{Q}}}(Z=1,\\phi )-{C}_{{\\rm{Q}}}(Z=-1,\\phi )| .$$ (3)\n\nThe interferometer must be well balanced t L \u2248 t R for \u0394C Q to be large according to equation (1). When E M = 0, \u0394C Q exhibits maxima along the E D = 0 line, with flux periodicity h/2e.\n\nFor detailed comparison with experiments, we use the methods discussed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the Supplementary Information to simulate a more complete model of the device and readout chain that includes the full triple-dot system, incoherent coupling to the environment (using parameters inferred from separate measurements; see Sections 9 and 10 of the Supplementary Information) and measurement backaction. Crucially, this approach allows us to incorporate different noise sources in a systematic and quantitative way without any free parameters. The simulated dynamical C Q , defined in Section 2.3 of the Supplementary Information, is shown in Fig. 4. The C Q histograms in Fig. 4a reveal two h/e-periodic branches (one shown in red and the other in blue), associated with the two parities of the coupled system. If the fermion parity Z were perfectly conserved, then the device would remain in one of the two parity eigenstates and the \u03a6 dependence would follow either the blue or the red trace in Fig. 4a. However, Z should fluctuate on a timescale given by the quasiparticle poisoning time \u03c4 qpp . Hence, in traces over times longer than \u03c4 qpp , a bimodal distribution of C Q values is expected, that is, both the blue and red traces in Fig. 4a. Consequently, the kurtosis K(C Q ) exhibits minima at which \u0394C Q is peaked, as shown in Fig. 4b, and time traces taken at these points will exhibit a telegraph signal composed of switches between the values C Q (1, \u03d5) and C Q (\u22121, \u03d5). Comparing Fig. 4 with Fig. 3h,i, we find good overall agreement of both the histograms and the kurtosis. We find a maximum \u0394C Q (\u03a6) \u2248 1 fF, which is consistent with our measurements in Fig. 3. This agreement extends to other parameter regimes, such as when the interferometer is poorly balanced or the splitting E M is sizeable, as discussed in Section 6 of the Supplementary Information.\n\nFig. 4: Simulation of fermion parity measurements.

Here we used t m1 = t m2 = 6 \u03bceV, t 12 = t 23 = 8 \u03bceV, E C1 = 140 \u03bceV, E C2 = 45 \u03bceV, E C3 = 100 \u03bceV, N g1 = N g3 = 0.3, T = 50 mK and E M = 0. b, Kurtosis of C Q (t) as a function of N g2 and flux through the loop.

We have tested our interpretation by: (1) disconnecting the dots from the wire; (2) measuring at fields of 0.8 T below the region identified by TGP; (3) intentionally injecting quasiparticles into the superconductor and observing the effect on \u03c4 RTS ; and (4) comparing the quasiparticle density measured in a separate test structure with that inferred according to the hypothesis that \u03c4 qpp = \u03c4 RTS \u2248 2 ms (Section 7 of the Supplementary Information).",

            "content": "Researchers at Microsoft, with support from DARPA, say they\u2019ve designed a quantum computer chip that could lead to artificial-intelligence tools that use far fewer computer resources and energy.\n\nAccording to a Microsoft blog on the announcement and their accompanying paper, the team has developed a new way to check the state of a quantum computation without disrupting the delicate information underlying it. This technique, called interferometric single-shot parity measurement, was tested using a special combination of indium arsenide and aluminum, or InAs\u2013Al. They\u2019ve used that to create a chip, the Majorana 1, which Microsoft described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first Quantum Processing Unit, QPU, powered by a topological core, designed to scale to a million qubits on a single chip.\u201d\n\nIn simple terms, the method allows scientists to determine whether two quantum bits (qubits) are in the same state or different states\u2014kind of like checking if two spinning coins landed on the same side\u2014without looking at them directly. This is important because traditional ways of measuring qubits can disturb them, simply because observing or measuring processes at the quantum level can change the process or phenomenon being observed. making quantum calculations less reliable.\n\nThe breakthrough would be especially useful for a type of quantum computing called topological quantum computation, which is designed to be more stable and resistant to errors. In this approach, information is stored in a way that makes it harder to lose due to tiny changes in the environment, a major challenge for quantum computers. If successfully implemented on a larger scale, this technique could help make quantum computers more reliable and easier to build. The paper provides a measurement technique that Microsoft\u2019 has integrated into Majorana 1.\n\nQuantum chips could have big implications for artificial intelligence as they allow for the processing of very large amounts of data in parallel, taking far less time and using fewer computer resources than traditional methods. For instance if you want to scale a computer running on highly advanced NVIDIA H100 GPUs, you would need to add more and more GPUs, leading to a linear increase in both performance and energy consumption. But a 10,000-qubit quantum computer could perform specific tasks with far less energy than traditional supercomputers.\n\nThat has relevance to the military, whose future operating environments will feature heavy electro-magnetic-spectrum warfare. Among other things, that means drones will need more onboard computing capability so they can analyze surveillance and intelligence data and make decisions autonomously. Quantum machine learning applied to encryption and security could render many classic encryption obsolete. And there are also potential applications in running large language models with far fewer computers and much less data\u2014hence the support from DARPA under its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, or QBI.\n\nBut Microsoft and others say that the nearest-term applications will blend traditional computing processes with quantum ones.\n\n\u201cThis is truly an advance for the industry: building a custom chip that uses topological qubits which many consider extremely useful for scaling to powerful quantum computers. The announcement reinforces our assessment that fault-tolerant quantum hardware is closer than many business leaders think,\u201d Markus Pflitsch, founder and CEO of Terra Quantum, said in a statement.\n\nOf course, quantum breakthroughs don\u2019t always turn out to be exactly what they seem, and the idea of measuring something without measuring it directly opens further questions into what exactly is being measured? The Microsoft announcement doesn\u2019t include many of the specific technical details that might nominally accompany such breakthroughs but, according to Nature, the researchers did provide some experts with a bit more information at a closed-door meeting in California.\n\nOne of the attendees, a University of Oxford theoretical physicist Steven Simon, told the journal, \u201cWould I bet my life that they\u2019re seeing what they think they\u2019re seeing? No, but it looks pretty good.\u201d",

            "content": "This year is historic for Washington state as we welcome Governor Bob Ferguson, the first new governor in twelve years. In the few weeks since his inauguration, Bob Ferguson has signaled a pragmatic approach to governance, launching a new era in Washington State. Alongside Washingtonians across the state, Microsoft welcomes the Ferguson administration.\n\nToday, in line with our commitment to transparency, we are sharing our annual legislative agenda.\n\nThis year is also notable as the 2025 session is a biennial budget year where over the course of 105 days, the legislature will negotiate, write, and ultimately pass three distinct yet interdependent operating, capital, and transportation budgets, outlining the critical spending and revenue plans for the next twenty-four months. With a new federal administration, new governments around the world, and our new government here in Washington, this biennial budget process has a certain gravitas.\n\nIndeed, this is a critical moment for our state. The complexity of our state\u2019s economic fabric\u2014aerospace, technology, life sciences, agriculture, and space\u2014has resulted in both a growing population and now, more than ever, a moment of unprecedented technological progress, presenting opportunities for Washington State and Washingtonians. Given the pace of progress all around us and the unique role we play in the innovation economy, Governor Ferguson and our legislators must be equally agile with deft and delicate policies over these next weeks of the 2025 legislative session.\n\nAs in years past, Microsoft\u2019s 2025 legislative agenda aligns closely with the priorities of Washingtonians. As a homegrown global company, we have an eye on these global shifts of change and opportunity. And in these global shifts of change and opportunity, the priority of policymakers in Olympia must be on maintaining and expanding economic vitality, addressing the crisis of affordable housing, supporting high-quality education, and improving public safety and quality of life for all of Washington.\n\nPeople-centered outcomes with policies that genuinely increase housing supply\n\nWashington and Oregon have the tightest housing markets in the United States and in Washington we need housing of every kind. There is wide agreement that Washington needs to add one million new housing units over the next 20 years to meet the needs of state residents, thereby making housing more affordable.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft announced a historic investment of $750 million to support the creation and\n\npreservation of affordable housing. This initiative aimed to help low- and middle-income workers, such as nurses, teachers, and police officers, who are increasingly unable to afford housing near their workplaces. Our investment contributed and preserved 12,000 units of housing for our neighbors in the Puget Sound region. What we learned through our financial investment, however, is that funding is not enough. We must increase the supply of land and do more to incentivize housing development.\n\nAs we have for the past decade, Microsoft supports policies that make it easier, faster, and less expensive to increase housing production. We need to unlock more land for housing, increase financing, and enable efficient and effective government permitting, including the use of new technology to speed up permit review. This includes reforms and incentives that enable more housing in areas with abundant employment and transportation modes, leveraging public investments in transit to provide affordable living options for people across various income levels, enabling them to build their lives closer to their jobs, schools, parks, and other neighborhood amenities.\n\nAmong the novel and promising ideas being advanced this session is to promote and unlock residential uses in commercial zones, especially in close proximity to frequent and reliable transit. The rise of online shopping has led to an increase in empty big box stores and underutilized strip malls surrounded by empty parking lots. Policymakers should prioritize rezoning underutilized commercial spaces along existing transit hubs to create vibrant new communities. Freeing up larger tracts of underutilized land will help housing developers overcome the first hurdle to building multi-family apartments, townhomes, and condos.\n\nFor the 2025 legislative session, the legislature must continue to take big swings at policy so that Washington State has housing for all.\n\nAccess to all types of education for all Washingtonians\n\nIn April, Microsoft will celebrate 50 years in business. In the decades after Microsoft was founded, Washington state shifted to a knowledge and innovation economy. Now, we are participating in the shift to an AI economy. And to meet the needs of this moment, we need an interactive jungle gym of skilling and credentialing opportunities for all Washingtonians so we can move both upward and across career paths to follow the job opportunities that hold the most promise now and as job opportunities evolve.\n\nWashington businesses are creating great jobs, but many people lack the necessary skills or credentials to attain them. We need our state to prioritize policies that address the skills gap limiting employment options for too many people. As a leader in global technology, Washington is also a leader in future technologies like AI, clean energy, and quantum computing, which will create a new wave of meaningful family-wage jobs. Washingtonians must be prepared with the right skills to participate in the economy now and in the economy of the future.\n\nMicrosoft also supports policies that enhance K-12 student achievement, foster career awareness in middle school, and encourage more students to pursue post-secondary credentials. Offering all Washington kids these opportunities has long been a priority for Microsoft. This year, lawmakers are advancing policies that create seamless pathways into higher education through guaranteed enrollment and generous eligibility for the Washington College Grant program. We are excited about the work being done in these areas.\n\nWe also encourage the state to establish more apprenticeships in high-demand fields and expand higher education programs to produce enough qualified applicants to match available jobs.\n\nThese are the policies that create a jungle gym of opportunity.\n\nCommitting to our statewide transportation plan\n\nOur transportation system is the lifeblood of our state, and our state legislature has done extraordinary work in recent years. We have many important projects underway across the state. People rely on our roads, highways, rail, and ferries to travel to work, school, obtain healthcare, and find recreation. Employers also depend on reliable transportation to move parts and products around the state and beyond. We applaud the work that has been done to keep Washington moving.\n\nThis biennium, the priority is to ensure that projects currently underway are completed on time, provide sufficient maintenance funding for existing facilities, and continue to make necessary investments in transformative regional projects, including ultra high-speed rail in the Cascadia corridor.\n\nCascadia at the forefront of the digital economy and looking to the future\n\nWashington state serves as one of the world\u2019s leading centers for the development of artificial intelligence technology. Advances in artificial intelligence are enhancing customer service interactions, transaction processing, and workflow efficiency across various sectors. Microsoft sees extraordinary opportunities for our state government to leverage local AI expertise to maximize public resources. We look forward to participating in these crucial conversations, which are more important than ever this year.\n\nAs we look to the future, we are optimistic. Microsoft\u2019s long-standing partnership with the state of Washington has been part of the success of our state. As we celebrate our 50th anniversary, we are as committed as we have ever been to collaborating with lawmakers to secure our state\u2019s vibrant future. We look forward to working together to meet the challenges and opportunities of the next 50 years.\n\nWe see this as a unique opportunity to partner with Governor Ferguson and the legislature to advance Washington State using technology and innovation, increasing individual productivity capacity, and expanding access to government services for Washingtonians.\n\nState budgets that are sustainable and prioritized\n\nThe most important policy bills the legislature will pass, however, will be the budget bills. More than anything, this bill will reflect the state\u2019s priorities now and for the next two years. Budgets are where Washington\u2019s tax dollars are put to work. Over the years, Microsoft has supported targeted tax increases for important programs and services. We have supported and defended nearly every transportation package in recent history. We supported the creation of the Workforce Education Investment Act to expand higher education opportunities for all Washingtonians. We have also provided millions in matching funds to help accelerate affordable housing. And just last year we helped lead the business community in defending the Climate Commitment Act.\n\nThis year, legislators are facing grim budget news\u2014a budget deficit ranging from $10 to16 billion, depending on who you ask and how you do the math. Importantly, Washington State is not in a recession. This deficit is not due to an economic downturn that caused a decline in revenues. In fact, most revenues are still marginally increasing or flat. Very simply, our policymakers in Olympia have passed budgets that went beyond our means.\n\nWe believe this challenge affords an opportunity to reexamine recent spending and Washington State\u2019s priorities of government.\n\nWe join others in Washington in asking straightforward questions about the outcomes Washingtonians are gaining from past and current state investments. Ultimately, the state budget is the state\u2019s most important investment opportunity for improving economic competitiveness and encouraging private sector job growth.\n\nWe stand ready\n\nThis year, we stand ready to work with Governor Ferguson and the Legislature to find solutions to all these challenges.\n\nThe 2025 legislative session is a pivotal moment for our state. With the can-do spirit Washington has always been known for, we are optimistic our legislature and Governor Ferguson will collaborate and find creative solutions to our most pressing challenges. Like so many others across the state, we at Microsoft are eager to be partners.\n\nTogether, we can create a brighter, more equitable future for Washington State.\n\nTags: affordable housing, Education and Jobs, transportation, Washington state",

            "content": "The start of the year has already seen a flurry of layoff announcements in the tech sector, and analysts say this may be just the beginning.\n\nMeta, Microsoft and Workday are among over 50 tech companies that have announced staff reductions so far this year, impacting a total of more than 13,000 workers, according to a tally by layoffs.fyi.\n\n\u201cI anticipate that we\u2019ll continue seeing job cuts in tech \u2014 unlikely at the levels that we saw in 2023 or last year, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite through with it,\u201d Andy Challenger, a senior vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, said in an interview.\n\nSixty-two percent of tech CFOs say their organization is planning a layoff this year as the industry focuses on the goal of sustaining profitable growth, according to survey results unveiled Tuesday by Chicago, Illinois-based accounting, tax and advisory firm BDO.\n\nMix of job cuts, hiring on tap\n\nDespite the planned job cuts, all respondents said their organizations will probably expand headcount this year.\n\nCompanies are shrinking some teams for the sake of efficiency, \u201cwhile putting those dollars and resources that are saved into other areas,\u201d Hank Galligan, BDO\u2019s national technology industry leader, said in an interview.\n\nIT topped the list of areas where tech firms are looking to hire more staff, according to the study. Finance ranked in second place. Tech CFOs are \u201cfocused on profitable growth, so having a good measure of profitability and being able to measure that continually is important,\u201d Galligan said.\n\nTech sector headcounts ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic amid heightened demand for IT products and services. After massive layoffs in the last few years, the sector continues to lean on job cuts to boost efficiency and free up capital for purposes such as investing in artificial intelligence, according to a September report from New York-based consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\n\u201cThese [AI] investments come at the expense of other strategic initiatives at a time when tech companies are already navigating a high-interest-rate environment, ongoing efforts to course-correct overhiring during the pandemic, and a deceleration in the market growth rate,\u201d the report said. \u201cFreeing up capital for AI and other growth initiatives will first mean trimming excess costs where feasible across the business.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, enterprise software giant Workday announced plans to eliminate about 1,750 positions, or 8.5% of its workforce. The move is part of a restructuring plan intended to prioritize the company\u2019s investments while advancing an \u201congoing focus on durable growth,\u201d according to a securities filing.\n\n\u2018Difficult, but necessary, decision\u2019\n\nIn a memo to staff that was included in the filing, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach called the layoff a \u201cdifficult, but necessary, decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompanies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis creates a massive opportunity for us, but we need to make some changes to better align our resources with our customers' evolving needs.\u201d\n\nWorkday said it expects to continue to hire in \u201ckey strategic areas and locations\u201d throughout its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2026.\n\nIn mid-January, Meta employees were informed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the company\u2019s plan to cut about 5% of its workforce, with a focus on the lowest-performing staffers, according to a Bloomberg report. Zuckerberg made the announcement in an internal memo, saying that 2025 will \u201cbe an intense year\u201d for the company, the report said.\n\nMeanwhile, Business Insider reported in early January that Microsoft was planning an unspecified number of job cuts and was taking a \u201charder look\u201d at under-performing employees as part of the effort.\n\nOther major tech companies that have announced layoffs since the start of the year include Salesforce and Amazon.\n\nStaff \u2018right-sizing\u2019 versus \u2018remixing\u2019\n\nWhile the industry has seen rampant job cuts in recent years, the trend appears to be easing up. Last year, tech companies announced a total of 152,104 layoffs, compared with more than 260,000 in 2023, according to layoffs.fyi. And about 2,400 layoffs were announced by the sector during the first month of this year compared with over 34,000 during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe slowdown may reflect a shift away from tech layoffs driven primarily by the need to \u201cright-size\u201d bloated staffs, analysts said. \u201cNow what you\u2019re seeing is more remixing, based on, let\u2019s say, the efficiency you might gain through investing in AI or some other technology,\u201d Galligan said.\n\nIn the coming year, layoffs aren\u2019t likely to return to peak levels absent a larger economic downturn, according to Challenger.\n\n\u201cIt really was such a unique phenomenon following Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies hired so many workers that they ended up not needing, so they had to make these huge reductions.\u201d",

Thanks to a few name changes, what\u2019s old sounds new and what\u2019s new sounds old. If you haven\u2019t kept up with the updates, it may not be clear which one you want \u2014 or if you actually prefer to run both.\n\nTo help you decide, I\u2019ve broken down what each app does. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nWhat is Windows Security?\n\nPCWorld\n\nPreviously known as Windows Defender, Windows Security is the most current name for the app that ties Microsoft\u2019s basic antivirus and network protections together. Similar to third-party antivirus software, you get a unified interface to make changes to the app and access manual scans. Separate tabs break out various settings:\n\nVirus & threat protection: From this tab, you can run manual scans (Quick, Full, Custom, or Offline), change how your system screens for threats, and set up more stringent ransomware defenses.\n\nFrom this tab, you can run manual scans (Quick, Full, Custom, or Offline), change how your system screens for threats, and set up more stringent ransomware defenses.

Family options: Filter viewable content for users on the PC, as well as see breakdowns of device usage. You can manage your family group through the web portal.\n\nClick on the arrows (desktop) or swipe (mobile) to see each tab in the Windows Security app.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Defender?\n\nPCWorld\n\nConfusingly, the Microsoft Defender app shares its name with the antivirus engine powering Windows Security\u2019s malware protection \u2014 but they\u2019re not directly tied. Instead, the Defender app offers additional defenses against online threats for Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscribers. It works equally with either Windows Security (including the Microsoft Defender Antivirus engine) or third-party antivirus software.\n\nIdentity theft monitoring: Through a partnership with Experian, Microsoft Defender will alert you to data breaches and any fraudulent activity on your credit reports. The service also provides up to $1 million in restoration costs and $100,000 in lost funds if you are a victim of identity theft.\n\nThrough a partnership with Experian, Microsoft Defender will alert you to data breaches and any fraudulent activity on your credit reports. The service also provides up to $1 million in restoration costs and $100,000 in lost funds if you are a victim of identity theft. Device protection: You can watch to see if your devices (up to four) or those linked through your Microsoft Family Group have any suspicious activity occurring and be notified through this app. Notifications will be sent through Windows\u2019 notification system and you can also view them through the Defender app.\n\nPreviously, the Defender app also offered an encrypted VPN feature called Privacy Protection, which provided up to 50GB of data per month, detected unsecure Wi-Fi connections, and supported multiple platforms. However, in February 2025, Microsoft ended support for Privacy Protection and removed it from the Windows app.\n\nClick on the arrows (desktop) or swipe (mobile) to see the different sections of the Microsoft Defender app.\n\nWindows Security vs. Microsoft Defender\n\nWindows Security and Microsoft Defender are complimentary apps rather than competing.\n\nWindows Security defends against online threats, including ransomware, and it\u2019s included for free with a Windows license. (Heads-up: If you ever see a popup notification telling you to call a phone number or pay to renew, you\u2019ve either visited a compromised website or your PC has been directly compromised \u2014 time to run an antivirus scan ASAP.)\n\nMicrosoft Defender then rounds out those protections by letting you shield your online activity from other users on the same network, keeping you informed of data leaks and credit fraud, and monitoring your devices for vulnerabilities.\n\nShould you use Microsoft Defender?\n\nWindows Security and Microsoft Defender paired together can rival basic third-party antivirus suite subscriptions. Alaina Yee / Foundry\n\nIf you\u2019re already a Microsoft 365 subscriber, having both Windows Security and Microsoft Defender set up and active is comparable to a very simple third-party antivirus suite subscription \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to pay extra.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re not yet a paid Microsoft 365 user, want additional integrated features (like a password manager), or prefer a different interface, independent antivirus software will be a better fit for your needs.

            "content": "Researchers from Microsoft have detected cyberattacks being launched by a group, called Storm-2372, which it assesses with medium confidence aligns with Russia\u2019s interests and tradecraft. The attacks appear to have been ongoing since August last year and primarily targeted governments, NGOs, information technology (IT) services and technology, defense, telecommunications, health, higher education, and energy/oil and gas in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nThe researchers have observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow. \u201cUsing this client ID enables Storm-2372 to receive a refresh token that can be used to request another token for the device registration service, and then register an actor-controlled device within Entra ID. With the same refresh token and the new device identity, Storm-2372 is able to obtain a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and access an organization\u2019s resources. We have observed Storm-2372 using the connected device to collect emails,\u201d they added.\n\nMoreover, the hacker has also been observed to use proxies that are regionally appropriate for the targets, likely in an attempt to further conceal the suspicious sign-in activity.\n\nMicrosoft also detailed that in device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow to capture authentication tokens, which they then use to access target accounts, and further gain access to data and other services that the compromised account has access to. This technique could enable persistent access as long as the tokens remain valid, making this attack technique attractive to threat actors.\n\nA device code authentication flow is a numeric or alphanumeric code used to authenticate an account from an input-constrained device that cannot perform an interactive authentication using a web flow and thus must perform this authentication on another device to sign in. In device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow.\n\nDuring the attack, the threat actor generates a legitimate device code request and tricks the target into entering it into a legitimate sign-in page. This grants the actor access and enables them to capture the authentication\u2014access and refresh\u2014tokens that are generated, then use those tokens to access the target\u2019s accounts and data. The actor can also use these phished authentication tokens to gain access to other services where the user has permission, such as email or cloud storage, without needing a password. The threat actor continues to have access so long as the tokens remain valid. The attacker can then use the valid access token to move laterally within the environment.\n\n\u201cStorm-2372\u2019s device code phishing campaign has been active since August 2024,\u201d Microsoft disclosed. \u201cObserved early activity indicates that Storm-2372 likely targeted potential victims using third-party messaging services including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams, falsely posing as a prominent person relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending subsequent invitations to online events or meetings via phishing emails.\u201d\n\nThe post also noted that the invitations lure the user into completing a device code authentication request emulating the experience of the messaging service, which provides Storm-2372 initial access to victim accounts and enables Graph API data collection activities, such as email harvesting. \u201cOn the device code authentication page, the user is tricked into entering the code that the threat actor included as the ID for the fake Teams meeting invitation.\u201d\n\nOnce the victim uses the device code to authenticate, the threat actor receives the valid access token. The threat actor then uses this valid session to move laterally within the newly compromised network by sending additional phishing messages containing links for device code authentication to other users through intra-organizational emails originating from the victim\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Microsoft observed Storm-2372 using Microsoft Graph to search through messages of the account they\u2019ve compromised,\u201d teh researchers pointed out. \u201cThe threat actor was using keyword searching to view messages containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov. Microsoft then observed email exfiltration via Microsoft Graph of the emails found from these searches.\u201d\n\nWith Microsoft identifying Storm-2372 as a suspected nation-state actor aligned with Russian interests, the researchers expect Storm-2372 to likely initially approach targets through third-party messaging services, posing as a prominent individual relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending invites to online events or meetings. These invites lure the user into device code authentication that grants initial access to Storm-2372 and enables Graph API data collection activities such as email harvesting.\n\nMicrosoft calls upon organizations to improve organizational defenses against phishing and other credential theft attacks by requiring multifactor authentication (MFA). While certain attacks such as device code phishing attempt to evade MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats. They must also leverage phishing-resistant authentication methods and avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking.\n\nOrganizations can also centralize their identity management into a single platform. If the organization is a hybrid environment, integrate your on-premises directories with your cloud directories. If your organization is using a third party for identity management, ensure this data is being logged in a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or connected to Microsoft Entra to fully monitor for malicious identity access from a centralized location.\n\nAdded benefits to centralizing identity data are to facilitate the implementation of Single Sign On (SSO) and provide users with a more seamless authentication process, as well as configure Entra ID\u2019s machine learning models to operate on identity data, thus learning the difference between legitimate access and malicious access quicker and easier. It is recommended to synchronize user accounts except for administrative and high-privileged ones when doing this to maintain a boundary between the on-premises environment and the cloud environment, in case of a breach.\n\nThey must also secure accounts with credential hygiene: practice the principle of least privilege and audit privileged account activity to slow and stop attackers.",

            "content": "This morning, I stood in Warsaw with Poland\u2019s Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, and announced Microsoft\u2019s latest cloud and AI infrastructure investment in Europe. Building on our initial billion-dollar investment to launch a Polish cloud region in 2023, I announced that Microsoft will spend another $700 million by the middle of next year to expand our computing capacity in the country. And we will deepen our work with Polish National Defense to strengthen Poland\u2019s cybersecurity, including by working together on the development of AI competencies and emerging digital technologies, including new AI and quantum breakthroughs.\n\nThis marks the latest critical step for Microsoft\u2019s business, economic, and political relationships in Poland \u2013 and in Europe as a whole.\n\nDuring the past 16 months, we have announced more than $20 billion in AI and cloud infrastructure investments that represent an important part of our datacenter expansion across 15 European countries. Today\u2019s investment in Poland builds on the integrated supply chain we are building with manufacturers across the EU. It calls on suppliers that are manufacturing critical components not only in Poland but in Italy, France, Germany, Finland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It also includes components manufactured and exported from Indiana in the United States. It\u2019s the type of investment that creates jobs and fosters economic growth throughout Europe and across the Atlantic.\n\nPromoting Trans-Atlantic Investment, Trade, and Economic Growth\n\nThe American technology sector is creating world-leading AI technology and is focused on being a trusted \u201cpartner of choice\u201d around the world. And European policy leaders are focused on mobilizing more capital and increasing productivity by \u201cclosing the innovation gap.\u201d Even in a time of fragmenting geopolitics, today\u2019s announcement illustrates that these two technology ambitions are more aligned than divergent.\n\nIn multiple ways, our investment in Poland puts both these goals into practice. It demonstrates how vastly the technology sector has changed since I first joined Microsoft as an employee in Paris more than 31 years ago. While we develop and provide world-leading technology products and services globally, we now support these with enormous national investments in infrastructure and large numbers of local employees. More than ever, technology requires coordinated investments that connect countries and span oceans.\n\nSustained Technology Support During a Decade of Crises\n\nEqually important, technology has become a lynchpin for national needs in times of crisis. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has aptly put recent history in perspective. As she highlighted, Europe faces a competitiveness challenge that comes as the third crisis of the 2020s, after the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s worth reflecting on the critical role of technology in helping to support the responses needed for each of these crises.\n\nFive years ago this month, the first pandemic in a century literally started to shut doors around the world. At Microsoft, our employees and partners used new video and productivity technology like Teams to keep the economy moving forward in every corner of Europe. In just days, businesses, schools, universities, hospitals, and governments sustain their operations by moving online.\n\nTwo years later, the Russian military invaded Ukraine. At Microsoft, we helped move Ukraine\u2019s critical data and technology services to our datacenters across Europe, ensuring their continued operation outside the range of cruise missile and air attacks. And like several other technology companies, we immediately helped Ukraine\u2019s officials and citizens defend their nation from Russian cyberattacks. As a company, we provided more than $250 million of free technology and financial assistance. And we have sustained this substantial support to this day.\n\nAs Europe now launches a new \u201ccompetitiveness compass,\u201d technology will again play an indispensable role. Especially as working-age populations shrink and aging populations expand, economic growth and prosperity will depend more than ever on new technology. Productivity growth will require it. And the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s many great industries and companies, large and small, will depend on their ability to hone their ongoing leadership in critical scientific domains and put their data to work. Across the continent, European institutions will need to harness the power of AI and the cloud.\n\nA Strong Foundation for Europe\u2019s AI Transition\n\nAI is rapidly becoming what economists call a General Purpose Technology, or GPT. In contrast to single-purpose technologies, GPTs boost innovation and productivity across the entire economy. Throughout history, transformative GPTs like ironworking, electricity, machine tooling, computer chips, and software have not only driven economic growth but sparked new discoveries and inventions, changing the way we live and work.\n\nThe good news is that the foundation for Europe\u2019s AI transition is already being laid. Industry leaders are investing tens of billions to construct state-of-the-art infrastructure to help Europe access, adopt, and innovate on the world\u2019s most advanced cloud and AI technology. And companies like Microsoft are developing and offering innovative AI tools and vital services that are ready for use by every sector of every European economy.\n\nAs a company, we are developing and operating our AI infrastructure and platform services with a constant focus on Europe\u2019s needs. This is one reason we announced our AI Access Principles in Barcelona a year ago. These eleven principles govern our operations and are designed to ensure that Microsoft\u2019s AI infrastructure is accessible, open, and available on fair terms to the entire European economy.\n\nAs we\u2019ve put these principles into practice, we\u2019ve recognized the vital role of open-source software and AI models for European researchers, start-ups, businesses, and governments. We\u2019ve launched the Azure AI Foundry, a platform designed to help developers build, run, and optimize AI-driven applications. The Foundry supports flexible choices and now supports more than 1,800 AI models, from OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini to open-source models like Llama, Mistral, and others, all giving Europe the tools it needs to stay competitive in the fast-moving AI landscape. European developers can then use our Models as a Service offering to distribute their products instantly to our datacenters around the world, so customers can call on them for AI-powered applications.\n\nWe also recognize that technology innovation requires investments in people. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in our AI Skilling Initiative across Europe. We\u2019re partnering with government, education, industry, and civil society to help bring AI skills to users, developers, and organizational leaders. Through our strategic partnerships, we have already helped to skill 2.9 million Europeans and are on track to engage 8 million people by the end of the year.\n\nTechnology Collaboration Built on Interdependence\n\nWe readily recognize that European leaders sometimes worry about becoming overly dependent on American technology. We appreciate that such questions are both natural and legitimate. We take them seriously and work hard to address them, including by understanding European values, supporting European needs, and adapting to European rules.\n\nAlong the way, we often point to a second technology dimension that too easily is overlooked. The reality is that this dependence runs both ways.\n\nAs a company, we\u2019re pouring tens of billions of dollars of investment into acquiring land, constructing massive buildings, bringing additional electricity to the grid, and installing the world\u2019s most advanced computing, networking, liquid cooling, and other technology.\n\nThese datacenters are not built on wheels.\n\nOnce constructed, these billions of dollars in infrastructure are permanent and subject to local laws, regulations, and governments. Time inevitably brings changes. It\u2019s imperative as a company that we constantly remain focused on earning and sustaining our \u201clicense to operate\u201d within each country. With datacenters, this starts with each local community and runs up to officials with EU-wide responsibilities. Our economic dependence on Europe runs deep.\n\nAs Microsoft celebrates its 50th birthday less than two months from now, we look back at more than four decades of European presence and support. As a company, we\u2019ve seen many things change. And we ourselves have changed. We\u2019ve put down deep roots, with employees and families in communities and countries across the continent.\n\nBut even amid constant change, one thing has been constant. Our support for Europe has been not only steady but steadfast.",

I get that renaming a cloud-based file can't be as instantaneous as doing the same for anything on a local SSD, but sometimes the delay between clicking 'rename' and actually being able to do it can run into seconds.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you may feel that the real problem is that I'm using OneDrive and I'll readily agree with anyone who feels that it's not the best cloud service out there. However, I use it all the time for doing game benchmarking across multiple PCs, because I have the testing software configured so that the results file is saved in my OneDrive. I can then access those on my main PC, while the others are still working away.\n\nOpening such files is fine but doing anything context menu stuff (e.g. copying, renaming, cloning) is pretty tiresome because of the lag. If this fix really does solve that problem, I will be one happy person. What puzzles me, though, is why on Earth it has taken Microsoft so long to create and release a solution. I can only assume that it didn't consider the bug to be a high enough priority and let's face it, Windows 11 surely has far more pressing issues than require fixing.\n\nEither that or the solution involved changes on its Azure servers, and given how expensive they are, any alterations to what they're doing or what hardware is being used are potentially very costly. What might seem like a minor fix at the user end of things could well involve a whole host of major tweaks on the server side.\n\nAnyway, I just want the fix to be publicly rolled out as soon as possible. Even if it only slightly improves the situation, it'll make my working life a whole lot nicer. Until the next Windows 11 bug grinds my gears.",

            "content": "Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers are doubling down on their AI infrastructure spending this year.\n\nThe stock market appears to be in the middle of quite the storm as of late. In the final days of January, a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek sent shock waves around the world after it released an artificial intelligence (AI) model similar to ChatGPT -- and claims to have trained its AI with legacy architectures that aren't widely leveraged by U.S. developers.\n\nWhile technology stocks in general have been more volatile since DeepSeek's arrival, none has taken a hit as hard as Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%). Investors are panicking that Nvidia's newer chipware may not be as much of a necessity, given DeepSeek's claims.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's future prospects is disorienting, some of the company's biggest partners have been dropping clues as to how DeepSeek is influencing their own AI roadmaps. I'll analyze what these trends are and assess how they might impact Nvidia.\n\nExamining big tech's AI infrastructure plans\n\nNvidia makes its fortune primarily through its compute and networking business, which sells advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are integral for generative AI applications, and are primarily housed in large data centers.\n\nWhile DeepSeek claims to have built its AI using Nvidia's old H800 GPUs, it's been difficult to verify how accurate that is. Nevertheless, all of Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers have reported earnings for the full calendar year 2024, and there is a common thread stitching their broader AI fabric together.\n\nMicrosoft kicked things off by announcing the company will be spending $80 billion this year on data centers and other AI infrastructure projects. Meta Platforms followed up with its own aggressive spending plans -- hinting that the company could see capital expenditures (capex) up to $65 billion this year. Lastly, Alphabet and Amazon are projected to spend an estimated $180 billion combined on AI capex this year.\n\nOn the surface, big tech's rising capex plans this year should be seen as a positive thing for Nvidia. However, when Nvidia reports earnings on Feb. 26, there is one thing in particular I think investors need to be laser-focused on.\n\nWhat should investors be looking for when Nvidia reports earnings?\n\nInvestors should listen carefully to management's commentary as it relates to the spending from big tech I outlined. While Nvidia isn't going to capture all of this spend, investors should still be able to get a glimpse into how much capex the Magnificent Seven will be allocating toward Nvidia.\n\nIn my eyes, the best way to figure this out is to look at Nvidia's financial guidance. If the company's growth rates are accelerating, I'd say this is a good proxy that big tech will be spending heavily on Nvidia's newest chip architectures this year. But on the flip side, if Nvidia's guidance calls for a material deceleration in growth, it could be that its biggest customers are still buying from Nvidia, but doing so in a more protracted way.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy before Feb. 26?\n\nIt's rare that I encourage timing an investment. As long-term investors, buying stock on a specific day isn't the most important factor. Rather, it's more important to reassess your conviction in your holdings, and so long as you remain optimistic, using a strategy of dollar-cost averaging over the course of many years is generally a recipe for success.\n\nThis is a rare occasion where I think buying the dip in Nvidia prior to earnings could be a good formula.\n\nConsidering history suggests that Nvidia stock will indeed rise following its fourth-quarter earnings, combined with big tech's capex plans just for this year, and the share price recovery from the DeepSeek sell-off pictured, I'm cautiously optimistic that Nvidia stock is a lucrative opportunity right now.",

It has recently come to light that Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is canvassing potential investors for a roughly $10 billion funding round. This could value the company at an estimated $75 billion.\n\nAccording to media reports, existing investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Valor Equity Partners, are in discussions to participate in the transaction. However, the terms of the round aren\u2019t finalized yet and may change.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nAccording to data compiled by PitchBook, xAI was last valued at $51 billion. The startup was launched by Musk in 2023, a rival to OpenAI. xAI has recently revealed that Grok3, its AI chatbot, is in the final stages of development and will be released in a week or two.\n\n\u201cGrok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we\u2019ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that\u2019s been released, that we\u2019re aware of, so that\u2019s a good sign\u201d.\n\nWith the competition in the AI world heating up fast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has recently revealed its plans around GPT-5, and how the company is going to work on simplifying its offerings. He stated that he realizes how the company\u2019s models and product offerings are getting complicated, bringing a solution for user ease.\n\n\u201cWe hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence\u201d.\n\nCurrently, users are required to manually select various AI models for different tasks. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, internally known as Orion, will be the company\u2019s final \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d After its release, the company will unify o-series and GPT-series models.\n\nIt will do so by offering a system that can use all of its features and determine when to take more or less time to think. The GPT-5 model will be launched as a comprehensive AI system that will incorporate o3 along with other technologies.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

At the time, he took over a software giant whose Windows operating system had been eclipsed by the rise of the smartphone.\n\nHowever, it was Nadella's reduced emphasis on the once-critical Windows operating system that revived Microsoft stock. Thanks to his leadership, Microsoft again plays a relevant role in the tech industry, and this has benefited shareholders of the SaaS stock tremendously.\n\nThe growth of Microsoft stock\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft when Nadella became CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, those shares would now be worth just over $11,100. If you include dividends, that value rises to around $13,500.\n\nNadella's rise to the CEO position occurred as the company's stock fell during the 14-year tenure of Steve Ballmer. At that time, Microsoft suffered after the rise of the smartphone reduced the need for PCs, making the dominance of its Windows operating system less relevant.\n\nNadella had previously served as executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise Group. When he became CEO, Nadella capitalized on his successes with this business segment, emphasizing cloud computing and reducing the emphasis on operating systems by discontinuing the Windows Mobile OS. Those moves proved successful as its Azure cloud platform became the leading competitor to Amazon Web Services in the cloud computing industry.\n\nNadella has also made some notable acquisitions, including the business social media platform LinkedIn and gaming giant Activision Blizzard. Additionally, it acquired GitHub, which was recently responsible for the development of Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Copilot.\n\nAmid such developments, Microsoft succeeded to the point that it briefly regained its title as the world's largest publicly traded company measured by market cap. Even if it isn't necessarily holding its title as the world's largest company, its stock gains are unlikely to end anytime soon as it solidifies its leadership across multiple software segments.",

However, Microsoft also references this same list on its minimum system requirements for Windows 11 page (expanding the 'Processors/CPUs' section has a link to Microsoft's \"list of approved CPUs,\" which is the same list as referenced below.) We are following up with Microsoft for clarification but have added mention of the OEM systems below.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has published its latest Windows 11 processor support lists for new OEM systems. The latest version of the OS, Windows 11 version 24H2, now includes official support for some of the newest Intel chips such as Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200 parts. However, we are surprised to see that Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors are no longer officially supported on the list for new OEM systems. The decision may be related to Intel's move of 7th-10th Gen iGPUs to a legacy support model in December.\n\nThough Windows 11 24H2 has been pushed to consumers for several months already, Microsoft has just released the first official CPU support lists on its Hardware Developer site (the same as linked to the overall Windows 11 minimum requirements). When the first version of Windows 11 went official users were surprised to see many serviceable Intel CPUs, the 7th Gen Kaby Lake series and older, left unsupported. Now we appear to be seeing Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors meeting the same fate.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nCutting support for Intel processors launched as recently as 2020 (10th Gen Comet Lake), seems rather drastic. The Core i9-10900K with 10C/20T and a boost as high as 5.3 GHz seems far too virile to be put to pasture when a Celeron 6305 2C/2T Tiger Lake chip (also launched in 2020), for example, makes the Windows 11 version 24H2 official support list.\n\nMicrosoft doesn't explain its CPU support decisions on the linked page. All it really says is that, going forward, \"subsequently released and future generations of processors which meet the same principles will be considered as supported, even if not explicitly listed.\" Moreover, it doesn't mention the dropping of support for Intel's 8th 9th, and 10th Gen processors in the preamble to the Windows 11 version 24H2 list.\n\nIntel found holding the smoking gun?\n\nThe absence of explanation might give some hope that all the Intel 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors missing from the support list could be some kind of clerical error. However, the dropping of support of these particular Intel CPUs tallies with Intel's moving of \"7th - 10th Gen Intel Processor Graphics and related Intel Atom, Pentium, and Celeron processor graphics to a legacy software support model.\" Intel announced this change quite recently, in December 2024.\n\nIf this is the reason for omitting these chips from the CPU support list, we have to wonder whether an 8th Gen chip, for example, with a modern discrete GPU will sail past any 'unsupported hardware' OS upgrade barriers.\n\nWindows 11 version 24H2 supported AMD processors\n\nMeanwhile, folk rocking PC systems running AMD processors will see that Ryzen 8000 chips have been added to the official Windows 11 support list (for 24H2) for the first time. We noticed that some mobile chips were misnamed, like the Ryzen 7 Pro 8945HS, which should be the Ryzen 9 Pro 8945HS. Also, the non-Pro SKU seems to be missing from the list, but these are likely oversights.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

There are no signs of any Ryzen 9000 CPUs, nor popular chips like the Ryzen AI 9 370 HX on the new list. Remember though, Microsoft says that new and upcoming processors built upon previous chips \"will be considered as supported, even if not explicitly listed.\"\n\nLastly, Microsoft's processor support axe has been known to sway, and even systems using CPUs outside of the official support lists can and do get Windows updates.",

Although Windows 11 has been available as a free upgrade for some time, many people continue to use Windows 10 \u2013 partly out of conviction, partly because of the high system requirements of Windows 11. Now there is another change that some people will not like. Microsoft has announced that support for 8th, 9th and 10th generation Intel processors will be discontinued for Windows 11 version 24H2. This means that these processor series will no longer play a role for many manufacturers.\n\nIt is important to note that this change only affects new OEM devices. These are new devices with pre-installed Windows, which will no longer be delivered with processors from the previously mentioned generations and Windows 11 version 24H2. However, anyone who already owns a PC or laptop with a processor from the 8th, 9th or 10th generation can continue to use Windows 11 and receive updates. Even if the impression might arise that these CPUs can no longer run Windows 11, this is not the case. While it is possible that these processors will continue to run Windows 11, future updates may be limited. Why Microsoft is taking this step has not been explained in detail.\n\nWindows 11 requires TPM 2.0 in order to be able to perform an upgrade. The affected Intel generations have this TPM 2.0 chip and therefore fulfill the basic requirements. A TPM (or Trusted Platform Module) is a permanently integrated security technology in the form of a microcontroller. This TPM chip is installed either in the mainboard or in the processor of a computer. Important and sensitive data is secured and stored using cryptography in order to guarantee the authentication of the platform.\n\nNevertheless, Microsoft has further increased the requirements so that only devices with Intel processors from the 12th generation onwards are eligible for new OEM devices with Windows 11. If you look at the release date of the 10th generation, for example, there is a lot of confusion. After all, this processor series was only released between 2019 and 2020, which is not too far off.

            "content": "Update 1: The article has been updated since the list of supported CPUs mentioned is only for OEMs.\n\nUpdate 2: Microsoft confirmed that the requirements for running Window 11 24H2 haven't changed, which means OEMs utilizing 8th, 9th, and 10th gen CPUs will still get Windows updates in the future as usual. (via Windows Latest)\n\nWindows Latest reports that Microsoft has stated that it only recommends OEMs to use 12th gen and newer chips, but doesn't prohibit using 8th, 9th, and 10th gen processors and won't block support for them.\n\nThe following content is based on information prior to the above updates.\n\nWindows 11 24H2 Will No Longer Support Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen Core Processors on OEM Systems From Now On, Recommends Newer Chips\n\nMicrosoft has officially dropped the support for several generations of Intel processors on Windows 11's latest version, 24H2. This is regarding only OEMs and not users, which means newer OEM machines after Microsoft's mandate with any of these processors won't receive a Windows 11 24H2 update, which may make things difficult for OEMs. However, users who already own these chips can still get the latest Windows 11 updates.\n\nIn a recent announcement by Microsoft, it excluded all of Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th gen processor-based OEM systems from the Windows 11 version 24H2 support list. It's bizarre, since Intel's 8th, 9th, and 10th gen CPUs do support TPM 2.0, which is a hardware-based security feature required for Windows 11. Still, Microsoft has suddenly decided that they will only support Intel's 12th gen and recent processors.\n\nThis update doesn't mean that anyone running one of these CPUs won't be able to run Windows 11 on their OEM systems or their system won't be able to apply newer updates and patches, but it means that they may no longer receive the latest Windows updates if they purchase an OEM PC with those chips from now on, since OEMs won't be able to provide them with the Windows 11 24H2 version. It's still shocking to see such an update since the 10th gen was released in the 2019-2020 time frame and qualifies for running Windows 11.\n\nMicrosoft says that it will only support processors that meet the 'design principles' of security and reliability to run the latest version of Windows 11. At the same time, it has added various new processor models from Intel and AMD to the list. Windows 11 24H2 will be supported on AMD's 8000 processors (desktop and Pro mobile series), and here are the compatible models:\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 8500G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 8500GE\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 8600G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8540U\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8700G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8600G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8600GE\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8500G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8640HS\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8640U\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 PRO 8645HS\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8840HS\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8840U\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8845HS\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8945HS\n\nThat said, anyone who buys an OEM system should consider getting at least a 12th gen Core processor or higher.\n\nNews Source: Microsoft",

            "content": "Apple Business Model vs. Microsoft Business Model: An Overview\n\nMore than any other American companies, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dominate the intersection of technology and consumer access. Even though they compete across a huge range of sub-industries, such as computing software, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, advertising, applications, and web browsing, each firm primarily targets different markets.\n\nOn Feb. 15, 2025, AAPL had a market cap of around $3.6 trillion. Microsoft lagged behind it at $3.04 trillion.\n\nKey Takeaways As of 2025, Apple and Microsoft are two of the biggest companies in the world, alternating the title of the world's most valuable company.\n\nBoth companies have market caps of over $3 trillion.\n\nApple's business model targets small and medium sized businesses, and consumers with devices targeted toward them. They are able to keep their base due to easy-to-use designs and data migration to new product lines.\n\nMicrosoft is an innovative leader in cloud computing, professional and business solutions, with a lower focus on personal computing than it used to have.\n\nThe Apple Business Model\n\nIt is difficult to recall a modern American business so thoroughly dominated by the ideas and personality of one individual as Apple was under Steve Jobs. Jobs' remarkable innovations propelled Apple to unprecedented heights until his passing in 2011.\n\nDuring Steve Jobs' second reign\u2014he was fired in 1985 and returned in 1997\u2014Apple returned to relevancy and revolutionized multiple subindustries. In 2001, the company released the iPod, a pocket-sized device that could hold 1,000 songs, which soon took over the Sony Walkman. In 2007, Apple completely redefined mobile phones when the iPhone was released.\n\nApple easily bests its competitors in terms of hardware sales and high-end gadgets. Thanks to the company's early 2000s reputation as a nonconformist response to Microsoft, millennials grew up using Macs in large numbers. This is buoyed by the company's brilliant insistence on integrating its products, making it easier to keep using new Apple products and thus more difficult to switch to a competitor's interface; this is sometimes referred to as the \"Apple Ecosystem Lock.\"\n\nThe weakness in the Apple's business model lies in the historic success of the company's golden invention: the iPhone. Nearly half of all Apple revenue comes from iPhone sales, and no comparable innovation has taken off since its former CEO died.\n\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook continued driving improvements and innovations to existing products and services. In 2023, new iOS 18, MacBook Pro and Air Models, iPad Air and Pro models, the iPhone 16 variants, the Apple Watch series, and AirPods 4 were all launched.\n\nThe iPhone remained Apple's key revenue generator in 2024, with sales of $201.18 billion out of $391.04 billion over the year (51%). Apple's services generated $96.2 billion in sales.\n\nThe Microsoft Business Model\n\nFor years, Microsoft dominated the computer industry with its Windows software; Apple was an afterthought for more than a generation of operating products. Before Google Web browsing began to dominate the market, Microsoft gave away Internet Explorer for free, driving Netscape and other similar companies out of business.\n\nThe Microsoft revenue model historically relied on just a few key strengths. The first, and most important, was the licensing fees charged for the use of the Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite.\n\nHowever, technological developments have made its operating system less of a revenue generator. Microsoft has moved its Office suite to an online subscription service to generate recurring revenue, acquired LinkedIn and its subscription and sales solutions, and developed cloud-based solutions for businesses and developers that generate recurring revenues. Its primary revenue generator was server products and cloud services, which generated $97.7 billion in FY 2024. This was followed by office products and cloud services, with $54.9 billion generated. Windows was third, generating $23.24 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has a popular gaming console and associated services that Apple does not\u2014the Xbox and its subscription services. Gaming and gaming services accounted for the fourth largest revenue stream for Microsoft in 2024, $21.5 billion.\n\nIs Microsoft Doing Better Than Apple? Each company has transitioned to focus on different products and services, so they each rank well. However, Apple generated more returns for investors as of February 2025 (33.23% year-over-year), while Microsoft lagged at 0.07%. Microsoft generated $245.12 billion in revenue in 2024, while Apple generated 391.04 billion. Microsoft earned $88.14 billion in net income to Apple's $93.74 billion. It seems Apple did slightly better (as far as finances go) than Microsoft in 2024.\n\nWhich Is Best, Microsoft or Apple? That depends on what you're evaluating. They each have different products and services and are very successful.\n\nWho Won the Apple vs. Microsoft Lawsuit? The copyright infringement lawsuit between Apple and Microsoft ended in 1992 in favor of Microsoft. Apple sued Microsoft for violating a copyright it held on certain elements of graphic user interfaces.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nApple and Microsoft are two tech giants that have dominated their industry for many years. Each began with similar business models but eventually went in different directions, with Microsoft catering more to productivity, business solutions, and cloud computing while keeping many of its consumer-facing products and services. Apple continues to market mostly to consumers and small- and mid-sized businesses.",

            "content": "Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) has quickly emerged as a leading player in the generative AI race through internal investments in its products and services and billions of dollars in investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nSome recent research from The Motley Fool analyzed Microsoft's earnings call to find some of the ways the company mentions how it will benefit from generative AI and what steps it's taking now to expand its artificial intelligence footprint. Here's how AI factors into the company's long-term growth plans.\n\nData center infrastructure spending\n\nOne important area that's at the top of nearly every major tech company's AI strategy is data center infrastructure spending.\n\nMicrosoft's management has mentioned infrastructure spending frequently. On the recent second-quarter earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, \"We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history.\"\n\nAnd Microsoft isn't even close to finishing up its data center infrastructure spending. The company recently said it's on track to spend $80 billion this year alone to build AI data centers and train AI models for its Azure cloud platform.\n\nRecent AI developments by Chinese start-up DeepSeek have raised the question of how much spending is necessary to build advanced AI, but so far, Microsoft and others are staying the course.\n\nBy building some of the most advanced data centers, Microsoft hopes to stay ahead of cloud infrastructure companies and offer its Azure cloud computing customers the most robust AI services and tools.\n\nPartnering with AI leaders\n\nAnother way Microsoft has talked about its generative AI opportunities is through its relationship and investment with OpenAI. Microsoft was an early investor in the ChatGPT creator and has already invested an estimated $13 billion into the company. One analyst even said it might be \"some of the best money ever spent.\"\n\nThe investment has given Microsoft access to some of the most advanced large language models (LLMs) through ChatGPT, which it's integrated into many of its services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, and Azure. The foundation of the company's AI Copilot comes from ChatGPT's technology, and it's likely to continue.\n\nNadella said recently that OpenAI had made a new large Azure commitment, adding: \"Through our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. And with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models.\"\n\nThe company's partnership that extends through 2030 states that OpenAI's API is exclusive to Azure, Microsoft has rights to OpenAI IP (for use in its Copilot service), and the two companies have revenue sharing agreements \"that flow both ways.\" One thing to note is that OpenAI can use other cloud providers for future AI training, but Microsoft has the right of first refusal.\n\nThe point here is that Microsoft and OpenAI are still very closely linked, and the two companies benefit from each other's success. Of course, that relationship could change down the line, but for now, it seems the two are still significantly intertwined.\n\nWhy this all matters\n\nMicrosoft is a key player in cloud computing, with the company taking 20% of the cloud market, behind Amazon's 31%. The good news for the company and shareholders is that artificial intelligence will likely supercharge cloud revenue, with Goldman Sachs estimating global cloud sales could reach $2 trillion by 2030 because of AI.\n\nMicrosoft is building its future around this, and so far it's been successful. The company's AI business now has $13 billion in annualized revenue -- a 175% increase year over year.\n\nThe AI wars are underway, and Microsoft made a strategic and seemingly prescient decision to tie itself to OpenAI early on. That's already helped the company boost its Azure sales and ensure its products have the latest AI models. That's not a guarantee of future success, of course, but it's certainly a great initial move as it plans for future artificial intelligence growth.",

            "content": "The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) is a powerful, well-engineered machine with a bright display and a lengthy lifespan. Its design is a little plain but it excels in every other department.\n\nWhy you can trust Live Science Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best ones for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nSpecifications CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite RAM: 32 GB LPDDR5x GPU: Qualcomm Adreno GPU Storage: 1 TB SSD Display: 15-inch PixelSense Flow Display Weight: 3.67 lbs (1.66 kg) Dimensions (in):12.96 x 9.14 x 0.72 (W x D x H) Dimensions (cm): 32.9 x 23.9 x 1.83 (W x D x H)\n\nIt's hard to avoid the artificial intelligence (AI) hype \u2014 and this is as true for software tools as it is for the newest laptops. Some of the latest machines have been designated as \"Copilot+ AI PCs\" \u2014 meaning they include the hardware to support on-device AI applications and workloads, as well as new applications. But to what extent is this just marketing buzz and how much does it materially improve the device?\n\nMicrosoft sees this shift as a pivotal moment for laptops and 2-in-1s, and the Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) is the perfect embodiment of that shift. It's a well-engineered and surprisingly reasonably priced machine that the company sees as a competitor to the MacBook Air. It also packs the latest Qualcomm-based hardware \u2014 as well as a neural processing unit (NPU) that claims to use AI to make performance as zippy as ever.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) review\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch): Design\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future)\n\nMicrosoft's latest laptop is extremely well-engineered, with the chassis made from recycled aluminum and rare earth metals for a high-quality feel. It also feels sturdy for a machine that's relatively lightweight for a 15-inch device \u2014 it weighs just 3.68 lbs (1.66 kg) \u2014 meaning it's a delight to use. You can choose the laptop in a light platinum finish, but we loved the moody black coating on our review model.\n\nSome may see the design as being a little too minimalist \u2014 but I felt the stripped-back look works a treat and rivals the look and feel we've come to expect from a MacBook Air in recent years. The biggest change comes in the touchpad, which is larger than that seen on the Surface Laptop 6th Edition, and offers great haptic feedback for a smooth response.\n\nRegardless, the expansive 3:2 display is its main attraction and its bezels are thinner than in the previous display, with the screen contained within four rounded corners. This is a design choice that might not gel with all users \u2014 as Windows 11 isn't necessarily configured to fit around the curved corners, you will lose pixels when applications encroach in these areas, but it looks incredibly stylish.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the device is more compact than its predecessor. It\u2019s lighter, too, but only slightly. It is a fraction of an inch thicker but is still thin enough to be considered a portable machine for something with a 15-inch display. That said, it's thicker, larger and slightly heavier than the MacBook Air 15-inch (M3).\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch): Display\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future)\n\nThe 15-inch LCD panel fitted into the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition is impressive and offers a great amount of real estate to watch media or work with graphics \u2014 with its sharp 2,496 x 1,664 resolution also providing a decent 201 pixels per inch, and a fantastic 120 Hz refresh rate (double the standard 60 Hz) for smoother scrolling and movement. The panel is also branded \"PixelSense Flow\" thanks to built-in technology designed to make it extra responsive to touch and stylus input.\n\nThe 3:2 ratio may take some getting used to, especially if you're used to working in the conventional 16:9 format. Although more and more laptops have adopted a 16:10 screen ratio \u2014 giving you marginally more vertical space to work with \u2014 this goes a step further and adopts an aspect ratio that's better suited to scrolling web pages and looking at photos.\n\nRegardless, the screen looks stunning in terms of its vibrancy and brightness. Testing with a display calibrator produced a color accuracy reading of 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut (meaning it covers 99% of all available colors) \u2014 with red, green and blue channels all perfect in terms of saturation levels. The average Delta-E measurement of 0.84 and maximum of 3.35, meanwhile, was also excellent. This metric (from 0 to 100) determines how distorted colors are compared to their true representations, with a good result normally falling between 3 and 6.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition is also impressively bright, with a reading of 474 nits \u2014 slightly short of the manufacturer's claims of 600 nits, but certainly brighter than most machines out there. The MacBook Pro can hit 500 nits, by contrast, so it's an impressive result.\n\nThe lack of an OLED option is one downside, however. The black level was a fractional 0.5 nits, with a contrast ratio of 929.51:1 \u2014 but OLED displays showcase deep, inky blacks that emit no light and boast near-perfect contrast ratios (infinity:1). Nonetheless, it's an otherwise exceptional panel, especially for a standard LCD display.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition 15-inch: Keyboard and touchpad\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future)\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Laptop's keyboard is snappy and responsive, although it lacks the bite you might expect from keyboards that offer more force feedback with each keystroke. That said, the keys are well-sized and well-spaced and if you don't mind a quieter experience, there's little faulting it. They are well constructed and complement the premium feel of the device itself \u2014 and typing with this machine is a joy.\n\nThe touchpad is similarly exceptionally crafted and more expansive than in the previous edition of the Microsoft Surface Laptop. The pad is near-glacial to the touch \u2014 it's extremely smooth and feels great when you glide your fingers across its surface. Clicking also feels great and you get plenty of haptic feedback. But there are a few minor responsiveness issues when moving your cursor \u2014 the lack of friction means you're prone to drifting. This becomes especially apparent when clicking and dragging, and it's hard to be completely precise.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch): Performance and battery\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future)\n\nOne of the major selling points of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) is the hardware it's fitted with \u2014 making it incredibly reasonably priced. The latest Arm-based Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon Elite X, is complemented by dedicated graphics in the form of a Qualcomm Adreno GPU. You can pair this with 32 GB of RAM and a decent 1 TB SSD.\n\nCapping this all off is a 45-TOPS Qualcomm Hexagon NPU that enables on-device AI, while also taking on tasks the CPU or GPU would normally handle and consuming much less energy in the process \u2014 translating to, in theory, a much longer battery life. That last point was indeed borne out in testing, with the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) lasting an incredible 17 hours and 31 minutes in our looped video playback testing, with conditions designed to simulate standard usage. It doesn't quite match the 22-hour maximum that Microsoft claims, but it is an exceptional result nonetheless.\n\nThe internal components also performed well when put through their paces in our benchmarking with Geekbench 6. The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) registered a score of 2,334 in single-threaded testing and 13,246 in multi-threaded testing. By way of comparison, the MacBook Air 15-inch (M3) registered 3,067 and 11,988 respectively, according to public results . The Microsoft laptop doesn't quite hit the same heights as the MacBook Air on basic tasks but leaves it in its wake on more complex, multi-core processes. This is an outstanding result, with the M3 chip previously considered the pinnacle of the current market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Adreno GPU, meanwhile, scores respectably on OpenGL graphics tests \u2014 with a score of 19,022. It's a far better score than you'd get on a machine without a dedicated GPU \u2014 but it's on the lower end for the newest laptops. The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, fitted with the same GPU, scored a slightly higher 20,493, while the HP Spectre x360 14, fitted with Intel Arc Graphics, scored 24,993.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch): Ports and features\n\nImage 1 of 9 (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future) (Image credit: Keumars Afifi-Sabet/Future)\n\nIf the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) disappoints in any category, it's the lack of ports for a 15-inch machine. There are two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, as well as a 3.5 mm headphone jack and MicroSDXC card reader. There's also a charging port for power delivery \u2014 this is rather pointless as power delivery through USB-C is standard nowadays, while there are omissions like HDMI and a full SD card slot that more people would find useful. It's a minor disappointment for a 15-inch machine to lack ports like this \u2014 but you could always buy a separate mini-dock to open up more ports.\n\nIt's worth highlighting the AI features embedded in the Surface Laptop 7, courtesy of the NPU, opening the door to new features in Windows 11 and third-party apps too. Beyond cocreator in Paint (which lets you access image generation features), you can use apps like CapCut to remove the background from videos and DaVinci Resolve to add VFX \u2014 things that were previously only possible on machines with hefty, top-end GPUs.\n\nShould you buy the LG ThinkPad X1 Fold Gen 2?\n\nBuy it if: \u2705 The AI revolution appeals: Having a neural processing unit on-board will be a big draw for some \u2705 You need premium performance: The Surface can rival the MacBook Air 15-inch (M3) in performance terms\n\nDon't buy it if: \u274c You do a lot of graphics work: There are rivals available with more powerful GPUs \u274c You're on a budget: At nearly $2,000 there are cheaper options, though you get plenty of computing punch for your hard-earned dollars\n\nThere is very little to fault in the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition \u2014 from its premium build quality and portability for a larger machine to its crisp and bright display. Its performance, too, is worth highlighting as it can rival the MacBook Air 15-inch (M3) on day-to-day performance. Compounding this is a fantastic battery life, partly thanks to the NPU, lasting in excess of 17 hours without needing to recharge. And you get all of this for around $2,000 \u2014 which is fantastic value for money.\n\nThere's very little to point out by way of weaknesses, but if we are nitpicking, you should probably look elsewhere if you're hoping to work with heavy-duty graphics. While the Qualcomm Adreno GPU in the Surface Laptop 7th Edition performs well, there are better options out there in terms of entry-level GPUs.\n\nWe'd also have loved to see an OLED option for near-perfect contrast, but there's still plenty to love about the bright and incredibly proficient display, which accurately reproduces colors and draws you in with its 3:2 aspect ratio.\n\nIf this product isn't for you\n\nThe first alternative you should consider is the MacBook Air 15-inch (M3). It's a little lighter, a little more portable and performs slightly better in terms of single-cord and graphical workloads, although the Surface Laptop 7th Edition(15-inch) has the edge in terms of multi-core performance.\n\nIf you want to downsize ever so slightly, you should also check out the 14.5-inch Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x Gen 9. It's a lightweight, razor-thin machine that packs the same Snapdragon processor and NPU into a much more compact and arguably more stylish chassis. This machine also includes an OLED display, but it does lack a dedicated GPU and includes only 16 GB RAM.\n\nYou should also consider the 15.6-inch ASUS Vivobook S 15, which has the exact same specs as the Surface Laptop 7th Edition (15-inch) but boasts a slightly larger-capacity battery, plenty of ports including HDMI and microSD and a 3K 120 Hz OLED display.",

            "content": "In the early part of your journey, you pass through medieval villages, an underground temple surrounded by waterfalls, a farm tended by reanimated corpses, and a sealed temple left by a civilisation thousands of years past. From realistically rolling and crashing waves along the coast, and neon fungus in shining caves, to dense and damp forest campsites under glowing starscapes, it can be a breathtaking game to look at, too. Like any good RPG, the meat of the game is the quests, the journeys, and the decisions you make that shape your character and the world around you. And despite the compressed size (and the fact the game is made up of a half-dozen big levels rather than a contiguous open world), there\u2019s just as much of that meat here, arguably of better quality, and way less gristle and fat. The core narrative tension is your presence in the Living Lands as an emblem of tyranny, and how you deal with that is up to you. You can be the empire\u2019s lapdog, siding with the forces already there and admonishing the locals for their customs and practices that are illegal under imperial law. Conversely, you can become a liberator, standing up against the paladins of the Steel Garrote and protecting the people\u2019s right to their own homes. As expected, in good fantasy storytelling, there are strong undertones of compassion, tolerance and progressive social values. But there is also always the option to be an absolute villain and cut people off any time they try to tell you anything, which is fun, too.\n\nSide quests are abundant, as are hidden secrets and loot, and jumping and climbing all over the map to poke your nose in every corner is a delight. It\u2019s often rewarded, too, not just with rare gear but with story implications; find and stop a group of plotting rogues and you might prevent a nearby city being razed to the ground later in the game. Avowed is filled with secret spots that you\u2019ll find only if you go looking. The impact of the story and quests are constantly reinforced by the characters you meet, whether that\u2019s in passing or through long conversations with your crew at camp, which adapt surprisingly well to your choices and actions. Even when you\u2019re on the road, you\u2019re frequently hearing funny banter from rangers or villagers, or a reminder from your crew that the objective area of a side quest you may have forgotten is nearby. Steel and sorcery Combat is a highlight in Avowed, which is rare for an RPG. The sound design does a lot of heavy lifting to make attacks feel violent and satisfying, and I love how an enemy\u2019s defeat is communicated visually by their collapsing, disintegration or being sent flipping away by an axe strike. But the best part is how many options you have to express your own play style through fighting.\n\nLoading For one-handed melee weapons, there are swords, spears and axes. You can mix and match any two you like or if you only want one, you\u2019ll be able to block with a shield or the weapon itself. But then there are also one-handed ranged weapons you can mix in: magic wands, grimoires (books that let you cast one of the four spells written therein) and flintlock pistols. Sword and gun is a powerful combo, even if reloading takes a second, and magic users will find wand and grimoire make for a much faster and more action-focused feel than most sorcery in RPGs. There are also huge two-handed melee weapons that pack an extra wallop and can be used to block, but are slow and will tire you out quicker. For two-handed ranged weapons, there\u2019s the silent bow, and the loud but deadly arquebus (or long rifle). Most importantly, you can set up two different loadouts and switch them with a button press, so you don\u2019t need to go into a menu to switch from your ranged set-up to your close-quarters crowd-control gear. Sword and spells is a good combo. But maybe go for a light or medium armour so you don\u2019t use all your stamina and essence (which you need to cast magic) too quickly. It will take some experimentation to find what works for you but like the rest of the game, the weapon system is streamlined and thoughtful. You use whatever you want, and as the opponents get tougher, you either acquire new gear or gather resources from the world to upgrade your favourite.\n\nSince you can break down any weapon to create resources (and get a refund for those you\u2019ve invested), I never felt punished for switching to a new type of weapon, even a dozen hours in. The real fun comes with unique weapons, which all have their own look, stats and special characteristic, for example poisoning on power strikes, or doing extra damage to enemies with full health. Collecting the right resources lets you enchant these weapons to unlock one of two powerful effects, making many opportunities for synergy. I won\u2019t dive too deep on the armour, accessories, skill tree or magic systems, but they all follow what seems to be the game\u2019s mechanical thesis: keep it fun, and get rid of the bloat. Take the stamina system as an example. It still exists because the game doesn\u2019t want you to be able to spam claymore strikes without taking a breath. But in most games, sprinting also consumes stamina, which is a bore; here, running is free. Loading At a more macro level, the lean design makes for an elegant, flowing loop of gameplay since challenges do not scale along with you as in other RPGs; quests and enemies at a higher level than you indicate you\u2019re moving through the game too fast. That makes upgrading your weapons and armour mandatory as you go, which in turn leads to exploring for resources, which exposes you to more of the world. It also means returning to earlier levels lets you feel like an overpowered god because you\u2019re one-shotting enemies that used to be tough. (And by the way, the resources you get from the early areas can be combined to create the resources you want for late-game weapons. Again, it\u2019s about making sure you\u2019re never wasting time).",

            "content": "Microsoft threat researchers discovered a series of what they are calling \u201cdevice code\u201d phishing attacks that allowed a suspected Russia-aligned threat group to gain access to and steal data from critical infrastructure organizations, the company said in research released Thursday.\n\nThe group, which Microsoft tracks as Storm-2372, has targeted governments, IT services and organizations operating in the telecom, health, higher education and energy sectors across Europe, North America, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMicrosoft observed attackers generating a legitimate device code sign-in request and then duping targeted users to input the code into a login page for productivity apps. By exploiting the device code authentication flow, Storm-2372 has gained access to targeted systems, captured authentication tokens and used those valid tokens to achieve lateral movement and steal data.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been successful in these attacks, though Microsoft itself is not affected,\u201d Sherrod DeGrippo, director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft, said in a video summarizing the report\u2019s findings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft declined to answer questions about the threat intelligence and did not say how many accounts or organizations have been impacted by the campaign, which started in August 2024.\n\nStorm-2372 likely set phishing lures by targeting potential victims via messaging apps, such as Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and Signal. Microsoft observed attackers posing as a person of importance to develop false rapport with targets before sending follow-up phishing emails disguised as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations.\n\nThe fake Teams meeting invitations have tricked targets to complete a device code authentication request with the code Storm-2372 included as the phony meeting ID. According to Microsoft, this attack chain has allowed Storm-2372 to gain initial access to victim accounts, enabling attackers to use the valid session for lateral movement within the compromised network.\n\nResearchers observed attackers sending intra-organizational phishing emails with device code authentication requests from the compromised account to other users, furthering the scope of access across the network.\n\nThe suspected Russian nation-state threat group also used Microsoft Graph to scrape emails and search for messages containing keywords, including username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry and gov. \u201cMicrosoft then observed email exfiltration via Microsoft Graph of the emails found from these searches,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft said Storm-2372\u2019s techniques could enable persistent access as long as the tokens remain valid.\n\nThe Storm taxonomy is a temporary designation Microsoft attributes to unknown or emerging clusters of threat activity. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center has a medium-level of confidence that Storm-2372 aligns with Russia\u2019s interests.\n\nStorm-2372\u2019s activities overlap with other threat groups using similar techniques but appear to be distinct from those groups. In late January, Volexity researchers spotted a trio of Russian nation-state threat groups using device code phishing attacks to gain access to highly targeted Microsoft 365 accounts.\n\nVolexity observed unique post-exploitation activities across these attacks, but all of the compromises were linked to device code authentication phishing lures, the threat intelligence company said in research released Thursday.\n\nVolexity attributes with medium confidence one of the Russia-based threat group\u2019s activities to Midnight Blizzard, a group it tracks as CozyLarch. Researchers acknowledge the activity could all be attributed to the same threat group, but due to variances in operations they are tracking the other clusters of activity as UTA0304 and UTA0307.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one highly targeted attack on a Volexity customer, an attacker claiming to be a high-ranking official from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine contacted the victim on Signal and then sent an email designed to look like an invite for a chat on the messaging app Element.\n\nVolexity researchers determined the attacker then duped the victim into clicking a link in an email feigned to be an invite for a secure chat room, but instead it prompted the victim to generate a device code that provided the attacker access to the victim\u2019s account.",

Furthermore, the Microsoft Graph service is used to search through messages of the breached account.\n\n\"The threat actor was using keyword searching to view messages containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov,\" Redmond said, adding the emails matching these filter criteria were then exfiltrated to the threat actor.\n\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, organizations are recommended to block device code flow wherever possible, enable phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), and follow the principle of least privilege.\n\nUpdate\n\nIn an update shared on February 14, 2025, Microsoft said it \"observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow.\"\n\nUsing the client ID, it added, enables the attackers to receive a refresh token that can be used to request another token for the device registration service, and then register an actor-controlled device within Entra ID. The connected device is then used to harvest emails.\n\n\"With the same refresh token and the new device identity, Storm-2372 is able to obtain a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and access an organization's resources,\" Microsoft said. \"The actor has also been observed to use proxies that are regionally appropriate for the targets, likely in an attempt to further conceal the suspicious sign in activity.\"\n\nCybersecurity firm Volexity said it has observed at least three different Russian threat actors conducting spear-phishing campaigns using the device code approach to compromise Microsoft 365 accounts since mid-January 2025.\n\nSome of the emails have been identified as sent from accounts impersonating individuals from the United States Department of State, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, European Union Parliament, and other prominent research institutions.\n\nOne of the clusters behind the activity is suspected to be APT29, which is also known as BlueBravo, Cloaked Ursa, CozyLarch, Cozy Bear, Midnight Blizzard (formerly Nobelium), and The Dukes. The other two groups have been assigned the monikers UTA0304 and UTA0307.\n\nIn one instance analyzed by Volexity, UTA0304 first approached a victim on Signal masquerading as an official from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, and then persuaded them to shift the conversation to another secure chat application called Element.\n\nThe attacker proceeded to send them a spear-phishing email, stating they needed to click on a link provided in the message to join a chat room. Clicking the link redirected the victim to a Microsoft page that asks for a device code in order to \"allow access.\"\n\n\"The message was a ploy to fool the user into thinking they were being invited into a secure chat, when in reality they were giving the attacker access to their account,\" Volexity's Charlie Gardner, Steven Adair, and Tom Lancaster said in an analysis.\n\n\"The generated Device Codes are only valid for 15 minutes once they are created. As a result, the real-time communication with the victim, and having them expect the 'invitation,' served to ensure the phish would succeed through timely coordination.\n\nCozyLarch and UTA0307, likewise, are said to have adopted a similar strategy, urging victims to join a Microsoft Teams meeting to gain unauthorized access to the Microsoft 365 account, followed by exfiltrating documents of interest.\n\n\"It should be noted that it is possible this is the work of a single threat actor running multiple, different campaigns,\" the researchers said, adding they are being tracked separately due to differences in the observed components.\n\n\"It appears that these Russian threat actors have made a concerted effort to launch several campaigns against organizations with a goal of simultaneously abusing this method before the targets catch on and implement countermeasures.\"",

This is designed to socially engineer targets into providing a specific Microsoft device authentication code, allowing the attackers long-term access to the user\u2019s account.\n\nThis tactic is designed to exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised organizations \u201cthat would be of interest to a Russian threat actor.\u201d\n\nDevice code authentication is a method whereby users can sign into M365 services on devices that lack a full browser interface, like Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, by using a code displayed on that device and then authenticating on another device, such as a phone.\n\nVolexity assesses with medium confidence that at least one of the threat actors is CozyLarch, which overlaps with the notorious Midnight Blizzard gang. The remaining activity is being tracked under UTA0304 and UTA0307.\n\nMost of the observed attacks originated via spear-phishing emails using a variety of themes. However, one case began with outreach via messaging service Signal.\n\nAll of them resulted in the attacker inviting the targeted user to a virtual meeting, access apps and data as an external M365 user or join a chatroom on a secure chat application.\n\nHow the Device Code Phishing Attacks Work\n\nIn the first incident investigated by Volexity, the victim was contacted on Signal by an individual claiming to be from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. The threat actor then requested the victim move off Signal to another secure chat application called Element.\n\nAfter joining an attacker-controlled Element server controlled by the attacker, the victim was informed they needed to click on a link from an email to join a secure chat room.\n\nThe email came from someone with the name of the high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.\n\nIt was structured to look like a meeting invite for a chatroom on the messaging application, Element.\n\nHowever, all the hyperlinks in the email were instead linked to the page used for the Microsoft Device Code authentication workflow, taking users to a dialogue box. Once a user entered their specific code into this dialogue, the attackers could then capture the code and gain long-term access to the user\u2019s account.\n\nThe generated Device Codes are only valid for 15 minutes once they are created, meaning the victim needed to access the page and input the code quickly after receiving the email.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the real-time communication with the victim, and having them expect the \"invitation\", served to ensure the phish would succeed through timely coordination,\u201d the researchers explained.",

            "content": "The Rise of Microsoft: How It Became a Tech Giant\n\nFrom a small software startup to one of the most powerful companies in the world, Microsoft has played a pivotal role in shaping the technology industry. Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the company revolutionized personal computing, software development, and cloud computing, securing its place as a dominant force in tech. But how did it all begin? Let\u2019s explore Microsoft\u2019s journey, from its early days to its meteoric rise.\n\nWhen Was Microsoft Released to the Public?\n\nMicrosoft was founded on April 4, 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. However, it wasn\u2019t a publicly traded company at the time. For the first few years, Microsoft operated as a small software development firm, creating programs for early microcomputers.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until March 13, 1986, that Microsoft went public with an initial public offering (IPO) at $21 per share. The IPO was a massive success, instantly making Bill Gates a millionaire and setting the stage for Microsoft\u2019s rapid growth. By the late 1990s, Microsoft had cemented itself as a leader in the software industry, thanks to products like Windows, Office, and Internet Explorer.\n\nWhat Was Microsoft\u2019s First Product?\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s first official product was a version of the BASIC programming language developed for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. This marked the company\u2019s first big break, as personal computers were just starting to gain popularity.\n\nHowever, Microsoft\u2019s real breakthrough came in 1981 when it developed MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) for IBM\u2019s first personal computer. MS-DOS became the foundation for Microsoft\u2019s future operating systems, including the wildly successful Windows.\n\nHow Did Microsoft Become Successful?\n\nThe Rise of Windows\n\nOne of Microsoft\u2019s biggest turning points was the launch of Windows 1.0 in 1985. Although it wasn\u2019t an immediate success, later versions\u2014Windows 3.0 (1990) and Windows 95 (1995)\u2014transformed Microsoft into a tech powerhouse. Windows 95, in particular, was a game-changer with its iconic Start menu, taskbar, and improved user interface.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Microsoft Windows had become the dominant operating system, running on more than 90% of personal computers worldwide.\n\nRelated: Zhang Yiming's Business Strategies: How He Built ByteDance Into a Global Powerhouse\n\nRelated: What Is Apple's Business Strategy and their biggest pitfalls?\n\nMicrosoft Office and Software Dominance\n\nIn 1989, Microsoft released Microsoft Office, which included essential programs like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The suite quickly became the standard for businesses and individuals, solidifying Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the productivity software market.\n\nThe Internet Boom and Internet Explorer\n\nDuring the 1990s, Microsoft capitalized on the internet revolution by launching Internet Explorer in 1995. The browser quickly overtook competitors like Netscape Navigator, securing Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the web browser market for years.\n\nThe Shift to Cloud Computing\n\nWhile Microsoft dominated the software industry for decades, it faced new competition from companies like Google and Apple. To stay relevant, Microsoft shifted its focus to cloud computing, launching Azure in 2010. Today, Microsoft Azure is one of the leading cloud platforms, competing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.\n\nWhat Was the Public Reaction to Microsoft?\n\nEarly Days (1975\u20131990s): Excitement & Innovation\n\nIn its early years, Microsoft was seen as a revolutionary company that brought computing to the masses. Its partnership with IBM and the release of MS-DOS helped make personal computers more accessible, earning praise from tech enthusiasts and businesses.\n\nHowever, as Microsoft grew into a corporate giant, it also faced criticism.\n\nRelated: Microsoft Through The Decades\n\nRelated: Microsoft CEO Gets $30M Raise While Laying Off Thousands and Facing Cyber Scandal!\n\nMonopoly Allegations & Legal Battles (1990s\u20132000s)\n\nBy the late 1990s, Microsoft faced antitrust lawsuits for allegedly monopolizing the software industry. The U.S. government accused Microsoft of stifling competition, particularly with its bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.\n\nThe landmark U.S. vs. Microsoft case in 2001 led to increased scrutiny, and Microsoft was forced to change its business practices. Despite the controversy, the company continued to grow and expand its influence.\n\nModern Era (2010s\u2013Present): Resurgence & Innovation\n\nUnder CEO Satya Nadella, who took over in 2014, Microsoft reinvented itself by focusing on cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and gaming. The company acquired major brands like LinkedIn (2016), GitHub (2018), and Activision Blizzard (2023), expanding into new markets.\n\nToday, Microsoft remains one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market value exceeding $2 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Lasting Legacy\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s rise from a small software company to a global tech leader is nothing short of remarkable. With its pioneering operating systems, productivity software, and cloud services, the company has shaped how people and businesses interact with technology.\n\nDespite challenges and competition, Microsoft continues to innovate, proving that it remains a dominant force in the tech industry. Whether through Windows, Office, or Azure, Microsoft\u2019s impact on the digital world is undeniable.",

            "content": "UPDATE (February 14, 2025): Within the past 24 hours, Microsoft has observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow. More details below. Executive summary: Today we\u2019re sharing that Microsoft discovered cyberattacks being launched by a group we call Storm-2372, who we assess with moderate confidence aligns with Russia\u2019s interests and tradecraft. The attacks appear to have been ongoing since August 2024 and have targeted governments, NGOs, and a wide range of industries in multiple regions. The attacks use a specific phishing technique called \u201cdevice code phishing\u201d that tricks users to log into productivity apps while Storm-2372 actors capture the information from the log in (tokens) that they can use to then access compromised accounts. These tokens are part of an industry standard and, while these phishing lures used Microsoft and other apps to trick users, they do not reflect an attack unique to Microsoft nor have we found any vulnerabilities in our code base enabling this activity.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center discovered an active and successful device code phishing campaign by a threat actor we track as Storm-2372. Our ongoing investigation indicates that this campaign has been active since August 2024 with the actor creating lures that resemble messaging app experiences including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams. Storm-2372\u2019s targets during this time have included government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), information technology (IT) services and technology, defense, telecommunications, health, higher education, and energy/oil and gas in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East. Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that Storm-2372 aligns with Russian interests, victimology, and tradecraft.\n\nIn device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow to capture authentication tokens, which they then use to access target accounts, and further gain access to data and other services that the compromised account has access to. This technique could enable persistent access as long as the tokens remain valid, making this attack technique attractive to threat actors.\n\nThe phishing attack identified in this blog masquerades as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations delivered through email. When targets click the meeting invitation, they are prompted to authenticate using a threat actor-generated device code. The actor then receives the valid access token from the user interaction, stealing the authenticated session.\n\nBecause of the active threat represented by Storm-2372 and other threat actors exploiting device code phishing techniques, we are sharing our latest research, detections, and mitigation guidance on this campaign to raise awareness of the observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), educate organizations on how to harden their attack surfaces, and disrupt future operations by this threat actor. Microsoft uses Storm designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the threat actor behind the activity.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center continues to track campaigns launched by Storm-2372, and, when able, directly notifies customers who have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to help secure their environments. Microsoft is also tracking other groups using similar techniques, including those documented by Volexity in their recent publication.\n\nHow does device code phishing work?\n\nA device code authentication flow is a numeric or alphanumeric code used to authenticate an account from an input-constrained device that does not have the ability to perform an interactive authentication using a web flow and thus must perform this authentication on another device to sign-in. In device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow.\n\nDuring the attack, the threat actor generates a legitimate device code request and tricks the target into entering it into a legitimate sign-in page. This grants the actor access and enables them to capture the authentication\u2014access and refresh\u2014tokens that are generated, then use those tokens to access the target\u2019s accounts and data. The actor can also use these phished authentication tokens to gain access to other services where the user has permissions, such as email or cloud storage, without needing a password. The threat actor continues to have access so long as the tokens remain valid. The attacker can then use the valid access token to move laterally within the environment.\n\nFigure 1. Device code phishing attack cycle\n\nStorm-2372 phishing lure and access\n\nStorm-2372\u2019s device code phishing campaign has been active since August 2024. Observed early activity indicates that Storm-2372 likely targeted potential victims using third-party messaging services including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams, falsely posing as a prominent person relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending subsequent invitations to online events or meetings via phishing emails.\n\nFigure 2. Sample messages from the threat actor posing as a prominent person and building rapport on Signal\n\nThe invitations lure the user into completing a device code authentication request emulating the experience of the messaging service, which provides Storm-2372 initial access to victim accounts and enables Graph API data collection activities, such as email harvesting.\n\nFigure 3. Example of lure used in phishing campaign\n\nOn the device code authentication page, the user is tricked into entering the code that the threat actor included as the ID for the fake Teams meeting invitation.\n\nPost-compromise activity\n\nOnce the victim uses the device code to authenticate, the threat actor receives the valid access token. The threat actor then uses this valid session to move laterally within the newly compromised network by sending additional phishing messages containing links for device code authentication to other users through intra-organizational emails originating from the victim\u2019s account.\n\nFigure 4. Legitimate device code authentication page\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft observed Storm-2372 using Microsoft Graph to search through messages of the account they\u2019ve compromised. The threat actor was using keyword searching to view messages containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov. Microsoft then observed email exfiltration via Microsoft Graph of the emails found from these searches.\n\nWithin the past 24 hours, Microsoft has observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow. Using this client ID enables Storm-2372 to receive a refresh token that can be used to request another token for the device registration service, and then register an actor-controlled device within Entra ID. With the same refresh token and the new device identity, Storm-2372 is able to obtain a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and access an organization\u2019s resources. We have observed Storm-2372 using the connected device to collect emails.\n\nThe actor has also been observed to use proxies that are regionally appropriate for the targets, likely in an attempt to further conceal the suspicious sign in activity.\n\nWhile many of the mitigations and queries listed below still apply in this scenario, alerts involving anomalous token or PRT activity surrounding close-in-time device registrations may also be a useful method for identifying this shift in technique. Additionally, enrollment restrictions \u2013 limiting the user permissions that can enroll devices into your Microsoft Entra ID environment \u2013 can also help to address this attack behavior.\n\nAttribution\n\nThe actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-2372 is a suspected nation-state actor working toward Russian state interests. It notably has used device code phishing to compromise targets of interest. Storm-2372 likely initially approaches targets through third-party messaging services, posing as a prominent individual relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending invites to online events or meetings. These invites lure the user into device code authentication that grants initial access to Storm-2372 and enables Graph API data collection activities such as email harvesting.\n\nStorm-2372 targets include government, NGOs, IT services and technology, defense, telecommunications, health, higher education, and energy/oil and gas in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nMitigation and protection guidance\n\nTo harden networks against the Storm-2372 activity described above, defenders can implement the following:\n\nThe following best practices further help improve organizational defenses against phishing and other credential theft attacks:\n\nRequire multifactor authentication (MFA). While certain attacks such as device code phishing attempt to evade MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats. Leverage phishing-resistant authentication methods such as FIDO Tokens, or Microsoft Authenticator with passkey. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking. Block legacy authentication with Microsoft Entra by using Conditional Access. Legacy authentication protocols do not have the ability to enforce MFA, as legacy MFA (per-user MFA prompts) is susceptible to abuse.\n\nCentralize your organization\u2019s identity management into a single platform. If your organization is a hybrid environment, integrate your on-premises directories with your cloud directories. If your organization is using a third-party for identity management, ensure this data is being logged in a SIEM or connected to Microsoft Entra to fully monitor for malicious identity access from a centralized location. The added benefits to centralizing all identity data is to facilitate implementation of Single Sign On (SSO) and provide users with a more seamless authentication process, as well as configure Entra ID\u2019s machine learning models to operate on all identity data, thus learning the difference between legitimate access and malicious access quicker and easier. It is recommended to synchronize all user accounts except administrative and high privileged ones when doing this to maintain a boundary between the on-premises environment and the cloud environment, in case of a breach.\n\nSecure accounts with credential hygiene: practice the principle of least privilege and audit privileged account activity in your Entra ID environments to slow and stop attackers.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365 detects malicious activity associated with this threat through the following alerts:\n\nThis email has traits consistent with phishing\n\nThis HTML has traits consistent with phishing\n\nMicrosoft Entra ID Protection\n\nThe following Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk detections inform Entra ID user risk events and can indicate associated threat activity, including unusual user activity consistent with known attack patterns identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence research:\n\nHunting queries\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR\n\nThe following query can help identify possible device code phishing attempts:\n\nThis following query from public research surfaces newly registered devices, and can be a useful in conjunction with anomalous or suspicious user or token activity:\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the following queries to detect phishing attempts and email exfiltration attempts via Graph API.

We\u2019re joining forces with our colleagues at Apple, Bocoup, Igalia, Google, and Mozilla, to improve interoperability on the web platform.\n\nInteroperability matters because it ensures that the code you write for the web will work the same way for your users regardless of browser and device. The Interop project is a yearly effort where browser implementers survey developers about top pain-points and agree on areas where we will concentrate resources to drive to full interoperability.\n\nOver the past four years, Interop has highlighted areas where bugs in engines prevented widespread adoption of important features, from CSS styling and layout to new HTML elements and web APIs. In 2024, Interop helped resolve important issues in multiple areas, including:\n\nThe Popover API , which allows you to display content on top of other page content declaratively using HTML, is now fully supported across all browsers.\n\n, which allows you to display content on top of other page content declaratively using HTML, is now fully supported across all browsers.

The way that browsers compute the accessible names and roles of the elements on the page is now consistent, improving the experience of assistive technology users.\n\nInterop 2025 brings about an ambitious list of focus areas for this year\u2019s Interop project, and we are looking forward to a successful collaboration. As with prior years, many proposals were submitted, and we received a lot of input and comments on them. Thank you for the time you spent telling us about how the web platform could be better for your use cases! Your feedback was key in helping focus our efforts on the areas where we can make a positive impact.\n\nThe areas that all browsers agreed to focus on in 2025 include:\n\nFor more details on the above focus areas, see the full description on the Interop GitHub repository. And, if you want to follow the progress of the project over the course of the year, check out the Interop 2025 dashboard.\n\nHowever, we want to acknowledge that we also hear frustration from developers that some long-lived interoperability concerns are still outstanding, and that the process for choosing focus areas in the Interop project is opaque. We are committed to providing better visibility into these ongoing interoperability gaps.\n\nLast year, Edge launched a supplementary Top Developer Needs dashboard to fill this visibility gap and track the improvements made to address these long-lived issues. Some of the top issues we\u2019re tracking, such as scroll-driven animations and anchor positioning, were addressed in 2024 and late-breaking progress on View Transitions also helped set the stage for Interop 2025. We will be updating this dashboard in the coming weeks and will continue to lobby within the Interop group for increased transparency and an end to confidential vetoes.\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the improvements that the Interop project will bring about this year, and we thank you again for submitting proposals and sharing your input. These proposals, as well as other developer signals, such as surveys, help us understand what\u2019s important to you.",

It's worth noting that the abuse of the Graph API has been previously detected in another backdoor named SIESTAGRAPH.\n\nThe communication mechanism entails parsing the commands stored in the mailbox's drafts folder and writing the results of the execution into new draft emails for each command. FINALDRAFT registers 37 command handlers that are designed around process injection, file manipulation, and network proxy capabilities.\n\nIt's also engineered to start new processes with stolen NTLM hashes and execute PowerShell commands in a manner such that it does not invoke the \"powershell.exe\" binary. Instead, it patches several APIs to evade event tracing for Windows (ETW) and launches PowerPick, a legitimate utility that's part of the Empire post-exploitation toolkit.\n\nELF binary artifacts uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil and the United States indicate the presence of a Linux variant of FINALDRAFT that features similar C2 functionality. The Linux version, for its part, can execute shell commands via popen and delete itself from the system.\n\n\"The completeness of the tools and the level of engineering involved suggest that the developers are well-organized,\" the researchers said. \"The extended time frame of the operation and evidence from our telemetry suggest it's likely an espionage-oriented campaign.\"\n\nUpdate\n\nPalo Alto Networks Unit 42, which is tracking REF7707 under the moniker CL-STA-0049, said the suspected Chinese activity cluster has targeted governments, defense, telecommunication, education and aviation sectors in Southeast Asia and South America since at least March 2023.\n\n\"The observed activity includes collecting sensitive information from compromised organizations, as well as obtaining information about high-ranking officials and individuals at those organizations,\" security researchers Lior Rochberger and Tom Fakterman said.\n\nThe attack chains are known to weaponize vulnerabilities in Internet Information Services (IIS) servers to drop web shells, allowing the threat actors to remotely access and deploy a sophisticated backdoor dubbed FINALDRAFT (aka Squidoor) that's capable of infecting both Windows and Linux systems.\n\nIt's capable of maintaining access, lateral movement, creating covert communication channels with its operators, and harvesting information of interest from the targeted entities. It can also receive instructions to execute arbitrary commands, inject payloads into selected processes, exfiltrate files, enumerate running processes, and deliver additional payloads.\n\nSquidoor is \"engineered for an enhanced level of stealth,\" Unit 42 pointed out, adding its multi-platform implementations \"enables the malware to infiltrate diverse network ecosystems, potentially compromising a broader range of targets and complicating detection and mitigation efforts across heterogeneous infrastructures.\"\n\nA key aspect of the backdoor is its support for different methods for C2 communication, thereby making it possible for the adversaries to adapt to various scenarios and evade detection -\n\nHTTP-based communication\n\nReverse TCP connection to a remote server\n\nReverse UDP connection to a remote server\n\nOutlook mail API\n\nDomain Name System (DNS) tunneling\n\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) tunneling\n\nA mail client retrieved from the configuration file\n\nNamed pipes-based communication (only internal and for Windows)\n\n\"After sending the initial beacon, Squidoor starts to query the email account for commands,\" the researchers said. \"If such an email exists, Squidoor will retrieve its contents and delete it from the attacker's mailbox. This mechanism allows the malware to receive commands or additional malicious code from its C2 server disguised as innocent-looking Outlook network traffic.\"\n\n(The story was updated after publication on February 28, 2025, to include additional insights about FINALDRAFT from Unit 42.)",

            "content": "Microsoft has published its first research on a subgroup within the Russian state actor Seashell Blizzard, detailing a multiyear initial access operation tracked as the \u2018BadPilot campaign.\u2019 The subgroup has targeted internet-facing infrastructure globally since at least 2021, enabling Seashell Blizzard to maintain persistence on high-value targets and facilitate tailored network operations. Seashell Blizzard\u2019s specialized operations have ranged from espionage to information operations and cyber-enabled disruptions, usually in the form of destructive attacks and manipulation of industrial control systems (ICS).\n\n\u201cActive since at least 2021, this subgroup within Seashell Blizzard has leveraged opportunistic access techniques and stealthy forms of persistence to collect credentials, achieve command execution, and support lateral movement that has at times led to substantial regional network compromises,\u201d Microsoft Threat Intelligence wrote in a Wednesday blog post. \u201cObserved operations following initial access indicate that this campaign enabled Seashell Blizzard to obtain access to global targets across sensitive sectors including energy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing, in addition to international governments.\u201d\n\nThe post assessed that this subgroup has been enabled by a horizontally scalable capability bolstered by published exploits that allowed Seashell Blizzard to discover and compromise numerous Internet-facing systems across geographical regions and sectors.\n\nMicrosoft said that its Seashell Blizzard research overlaps with activity tracked by other security vendors such as BE2, UAC-0133, Blue Echidna, Sandworm, PHANTOM, BlackEnergy Lite, and APT44.\n\nFurthermore, since early 2024, the subgroup has expanded its range of access to include targets in the U.S. and the U.K. by exploiting vulnerabilities primarily in ConnectWise ScreenConnect (CVE-2024-1709) IT remote management and monitoring software and Fortinet FortiClient EMS security software (CVE-2023-48788). These new access operations built upon previous efforts between 2021 and 2023 which predominantly affected Ukraine, Europe, and specific verticals in Central and South Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nMicrosoft detailed that due to their specialization in computer network exploitation (CNE) and expertise targeting critical infrastructure such as ICS and supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), Seashell Blizzard\u2019s operations have frequently been leveraged during military conflicts and as an adaptable element during contentious geopolitical events. \u201cHistorically, some of Seashell Blizzard\u2019s operations may be considered part of a spectrum of retaliatory actions sometimes used by the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nAlso, since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Seashell Blizzard has conducted a steady stream of operations complementing Russian military objectives. The threat actor\u2019s strategic targets in the region have included critical infrastructure such as energy and water, government, military, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, telecommunications, and other supportive civilian infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft disclosed that since at least April 2023, Seashell Blizzard has increased targeting of military communities in the region, likely for tactical intelligence gain. Their persistent targeting of Ukraine suggests Seashell Blizzard is tasked to obtain and retain access to high-priority targets to provide the Russian military and Russian government with a range of options for future actions.\n\n\u201cSeashell Blizzard\u2019s network intrusions leverage diverse tradecraft and typically employ a range of common publicly available tools, including Cobalt Strike and DarkCrystalRAT,\u201d the post added. \u201cNetwork intrusions linked to the threat actor have affected multiple tiers of infrastructure, showcasing Seashell Blizzard\u2019s abilities to target end users, network perimeters, and vertical-specific systems leveraging both publicly available and custom exploits and methods.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft identified that since February 2022, Seashell Blizzard has generally taken three approaches to their network intrusions \u2013 targeted, opportunistic, and hybrid. Seashell Blizzard has frequently used tailored mechanisms to access targets, including scanning and exploitation of specific victim infrastructure, phishing, and modifying legitimate functionality of existing systems to either expand network access or obtain confidential information.\n\nSeashell Blizzard has increasingly used broad exploitation of Internet-facing infrastructure and distribution of malware implants spread through trojanized software to achieve scalable but indiscriminate access. In cases where a resulting victim is identified as strategically valuable, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed the threat actor conducting significant post-compromise activities.\n\nAlso, Seashell Blizzard has very likely gained access to target organizations using a limited supply-chain attack narrowly focused within Ukraine, an operation that was recently mitigated by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA). Other hybrid methods have included the compromise of regionally managed IT service providers, which often afforded regional or vertical-specific access to diverse targets.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence assesses that the initial access subgroup is linked to Seashell Blizzard. Despite the subgroup\u2019s opportunistic tactics, we can distinguish this subgroup due to its consistent use of distinct exploits, tooling, infrastructure, and late-stage methods used to establish persistence.\n\nMoreover, the post added that its \u201clongstanding forensic investigation uncovered distinct post-compromise activities, a part of which incorporated specific operational capabilities and resources chiefly utilized by Seashell Blizzard. We have also observed the initial access subgroup to pursue access to an organization prior to a Seashell Blizzard-linked destructive attack.\u201d\n\nThe subgroup\u2019s historical pattern of exploitation has also led to the compromise of globally diverse organizations that appear to have limited or no utility to Russia\u2019s strategic interests. This pattern suggests the subgroup likely uses an opportunistic \u2018spray and pray\u2019 approach to achieving compromises at scale to increase the likelihood of acquiring access to targets of interest with limited tailored effort.\n\nIn cases where a strategically significant target is compromised, Microsoft said it has \u201cobserved significant later post-compromise activity. The geographic focus of the subgroup frequently transitions between broad campaigns against multiple geographic targets and a narrow focus on specific regions or countries, demonstrating the subgroup\u2019s flexibility to pursue unique regional objectives.\u201d\n\nIn its conclusion, the post noted that Seashell Blizzard serves as Russia\u2019s leading cyber capability in Ukraine. Microsoft Threat Intelligence assesses that this access subgroup will likely continue to develop new, horizontally scalable techniques to compromise networks, both in Ukraine and globally, in alignment with Russia\u2019s wartime objectives and shifting national priorities. \u201cThis subgroup, which is characterized within the broader Seashell Blizzard organization by its near-global reach, represents an expansion in both the geographical targeting conducted by Seashell Blizzard and the scope of its operations.\n\nAt the same time, it recognized that Seashell Blizzard\u2019s far-reaching, opportunistic access methods likely offer Russia expansive opportunities for niche operations and activities that will continue to be valuable over the medium term.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly issued a bulletin warning that internet-connected cameras manufactured in China could potentially be exploited for espionage targeting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure installations. According to the bulletin, these cameras usually lack data encryption and secure configuration settings, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. Additionally, the cameras are designed to communicate with their manufacturers by default, raising concerns about unauthorized data access and surveillance.",

However, using general purpose LLM models to serve as GUI agents faces several challenges: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associating the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. OmniParser closes this gap by \u2018tokenizing\u2019 UI screenshots from pixel spaces into structured elements in the screenshot that are interpretable by LLMs. This enables the LLMs to do retrieval based next action prediction given a set of parsed interactable elements.\n\nOmniParser V2 takes this capability to the next level. Compared to its predecessor (opens in new tab), it achieves higher accuracy in detecting smaller interactable elements and faster inference, making it a useful tool for GUI automation. In particular, OmniParser V2 is trained with a larger set of interactive element detection data and icon functional caption data. By decreasing the image size of the icon caption model, OmniParser V2 reduces the latency by 60% compared to the previous version. Notably, Omniparser+GPT-4o achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy of 39.6 on a recently released grounding benchmark ScreenSpot Pro (opens in new tab), which features high resolution screen and tiny target icons. This is a substantially improvement on GPT-4o\u2019s original score of 0.8.\n\nTo enable faster experimentation with different agent settings, we created OmniTool, a dockerized Windows system that incorporates a suite of essential tools for agents. Out of the box, we enable OmniParser to be used with a variety of state-of-the-art LLMs: OpenAI (4o/o1/o3-mini), DeepSeek (R1), Qwen (2.5VL) and Anthropic (Sonnet) combining the screen understanding, grounding, action planning and execution steps.\n\nRisks and Mitigations\n\nTo align with the Microsoft AI principles (opens in new tab) and Responsible AI practices (opens in new tab), we conduct risk mitigation by training the icon caption model with Responsible AI data, which helps the model avoid inferring sensitive attributes (e.g.race, religion etc.) of the individuals which happen to be in icon images as much as possible. At the same time, we encourage user to apply OmniParser only for screenshot that does not contain harmful content. For the OmniTool, we conduct threat model analysis using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool overview \u2013 Azure | Microsoft Learn (opens in new tab). We provide a sandbox docker container, safety guidance and examples in our GitHub Repository. And we advise a human to stay in the loop in order to minimize the risk.\n\nOpens in a new tab",

Active since at least 2013, the group is assessed to be affiliated with Unit 74455 within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).\n\nThe adversarial collective has been described by Google-owned Mandiant as a \"highly adaptive\" and \"operationally mature\" threat actor that engages in espionage, attack, and influence operations. It also has a track record of mounting disruptive and destructive attacks against Ukraine over the past decade.\n\nCampaigns mounted by Sandworm in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian war have leveraged data wipers (KillDisk aka HermeticWiper), pseudo-ransomware (Prestige aka PRESSTEA), and backdoors (Kapeka), in addition to off-the-shelf malware families like DarkCrystal RAT (aka DCRat) that allow the threat actors to maintain persistent remote access to infected hosts.\n\nIt has also been observed relying on a variety of Russian companies and criminal marketplaces to source and sustain its offensive capabilities, highlighting a growing trend of cybercrime facilitating state-backed hacking.\n\n\"The group has used criminally sourced tools and infrastructure as a source of disposable capabilities that can be operationalized on short notice without immediate links to its past operations,\" the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said in an analysis.\n\n\"Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, APT44 has increased its use of such tooling, including malware such as DarkCrystal RAT (DCRat), Warzone, and RADTHIEF ('Rhadamanthys Stealer'), and bulletproof hosting infrastructure such as that provided by the Russian-speaking actor 'yalishanda,' who advertises in cybercriminal underground communities.\"\n\nMicrosoft said the Sandworm subgroup has been operational since at least late 2021, exploiting various known security flaws to obtain initial access, followed by a series of post-exploitation actions aimed at collecting credentials, achieving command execution, and supporting lateral movement.\n\n\"Observed operations following initial access indicate that this campaign enabled Seashell Blizzard to obtain access to global targets across sensitive sectors including energy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing, in addition to international governments,\" the tech giant noted.\n\n\"This subgroup has been enabled by a horizontally scalable capability bolstered by published exploits that allowed Seashell Blizzard to discover and compromise numerous Internet-facing systems across a wide range of geographical regions and sectors.\"\n\nSince early last year, the sub-cluster is said to have weaponized vulnerabilities in ConnectWise ScreenConnect (CVE-2024-1709) and Fortinet FortiClient EMS (CVE-2023-48788) to infiltrate targets in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nAttacks carried out by the subgroup involve a combination of both opportunistic \"spray and pray\" attacks and targeted intrusions that are designed to maintain indiscriminate access and perform follow-on actions to either expand network access or obtain confidential information.\n\nIt's believed that the wide array of compromises offer Seashell Blizzard a way to meet Kremlin's ever-evolving strategic objectives, permitting the hacking outfit to horizontally scale their operations across diverse sectors as new exploits are disclosed.\n\nAs many as eight different known security vulnerabilities have been exploited by the subgroup to date -\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server (CVE-2021-34473 aka ProxyShell)\n\nZimbra Collaboration (CVE-2022-41352)\n\nOpenfire (CVE-2023-32315)\n\nJetBrains TeamCity (CVE-2023-42793)\n\nMicrosoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397)\n\nFortinet FortiClient EMS (CVE-2023-48788)\n\nConnectwise ScreenConnect (CVE-2024-1709)\n\nJBOSS (Unknown CVE)\n\nA successful foothold is succeeded by the threat actor establishing persistence through three different methods -\n\nFebruary 24, 2024 \u2013 present: Deployment of legitimate remote access software such as Atera Agent and Splashtop Remote Services, in some cases abusing the access to drop additional payloads for credential acquisition, data exfiltration, and other tools for maintaining access like OpenSSH and a bespoke utility dubbed ShadowLink that allows the compromised system to be accessible via the TOR anonymity network\n\nDeployment of legitimate remote access software such as Atera Agent and Splashtop Remote Services, in some cases abusing the access to drop additional payloads for credential acquisition, data exfiltration, and other tools for maintaining access like OpenSSH and a bespoke utility dubbed ShadowLink that allows the compromised system to be accessible via the TOR anonymity network Late 2021 \u2013 present: Deployment of a web shell named LocalOlive that allows for command-and-control and serves as a conduit for more payloads, such as tunneling utilities (e.g., Chisel,

rsockstun) Late 2021 \u2013 2024: Malicious modifications to Outlook Web Access (OWA) sign-in pages to inject JavaScript code that can harvest and exfiltrate credentials back to the threat actor in real-time, and DNS A-record configuration changes likely in an effort to intercept credentials from critical authentication services\n\n\"This subgroup, which is characterized within the broader Seashell Blizzard organization by its near-global reach, represents an expansion in both the geographical targeting conducted by Seashell Blizzard and the scope of its operations,\" Microsoft said.\n\n\"At the same time, Seashell Blizzard's far-reaching, opportunistic access methods likely offer Russia expansive opportunities for niche operations and activities that will continue to be valuable over the medium term.\"\n\nThe development comes as Dutch cybersecurity company EclecticIQ linked the Sandworm group to another campaign that leverages pirated Microsoft Key Management Service (KMS) activators and fake Windows updates to deliver a new version of BACKORDER, a Go-based downloader that's responsible for fetching and executing a second-stage payload from a remote server.\n\nBACKORDER, per Mandiant, is usually delivered within trojanized installer files and is hard-coded to execute the original setup executable. The end goal of the campaign is to deliver DarkCrystal RAT.\n\n\"Ukraine's heavy reliance on cracked software, including in government institutions, creates a major attack surface,\" security researcher Arda B\u00fcy\u00fckkaya said. \"Many users, including businesses and critical entities, have turned to pirated software from untrusted sources, giving adversaries like Sandworm (APT44) a prime opportunity to embed malware in widely used programs.\"\n\nFurther infrastructure analysis has uncovered a previously undocumented RDP backdoor codenamed Kalambur that's disguised as a Windows update, and which utilizes the TOR network for command-and-control, as well as to deploy OpenSSH and enable remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389.\n\nInterestingly, Kalambur shares some level of functional overlap with ShadowLink. \"When launched, [ShadowLink] installs TOR hidden services on the device, turning it into a TOR network server with a unique .onion domain,\" per Microsoft. \"The threat actor can connect to this domain using a pre-configured port number, which in this case is port 3389, redirecting traffic to the device's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service.\"\n\n\"By leveraging trojanized software to infiltrate ICS environments, Sandworm (APT44) continues to demonstrate its strategic objective of destabilizing Ukraine's critical infrastructure in support of Russian geopolitical ambitions,\" B\u00fcy\u00fckkaya said.",

            "content": "Microsoft followed up its massive January Patch Tuesday update containing fixes for 159 vulnerabilities with a more modest crop this month. This time, it released fixes for 57 new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in its update, three of which are critical.\n\nDustin Childs of the Zero Day Initiative described one of the vulnerabilities as unprecedented in the wild. This is a Windows storage elevation of privilege (EOP) vulnerability, CVE-2025-21391.\n\nIn a blog post, Childs said: \u201cThis is \u2026 a type of bug we haven\u2019t seen exploited publicly. The vulnerability allows an attacker to delete targeted files. How does this lead to privilege escalation? My colleague Simon Zuckerbraun details the technique here. While we\u2019ve seen similar issues in the past, this does appear to be the first time the technique has been exploited in the wild. It\u2019s also likely paired with a code execution bug to completely take over a system. Test and deploy this quickly.\u201d\n\nIn Computer Weekly\u2019s sister title SearchWindowsServer, Tom Walat picked out two new zero-day vulnerabilities that Microsoft has fixed in this Patch Tuesday, including the EOP that Childs highlighted.\n\n\u201cThe first new zero-day is a Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock elevation-of-privilege vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418) rated important with a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score of 7.8. This bug affects all currently supported Windows desktop and server systems,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe second new zero-day is the storage EOP vulnerability (CVE-2025-21391) that Childs commented on, to which Walat added: \u201cTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker only needs local access to the network with low privileges. If successful, the attacker can delete files on a system to cause service disruptions and possibly perform other actions, such as elevating their privileges.\u201d\n\nChilds also picked out CVE-2025-21376, a Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. \u201cThis vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to run their code on an affected system simply by sending a maliciously crafted request to the target,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSince there\u2019s no user interaction involved, that makes this bug wormable between affected LDAP servers. Microsoft lists this as \u2018exploitation likely\u2019, so even though this may be unlikely, I would treat this as an impending exploitation. Test and deploy the patch quickly.\u201d\n\nIn the CVE notes to this \u201ccritical\u201d vulnerability, which has a CVSS rating of 8.1, Microsoft stated: \u201cAn unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted request to a vulnerable LDAP server. Successful exploitation could result in a buffer overflow which could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.\u201d\n\nThere are also several Microsoft Excel bug fixes in this update, including CVE-2025-21387, an RCE vulnerability. \u201cThis is one of several Excel fixes where the Preview Pane is an attack vector, which is confusing as Microsoft also notes that user interaction is required,\u201d said Childs. \u201cThey also note that multiple patches are required to address this vulnerability fully. This likely can be exploited either by opening a malicious Excel file or previewing a malicious attachment in Outlook. Either way, make sure you get all the needed patches tested and deployed.\u201d\n\nThis vulnerability is one of six Excel flaws that Microsoft corrected this month, in what proved to be a relatively light Patch Tuesday.",

            "content": "A subgroup of a notorious Russian state-backed hacking group has been running a multi-year campaign to gain initial access to dozens of strategically important organizations across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s threat intelligence team published an examination on Wednesday of the \u201cBadPilot campaign\u201d \u2014 an effort by a Russian group known as Sandworm, or Seashell Blizzard, to breach sectors like energy, including oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing, and the government.\n\nOperators behind the campaign have been able to retain access to high-priority targets, helping the Russian military and government to \u201cadapt swiftly and dynamically to the evolving geopolitical landscape,\u201d Microsoft Threat Intelligence said, warning that the \u201ccluster's operations present significant risk to the global community at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that Seashell Blizzard is Russia\u2019s cyber tip of the spear in Ukraine, Microsoft Threat Intelligence assesses that this access subgroup will continue to innovate new horizontally scalable techniques to compromise networks both in Ukraine and globally in support of Russia\u2019s war objectives and evolving national priorities,\u201d Microsoft researchers said in the report.\n\nThe subgroup\u2019s activity has provided Russia with \u201cexpansive opportunities for niche operations and activities that will continue to be valuable over the medium term,\u201d according to the experts.\n\nSandworm, which researchers have tied to Russian Military Intelligence Unit 74455, has been active since at least 2013 and is responsible for some of Russia\u2019s most high-profile destructive attacks, including KillDisk and FoxBlade as well as headline-grabbing incidents like NotPetya and Prestige.\n\nThe group has been repeatedly leveraged during military conflicts and has proven to be highly-skilled at targeting critical infrastructure systems. It has played a central role in Russia\u2019s invasion and attacks on Ukraine.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. State Department announced a $10 million reward for information about six hackers working within Seashell Blizzard. The six were implicated in the creation and propagation of the NotPetya malware in charges filed by the Justice Department in 2020.\n\nSherrod DeGrippo, Microsoft\u2019s director of Threat Intelligence Strategy, told Recorded Future News that the concern with the activity they identified is that it shows a significant departure from Russia\u2019s typical operating behavior of narrowly-focused cyber operations.\n\n\u201cThe activity has been indiscriminate at times, affecting a wide range of industries across numerous countries and regions, well outside the borders of Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFurther, Russia-sponsored military threat actors are considered highly reactive to escalations within the geopolitical environment. This global exploitation activity has helped Russian Intelligence gain access to sensitive industries in numerous locations around the world.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s objectives\n\nRussia has previously deployed Sandworm for espionage and information operations as well as cyber-enabled disruptions. The cluster of activity covered in the report focuses on the specific subgroup responsible for gaining initial access into targets that may support future Russian intelligence priorities.\n\nOver the years, the operation has expanded beyond Eastern Europe into the U.S. and U.K.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the subgroup\u2019s targeting is opportunistic, its compromises cumulatively offer Seashell Blizzard options when responding to Russia\u2019s evolving strategic objectives,\u201d the researchers explained.\n\nThe group has focused on compromising internet-facing infrastructure to enable Sandworm to persist on high-value targets and support tailored network operations.\n\nSince early 2024, Microsoft incident responders observed the hackers exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-1709 \u2014 which affects IT remote management and monitoring software ConnectWise ScreenConnect \u2014 and CVE-2023-48788, which impacts Fortinet FortiClient EMS security software.\n\nThese operations evolved out of previous access efforts between 2021 and 2023 that focused on Ukraine and specific sectors in Central and South Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2022, its primary focus was on the energy, retail, education, consulting, and agriculture sectors in Ukraine but the next year it expanded globally.\n\n\u201cIt frequently prioritized sectors that either provided material support to the war in Ukraine or were geopolitically significant,\u201d the researchers said.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, while the exposure of multiple vulnerabilities likely offered the subgroup more access than ever, it appeared to have honed its focus to the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThere is some evidence that the group is somewhat opportunistic given that it was observed carrying out attacks on organizations that have no utility to Russian strategic interests. The company\u2019s incident responders saw \u201csignificant later post-compromise activity\u201d in targets that are strategically significant to Russia.\n\nMicrosoft was able to tie the subgroup to Sandworm based on the tactics used, the tools deployed and distinct post-compromise activities.\n\n\u201cWe have also observed the initial access subgroup to pursue access to an organization prior to a Seashell Blizzard-linked destructive attack,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cThis persistent access is noted in at least three cases to have preceded select destructive attacks attributed to Seashell Blizzard, highlighting that the subgroup may periodically enable destructive or disruptive attacks.\u201d\n\nThe group has used third-party internet scanning services to find targets and commonly exploit at least eight vulnerabilities, as follows:\n\nMicrosoft Exchange (CVE-2021-34473)\n\nZimbra Collaboration (CVE-2022-41352)\n\nOpenFire (CVE-2023-32315)\n\nJetBrains TeamCity (CVE-2023-42793)\n\nMicrosoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397)\n\nConnectwise ScreenConnect (CVE-2024-1709)\n\nFortinet FortiClient EMS (CVE-2023-48788)\n\nJBOSS (exact CVE is unknown)\n\nAfter exploiting bugs, the hackers deploy remote management tools like Atera Agent and Splashtop Remote Services to maintain their access to compromised systems.\n\nIn some cases, the hackers inserted malicious code into otherwise legitimate sign-in portals to steal credentials like usernames and passwords \u2014 allowing them to move laterally within organizations.\n\n\u201cThis subgroup has leveraged exploiting a variety of recent public vulnerabilities since late 2021. This shows a focus on being agile and keeping track of new CVEs as a potential way to gain access to targets quickly,\u201d DeGrippo explained.\n\nShe noted that historically, Sandworm\u2019s operations are assessed to be a key component of Russia\u2019s overall strategy for destabilizing Western institutions and emerging or established democracies, and has been one of the lead threat actors they have seen operational in Ukraine since the 2022 invasion.\n\nLast year, Ukraine\u2019s government said the group was responsible for attacks on nearly 20 energy facilities in the country in an effort to amplify the impact of Russian missile and drone strikes on critical infrastructure.\n\nUkraine\u2019s computer emergency response team (CERT-UA) said the hackers deployed several new and previously known malware variants to infect energy, water and heating suppliers in 10 regions of the country in March 2024.\n\nThe group has also been implicated in attacks on Ukraine\u2019s largest telecom, internet providers, government agencies and a popular Ukrainian military app. Google-owned Mandiant discovered in 2024 that the group established an infrastructure allowing Russian military forces to exfiltrate encrypted Telegram and Signal communications from mobile devices captured on the battlefield.",

The OCI Roving Edge is also being integrated into Menace.\n\n\"Microsoft has some pretty extraordinary things in the pipe on the AI and cloud computing side that will continue to power IVAS,\" Anduril founder Palmer Luckey said in a blog post.\n\n\"Tactical heads-up-displays that turn warfighters into technomancers and pair us with weaponized robotics were one of the products in the original Anduril pitch deck for a reason. The past eight years we have spent building Lattice have put Anduril in a position to make this type of thing actually useful in the way military strategists and technologists have long dreamed of, ever since Robert Heinlein\u2019s 1959 novel Starship Troopers. Not just day and night and thermal and ultraviolet, but peering into an idealized interactive real-time composite of past, present, and future that will quickly surpass traditional senses like vision and touch.\"\n\nLuckey is the founder of virtual reality headset company Oculus VR, which was acquired by Facebook (now Meta) for $2 billion in 2014. After falling out with CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2017, Luckey left to found Anduril alongside former Palantir Technologies executives Matt Grimm, Trae Stephens, and Brian Schimpf.\n\nIt has since won billions in military contracts, including involvement in the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System.",

            "content": "ZDNET\n\nMicrosoft's Patch Tuesday rollout for February is a big one, not simply in size but in scope. Rolled out on February 11, the latest updates not only add a few new features but squash several bugs, including a few critical security vulnerabilities.\n\nLet's start with the new features. The latest round of patches, available as KB5051987 for Windows 11 24H2 and KB5051989 for Windows 11 23H2, enhances built-in tools such as the Taskbar and File Explorer.\n\nAlso: Windows 11's bug-fixing update is making things worse\n\nAccording to its changelog, Microsoft says the update improves the previews and animations that appear when your cursor hovers over Taskbar icons. Next, a new icon appears in the System Tray when you use an app that supports Windows Studio Effects, which can display special effects through the front-facing camera on your PC or monitor. The update also adds a new simplified Chinese font called Simsun-ExtG.\n\nThere's one more. Windows can now automatically restart certain apps when you exit and then sign back in. To enable this option, go to Settings, select Accounts, and then click Sign in options. Turn on the switch for \"Automatically save my restartable apps and restart them when I sign back in.\"\n\nAs for File Explorer, the latest update adds a few tweaks. When you right-click on a drive or folder in the left pane, a \"New Folder\" command now appears in the context menu. Windows will now restore all previously open tabs in each File Explorer window if you check the box in Folder Options for \"Restore previous folder windows at logon.\"\n\nPrior to the update, File Explorer was also beset with a few glitches. A search that you ran might repeat when you didn't want it to. The date and time properties of a file could change after copying it. Icons on the details pane might not update if you switched between dark and light themes. And the search box may lose focus as you typed. Now these bugs have all been resolved.\n\nThe February Patch Tuesday update also fixes a number of other bugs, old and new.\n\nPreviously, the display of some games was oversaturated when you used Auto HDR. People who used USB audio devices with DACs (digital audio converters) could have encountered issues where the playback would stop. Another problem affected USB audio drivers connected to external devices, displaying an error that the device could not start. But those glitches should no longer plague Windows users.\n\nAlso: Microsoft has a big Windows 10 problem, and it's running out of time to solve it\n\nOne snafu introduced with the January 2025 security update prevented USB cameras from being recognized. Passkey users would sometimes get a one-minute timeout when using their passkeys through a mobile phone. And the Windows shutdown process could be slower with a controller connected to the computer. These three problems have also been fixed.\n\nThe February Patch Tuesday update also resolves several security holes in Windows. In total, 56 vulnerabilities are fixed, three of which are classified as critical. According to patch management provider Action1, two zero-day flaws have been patched, and an older zero-day fault has been further updated.\n\nRated as important, the CVE-2025-21391 flaw could have allowed an attacker to delete files on a targeted system. Another flaw rated as important, CVE-2025-21418, could have let an attacker remotely execute malicious code on a PC. The flaw labeled CVE-2025-21377 could have opened the door for someone to spoof the victim's authentication credentials. And a flaw rated as critical, CVE-2025-21376, could have allowed an attacker to run malicious code on an affected system.\n\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and how it helps your system run better)\n\nThe new KB5051987 and KB5051989 patches are the official and final versions of the preview updates that Microsoft launched on January 28. Those updates fixed some bugs but created a host of new ones. So far, the February patches appear to be more stable.\n\nThe latest patches are set as automatic updates, which means they should automatically get installed on your PC. Otherwise, head to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the Check for updates button to download and install them.",

The IVAS program represents a groundbreaking step forward in military technology, providing soldiers with a comprehensive, body-worn system that integrates advanced augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to give warfighters beyond line-of-sight perception capabilities, increasing combat effectiveness, survivability against drones, and accelerating mission command of unmanned systems.\n\nThis collaboration between Anduril and Microsoft leverages the distinct strengths of each company, ensuring continuity in the program while advancing IVAS goals of enhancing combat effectiveness, awareness and decision-making on the battlefield. Anduril\u2019s mission focus on innovation in defense technology, deep understanding of military requirements, and unique approach to manufacturing defense products will ensure future program development specifically tailored to the evolving needs of the Army as well as production at scale and at lower unit cost.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s advanced cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities will continue to provide a robust backbone for the program, enabling seamless data integration and real-time insights critical to soldier effectiveness. Artificial intelligence will be foundational to all technical innovations for national security missions, and the cloud is essential to successfully delivering AI whenever and wherever it is needed. Through this agreement, Anduril will establish Azure as its preferred hyperscale cloud to support its AI development. Azure, through its commercial, U.S. government and classified clouds, provides high resiliency, sophisticated capabilities, flexibility and advanced security, designed to meet the stringent compliance requirements of the nation\u2019s most sensitive data.\n\nSince its founding in 2017, Anduril has focused exclusively on developing advanced defense technologies to solve unique challenges for warfighters. Palmer Luckey, Anduril\u2019s founder, who previously revolutionized the VR industry with Oculus, brings unparalleled expertise and vision to this effort.\n\n\u201cThe IVAS program represents the future of mission command, combining technology and human capability to give soldiers the edge they need on the battlefield,\u201d said Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to create a military ecosystem where technology acts as an extension of human capability. By empowering soldiers with the tools they need to make faster, smarter decisions, we\u2019re building a future where technology and human ingenuity combine to ensure mission success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of the work our teams have put in to help the U.S. Army transform its concept of a soldier-borne, AR headset into reality with the IVAS program. Our Soldier-Centered Design approach helped reimagine technology development with the Army that continuously took in real-world soldier feedback to develop a product that soldiers love,\u201d said Robin Seiler, corporate vice president, Mixed Reality, Microsoft. \u201cWe are excited to partner with Anduril for the next phase of IVAS and leverage our combined strengths to meet our commitments on this vital program and deliver a game-changing capability for every U.S. soldier.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft and Anduril have previously collaborated to integrate Anduril\u2019s Lattice platform into IVAS to provide rapid AI-enabled situational awareness capabilities to enhance soldier safety and operational effectiveness. This new agreement brings Microsoft and Anduril closer together to maximize their unique expertise in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and defense manufacturing to further enhance technical developments and operational efficiencies.\n\nAbout Anduril Industries\n\nAnduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology.

            "content": "Microsoft today issued security updates to fix at least 56 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including two zero-day flaws that are being actively exploited.\n\nAll supported Windows operating systems will receive an update this month for a buffer overflow vulnerability that carries the catchy name CVE-2025-21418. This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction.\n\nTenable senior staff research engineer Satnam Narang noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component \u2014 three each year \u2014 including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).\n\n\u201cCVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,\u201d Narang said. \u201cAt this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.\u201d\n\nThe other zero-day, CVE-2025-21391, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft\u2019s advisory on this bug references something called \u201cCWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,\u201d says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low.\n\nAdam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that \u2018an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,\u2019 it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.\n\n\u201cAs long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,\u201dBarnett wrote.\n\nOne vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is CVE-2025-21377, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes \u2014 essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or \u201cperforming an action other than opening or executing the file.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft\u2019s way of saying \u2018if we told you any more, we\u2019d give the game away,'\u201d Barnett said. \u201cAccordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.\u201d\n\nThe SANS Internet Storm Center has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn\u2019t also bundled with Microsoft\u2019s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with Microsoft Office 365, which Redmond has since rebranded as \u201cMicrosoft 365 Copilot.\u201d Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.\n\nOffice-watch.com writes that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of \u201cMicrosoft 365 Classic,\u201d an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.\n\nIn other security patch news, Apple has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks.\n\nAdobe has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across InDesign, Commerce, Substance 3D Stager, InCopy, Illustrator, Substance 3D Designer and Photoshop Elements.\n\nChris Goettl at Ivanti notes that Google Chrome is shipping an update today which will trigger updates for Chromium based browsers including Microsoft Edge, so be on the lookout for Chrome and Edge updates as we proceed through the week.",

The system \u2014 which includes ruggedized headgear and software with night-vision, thermal-sensing and augmented reality capabilities, among others \u2014 was inspired by the company\u2019s HoloLens 2 device. The Army aims to use the equipment for training and battlefield operations for dismounted troops. The program was projected to be worth as much as $21.9 billion if it reaches full fruition.\n\n\u201cThrough this partnership agreement, and pending Department of Defense approval, Anduril will assume oversight of production, future development of hardware and software, and delivery timelines.

In September 2024, Anduril announced that its Lattice platform was being incorporated into the system. Lattice can be employed as a situational awareness tool that uses capabilities such as AI, computer vision, edge computing and sensor fusion to detect, track and classify objects of interest for users, according to a product description.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Army has been rolling out different variants of IVAS to soldiers for experimentation and to get their feedback on the technology. The latest iteration developed by Microsoft is known as IVAS 1.2. Microsoft had already been making enhancements to IVAS equipment and software, some of which were prompted by soldier complaints about early versions.\n\nThe Army requested $255 million from Congress for fiscal 2025 to buy more IVAS systems \u2014 including 3,162 IVAS 1.2 heads-up-display platforms \u2014 as well as $98 million for research, development, test and evaluation related to the technology.\n\nAnduril founder Palmer Luckey previously launched Oculus VR, the startup known for its commercial virtual reality headset which went on to be acquired by Facebook.\n\n\u201cFor me, this announcement is deeply personal. Since my pre-Oculus days as a teenager who had the opportunity to do a tiny bit of work on the Army\u2019s BRAVEMIND project, I\u2019ve believed there would be a headset on every soldier long before there is a headset on every civilian. Given that America loses more troops in training than combat, the Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) side of IVAS alone has the potential to save more lives than practically anything else we can imagine building,\u201d Luckey wrote in a blog \u2014 titled \u201cTurning Soldiers into Superheroes\u201d \u2014 published Tuesday.\n\nAnduril is also building a variety of drones and other high-tech tools, such as \u201cedge data integration services capabilities,\u201d for the Pentagon. In December, it announced that it was forming an alliance with Palantir and a new \u201cconsortium\u201d to merge AI capabilities for defense customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is touting its ability to deliver cloud capabilities to boost Anduril\u2019s products.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s advanced cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities will continue to provide a robust backbone for the [IVAS] program, enabling seamless data integration and real-time insights critical to soldier effectiveness.

Azure, through its commercial, U.S. government and classified clouds, provides high resiliency, sophisticated capabilities, flexibility and advanced security, designed to meet the stringent compliance requirements of the nation\u2019s most sensitive data,\u201d the companies said in a release.\n\nMicrosoft is already a major cloud vendor for the Pentagon. It\u2019s one of four companies \u2014 along with Google, Oracle and Amazon Web Services \u2014 that were chosen to compete for task orders for the $9 billion enterprise Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) program.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the DOD will approve the program handover that Microsoft and Anduril are proposing for IVAS.\n\nThe new partnership agreement comes at a critical time for the IVAS program. The plan was to transition it to a major capability acquisition pathway no later than October 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Army officials are preparing to potentially recompete the IVAS effort via an initiative known as IVAS Next.\n\nLast month, the service released a request for information for IVAS Next, seeking information from vendors to determine their capabilities to act as a prime contractor in the development and manufacturing of the technology.\n\n\u201cThis RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future,\u201d officials noted.\n\nCompanies were asked to include information about the design and features of their IVAS Next solution.\n\n\u201cThe narrative should cover Heads Up Display (HUD), body-worn compute, night vision capability, company-level communications network, and any software supporting services or systems (e.g., Cloud or Edge computing),\u201d officials wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVendors were also asked to lay out a program management approach for their IVAS Next solution, including identifying teaming arrangements and key subcontractors and suppliers.\n\nThe Microsoft and Anduril announcement was released on the same day that the Army had scheduled a virtual industry day for IVAS Next.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this event is to inform interested companies of the IVAS Next requirements and acquisition path and to hold an open forum for discussion of IVAS Next capability requirements,\u201d officials wrote in a special notice.\n\nLast year, DefenseScoop asked Anduril officials if the company was considering competing as a prime contractor for IVAS Next.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closely following the developments around IVAS-next and are confident that the combined strengths of Anduril and Microsoft can deliver a solution that enhances both soldier survivability and lethality. We will continue to monitor IVAS-next, and as always, we are committed to positioning ourselves to do what\u2019s best for the warfighter, staying true to our mission of delivering the most effective solutions,\u201d an Anduril spokesperson said.",

Vulnerabilities with high-severity base scores run across multiple Microsoft systems, impacting Windows Telephony Service, Windows Ancillary Function Driver, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and other key services.\n\nThe vendor\u2019s monthly batch of patches addresses two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities: privilege escalation flaws in Windows Storage, tracked as CVE-2025-21391, and Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock, tracked as CVE-2025-21418.\n\nThe actively exploited vulnerability in Windows Storage, an improper link resolution before file access defect with a CVSS score of 7.1, allows an attacker to delete targeted files on a system. Microsoft said the vulnerability doesn\u2019t put confidential data at risk, but noted it could allow an attacker to delete data, rendering the service inoperable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttackers who combine CVE-2025-21391 exploits with other vulnerabilities could escalate privileges and cause more severe damage, according to Mike Walters, president and co-founder of Action1.\n\n\u201cLarge organizations with numerous Windows systems are at significant risk due to the widespread use of Windows Storage features,\u201d Walters said in an email. \u201cGiven the ubiquity of Windows operating systems in business environments, potentially millions of organizations worldwide could be at risk. The actual number depends on Windows version adoption rates and existing security measures.\u201d\n\nThe second zero-day addressed by Microsoft, a heap-based overflow vulnerability impacting Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock, allows an attacker to gain system privileges and carries a CVSS score of 7.8.\n\nAdam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said in an email that organizations have used the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for foundational networking functionality for decades, effectively as a kernel driver that interacts with large amounts of user-supplied input.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is aware of existing exploitation in the wild, and with low attack complexity, low privilege requirements, and no requirement for user interaction, CVE-2025-21418 is one to prioritize for patching,\u201d Barnett told CyberScoop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft designated nine of the vulnerabilities addressed in the security update as \u201cmore likely\u201d to be exploited. The majority of those defects carry high-severity scores on the CVSS scale, including CVE-2025-21400, a remote-code execution flaw in Microsoft SharePoint Server, and a pair of privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows CoreMessaging, CVE-2025-21184 and CVE-2025-21358.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s exploitability likelihood rating is somewhat opaque, but to add more context about the nine vulnerabilities labeled likely to be exploited, we know that they all had low or no privileges required to exploit, and two of them had public exploit code available,\u201d Jackson Rolf, security analyst at Censys, said in an email to CyberScoop.\n\nRolf noted that six of the vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft this month are remote-code execution flaws impacting the Windows Telephony Service. The group of flaws carry low attack complexity and don\u2019t require privileges for exploitation, he added.\n\nThe sole critical-severity vulnerability covered in Microsoft\u2019s security update, CVE-2025-21198, is a remote-code execution flaw impacting the Linux agent in Microsoft High Performance Compute clusters. It requires an attacker to have access to the network connected to the targeted cluster or Linux compute node.\n\nThe full list of vulnerabilities addressed this month is available in Microsoft\u2019s Security Response Center.",

            "content": "Patch Tuesday Microsoft\u2019s February patch collection is mercifully smaller than January\u2019s mega-dump. But don't get too relaxed \u2013 some deserve close attention, and other vendors have stepped in with plenty more fixes.\n\nOf the 63 patches (including six released earlier in the month) Microsoft announced, two are already being exploited.\n\nBoth require attackers to be local and authenticated. One is CVE-2025-21418: A CVSS 7.8-scored elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock that allows an attacker to execute a specially crafted program to gain SYSTEM-level privileges. The flaw affects machines running Windows 10, 11, and various versions of Windows Server.\n\nThe other: CVE-2025-21391, a CVSS 7.1-rated elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that means a local attacker can delete files under limited and vague conditions. As Windows Storage is present in Windows Server, that raises the possibility that data apps rely on could be deleted.\n\nMicrosoft also detailed two issues that are publicly known, even if they haven't yet been exploited. Those of you with Surface kit - a laptop or tablet \u2013 may wish to consider fixing CVE-2025-21194, a 7.1-rated vulnerability that means some PCs are susceptible to compromise of the hypervisor and the secure kernel.\n\nHypervisor compromises are very nasty, but Microsoft says exploiting this flaw \u201crequires multiple conditions to be met, such as specific application behavior, user actions, manipulation of parameters passed to a function, and impersonation of an integrity level token.\u201d\n\nThe other known vulnerability is CVE-2025-21377, which could leak a user's NTLMv2 hash. What makes this CVSS 6.5 flaw particularly annoying is that the user doesn't need to do much\u2014simply selecting the file (single-click), right-clicking to inspect it, or performing another action short of opening or executing it can trigger the vulnerability.\n\nWe also shouldn't skip over CVE-2025-21376, a wormable remote-code execution flaw (a buffer overflow) in Windows LDAP that can be used to hijack a machine and make it attack others.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s highest-scored February flaw is CVE-2025-21198, which earned a 9.0 CVSS rating. This one could have serious consequences for high-performance computing infrastructure by allowing remote code execution. The attacker would need access to the network connecting machines in a targeted HPC cluster, but once exploited, this flaw could extend to other clusters and nodes within the same network.\n\n\"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the targeted head node or Linux compute node granting them the ability to perform RCE on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node,\" Microsoft warned.\n\nExcel received five patches this month - all rated 7.8 \u2013 with one deemed a critical patching priority by Redmond and four classed as important. CVE-2025-21381 is the one Microsoft wants you to fix first as it allows remote code execution, though technically classified as a local attack. The \"remote\" aspect refers to how the attacker delivers the malicious file to abuse the bug. In this case, an attacker could use social engineering to trick a victim into opening a specially crafted file, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nMicrosoft also urges attention to CVE-2025-21379, a flaw in the DHCP Client Service for all builds of Windows. The 7.1-rated bug is hard to exploit and requires an attacker to thoroughly map the network and execute a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack with precision. If an attacker can do that, they may be deep in your infrastructure by the time they get around to targeting this flaw.\n\nDomain controllers get tough Admins should be on alert as Microsoft\u2019s changes to certificate-based authentication on domain controllers come into force on February 11. \"By February 2025, if the StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement registry key is not configured, domain controllers will move to Full Enforcement mode. Otherwise, the registry keys Compatibility mode setting will continue to be honored,\" Redmond warned in an advisory. \"In Full Enforcement mode, if a certificate fails the strong (secure) mapping criteria (see Certificate mappings), authentication will be denied. However, the option to move back to Compatibility mode will remain until September 2025.\" In practice, this means some certificate mappings may need to be reconfigured, especially if certificates contain conflicts like User Principal Names (UPNs) overlapping with sAMAccountNames or missing dollar signs at the end of machine names. After installing the patches, keep an eye on audit logs for unusual Event IDs that might indicate problematic certificates\u2014these will be your early warning system.\n\nTechnically CVE-2025-21177, a CVSS 8.7 flaw that allows an elevation of privileges attack against Dynamics 365, is also rated critical by Microsoft. Thankfully, however, Redmond has already fully mitigated this vulnerability, and there's no action required from users.\n\nIf you're a Windows Telephony user, six patches await - all ranked as important by Redmond and with CVSS scores of 8.8. For Office users, Microsoft has patched multiple vulnerabilities, including a couple of remote code execution flaws and a spoofing vulnerability affecting the suite.\n\nOther vendors patch, too\n\nIt wouldn't be a Patch Tuesday without Adobe adding to the load with 45 patches - although unusually there's no patches for Acrobat this month.\n\n31 of the patches apply to Adobe Commerce, to fix cross-site scripting (XSS) bugs, security feature bypasses, and Critical-rated code execution flaws. Users of the open source Magneto software should prioritize these updates, as that project remains a frequent target of attacks.\n\nInDesign gets seven bug fixes, four of them rated critical, while Illustrator's three critical-rated bugs could lead to arbitrary code execution when opening a malicious file.\n\nSubstance 3D and InCopy both receive a single critical-rated code execution fix, while Photoshop Elements is patched for an important-rated privilege escalation flaw, applicable to macOS on Arm.\n\nSAP pushed out 21 individual patches, ranging in CVSS score from 8.8 to 3.1. The bulk apply to NetWeaver, including a cross-site scripting issue. Additionally, SAP\u2019s Enterprise Project Connection gets a patch that fixes multiple problems.\n\nFortinet has issued security updates for multiple products, notably addressing a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy. With a CVSS score of 9.6, this one looks like a strong candidate to be applied in your next change window. \u00ae",

A search for Gulf of America takes users to the correct location of the gulf and maintains the label as Gulf of Mexico.\n\nA representative for Mapquest didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaps sites say the change is determined by region\n\nBefore Apple began to make the change, some people on social media said that Google's adoption of the name change was enough to make them switch to alternate map software from Apple and Microsoft. One person wrote on X, \"It gives me no pleasure to announce that Apple Maps and Bing Maps are not superior to Google.\"\n\nA representative for Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle said in late January it would be making the change after an executive order from President Donald Trump called for renaming the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. Google said in a series of social media posts that it was complying with Global Navigation Information Systems data and that it would take some time for the update to go through. On Feb. 10, Google published a blog post letting users know what they will see in its software.\n\nIn the post, the company said, \"The names you see in the Maps app are based on your country location, which is determined by information from your phone's operating system (e.g., iOS and Android), including your SIM, network and locale.

AI tools demand a robust foundation that improves security and privacy to keep organizations protected. Combining this secure foundation with productivity tools will empower employees to take full advantage of the potential of AI. As organizations embrace AI and productivity tools to transform their businesses, their IT infrastructures must continue to evolve to keep pace. Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 Copilot play pivotal roles in this transformation, fostering a culture of innovation and accelerating business outcomes\u2014essential for modern IT infrastructure.\n\nA new 2025 Total Economic Impact\u2122 study conducted by Forrester Consulting, commissioned by Microsoft, found that adopting Microsoft 365 E3 provides the composite organization, which is a representative of the interviewees\u2019 and survey respondents\u2019 organizations, a three-year return on investment of 197 percent and a payback period of less than six months. It also allows the composite organization to realize benefits of USD153.21 million over three years versus a cost of USD51.65 million, adding up to a net present value (NPV) of USD101.56 million. The study also highlights how organizations can boost productivity for end-users and IT teams; elevate security to reduce the likelihood of breaches; and reduce IT costs while also reducing complexity by adopting Microsoft 365 E3, Teams, and Microsoft 365 Copilot:\n\nBoost productivity and enhance business outcomes. In the quest to maximize efficiency and increase performance, many organizations are exploring the benefits of more comprehensive productivity and AI solutions. By transitioning to Microsoft 365 E3 and Teams, the composite organization can achieve end-user productivity savings of more than 70 hours per year. They were able to gain productivity savings of an additional 108 hours per year for each Microsoft 365 Copilot user in the organization. An energy customer noted, \u201cThe collaboration benefits we get on Microsoft 365 [E3] and Microsoft Teams are second to none.\u201d Productivity enhancements also extended to IT operations with the composite organization saving more than 25,000 hours on endpoint deployment and management. This reduction in IT burden gave the composite organization the opportunity to shift some of its IT resources\u2019 focus to projects that more directly impact business outcomes, like building line of business applications. These productivity gains, coupled with cost savings, highlight the strategic value of Microsoft 365 E3 alongside Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nElevate security and reduce the likelihood of breaches. In this era of digital transformation and AI, elevating security is paramount for organizations making the move to the cloud and deploying AI solutions. More specifically, moving to Microsoft 365 E3 and deploying included features such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P1, Microsoft Entra ID P1, and Microsoft Purview capabilities, the composite organization is able to reduce the likelihood of breaches on addressable threats by 50%. Interviewees also stated that Microsoft\u2019s security reputation influenced their investment decisions, while Microsoft\u2019s solutions provided their organization with the tools they needed to enable secure remote work, manage Shadow IT, protect business information, safeguard their endpoints, and much more. A pharmaceuticals customer shared, \u201cAs a pharmaceutical company, security is a very important pillar of our IT strategy\u2026 [functionality] like multifactor authentication and self-service password reset [through Microsoft 365 E3] are very valuable features.\u201d Embracing robust security measures not only fortifies an organization\u2019s defenses but also instills confidence in rolling out AI solutions like Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nReduce costs and optimize IT enablement. In addition to boosting productivity and elevating security, Microsoft 365 E3 is instrumental in improving IT infrastructure and management capabilities. Optimizing IT infrastructure using the IT management tools in Microsoft 365 E3 helped the composite organization reduce support tickets by 45% and improve their resolution time by 21%. The composite organization was also able to consolidate multiple vendor solutions into a comprehensive suite with Microsoft 365 E3 and Teams, allowing them to eliminate redundant licenses and reduce infrastructure support costs. This gave the composite organization a vendor consolidation savings of USD60 per user per month. An automotive customer noted, \u201c[With Microsoft 365 E3] we need fewer IT administrators, fewer developers\u2014fewer people doing regular IT operations and patching because all of that is taken care of by Microsoft. These people now [focus on] ensuring we\u2019re working according to the requirements of the business. The nature of our work has changed.\u201d By adopting Microsoft 365 E3, organizations can start to streamline their IT operations, save costs, and reduce complexities. These cost savings and operational optimizations are essential for organizations to maximize their investments while fostering a more resilient and agile IT environment.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving digital landscape, Microsoft 365 E3 emerges as a transformative solution, empowering organizations to enhance productivity, bolster security, and optimize IT operations while seamlessly integrating AI capabilities.

            "content": "Bill Gates reflects on his youth, beginnings of Microsoft, in new memoir\n\ntoggle caption Mitra Arthur/NPR\n\nBill Gates tends to look towards the future.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he envisioned a future of mass personal computing. Today, his work revolves around other initiatives, such as the future of global health. Even his books tend to be about how to navigate an imagined future \u2014 one published in 1995 was titled The Road Ahead. But now, in a new memoir, he's looking back in time.\n\n\"It was only as I was turning 70 this year, and Microsoft turning 50, that I decided, OK maybe it is time to look back a bit,\" he told NPR's All Things Considered.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGates channeled that reflective mood into Source Code: My Beginnings, the first installment of a two-part autobiography. It describes, in detail, the adolescence and early adult life of one of America's most consequential entrepreneurs.\n\nGates recently sat down with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow at NPR headquarters to talk about a variety of topics: sneaking out to the computer lab in the middle of the night as a teenager; how he and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen outwitted the established computing industry as young upstarts; and his thoughts on the current state of global health initiatives as the Trump administration takes office.\n\nSee the full video of their conversation above, and highlights from the radio broadcast below.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nScott Detrow: What do you think about the person you were as a pre-teen, as a teenager? Because there's a lot of time in this book where you write about it, and at times you write with regret or embarrassment, or reflectiveness, but it's also clear that a lot of those traits helped you become who you were down the line as an adult.\n\nBill Gates: I mean, I blushed, thinking of how I could be abrasive or, you know, things like where I told my professor when he was wrong and turned out I was completely wrong. You know, I wanted to get that off my chest because I've always felt bad about it. And he was very gracious when I spoke to him recently.\n\nDetrow: The thing that I was thinking about reading this is I'm wondering what you think about the idea, like how much of this path to success is replicable in 2025? Because on one hand, you have this industry being created around you in the moment. You're in the right place at the right time. The industry is exponentially expanding. But on the other hand, there's like this level of freedom that a teenager can have to go sneak out your window in code at two in the morning and then to like to ride the bus to another city. And code sensitive infrastructure, like. Like It feels like a Ferris Bueller movie type thing where just like clearly no teen would be able to do that today. Like, is any of this replicable these days?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGates: There's no doubt that kids are more subject to restrictions. Even the hiking that I did where my parents didn't know where we were. It's not how I raise children. We were a lot tighter. And there is some pushback on that because you don't mature in quite the same way. You don't get to make the same mistakes. You know, I still think there will be unbelievable entrepreneurs, you know, companies like Nvidia. But I was lucky that Paul Allen I saw personal computing and the role of software and almost nobody else did. Even the big companies, particularly IBM, didn't see what we saw. So you always when you have lots of companies, you have to find a flaw in their thinking. Yeah. And so it'd be tougher today.\n\ntoggle caption Koichi Kamoshida/Getty Images\n\nDetrow: Do you remember the moment when you and the other kids at the computer lab realized like, okay, in the next 20 years, everyone's going to have a computer? Like, do you remember when that clicked into place? Like this is going to happen?\n\nGates: Yeah, when I helped Paul get a job in Boston and he moved out my sophomore year, we were already writing that there would be a computer on every desk and in every home. And that became sort of the founding slogan of Microsoft. Actually, we added the words running Microsoft software, which was kind of the self-centered piece. And I was going to professors and saying, look, computing is going to become free because of this exponential improvement. And, you know, let's get involved in thinking that through. And people just didn't see it. That kind of surprised us, but it's what gave us the edge. You know, Paul wanted to do personal computers. I said, no, no, let's just do the software piece. And then when the first kid computer comes out, that's when I know to be in on the ground floor of the revolution. We'd been waiting for that. I had to drop out.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDetrow: Why do you think it was a bunch of kids who saw that so clearly? And professors and big companies and all of the existing infrastructure didn't quite see it the same way that you did.\n\nGates: Well, once you get your mindset that computers are these rare, expensive things and you've been spending your time thinking about how you make them a little more efficient and a little less expensive when somebody who's young and hasn't been around can say, wait a minute, exponential improvement. You know, that's the chip industry often in California, Intel and the computer industry, both IBM and the mini-computer companies that are mostly up in the Boston area, they're not really tracking that. I mean, Paul and I, the minute the 8080 chip was announced in 1973, Paul says to me, Is this one good enough? And I said, Paul, this thing is better than the most popular mini-computer, which was a $20,000 machine. And so we were like, Wow, how come everybody's not their mind isn't blown? You know, when we show up and actually call the company with that computer, you know, they were amazed.\n\nThe Gates Foundation is a financial supporter of NPR.",

Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

Its end of support date will be June 30, 2028. Microsoft is encouraging customers to use this extended deprecation period to transition to the Customer Service workspace (CSW) application.\n\nCustomer Service workspace is Microsoft\u2019s flagship application for modern CS experiences. The company is continuously updating the application with more AI and innovation. New features like multi-session, channels, autonomous agents, and Copilot, are unavailable to customers in the Unified Service Desk application.\n\nThis upcoming change will affect USD customers currently using the application with the cloud-based CRM feature.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nKey dates:\n\nDeprecation: April 1, 2026. After this date, Microsoft is no longer going to invest in the USD with CRM Online application. All versions before the latest update will no longer have access Dataverse as they will lack critical security features.\n\nEnd of Service: April 30, 2027. After this date, the USD with CRM Online application will no longer receive quality or security updates.\n\nEnd of Support: June 30, 2028. After this date, Microsoft will no longer support the USD with CRM Online application. It will be taken out of service.\n\nNext steps:\n\nThere will be no change to Unified Service Desk with CRM Online availability until the end of support on June 30, 2028. Microsoft is urging customers to begin migrating to the new application. Due to security upgrades, customers who are unable to migrate to Customer Service workspace by April 2026 must update to the latest version of USD. Microsoft is encouraging customers who update to the latest USD version to move to Customer Service workspace by its end of service date in April 2027, and June 2028 at the latest when the application will reach end of life.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nThe scoop on CSW. Microsoft\u2019s Customer Service Workspace (CSW) is a multi-session app designed to enhance agent productivity, streamline workflows, and improve customer interactions. CSW enables agents to handle multiple cases simultaneously within a tabbed interface, and supports AI-driven case routing and prioritization, optimizing agent workloads. Each session operates independently, ensuring context retention across different customer interactions. Microsoft Copilot assists agents with AI-driven insights, auto-summarization, and response suggestions. AI-powered real-time translation and sentiment analysis enhance customer interactions. And automated workflows reduce manual efforts, speeding up case resolution. CSW integrates CRM, case histories, and customer profiles in a single view and helps agents track past interactions across multiple channels, while providing 360-degree customer insights, improving engagement and personalization. The application provides seamless support for email, chat, voice, and social media from within the workspace, and has built-in integration with Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform. CSW is built on Microsoft Azure, ensuring enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability, and offers role-based access controls for data security along with low-code extensibility with Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\nShould you stay, or should you go? There are plenty of good reasons to move from USD to CSW. CSW is cloud-based, eliminating the need for on-premises installations and updates. It provides better scalability and security compared to the legacy USD solution. It offers an intuitive, modern UI with a tab-based layout for better navigation, and it reduces agent fatigue by offering a cleaner and more user-friendly interface. Also, as stated above, in CSW the AI-powered Copilot provides real-time suggestions, automates repetitive tasks, and improves agent productivity. CSW is also optimized for faster load times and better stability than USD, which relied heavily on on-prem hardware and legacy CRM frameworks. CSW customers benefit from seamless integration with Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Teams, Power Platform, Azure, and other Microsoft tools, and the application works well with Microsoft Omnichannel for Customer Service. All of that said, USD customers following Microsoft\u2019s guidance to move to CSW sooner rather than later should be aware of a few potential challenges. Some advanced customization options in USD (like deeply embedded workflows and automations) may not yet be available in CSW. Multi-session management in CSW is still evolving, and some legacy USD features may not have direct equivalents. Also, customization and scripting built into USD may not transfer directly to CSW, requiring refactoring. Organizations with complex agent desktop setups may face downtime or disruptions during the migration process. Agents accustomed to USD may require training and onboarding for CSW\u2019s new UI and workflows. Customization requires different skill sets (Power Platform & Dataverse instead of USD\u2019s traditional hosted control framework). Also, some organizations may need to wait for additional feature parity before moving, especially those relying on legacy CTI integrations or custom UI components in USD. While CSW is bundled with Dynamics 365 Customer Service, some organizations may need additional licensing for Omnichannel, Copilot AI, or Power Platform-based customizations.\n\nEmulate other customers\u2019 successes with CSW. Organizations across various industries have leveraged Microsoft\u2019s Customer Service Workspace and related technologies to enhance their service delivery and operational efficiency. For instance, G&J Pepsi embarked on a transformation journey to maximize customer service, revenue, and cost savings by implementing solutions including Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, and other Microsoft technologies. This integration led to significant improvements in service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Ernst & Young Limited (EY), one of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, transformed its sales processes with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales. This implementation streamlined their operations, leading to enhanced client interactions and improved service delivery. And Sweco Group empowered its architects and engineers with a timesaving AI assistant built in Azure AI Studio. This custom Copilot automates document tasks, boosts productivity, and frees up time for creativity and customer support.",

            "content": "Bill Gates details his early relationship with Steve Ballmer in his new \"Source Code\" memoir.\n\nBallmer mirrored Gates' energy, boosted his social life, and became the business partner he needed.\n\nGates gave Ballmer a 4% stake in Microsoft that's now worth more than $120 billion.\n\nBill Gates found a kindred spirit, a social connector, a confidant, a study buddy, and a true business partner in Steve Ballmer, he writes in his new memoir, \"Source Code: My Beginnings.\"\n\nGates, the billionaire philanthropist who cofounded Microsoft, met Ballmer in a graduate economics class in the fall of 1976, when the pair were undergraduates at Harvard University.\n\nThe computing pioneer had heard from a friend that \"Steve's a lot like you\" and instantly recognized that Ballmer shared his \"excess energy.\"\n\n\"Steve Ballmer had it beyond anyone I had ever known,\" Gates writes.\n\nBallmer was different from many of the students in Gates' dorm building, \"nerdy math-science types\" who largely socialized by playing Pong or poker in the basement.\n\n\"He had an unusual combination of brains and physicality and was effortlessly social,\" Gates writes, adding that Ballmer managed the university's football team, oversaw advertising at its student newspaper, and was president of its literary magazine.\n\nThe future software tycoon recalled attending a football game and seeing Ballmer \"expend just as much energy pacing and bouncing on the sidelines\" as anyone on the field.\n\nGates writes that Ballmer widened his social circle and helped secure his entry into the exclusive Fox Club, known for its \"black-tie parties, secret handshakes, and other archaic rules and rituals\" that Gates would usually have avoided.\n\nMicrosoft's first CEO writes that he and his future successor spoke late at night about their life goals, whether it was better to work for the government or a company, and how they could improve society and maximize their impact on the world.\n\nThey also skipped most of their economics lectures, crammed together for the final, and were \"triumphant\" when they passed.\n\nBringing Ballmer on board\n\nGates had founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. They initially had a 60-40 split, but Gates felt he was more committed to building the company, so he negotiated with Allen to make it 64-36.\n\nHe also realized he needed an around-the-clock business partner to talk through key decisions, pore over customer lists, manage the company's finances, and help him with \"shouldering a hundred things like that every week.\"\n\nGates eventually gave his additional 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school for Microsoft. \"He joined in 1980 and became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,\" Gates wrote.\n\nBallmer owns the LA Clippers basketball team. Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n\nBallmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft CEO in 2000 and still owned 4% of the company when he stepped down in 2014, regulatory filings show.\n\nThe LA Clippers owner's stake is worth more than $120 billion and makes up the bulk of his estimated $145 billion net worth \u2014 putting him in 10th place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, just behind Warren Buffett and only three spots behind Gates.",

            "content": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive business environment, seamless communication and enhanced productivity with security are not just desirable \u2014 they are essential. That is why more companies are using Microsoft Teams. This platform has changed how organizations work together and succeed in a digital world. An experienced managed services provider can help companies incorporate Teams into their network in an efficient, secure manner.\n\nNetwork communications in Teams are encrypted by default. By requiring all servers to use certificates \u2013 and by using OAUTH (a technological standard that authorizes one app or service to sign in to another without divulging private information, such as passwords), transport layer security, and secure real-time transport protocol \u2013 all Teams data is protected on the network.\n\nSignificant technological advancements have marked the journey from traditional office setups to remote and hybrid work environments. In the early 2000s, email was the primary mode of professional communication. While effective, it often led to cluttered inboxes and delayed responses. Early instant messaging platforms introduced real-time communication but lacked the integration and security for comprehensive project management.\n\nOne of the standout features of Microsoft Teams is its ability to enhance productivity across industries. The platform works well with other Microsoft 365 apps, like Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Users can create, edit and share documents without leaving the Teams interface. The seamless, secure integration reduces the time switching between applications, enabling employees to focus on tasks like:\n\nGlobal Marketing: Employee groups can use Teams to coordinate campaigns across different regions. You can create channels for local teams to talk about strategies and share resources. Video features help everyone stay connected. Shared and secure OneDrive folders make sure all campaign materials are easy to access.\n\nEmployee groups can use Teams to coordinate campaigns across different regions.

Retailer Communications: Retail store managers and staff can connect instantly, share updates, and coordinate daily tasks through group chats and channels. This ensures everyone is on the same page and can respond quickly to customer needs or store issues. Teams can connect with inventory management systems. This helps staff track stock levels, place orders and get alerts for low-stock items.\n\nRetail store managers and staff can connect instantly, share updates, and coordinate daily tasks through group chats and channels.

Staff can view their schedules, request time off and swap shifts with coworkers all within the Teams platform, making shift management more streamlined and transparent. Workflows: Teams\u2019 robust project management capabilities can streamline workflows. You can create channels for different projects or departments, ensuring that relevant information remains easily accessible. Within these channels, users can share files, hold discussions and set up meetings \u2014 all in one place. This centralized approach minimizes the risk of miscommunication while maximizing safety and ensures everyone is on the same page.\n\nThe platform\u2019s task management features, such as Planner and To-Do, further enhance productivity. Teams can assign tasks, set deadlines and track progress, ensuring that projects stay on track. The ability to integrate third-party apps provides additional flexibility for organizations with specific project management needs.\n\nSecurity-first communication\n\nEffective, security-first communication is a cornerstone of any successful organization, and Microsoft Teams excels in this area. The platform offers a variety of communication tools, including chat, voice calls and video conferencing. These tools cater to different communication preferences and ensure that teams can stay connected, regardless of location.\n\nThe chat feature allows for quick, informal conversations, reducing the need for lengthy email threads. Users can create group chats for team discussions or one-on-one chats for private conversations. The ability to share files and links within the chat enhances collaboration and ensures that important information is readily available.\n\nVoice and video calls are integral to maintaining a human connection in remote work environments. Teams\u2019 high-quality audio and video capabilities make virtual meetings feel more personal and engaging. And because the platform works with Outlook, users can schedule and join meetings right from their calendars. This makes the process easier and helps avoid scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to remote work, and many organizations have since adopted a hybrid work model. Microsoft Teams has proven to be an invaluable tool in this transition. Its cloud-based nature ensures that employees can access their work anywhere, on any device. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining productivity and communication in a hybrid work environment.\n\nTeams\u2019 collaboration features let employees work together easily. They can co-author documents in real time, no matter where they are. The platform\u2019s security features, including data encryption and multifactor authentication, protect sensitive information, even when users access it remotely.\n\nTeams continues to evolve. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be important for the future of Teams, and we can anticipate features like automated meeting notes, smart task prioritization and better analytics. Businesses that work with an experienced MSP can fully realize the benefits from the seamless integration that Teams offers with other Microsoft 365 applications, robust project management capabilities, and versatile communication tools that make it an indispensable asset for modern businesses.\n\nCarl Mazzanti is president of eMazzanti Technologies in Hoboken, providing IT consulting and cybersecurity services for businesses ranging from home offices to multinational corporations.",

As research continues, many countries have banned the app from sensitive systems, and other countries and organizations, including the US, are also considering banning it.\n\nThe Trump administration announced the Stargate project to accelerate AI development in the US. This was done while simultaneously revoking several federal regulations, which could slow development. Many of these regulations addressed safety and security restrictions to prevent cyberattacks on people and infrastructure. It is unclear at this point which, if any, federal organizations will be tasked with overseeing new AI initiatives. As I mentioned in previous months, Microsoft and others have embraced AI for security and many other functions, so it remains to be seen how this new AI direction will factor into our patch operations in the months and years ahead.\n\nMass patching\n\nPatch releases have also contributed to the January whirlwind, with Microsoft addressing near-record numbers of CVEs in their Patch Tuesday updates. There were 130 CVEs fixed in Windows 10 and 11, including three zero-day and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. There were also critical fixes for all versions of Microsoft Office and an important update for SharePoint Server and .NET framework release.\n\nEOL woes\n\nIt\u2019s still early February, but everyone should be planning and budgeting to address all the products reaching their end-of-life later this year. Microsoft sent out reminders several times this month. The largest for most of us to deal with is the last security update for Windows 10 coming on October 14th. Estimates show 40%+ of all Windows desktop machines are still running this operating system. The latest and final version is Windows 10 22H2.\n\nAs part of a phased rollout, Microsoft announced they are now offering Windows 11 24H2 to eligible Windows 10 22H2 devices. If you have devices which need to continue running Windows 10, there is a 3-year ESU program starting in November but that gets expensive as the price doubles each year for these security updates. Also on October 14th, Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 will reach the end of support.\n\nIn the continued march to the cloud, Microsoft recommends migrating to Exchange Online or Microsoft 365. And finally, don\u2019t forget that Microsoft will deprecate WSUS driver synchronization on April 18, 2025. They will continue to be available in the update catalog, but you won\u2019t be able to import them into WSUS. Microsoft has some migration recommendations in its latest announcement.\n\nApple\n\nApple issued security updates for multiple products on January 27th which included a fix for its first zero-day vulnerability CVE-2025-24085 allowing privilege escalation. Apple acknowledged this vulnerability was under active exploitation. In addition to this vulnerability, there were up to 28 additional fixes depending upon the product. If you haven\u2019t already deployed these updates, ensure they are part of next week\u2019s Patch Tuesday program.\n\nFebruary 2025 Patch Tuesday forecast\n\nCan Microsoft continue to release updates addressing such large numbers of CVEs? I suspect we\u2019ll see the usual 40-50 next week scattered over the usual supported operating systems and Office updates. We saw a .NET framework release last month, so don\u2019t anticipate another.\n\nAdobe updated some of their bigger products like Photoshop, Illustrator and Animate last month. We may see some minor releases next week, but don\u2019t expect many.\n\nApple released security updates for almost all their product line, which included Ventura 13.7.3, Sonoma 14.7.3, Sequoia 15.3, Safari 18.3 and iOS 18.3. The next round of updates will probably come in five to six weeks.\n\nGoogle Chrome Dev for Desktop beta came out last week, so expect the usual drop this week.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation released security updates for all their products on February 4th. All the updates were rated High with 12 vulnerabilities reported in Firefox. These releases were Thunderbird ESR 128.7 and Thunderbird 135, Firefox ESR 115.20, Firefox ESR 128.7, and finally Firefox 135. Be sure to include these in your Patch Tuesday mix if you haven\u2019t deployed them already.\n\nI told you last month to hang on for a fun ride! The roller coaster is just getting started.",

He had that and I didn't \u2014 I envy how genius he was at that,\" Gates told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\n\"But he was not an engineer. He would not know what source code was. He didn't really know about chip design, although his ability to pick people who worked in those areas was amazingly good.\"\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nJobs co-founded Apple in 1976, was ousted in 1985 by its board and CEO John Sculley, and returned in heroic fashion to revitalize the company in 1997.\n\nThat's when a tighter bond between Jobs, the obsessive designer, and Gates, the obsessive engineer, was formed.\n\nJobs was onstage at the MacWorld event, decked out in a black vest and dark jeans, when he announced a new partnership with Microsoft that came along with a $150 million investment.\n\nMicrosoft promised to develop its Office apps for the Macintosh computer for at least five years. They also agreed to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the default web browser for the Mac.\n\nGates says Jobs learned a good bit about engineering from him and his Microsoft teams.\n\nWatch: What this former Apple board member learned from Steve Jobs\n\n\"Steve would say something like, okay, I don't want any software to have manuals, which, okay, that's a nice thing to say. But actually we still did need to have help and some documentation. So we got kind of the best of both worlds where he would push, and I had engineering teams that we really had to do the work,\" Gates said.\n\nJobs died in October 2011 of cancer, but he left a lasting impression on the world through game-changing products like the iPhone, iPad, and App store.\n\nToday, Apple is valued at $3.44 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance data. Microsoft's market cap stands at $3.04 trillion.\n\nWith Microsoft turning 50 this year and a newly released book about his life called \"Source Code: My Beginning,\" it\u2019s no surprise that many want to take a deeper look at what makes Bill Gates tick.\n\nIn the book, Gates chronicles his upper-middle-class childhood in Seattle up to the very start of Microsoft in 1975 alongside friend and co-founder Paul Allen. The book has a few stories that would come as a surprise to Microsoft investors, besides the tale of Gates first meeting a brash Jobs at a conference in the late 70s.",

Advertising space is at a premium and hugely expensive. The price of a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LIX is an eye-watering $8 million - up a million dollars from last year.\n\nCommercials have been an integral part of the Super Bowl experience since televisions became more affordable for US households in the 1960s.\n\nMany have become iconic for the way they tap into the mood of the moment, for their cinematic qualities, special effects or just for making people laugh.\n\n41 years ago today, the @Raiders etched their name in Super Bowl history! \ud83c\udfc6 On January 22, 1984, the Silver & Black dominated Washington, 38-9, in Super Bowl XVIII, setting a record for the most points scored by an AFC team in a Super Bowl\u2014a record that stood untouched until the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/d3srClcPwU \u2014 Pro Football Hall of Fame (@ProFootballHOF) January 22, 2025\n\nArguably the most iconic Super Bowl ad of all was Apple\u2019s famous 1984 commercial shown during a timeout in the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII between the Redskins and the Raiders on 22 January 1984.\n\nIt was one of 19 ads shown during the game, and one of four promoting the latest advancements in home computers in the new digital age.\n\nSteve Hayden was hired to write the copy, Brent Thomas as art director and Alien and Blade Runner director Sir Ridley Scott was in charge of bringing it all together.\n\nThe ad was a nod to George Orwell\u2018s 1949 novel - a peek into a dystopian, Big Brother future with citizens trampled under a totalitarianism regime, mass surveillance and repression.\n\nApple\u2019s iconic 1984 Super Bowl ad\n\nApple\u2019s ad ran for one minute featured a \u201cBig Brother\u201d figure addressing a large crowd of subjects all dressed in the same clothes from a giant video screen in a stark, gray conference room. \u201cToday we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives,\u201d he exclaims.\n\nThe ad then quickly cuts to a blonde athlete sprinting with a hammer being chased by a group of storm troopers.\n\n\u201cWe have created for the first time in all history a garden of pure ideology,\u201d continues the public announcement. \u201cWhere each worker may bloom, secure from the pests of any contradictory true thoughts\u201d.\n\nThe female hammer thrower reaches the conference hall with the storm troopers in close pursuit. She launches her hammer just in time, smashing the video screen, just as the announcer proclaims, \u201cWe shall prevail!\u201d leaving onlookers in stunned silence.\n\nThe camera pans through an open-mouthed crowd as the punch line is delivered: \u201cOn January 24th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like \u20191984\u2018\u201d.\n\nWhile it might seem tame now, at the time Apple\u2019s ad was revolutionary - unlike anything seen before, and marked a before and after in Super Bowl advertising as it raised the bar considerably.\n\nIt also somehow captured the zeitgeist of a dark time in history - the Cold War, arms race, concern about the future and nuclear war while showing how different the world actually was compared to Orwell\u2019s predictions.\n\n\u201cWe were all so scared about 1984, so it tapped into that brilliantly,\u201d sports marketing expert David Stubley told CNN. \u201cEveryone thought the world was going to come to an end in 1984, if you\u2019d read George Orwell\u2019s book. And so to have this take on that whole scariness and confront it in such a brilliant way, I think it really caught people\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nFor Apple the ad could not have been a bigger success - the company reportedly sold 72,000 computers in the 100 days after the game - 50 percent more than it had projected. That alone brought in $150 million - five times the estimated $300,000 budget to make the ad.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGet your game on!

First spotted by Windows Latest, the page instead tries to convince the reader not to uninstall the company's browser.\n\nWhen doing a search for \"How to uninstall Edge\" on Microsoft's website, the first result is a page titled \"Are you sure you want to uninstall Microsoft Edge?\" Instead of instructions, the page goes on to explain the benefits of Edge over Google Chrome citing browser features such as \"Copilot, Designer, Vertical tabs, Coupons, Read Aloud, and VPN.\"\n\nThe page even includes a chart comparing these features in Edge to Google Chrome, emphasizing that Chrome lacks them.\n\nA chart from Microsoft on how its Edge browser has more features than Google Chrome. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nAside from a few more banners about features, that's pretty much it for what's available on the page that is supposed to be on how to uninstall Microsoft Edge.\n\nLike with Internet Explorer, Edge is the default browser for Windows 10 and 11. As often happens with default programs, there can be measures implemented to prevent users from installing it. If a Windows 11 user tries to uninstall the Edge browser in the typical steps to remove any program, the only option available is to \"Modify\" the program while the \"Uninstall\" option is greyed out.\n\nNow for those who want to get rid of Microsoft Edge from Windows 11, there is a way to do it, however, it's not as easy as just clicking \"uninstall.\" LaptopMag put together a simple guide on how to uninstall Microsoft Edge, and it does take several steps, which is probably more than most Windows users would expect to get rid of a program. The process does require inputting certain commands into the Windows Terminal, but it's fairly easy to do and won't take long.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.

The Chromium-based browser was the company's attempt to modernize its browser to keep it competitive with competitors such as Chrome and Apple Safari.\n\nLast year, Microsoft promoted Edge even further with the incorporation of AI features. Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, began pushing its own AI companion, Copilot. The company used the AI as a feature for the Edge browser, making it provide AI chatbot functions within it. Google made a similar move last year, incorporating AI features into Google Chrome.\n\nAn update to Copilot in January added a \"Think Deeper\" mode to the AI that was powered by OpenAI's o1 reasoning model.",

I was already questioning paying \u00a35.99 each month for Microsoft 365 Personal, but it was just about low enough not to cause me to seek out an alternative. It\u2019s an unwritten agreement I have with various services \u2014 if they don\u2019t try to take too much out of my account each month, I won\u2019t bother to give it further thought. But now I\u2019ve received an email saying my Microsoft 365 subscription with Office is going up to \u00a38.49 on Valentine\u2019s Day, so it\u2019s time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nTalk about high maintenance. Microsoft says the 41% price hike is to \u201caddress rising costs and enable us to continue delivering new innovations.\u201d To me, this sounds like code for how much more the company needs to pour into an AI black hole. Meanwhile, I still mostly use the Office suite the same way I did 20 years ago, so I\u2019m not interested in funding further folly.\n\nMore than the extra money, it's a matter of principle.\n\nMore than the extra money, it\u2019s a matter of principle because I still resent the fact that I have to pay a monthly fee at all. I\u2019m sure many of you feel the same way. Moving from actually owning a product to these subscription models is just another way that Big Tech makes my life worse, not better.\n\nWhat also baffles me about this is how Microsoft knows it won\u2019t drive many more customers like me to find an alternative. Microsoft 365 is more than just the Office suite, and while the many other tools may look to my eyes like padding in order to justify fleecing punters, perhaps many of its clients are locked into a Microsoft ecosystem now. Getting people hooked and then jacking up the price has been a viable business model for centuries, albeit a contemptible one.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nI don\u2019t use any of the services I\u2019m apparently paying for in the screenshot above. That includes my \u201cAI credit balance,\u201d which I just discovered is a thing that I have. As for the Office tools, Google offers a viable alternative for free. I use Sheets and Docs all the time. Microsoft might have a few extra facets I like, but not at any price.\n\nLuckily, there are still versions of Microsoft Office that you can own or at least get the license for a one-time fee. I\u2019ve got my eye on one Microsoft Office Professional 2021 deal in particular, so that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be taking my money on Valentine\u2019s Day. One of the places you can get it is our TechDeals page, where it\u2019s on sale for just $59.97.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly an older version of Office, but long-time Word or Excel users will know that not many big changes have happened in that world. It has the vast majority of the functionality we see today, including everything I use. As my credit balance will attest, I should be fine without the AI. The link is below if you want to join me in the exodus.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Samsung's best for 2025 Simply put, this is Samsung's very best phone for 2025. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a 6.9-inch QHD+ device with 12GB of RAM, 256GB+ of storage, embedded S Pen, and the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The key upgrade over the lower S25 models is a 200MP main camera and 100x Space Zoom. See price at Samsung Save $300.00 Limited Time Deal!\n\nThis is the official Office Suite, which contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and several other popular tools. If you favor Apple machines, you\u2019ll find a link to Microsoft Office Home & Business for Mac 2021 for around $25 more.\n\nIt looks insanely cheap, but other than the previous-generation factor, this is down to one particular catch. It\u2019s a big one, but it\u2019s made very clear on the page \u2014 the deal is for a single license that can only be installed on one Windows PC. That means it won\u2019t last you decades, and you shouldn\u2019t buy it just yet if you\u2019re planning to upgrade your laptop anytime soon. Otherwise, it\u2019s the real deal, with verified reviews to prove it.\n\nThis license will pay for itself in a matter of months.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s a no-brainer. Compared to what I\u2019m being asked to fork out for my Microsoft 365 subscription from next week, this license will pay for itself in a matter of months.\n\nSorry, Microsoft. You\u2019re still getting a bit of my money, but only as a one-off parting gift this Valentine\u2019s Day. Take care, and good luck in your future endeavors.\n\nYou might like",

While Microsoft said the threat actor is \"unattributed,\" the U.S. government previously has tied the Godzilla framework, which creates malicious web shells that can be used as backdoors, to Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.\n\n\"In the course of investigating, remediating, and building protections against this activity, we observed an insecure practice whereby developers have incorporated various publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys from publicly accessible resources, such as code documentation and repositories, which threat actors have used to perform malicious actions on target servers,\" Microsoft said in the blog post.\n\nThe insecure practice led to the exposure of more than 3,000 ASP.NET machine keys on the internet, Microsoft said. The keys can be abused by threat actors for what is called ViewState code-injection attacks. ViewState, Microsoft explained, is a method used by ASP.NET page frameworks to preserve page and control values between round trips. ASP.NET machine keys are used to protect ViewState from tampering and data disclosure.\n\nHowever, if such keys fall into the wrong hands, they can be used to create a malicious ViewState that can be delivered to the website and gain remote code execution on an enterprise IIS (Internet Information Services) server. In other words, organizations with exposed ASP.NET machine keys could inadvertently supply threat actors with a powerful hacking tool to remotely compromise the organization\u2019s own servers.\n\n\"Whereas many previously known ViewState code injection attacks used compromised or stolen keys that are often sold on dark web forums, these publicly disclosed keys could pose a higher risk because they are available in multiple code repositories and could have been pushed into development code without modification,\" the company warned.\n\nJeremy Dallman, senior director of security research at Microsoft Threat Intelligence, issued a call to action in a LinkedIn post. \"Poor hygiene practices by owners of static ASP.NET machine keys has resulted in these getting disclosed inadvertently around the internet in code samples and documentation,\" he wrote. \"The community needs to step up and clean house to eradicate this technique.\"\n\nIt's unclear if any of the 3,000 exposed keys have been rotated and secured by their respective owners. Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nIn the blog post, Microsoft advised owners of ASP.NET machine keys to regularly rotate them and not expose them in publicly available resources like code documentation and repositories. The company also urged developers to not use such exposed keys in their environments.\n\nMicrosoft also published hash values for the publicly disclosed machine keys in a GitHub repository and advised customers to check their networks with a provided script. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can detect at-risk keys in a network via the alert \u201cPublicly disclosed ASP.NET machine key,\u201d according to the vendor.",

            "content": "Microsoft is warning of an insecure practice wherein software developers are incorporating publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys from publicly accessible resources, thereby putting their applications in attackers' pathway.\n\nThe tech giant's threat intelligence team said it observed limited activity in December 2024 that involved an unknown threat actor using a publicly available, static ASP.NET machine key to inject malicious code and deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework.\n\nIt also noted that it has identified over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys that could be used for these types of attacks, which it's calling ViewState code injection attacks.\n\n\"Whereas many previously known ViewState code injection attacks used compromised or stolen keys that are often sold on dark web forums, these publicly disclosed keys could pose a higher risk because they are available in multiple code repositories and could have been pushed into development code without modification,\" Microsoft said.\n\nViewState is a method used in the ASP.NET framework to preserve page and control values between postbacks. This can also include application data that is specific to a page.\n\n\"By default, view state data is stored in the page in a hidden field and is encoded using base64 encoding,\" Microsoft notes in its documentation. \"In addition, a hash of the view state data is created from the data by using a machine authentication code (MAC) key. The hash value is added to the encoded view state data and the resulting string is stored in the page.\"\n\nIn using a hash value, the idea is to ensure that the view state data has not been corrupted or tampered with by malicious actors. That said, if these keys are stolen or made accessible to unauthorized third-parties, it opens the door to a scenario where the threat actor can leverage the keys to send a malicious ViewState request and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\"When the request is processed by ASP.NET Runtime on the targeted server, the ViewState is decrypted and validated successfully because the right keys are used,\" Redmond noted. \"The malicious code is then loaded into the worker process memory and executed, providing the threat actor remote code execution capabilities on the target IIS web server.\"\n\nMicrosoft has provided a list of hash values for the publicly disclosed machine keys, urging customers to check them against the machine keys used in their environments. It has also warned that in the event of a successful exploitation of publicly disclosed keys, merely rotating the keys will not be sufficient as the threat actors may have already established persistence on the host.\n\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such attacks, it's advised to not copy keys from publicly available sources and to regularly rotate keys. As a further step to deter threat actors, Microsoft said it removed key artifacts from \"limited instances\" where they were included in its documentation.\n\nThe development comes as cloud security company Aqua revealed details of an OPA Gatekeeper bypass that could be exploited to conduct unauthorized actions in Kubernetes environments, including deploying unauthorized container images.\n\n\"In the k8sallowedrepos policy, a security risk arises from how the Rego logic is written in the ConstraintTemplate file,\" researchers Yakir Kadkoda and Assaf Morag said in an analysis shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\"This risk is further amplified when users define values in the Constraint YAML file that do not align with how the Rego logic processes them. This mismatch can result in policy bypasses, making the restrictions ineffective.\"",

            "content": "The past week or so have been rough for Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%). The company's massive investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure came under scrutiny following Chinese start-up DeepSeek's revelation that it has developed AI models at a fraction of the cost that the tech giant has spent so far. This sent Microsoft shares into a tailspin.\n\nMicrosoft stock came under more pressure following the release of results for its fiscal 2025's second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2024) on Jan. 29. Though the company beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations easily, its revenue guidance for the current quarter was lower than what analysts were expecting.\n\nAll this explains why Microsoft stock is down more than 5% since Jan. 27, when DeepSeek's news rocked the AI world. But is this an opportunity for savvy investors to buy this Magnificent Seven stock on the dip? Let's find out.\n\nAI is driving tremendous growth in Microsoft's cloud business\n\nMicrosoft's revenue rose 12% year over year in the previous quarter, with the company's cloud business playing a central role in driving this double-digit growth. It recorded a 19% year-over-year increase in revenue from the Intelligent Cloud business. Microsoft's Azure cloud services got a boost of 13 percentage points from the fast-growing demand for AI applications that the company has been offering on its platform.\n\nThe company points out that it witnessed a whopping 157% jump in AI services revenue last quarter, exceeding its expectations. However, the tech giant faced constraints as \"demand continued to be higher than our available capacity.\" As a result, the 31% jump in Azure revenue fell slightly below analysts' expectations.\n\nHowever, investors will do well to take a closer look at the bigger picture. The demand for Microsoft's AI offerings is so solid that the company has been witnessing a major uptick in contract sizes and bookings. It saw a terrific jump of 67% in commercial bookings during the quarter on the back of \"Azure commitments from OpenAI.\" That number is significantly higher than the 17% increase in commercial bookings in the year-ago period.\n\nAs commercial bookings refer to the new contracts signed by Microsoft with large customers, the impressive jump in this metric bodes well for the company's future. Microsoft's robust future revenue pipeline is also evident from its remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $298 billion in the previous quarter. This metric, which refers to the total value of the company's contracts that will be fulfilled in the future and recognized as revenue, increased by 34% from the year-ago period.\n\nNot surprisingly, Microsoft is going to ramp up its infrastructure spending as it strives to fulfill these contracts in the future, which should ideally lead to an acceleration in growth going forward. The company allocated $22.6 billion toward capital expenditure last quarter, which was above the $20.95 billion consensus estimate.\n\nMicrosoft points out that \"more than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\" The company's remaining spending on cloud and AI infrastructure is directed toward server infrastructure such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs), as it rushes to fulfill the massive RPO it is sitting on.\n\nThis also explains why Microsoft's earnings grew at a slower pace than its revenue last quarter. However, the good part is that Microsoft is expecting its AI capacity to match demand by the end of the current fiscal year, owing to the substantial increase in its capital expenses. That should pave the way for stronger growth going forward.\n\nIs the stock worth buying now?\n\nWe have already seen that Microsoft has a massive backlog of contracts. In fact, the size of its RPO is higher than the $254 billion revenue that the company has generated in the past 12 months. It won't be surprising to see Microsoft's RPO growth accelerating in the future. The cloud AI services market is expected to clock almost 40% annual growth through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nAll of the above tell us why analysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings growth to step on the gas following an 11% jump in its bottom line in fiscal 2025 to $13.15 per share.\n\nThe chart above points toward an increase of 14% and 17% in Microsoft's earnings over the next two fiscal years. That's why it may be a good idea to buy this stock following its recent pullback, as it is trading at 33 times earnings right now, which is in line with the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple.\n\nA potential improvement in Microsoft's earnings growth thanks to its ability to tap the huge addressable opportunity in the cloud-based AI services market points toward a bright future for this AI stock.",

            "content": "Copilot is Microsoft\u2019s take on productivity-boosting generative AI, and it continues to grow and expand with Microsoft\u2019s AI ambitions. Today, there are around a dozen Copilot-branded products powering various capabilities in Microsoft software and services, like summarizations in Microsoft Outlook and transcriptions in Microsoft Teams.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to Microsoft-owned GitHub\u2019s Copilot tool for generating code, and the Copilot that lives on Windows and the web, which serves as a general-purpose assistant.\n\nIn this post, we explain the many Microsoft Copilots available and what they do, and the differences between the premium and free editions.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Copilot?\n\nMicrosoft Copilot, previously known as Bing Chat, is built into Microsoft\u2019s search engine, Bing, as well as Windows 10, Windows 11, and the Microsoft Edge sidebar. (Newer PCs even have a dedicated keyboard key for launching Copilot.) There\u2019s also stand-alone Copilot apps for Android and iOS and an in-app Telegram room.\n\nImage Credits:Microsoft\n\nPowered by fine-tuned versions of OpenAI\u2019s models (OpenAI and Microsoft have a close working relationship), Copilot can perform a range of tasks described in natural language, like writing poems and essays, as well as translating text into other languages and summarizing sources from around the web (albeit imperfectly).\n\nCopilot, like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, can browse the web (in Copilot\u2019s case, via Bing) for up-to-date information. It sometimes gets things wrong, but for timely queries, access to search results can give Copilot an advantage over offline bots such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude.\n\nCopilot can create images by tapping Image Creator, Microsoft\u2019s image generator built on OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 model. And it can generate songs via an integration with Suno, the AI music-generating platform. Typing something like \u201cCreate an image of a zebra\u201d or \u201cGenerate a song with a jazz rhythm\u201d in Copilot will pull in the relevant tool.\n\nImage Credits:Microsoft\n\nOn the subject of integrations, Copilot supports plug-ins for third-party apps and websites. There\u2019s plug-ins for Instacart (for meal planning and cooking-related questions), Kayak (for trip planning), OpenTable (for restaurant reservations) and Shopify, to name a few examples. More are being added on a regular basis.\n\nCopilot also drives Copilot Pages, an embeddable digital canvas where users can edit and share Copilot-originated content. Paying customers (more on that below) get access to BizChat, a business-focused hub that ties into Pages to pull data from the web (and work files) to help create things like project plans, meeting notes, proposals, and more.\n\nWhich Windows settings can Copilot control?\n\nOn Windows 11 (but not necessarily Windows 10), Copilot can control certain settings and functions, acting as a digital concierge of sorts.\n\nWith Copilot, either by typing or using Windows 11\u2019s speech recognition functionality, users can perform actions on a PC like turning the battery saver on or off, showing device and system information, launching live captions, displaying the PC\u2019s IP address, and emptying the recycle bin.\n\nCopilot in Windows. Image Credits:Microsoft\n\nA toggle in the Copilot experience on Windows 11 switches between \u201cWork\u201d and \u201cWeb\u201d mode, with the former bringing Copilot\u2019s Microsoft 365 capabilities in the Windows interface.\n\nWhat is Copilot Pro?\n\nCopilot Pro is Microsoft\u2019s premium Copilot product, priced at $20 per month.\n\nCopilot Pro customers get priority access to the most capable OpenAI models (e.g., o1) during peak times. And select features of Copilot can only be accessed with a Pro subscription, such as higher-resolution images from Image Creator.\n\nCopilot Pro also gives users access to generative AI functions across the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity apps: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote.\n\nIn Word and OneNote, Copilot can write, edit, summarize, and generate text. Copilot in Excel and PowerPoint can turn natural language prompts into presentations and visualizations (optionally grounded in data from files and templates). And in Outlook, Copilot can help draft email responses with toggles for adjusting the length or tone.\n\nMore features as part of Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Wave 2 update are coming down the pipeline.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint will soon pull in company-approved images from a SharePoint library, while Outlook will get a \u201cPrioritize my inbox\u201d capability that summarizes each email (and gives insights like who you\u2019ve been most responsive too). In late 2024, Outlook users will also gain the ability to \u201cteach\u201d Copilot topics, keywords, and people of interest so that those emails are always marked as high-priority.\n\nIn Excel, Copilot can format data, create graphs, generate pivot tables and guide users through creating new formulas and macros. It can also make use of the programming language Python for advanced data analysis \u2013 in natural language, users can describe forecasting, risk analysis, and data visualization tasks and Copilot will translate the text to the necessary Python code to perform these tasks.\n\nA future version of Copilot in Word will let you quickly pull in data from outside Word, PowerPoint, and PDF documents as well as emails, encrypted docs, and meetings. Elsewhere, in OneDrive, Copilot will summarize, show metrics about, and compare the differences between files for you.\n\nImage Credits:Microsoft\n\nBeyond the Microsoft 365 upgrades, Copilot Pro subscribers get landscape formatting options and 100 \u201cboosts\u201d per day in Image Creator (versus only 15 per day for free users) to speed up the image-generation process.\n\nImportantly, Copilot Pro does not come with Copilot in Teams, a Copilot feature in Microsoft Teams that provides real-time summaries and action items while handling tasks like identifying people for follow-ups. Copilot in Teams is exclusive to enterprise Copilot customers, meaning those with an enterprise-class (or equivalent) Microsoft 365 license.\n\nWhat is Microsoft 365 Copilot?\n\nSeparate and distinct from the consumer Copilot SKU is Microsoft 365 Copilot, a collection of generative AI add-ons to Microsoft 365 with an emphasis on business apps.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is priced at $30 per user per month and available to customers with a Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, or Business Premium license. It delivers many of the same capabilities across the Microsoft 365 family of apps as Copilot Pro, but with the addition of \u201centerprise-grade data protection\u201d and the Semantic Index, a back-end system that creates a map of the data and content in an organization to allow Copilot to deliver more personalized responses.\n\nTeam Copilot in Planner. Image Credits:Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft recently launched Microsoft 365 Chat, for example, a tool that pulls info from content across Microsoft 365 apps (e.g., Word docs, PowerPoint presentations) to answer questions.\n\nThere are many, many Copilots besides.

Team Copilot can help manage meeting agendas in Teams and extend to Loop and Planner to create and assign tasks, track deadlines, and notify team members when their input is needed.\n\nNote that some of Microsoft\u2019s Copilots, like Copilot in Business Central, are included in the base software licenses and don\u2019t require paying an additional fee. Others, like Copilot for Sales and Copilot for Service, cost an extra $20 per user per month or $50 per user per month without an active Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription.\n\nCopilot Studio\n\nCopilot Studio is a dashboard that lets customers give Microsoft 365 Copilot access to data in their, or a third party\u2019s, customer relationship management software, enterprise resource management systems, and other databases and repositories using prebuilt connectors or connectors they build themselves. Through Copilot Studio, customers can build guardrails for Copilots and create and publish their own custom-tailored \u201ccopilots.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot subscribers can tap Copilot Studio to create their own custom copilot by describing it in natural language. Copilots can filter to specific datasets for particular teams or users, or connect to an automation, plug-in, or third-party service to kick off actions or a workflow.\n\nImage Credits:Microsoft\n\nCopilot Studio is also where customers can craft what Microsoft calls Copilot agents. These AI bots \u2014 which can be \u201c@ mentioned\u201d in Outlook and Teams \u2014 leverage memory and knowledge of context to navigate different business workflows, learning from user feedback and asking for help when they encounter situations they don\u2019t know how to handle.\n\nCopilot agents range in capability from simple, prompt-and-response agents to more sophisticated bots \u2014 think bots that can monitor email inboxes and automate data entry. Microsoft provides a number of pre-built ones, including the Visual creator agent that generates images, designs, and soon videos.\n\nWhat is GitHub Copilot?\n\nNot to be confused with the many other Copilots in Microsoft\u2019s portfolio, GitHub Copilot is a set of tools for generating code and supporting programming work. GitHub Copilot can be installed as an extension for IDEs including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains, or used in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.\n\nThe generative AI model underpinning GitHub Copilot has been trained on billions of lines of Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, and dozens of other programming languages \u2014 many of them hosted and available publicly on GitHub. When you\u2019re writing code, GitHub Copilot suggests code as you type; you can cycle through suggestions and accept or reject them.\n\nGitHub Copilot can also translate code into natural language descriptions, and Copilot Extensions allow developers to extend Copilot with third-party skills. In February, GitHub announced a ton of new updates for Copilot. Among them: Vision for Copilot, which allows people to attach a screenshot, photo, or diagram to a chat, and Copilot will generate the interface, code, and alt text to bring it to life.\n\nImage Credits:GitHub\n\nGitHub Copilot is available for free for students and for \u201cverified\u201d open source contributors and educators. For individuals, it\u2019s $10 per month. For business customers, it\u2019s $19 per month per user. And for enterprises, it\u2019s $39 per user per month.\n\nIndividual, business and enterprise subscribers get Copilot Chat along with GitHub Copilot, a chatbot-like flow that\u2019s aware of the entire context of the code they\u2019re working on and can answer questions about that code. In addition to answering coding queries, Chat can help developers fix errors and bugs and address security issues through code analysis.\n\nImage Credits:GitHub\n\nThe enterprise and business GitHub Copilot plans include license management, IP indemnity, organization-wide policy management, and added privacy features. Enterprise customers can customize for their codebases and knowledge bases and fine-tune the underlying models, as well as access Copilot through the Microsoft Copilot on the web and use Copilot Chat on GitHub.com.\n\nIn April, GitHub launched Copilot Workspace, a sort of take on AI-powered software engineering. Workspace provides a dev environment that taps AI-powered agents to help brainstorm, plan, build, test and run code in natural language.\n\nIssues with Copilot\n\nOwing to the complex and fraught nature of today\u2019s generative AI tech, Microsoft\u2019s Copilots have their issues.\n\nThe models occasionally make mistakes when summarizing or answering questions because of their tendency to hallucinate, including while summarizing meetings. The Wall Street Journal cited an instance where, for one early adopter using Copilot for Teams meetings, Copilot invented attendees and implied that calls were about subjects that were never actually discussed.\n\nAs for GitHub Copilot, GitHub itself warns that it can produce insecure coding patterns, bugs, and references to outdated APIs, or idioms reflecting the imperfect code in its training data. The code Copilot suggests might not always compile or run \u2014 or even make sense.\n\nSecurity and privacy concerns loom large over Copilot, as well. But perhaps the elephant in the room is the unresolved fair-use question.\n\nLike most generative AI models, the models powering Microsoft\u2019s Copilots were trained on public data, some of which is copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Microsoft \u2014 among others \u2014 argues that the fair-use doctrine shields it from copyright claims. But that hasn\u2019t stopped data owners from filing class action lawsuits against the company, GitHub, OpenAI, and many more over what owners allege are clear licensing and IP violations.\n\nMicrosoft offers policies to protect certain customers from courtroom battles arising from fair use challenges \u2014 at least in narrow circumstances. That doesn\u2019t resolve the ethical quandary of training models on data without permission, however, which may be more than some customers can swallow.\n\nThis story originally published in August 2024 and will be updated periodically with new information.",

Specifically, QBI is designed to rigorously verify and validate whether any quantum computing approach can achieve utility-scale operation \u2014 meaning its computational value exceeds its cost \u2014 by the year 2033.\n\nAnnounced in July 2024, QBI builds upon and expands US2QC, and is separate, but related to the original Quantum Benchmarking program. Microsoft and PsiQuantum were participating in the second phase of US2QC when the QBI expansion was announced. The final Phase of US2QC has the same technical goals as the final stage of QBI \u2013 validation and co-design of an industrially useful quantum computer.\n\n\u201cOur government evaluation team has been working closely with both companies since the beginning of 2023 to scrutinize their approach to building a utility-scale quantum computer. Both companies have undergone an incredibly rigorous and deeply technical analysis from what is almost certainly the world\u2019s best quantum computing test and evaluation team,\u201d said Joe Altepeter, DARPA QBI program manager. \u201cNow, we\u2019re ready to evaluate their final utility-scale system designs, conduct government testing of components and hardware, and assess system-level performance capabilities of major prototypes.\u201d\n\nThe companies have different approaches to their proposed utility-scale quantum computers. Microsoft Corporation, based in Redmond, Washington, is building an error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computer based on a compact superconducting topological qubit architecture, while PsiQuantum, Corp., based in Palo Alto, California, is using silicon-based photonics to create an error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computer based on a lattice-like fabric of photonic qubits. Over 50 experts from DARPA\u2019s test and evaluation team have exhaustively examined both companies\u2019 specific technical approaches, their detailed plans for fault-tolerant prototypes, and their long-term R&D plans, components, architectures, systems development, and application utility.\n\nAdditional quantum computer companies, who submitted initial proposals under the QBI solicitation last summer, are expected to be selected for QBI Stage A soon.\n\n\u201cSince we expanded our quantum computing efforts beyond US2QC with the announcement of QBI last summer, we are very close to selecting additional quantum computing companies whose plans for a utility-scale quantum computer show promise,\u201d Altepeter said. \u201cEarly this spring, we anticipate announcing multiple awards to companies who will be entering QBI Stage A, where they will describe their utility-scale quantum computing concepts to an extraordinary test and evaluation team. Stay tuned for news of these selections soon.\u201d\n\nFor more information on QBI visit: https://www.darpa.mil/qbi.",

            "content": "Users are now receiving notifications regarding their Microsoft 365 subscriptions and must take action if they wish to avoid Copilot and its extra charges.\n\nThe email from Microsoft warns that the cost of a 365 Personal Subscription will jump, however, there is no need to worry \u2013 Microsoft knows what's best and will increase your payment in return for all those AI-powered Copilot services it knows you want.\n\nWhy is Big Tech hellbent on making AI opt-out? READ MORE\n\nWe noted the upcoming increases last month and how users could turn off the generative AI assistant. At the time, Microsoft said users would be able to switch to plans without Copilot.\n\nHowever, unless a user takes action, the price they pay for their \"Current Subscription\" will increase, and AI-powered delights will be added to their plan.\n\nOne Bluesky user wrote: \"Happy 'Microsoft trying to force Copilot subs' day in the UK for all who celebrate,\" before going into detail on how users can avoid the price hike. Clicking \"Cancel subscription\" within a customer's Microsoft account will allow the non-Copilot option to be selected.\n\nIn January, Microsoft said the switch to the Personal Classic or Family Classic plans, without Copilot, would only be available for a \"limited time.\"\n\nThe wording of Microsoft's email shared on social media might make some users think that the rising cost was simply an inflationary thing. After all, Microsoft 365 Personal offers pretty good value (if not as good value as free, open source alternatives) and the price hasn't changed for years, right?\n\nYet by Microsoft's own admission it is \"to reflect the value we've added over the past decade.\" However, that \"value\" appears to be the entirely optional Copilot assistant. So unless a customer wants Copilot, clicking the \"Cancel subscription\" link will reveal a plan that removes the AI feature and brings the price back down.\n\nBoth annual and monthly payments can be cut so long as action is taken. Otherwise, users will be, for all intents and purposes, automatically enrolled in a more expensive plan that includes Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft is to be commended for offering the reduced-price plan for Copilot refuseniks. However, that same commendation cannot be given for making Copilot opt-out rather than opt-in and employing dark patterns to urge users down the path of paying more for a service they didn't ask for. \u00ae",

            "content": "In December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed limited activity by an unattributed threat actor using a publicly available, static ASP.NET machine key to inject malicious code and deliver the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. In the course of investigating, remediating, and building protections against this activity, we observed an insecure practice whereby developers have incorporated various publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys from publicly accessible resources, such as code documentation and repositories, which threat actors have used to perform malicious actions on target servers.\n\nMicrosoft has since identified over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys that could be used for these types of attacks, which are called ViewState code injection attacks. Whereas many previously known ViewState code injection attacks used compromised or stolen keys that are often sold on dark web forums, these publicly disclosed keys could pose a higher risk because they are available in multiple code repositories and could have been pushed into development code without modification.\n\nMicrosoft recommends that organizations do not copy keys from publicly available sources and to regularly rotate keys. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can help reduce this risk by detecting publicly disclosed keys. To further discourage this practice, we have also removed key samples from limited instances where they were included in our own public documentation.\n\nThe limited malicious activity observed in December 2024 identified one publicly disclosed key that was used to inject malicious code. Microsoft Threat Intelligence continues to monitor the additional use of this attack technique. In this blog, we share more information about ViewState code injection attacks and provide recommendations for securing machine keys and monitoring configuration files.\n\nWhat are ViewState code injection attacks?\n\nViewState is the method by which ASP.NET Web Forms preserve page and control state between postbacks. ViewState data is stored in a hidden field on the page and is encoded using Base64-encoding. To protect ViewState against tampering and information disclosure, the ASP.NET page framework uses machine keys: ValidationKey and DecryptionKey. ValidationKey is used to create a message authentication code (MAC) to be attached in the ViewState. DecryptionKey is related to the option of encrypting ViewState. These keys are either auto-generated and stored in registry or specified manually in config files.\n\nIf these keys are stolen or made accessible to threat actors, these threat actors can craft a malicious ViewState using the stolen keys and send it to the website via a POST request. When the request is processed by ASP.NET Runtime on the targeted server, the ViewState is decrypted and validated successfully because the right keys are used. The malicious code is then loaded into the worker process memory and executed, providing the threat actor remote code execution capabilities on the target IIS web server.\n\nViewState code injection attack leading to Godzilla post-exploit framework\n\nIn December 2024, an unattributed threat actor conducted a ViewState code injection attack leveraging a publicly known machine key. The malicious ViewState payload reflectively loaded assembly.dll (SHA-256: 19d87910d1a7ad9632161fd9dd6a54c8a059a64fc5f5a41cf5055cd37ec0499d), a Godzilla post-exploitation framework, followed by plugin modules. Godzilla\u2019s functionality includes executing malicious commands, injecting shellcode into processes, and more.\n\nViewState code injection attack chain leading to Godzilla.\n\nRecommendations\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint customers can identify publicly disclosed keys in their environment based on the presence of the alert Publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine key. This alert is for informational purposes and is not indicative of attack activity. Additionally, Microsoft has provided a list of hash values for identified publicly disclosed machine keys in our Github repository and recommends checking machine keys in your environment using the provided script.\n\nIf publicly disclosed keys are identified in your environment, Microsoft recommends the following actions, depending on your scenario:\n\nIf you are running an ASP.NET web application on .NET Framework and this is not part of Exchange Server or SharePoint, review the following potential setups: You have set fixed key values using the <machineKey> element of the web.config to align the encryption/decryption of ViewState values within multiple servers that are part of a web farm. This configuration assumes you have multiple web servers hosting the same instance of a web application to distribute load among them, and that requests that were originally served from one server in the farm could trigger POST requests to another server of the same farm. In this case, you will need to rotate the values of your machine keys in all servers of the farm, either by using the IIS manager console or PowerShell (see details below). Ensure that you use the same newly generated values on all servers in the farm. You have set fixed key values using the <machineKey> element for a single server that is running your ASP.NET web application. In this scenario, removing the <machineKey> element from the configuration will revert the application to the auto-generated values for the ASP.NET machine keys that are stored inside your computer\u2019s registry. See the below details on how the <machineKey> element can be removed by editing the web.config configuration file or using the IIS manager console.\n\nIf you are using SharePoint or Exchange web applications, SharePoint uses its own key management system, which allows the keys to be rotated as described in this article.\n\nFollow the steps below for removing or replacing the ASP.NET machine key values in the web.config configuration file using either the IIS manager console or PowerShell.\n\nUsing the IIS manager console:\n\nFrom the IIS manager console, select the website or web application that contains the fixed key values in the web.config configuration file. From the middle pane of the IIS manager console, select the Machine Key element icon. To create new machine key values, select the Generate Keys button on the right-hand side of the console, which will populate new values for Validation and Decryption key textboxes. Once the new values are populated, select the Apply button from the right-hand side pane to persist the new values into the web.config file for the target website or web application. To remove the fixed keys and rely on the auto-generated machine key values for ASP.NET, select the Automatically generate at runtime checkboxes for both the Validation and Decryption keys. This will render the two text fields for these values disabled. Proceed to select the Apply button on the right-hand side of the console, which will remove the <machineKey> element from the web.config file of the website or web application.\n\nUsing PowerShell:\n\nUsing PowerShell, create a .ps1 file (for example, GenerateKeys.ps1) with the following content:\n\nUsing a Windows PowerShell command prompt, navigate to the location containing your .ps1 file. Load the .ps1 file (for example, GenerateKeys.ps1) by executing the following command:\n\nCall the function within the script file by executing the following command:\n\nCopy the resulting <machineKey> element to the web.config file of your website or web application, replacing the existing one.\n\nNOTE: If successful exploitation of publicly disclosed keys has occurred, rotating machine keys will not sufficiently address possible backdoors or persistence methods established by a threat actor or other post-exploitation activity, and additional investigation may be warranted. In particular, web-facing servers should be fully investigated and strongly considered for re-formatting and re-installation in an offline medium in cases where publicly disclosed keys have been identified, as these servers are most at risk of possible exploitation.\n\nMicrosoft also recommends the following best practices for securing machine keys and web servers:\n\nFollow secure DevOps standards and securely generate machine keys. Avoid using default keys or keys listed in public resources.\n\nAt deployment, encrypt sensitive information like the machineKey and connectionStrings elements in web.config. This prevents these secrets from ever existing in plaintext on the file system, inhibiting an attacker\u2019s ability to read these secrets at all.\n\nUpgrade your application to use ASP.NET 4.8 to enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) capabilities.\n\nHarden Windows Servers instances by using attack surface reduction rules such as Block Webshell creation for Servers. Attack surface reduction rules are sweeping settings that are effective at stopping entire classes of threats.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects post-exploitation activity such as delivery of the Godzilla framework with the following components as the following malware. Note, however, that these alerts can also be triggered by unrelated threat activity and are not necessarily indicative of ViewState code injection attacks:\n\nBackdoor:MSIL/GodZillaMod.A\n\nTrojan:Win32/WebShellTerminal\n\nBackdoor:MSIL/Godzela\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert indicates the presence of publicly disclosed machine keys but are not indicative of exploitation activity. To get this alert, you must be running Microsoft Defender Antivirus as your active antivirus. Customers who receive this alert should review our steps for rotating or removing machine keys in the Recommendations section.\n\nPublicly disclosed ASP.NET machine key\n\nThe following alert might also indicate threat activity such as code injection attacks. Note, however, that this alert can be also triggered by unrelated threat activity.\n\nIIS worker process loaded suspicious .NET assembly\n\nMicrosoft Security Copilot\n\nSecurity Copilot customers can use the standalone experience to create their own prompts or run the following pre-built promptbooks to automate incident response or investigation tasks related to this threat:\n\nIncident investigation\n\nMicrosoft User analysis\n\nThreat actor profile\n\nThreat Intelligence 360 report based on MDTI article\n\nVulnerability impact assessment\n\nNote that some promptbooks require access to plugins for Microsoft products such as Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nHunting queries\n\nMicrosoft recommends monitoring configuration files and configurable locations using the following audit policy settings, which will enable the logging of Event ID 4663 in the Windows Security Event Log. Before setting up auditing, note that:\n\nMonitor access to ASP.NET configuration files by configuring Advanced Audit Policy settings:\n\nOpen the Group Policy Management Console from Server Manager > Tools > Group Policy Management. Open a GPO that will apply policy to the ASP.NET application or web server. From the window that opens, go to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Audit Policy > Audit object level access. Define these policy settings: Checked\n\nSuccess: Checked\n\nFailure: Optional\n\nAfter enabling Audit object access, enable auditing on individual files through the Security Tab on file properties to audit sensitive configuration files:\n\nLocate your web.config or other configuration file of concern and open the Security Tab and select the Advanced button. Select the Auditing tab and Add a new rule. Select a principal and resolve the principal Everyone. Select the Read checkbox at minimum. Save your changes by clicking Ok, Ok, Ok.\n\nAfter Audit object access is configured, and Auditing has been turned on for specific files, alerts can be viewed using Event ID 4663 in the Windows Security Event Log. Information includes SubjectUserName accessing the file, and the ProcessId and ProcessName. Seeing a username or process that is not the IIS Application Pool service account or the w3wp.exe process could be a sign of tampering and attempt to compromise a machine key.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.\n\nAdditionally, once auditing is enabled for specific configuration files that may contain machine keys, Sentinel customers can leverage the SecurityEvent table to analyze collected Event ID 4663 and identify potential anomalies and unauthorized or suspicious file access attempts. To begin the threat hunting process, the following query can be used as a starting point:\n\nSome of the key information captured in the result includes the SubjectUserName, which identifies the user accessing the file, along with the associated ProcessId and ProcessName. Observing a username or process other than the expected IIS Application Pool service account or the standard w3wp.exe process may signal potential tampering or an attempt to compromise the machine key.\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\nIndicator Type Description First seen Last seen 19d87910d1a7ad9632161fd9dd6a54c8a059a64fc5f5a41cf5055cd37ec0499d SHA-256 Godzilla post-exploitation framework 2024-12-11 2024-12-19\n\nMicrosoft has provided a list of hash values for identified publicly disclosed machine keys in our Github repository. We recommend using the included script to compare the values against static keys in your environment to determine whether your machine keys have been disclosed in publicly accessible resources, and using the Recommendations listed above to rotate or remove machine keys.\n\nReferences\n\nLearn more\n\nFor the latest security research from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community, check out the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Blog: https://aka.ms/threatintelblog.\n\nTo get notified about new publications and to join discussions on social media, follow us on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-threat-intelligence, and on X (formerly Twitter) at https://x.com/MsftSecIntel.\n\nTo hear stories and insights from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community about the ever-evolving threat landscape, listen to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence podcast: https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/microsoft-threat-intelligence.",

That would bring Amazon's capex over $100 billion for the full year, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of which would go toward AI for Amazon Web Services, he said.\n\nThat comes after Amazon recently rolled out Trainium2, the latest model of its in-house chips. The company is working with Anthropic, the startup behind the Claude large language model, to build a server containing hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips with significantly more computing power than the current Claude models were trained on. Looking ahead, Jassy said Amazon expects to preview even more powerful Trainium3 chips later this year.\n\nAmazon's plans to ramp spending on AI follow similar moves by its Big Tech peers. Just earlier this week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) forecast $75 billion in capital expenditures this year to support expanding its AI capacity. Last week, Meta (META) said it plans to invest $60 billion to $65 billion this year, while Microsoft (MSFT) said it plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in its 2025 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe're all learning from one another,\u201d Jassy said Thursday, nodding to Amazon's U.S. rivals as well as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, adding that Amazon has added DeepSeek models to its Bedrock and SageMaker development platforms. \u201cYou have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us.\u201d\n\nThe rapid rise of DeepSeek, which recently claimed to develop a competitive AI model for a fraction of the cost of stateside competitors, has raised concerns about American firms' spending on AI. However, Bank of America analysts said the development could be \"AI's Sputnik moment,\" with growing competition pushing U.S. hyperscalers like Amazon to act with greater urgency and raise their investments rather than pull back.\n\nShares of Amazon slid 4% in extended trading Thursday after the company's earnings call and its outlook missed estimates. The stock was up 40% over the past 12 months through Thursday\u2019s close.\n\n",

Microsoft announced that its latest Windows 11 Canary test build includes a public preview of Windows MIDI Services, which supports MIDI 2.0 and updates allowing MIDI 1.0 to run on Windows on Arm.\n\nMIDI (which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol for transmitting and storing music. It\u2019s integral to modern music production, allowing electronic musical instruments to be connected to computers and other devices for precise control and synchronization. MIDI 2.0 was announced in 2019 and provides improvements in speed, fidelity, instrument control, and more, and this marks the first time that the updated protocol will be available in Microsoft\u2019s operating system.\n\nExperimental Canary versions of Windows like build 27788 aren\u2019t quite ready for public release, but the Windows MIDI Services stack it contains certainly will be once it\u2019s fully tested. Microsoft says the Windows MIDI rewrite aims to provide a \u201cgreat experience for musicians,\u201d and describes the update as \u201ca strong foundation for future expansion and enhancement.\u201d You can read all the technical details about the improvements MIDI 2.0 is bringing to Windows 11 on Microsoft\u2019s blog.\n\nAside from music-related updates, the latest Windows 11 Canary build also includes a new one-click OneDrive feature that lets users continue working on files while jumping between Windows 11 PCs and iOS or Android phones. There\u2019s also a Microsoft Store feature that allows users to selectively install individual components for games such as Call of Duty and Halo, and the usual smattering of Windows 11 bug fixes.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. shares have largely climbed on the back of two trends: strength in its cloud business and a focus on costs. Now both could be in question.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDisappointing results from major cloud-computing companies Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. suggest reasons to be cautious about Amazon Web Services, the biggest player in the space \u2014 and a central plank in Wall Street\u2019s nearly unanimously positive view on the stock. At the same time, a trend of growing capital expenditures as firms invest heavily in artificial intelligence could, if Amazon follows suit, force a recalibration of how profitable it can be this year.\n\nThe performance of AWS and the company\u2019s spending plans will likely be a main focus of Amazon\u2019s results, due after the market close. Shares hit a record earlier this week, and have risen nearly 50% off an August low. The stock gained 1.2% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf the trend of relative cloud weakness is real, as it appears to be, we could see shares move lower if AWS disappoints,\u201d said Dan Genter, who oversees about $8 billion as chief executive officer of Genter Capital Management. \u201cWe want to see margin improvement, and if we don\u2019t see continued revenue growth, we will be entirely dependent on cost cutting for that at a time when companies are spending a lot more.\u201d\n\nCloud computing is seen as a part of software where AI will emerge early as a tailwind to growth, but the latest reads have undercut the timing of when that might occur. Results from Alphabet featured weaker-than-expected cloud revenue, following in the footsteps of Microsoft, which last week gave a similarly mixed read on its own cloud business, although that in part reflected supply constraints amid high demand.\n\nThe lack of pronounced growth inflections has investors growing impatient about when the billions of dollars invested in AI infrastructure will pay off. While there remains a lot of long-term optimism that it will over the long term, some have balked at the heavy spending.\n\n\u201cCapex is starting to feel like the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and there\u2019s some fatigue at all this spending,\u201d said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. \u201cRight now its almost less about when the AI spending will be monetized, and more about whether it can be legitimized.\u201d",

            "content": "Microsoft has released its first in-box public preview of Windows MIDI Services with full support for the MIDI 2.0 standard.\n\nThe preview is part of build 27788 of the Windows 11 Insider Preview Canary Channel, which, as if to emphasize its bleeding edge nature, includes a known issue: a 0x8007000d install error and a failed .NET update ( 0x80073712 ). Retry the build but not the .NET update, and everything should be fine, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe Windows MIDI Services have been floating around for a while now. Pete Brown, Principal Software Engineer for Microsoft's Developer Platform team, talked about the technology in 2022 and gave updates over the years, including Microsoft opening the MIDI GitHub repo in 2023 and teasing the upcoming tech in October 2024.\n\nAt that time, Brown said the Windows MIDI Services would \"ship in Windows Insider builds next month.\" Almost, but not quite. It has taken until February for the feature to arrive in the Windows 11 Insider Canary Channel. A sensible move as Brown emphasized: \"We will have bugs.\"\n\nAt its core, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a standard for connecting electronic instruments to devices such as computers to play, edit, and record music. Users who dabble in electronic music will therefore welcome the update. However, this is a preview in the Canary Channel, so not everything will work out of the box. Microsoft wants users to report issues and backward compatibility problems with existing hardware and software.\n\nA musician friend of The Reg enthused:\n\n\"Having inbox MIDI 1.0 and 2.0 drivers means the end of badly written OEM drivers. The new multi-client MIDI implementation ensures you\u2019re no longer locked into a single application, allowing for custom MIDI routing while still using a DAW.\n\n\"MIDI 2.0 is also a big deal \u2014 offering better connection speeds, two-way communication, and property exchange,\" he said. Microsoft is \"working on new inbox audio drivers\" too.\n\nThe technology will find its way to the latest supported versions of Windows 10 and 11 at some point in the future \u2013 hopefully before October since there won't be many supported versions of Windows 10 after then.\n\nMIDI can be a contentious technology. For every computer fan left agog from hearing The Secret of Monkey Island theme through MT-32 hardware, there are dozens bruised by playground squabbles over which is better \u2013 the Atari ST and its built-in MIDI capabilities or the Commodore Amiga and its superior graphics?\n\nThen there are the projects to support the tech, one of which is mt32-pi, a work-in-progress bare-metal MIDI synthesizer for the Raspberry Pi 3 and above. It recently went off the rails when the maintainer threw in the towel following what he described as \"a sustained campaign of abuse.\"\n\nPerhaps silence is golden after all. \u00ae",

I am excited to apply my global perspective and institutional knowledge to lead our SME&C team.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft cites the naming of Haupter to this new leadership role as a way to leverage his broad leadership experience from across EMEA and his prior stint in Asia.\n\nAbu-Ltaif has served at Microsoft for two decades, holding several leadership roles. According to the IT giant, he has initiated numerous skills development programs to provide the workforce with access to skills, technology, networks, and opportunities to succeed in AI.\n\n\u201cI am both humbled and honored to announce that I am taking on the role of President of Microsoft Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), driving digital transformation for our customers and partners across more than 120 markets during this pivotal era of AI,\u201d Abu-Ltaif wrote in a LinkedIn post. \u201cI am excited about the future and the impact we can make together.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft earnings call\n\nIn other recent Microsoft news, the organization had its quarterly earnings call where executive vice president and CFO of Microsoft, Amy Hood, said that non-AI Azure sales saw \u201cgo-to-market execution challenges\u201d in the vendor\u2019s scale motion.\n\nShe attributed the challenges to the amount of time it took to implement changes surrounding balancing work with customer AI workloads and work with migrations and other fundamentals.\n\n\u201cAs you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions,\u201d said Hood.\n\nElsewhere, Microsoft saw year-over-year increases in revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.\n\n\u201cThis quarter Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion, up from 21 percent year-over-year,\u201d Hood said. \u201cWe remain committed to balancing operational discipline with continued investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCollaboration in the channel has been a signature part of developing AI and improving AI solutions to enhance both efficiency and productivity.

This is in addition to in-market audiences by job title and company size.\u201d\n\nSo now, advertisers using Microsoft\u2019s Performance Max ad option will be able to extend their campaigns based on LinkedIn member data, providing another way to reach the right audience with their ads.\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft advertisers using its various other ad products (Dynamic Search Ads, Microsoft Audience Network, and Shopping Campaigns) have been able to utilize LinkedIn member data for years.\n\nSo the option itself isn\u2019t new, but the expansion to Performance Max, Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered, automated ad option, will provide more ways for its systems to find the right audience for your campaigns, based on a broader set of data points.\n\nWhich is significant, because LinkedIn\u2019s trove of professional insights is unmatched, which gives parent company Microsoft a significant advantage for specific types of audience targeting. And with the right campaign assets, Performance Max targeting to LinkedIn audiences could help you reach key decision-makers, without you having to manually select and categorize these users.\n\nIt could actually be a big boost, which may make Performance Max campaigns more appealing for B2B and professional marketers.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting expansion either way, and with Microsoft\u2019s AI targeting continuing to improve, it could offer significant advantages and benefits.\n\nMicrosoft says that advertisers can now request to be enabled for this pilot via their account team or contacting Microsoft support.\n\nYou can learn more about Microsoft\u2019s latest ad updates here.",

            "content": "Share prices of Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) were down 6% immediately following its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Jan. 29. The software leader delivered revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations, but it wasn't enough for investors to justify bidding the share price to new highs.\n\nThe main issue seems to be valuation. Microsoft has accelerated its capital expenditures over the past few years to support artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Investors have bid the share price up to a high price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33 anticipating those expenditures to drive strong growth, but the company's earnings have increased just 10% year over year for the last three quarters.\n\nInvestors may be starting to lose patience waiting for these investments to pay off. Here's why the stock could continue to disappoint investors in 2025.\n\nHigher capital spending is not translating to higher growth\n\nTo its credit, Microsoft is in a solid competitive position to benefit from enterprise investment in AI services. Microsoft's cloud revenue surpassed $40 billion and grew 21% year over year. AI-related revenue is up to $13 billion on an annualized basis, and up 175% year over year.\n\nStill, the revenue from AI is barely moving the needle for a company generating $261 billion in total revenue across all products. Moreover, as its relatively low rate of earnings growth indicates, this small amount of additional AI revenue is coming at a big cost.\n\nMicrosoft doubled its data center capacity over the past three years. Capital expenditures during calendar 2022 were under $25 billion but have more than doubled to $55 billion over the past 12 months.\n\nDespite this accelerated spending curve, Microsoft's year-over-year earnings growth has slowed from over 20% a year ago to just 10%, and this deceleration in earnings growth comes as investors are paying a higher P/E multiple for the shares. Even considering long-term estimates, analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 13%, which may not be enough to support the stock's 33 P/E.\n\nIt's understandable that higher spending will pressure near-term margins and earnings. But even Microsoft's revenue growth hasn't shown any acceleration over the past five years. Microsoft's 12% year-over-year increase last quarter is consistent with its historical average.\n\nThis raises questions about whether Microsoft is earning the returns on capital to justify these massive spending increases in technology infrastructure.\n\nThe stock is relatively expensive and could fall further\n\nTo be fair, Microsoft is investing to meet demand for AI and cloud services over the long term. But that doesn't make the stock a buy, especially when there are other top tech companies investing in AI but also reporting much higher earnings growth.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms reported Q4 earnings growth of 50% year over year, and analysts are also forecasting its earnings to grow 17% annually over the next several years. Meta is growing earnings faster than Microsoft, while the stock's valuation is slightly cheaper. Investors can buy shares for 29 times earnings.\n\nMicrosoft is certainly seeing robust demand for AI, but AI services are not generating enough revenue to make an impact on the company's overall growth rate. Unless Microsoft can accelerate revenue or earnings growth, investors shouldn't expect the stock to hit new highs anytime soon, and there could even be more downside if the stock corrects to a lower P/E.",

This is your go-to series for all the exciting announcements and updates from Microsoft Copilot Studio.\n\nWelcome to What\u2019s new in Copilot Studio. This is your go-to series for all the exciting announcements and updates from Microsoft Copilot Studio. Since Copilot Studio is a software as a service (SaaS) product, we seek to deliver new features and capabilities every month, and this blog series will feature some of these capabilities.\n\nFor this edition, we\u2019ll talk about:\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Studio Your agent, your way. Start your free trial\n\nCopilot Studio in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat\n\nAs a part of our continued mission to empower every person with a Copilot and transform their business with agents, we announced Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, a free and secure AI chat experience powered by GPT-4. With Copilot Chat, your entire organization can start using Copilot and agents today. These agents are easy to create directly in Copilot, highly discoverable, and can be published to Copilot Chat. This enables org-wide agents to be used in a common UI for all employees, regardless of Microsoft 365 Copilot licensing, making agents more accessible for all.\n\nFor example, a team could build a Budget Agent that is equipped with knowledge about the team and helps submit expense reports, provide financial insights, and check policy compliance\u2014and everyone on the team could use this agent through Copilot Chat, even if they don\u2019t have an individual Copilot license.\n\nThis experience is designed to be enterprise-grade, providing security, privacy, and compliance features for all users. Additionally, IT controls are available to manage and monitor the usage within the organization.\n\nRead the full announcement of agents experienced in Copilot Chat.\n\nShared consumption meter for Copilot Studio\n\nIn December 2024, we introduced consumption-based pricing for agents built in Copilot Studio. This new billing model offers greater flexibility and scalability for organizations looking to easily use natural language to build agents, without committing to upfront license purchases.\n\nThe PAYGO meter allows customers to pay only for the messages they consume, providing a cost-effective alternative to the traditional prepaid message packs. This model is designed to accommodate varying usage patterns, making it ideal for businesses with fluctuating demands.\n\nUnder the PAYGO model, customers are billed $0.01 per message. This includes both classic (non-generative AI) and generative answers. Agent responses generated from grounded knowledge, outside of the Microsoft Graph, will cost two messages. The consumption rate for autonomous agents and agents with generative orchestration will scale based on the complexity of the task completed. The PAYGO meter uses your Azure subscription as the payment instrument, ensuring seamless integration with existing billing processes. This meter is available in regions where Copilot Studio\u2019s generative AI capabilities are also available.\n\nFollowing is a list of Copilot Studio events and their respective billing rates:\n\nClassic answer: 1 message\n\nGenerative answer: 2 messages\n\nAutonomous action: 25 messages\n\nTenant Microsoft Graph grounding for messages: 30 messages\n\nBy paying only for the messages consumed, organizations can optimize their spending and avoid overpaying for unused capacity. There are no in-product feature differences between the PAYGO meter and the prepaid message packs. Customers can have the same capabilities and benefits, regardless of the billing model they choose. However, if the purchased capacity of message packs is reached with the pre-paid packs, makers will be restricted from creating, editing, or publishing agents for the duration of the month in which capacity was reached.\n\nWe recommend signing up for the meter even if you purchase message packs to handle these scenarios without disruption. The meter won\u2019t count utilization in any month until purchased message packs have been fully exhausted. If capacity is reached, agents that are already published will remain functional without interruption, but updates to the agent cannot be published during that time. Learn more about message allocation.\n\nSetting up the PAYGO meter for Copilot Studio is a straightforward process. Administrators can manage their message capacity and monitor consumption through the Microsoft Power Platform admin center (PPAC). The capacity management features provide detailed, daily usage data, helping organizations plan and budget effectively.\n\nSee more information on setting up consumption billing.\n\nImproved SharePoint responses with semantic search\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce enhanced search capabilities in Copilot Studio, which enables semantic search over your SharePoint knowledge.\n\nBy enabling the new \u201cEnhanced search\u201d results, your agent can leverage the semantic index for Copilot feature to semantically index the data you have stored in SharePoint and yield more relevant search results. You can easily control the \u201cEnhanced search\u201d results setting from the \u201cGenerative AI\u201d settings page.\n\nThis feature is turned on by default, so you can get immediate benefits without additional setup. Tenants with Microsoft 365 Copilot can create custom agents and leverage the same index used by Microsoft 365 Copilot. These same tenants can also use SharePoint and Microsoft Graph connectors containing files up to 200 MB, resulting in answers that are more relevant for you.\n\nTo benefit from this more robust indexing capability, agents must share a tenant with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Learn more about billing for tenant Graph grounding for messages.\n\nLearn more about enhanced search.\n\nKnowledge tuning in public preview\n\nThe ability to make data-driven decisions and fine-tune your knowledge accordingly is now available to all in public preview. Adding knowledge to agents equips them with your enterprise-specific data and enables agents to generate responses grounded on that information. However, agents can still face challenges in identifying the correct data. By leveraging these new advancements for knowledge tuning and knowledge analytics, makers can get recommendations and insights into how their knowledge sources are utilized by their agents and ensure their knowledge is more robust and effective.\n\nThe \u201cKnowledge\u201d page now includes relevant analytics such as knowledge usage, errors, and answer rates. Makers will also have access to suggestions for how to improve their knowledge, including Microsoft Dataverse tables, SharePoint libraries, or public websites that may be relevant to their agents.\n\nAdditionally, makers can designate verified and trusted knowledge sources as official sources so that these specific sources are prioritized and highlighted in responses provided by the agent.\n\nWe hope that these improvements will help makers derive even greater value from their data sources. We\u2019re not stopping here though, additional capabilities coming soon include further recommendations on relevant Microsoft Graph files or SharePoint libraries, and the ability to define custom instructions for connectors or SharePoint data sources.\n\nLearn more about the advanced knowledge tuning capabilities.\n\nLet agents analyze images for you\n\nToday, employees and customers who chat with agents for support are limited to sending and receiving messages only. However, many scenarios require sending an image for the agent to analyze and respond appropriately. This capability is now available in public preview.\n\nWhen end-users upload images to the chat, agents can seamlessly analyze both text and visuals, ensuring a smooth conversation flow and expanding the range of supported scenarios. Whether you\u2019re a field technician attaching a photo of a faulty part for troubleshooting or an analyst sharing a chart for insights on emerging trends, this feature enhances how agents can support your needs. Users can upload a wide range of images, including products, blueprints, maps, and charts.\n\nTo try out this feature, head to Copilot Studio and enable \u201cImage input\u201d under the \u201cGenerative AI\u201d section of the agent\u2019s settings. Keep in mind that enabling end-user image uploads requires \u201cGenerative mode\u201d to be turned on. Once enabled, see how your agent can analyze and respond to the images you send.\n\nLearn more about image input from users.\n\nSecurity and data loss prevention (DLP) updates\n\nWe believe it\u2019s critical to secure agents built in Copilot Studio and are always investing in ways to improve security and governance features in this pursuit. Currently, DLP enforcement is disabled by default. The process to enable and enforce these DLP policies is a two-step process, resulting in many agents published without sufficient DLP configured.\n\nStarting January 2025, the default mode for all tenants has been changed to be Soft-Enabled. The Soft-Enabled DLP state allows published agents to continue to run without enforcing any DLP policies. However, it blocks any further updates to agents that are affected by DLP blocks. In addition, the option to toggle to Disabled mode in the PowerShell module will be disabled.\n\nFurthermore, in February 2025 the default mode for all tenants will be changed to Enabled. Enabled mode enforces DLP checks completely for running agents and updates to existing agents. All published agents and updates will be subject to the DLP policies that apply as defined by the tenant.\n\nThese changes will help ensure all agents built and published through Copilot Studio are safe and secure, and follow the DLP policies defined by the tenant.\n\nLearn more about DLP and other best practices.\n\nArabic support is now available\n\nWe now have 27 languages in Copilot Studio, with the addition of Arabic. This exciting update brings enhanced accessibility and usability for our Arabic-speaking users.\n\nUsers can now chat in Arabic to ask questions or seek support, with responses also generated in Arabic. Agents grounded in knowledge can provide accurate and relevant answers in Arabic, ensuring seamless communication. Additionally, Arabic is available for interactive voice response agents, making voice interactions more inclusive and effective.\n\nHowever, there are some important limitations. Arabic is not currently available in the UI of the authoring canvas or maker experiences within Copilot Studio. Additionally, Arabic is not yet supported for \u201cGenerative mode,\u201d which enables agents to leverage large language models to dynamically select the best combination of topics, actions, and knowledge sources during conversations.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to continuously improving our platform and expanding language support to better serve our user base. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements.\n\nLearn more about all the supported languages.\n\nBookmark this page to learn about features as we ship them, as well as upcoming releases: What\u2019s new in Microsoft Copilot Studio \u2013 Microsoft Copilot Studio | Microsoft Learn.\n\nWatch monthly episodes highlighting Copilot Studio news and feature deep dives in \u201cThis Month in Copilot Studio\u201d with Dona Sarkar, Microsoft Principal Cloud Advocate, and Kendra Springer, Principal Group Product Manager with Copilot Studio: This Month in Copilot Studio.\n\nGet started today\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Copilot Studio and how it can transform your organization\u2019s productivity, visit the Copilot Studio website or sign up for our free trial today.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence agents \u2014 tools designed to take on workplace tasks \u2014 could fundamentally reshape the corporate finance function in coming years, rendering some jobs obsolete while creating new ones, according to Georg Glantschnig, vice president of Dynamics 365 AI ERP at Microsoft.\n\nThe technology is still in the early stages of development, and some analysts say it may be too soon for rapid adoption when it comes to functions such as corporate finance.\n\nEventually, however, AI agents could act as \u201cskilled virtual coworkers, working with humans in a seamless and natural manner,\u201d according to a McKinsey report published last year.\n\nMicrosoft envisions every business process in an organization being impacted by AI agents, Glantschnig told CFO Dive. Such agents can help finance teams automate labor intensive processes like the financial close, he said.\n\nThe following is a Q&A, conducted via email, between Glantschnig and CFO Dive\u2019s Alexei Alexis. The exchange has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nCFO Dive: How do you define AI agents or agentic AI, and how much of a potential game-changer is this emerging space when it comes to business automation, particularly in the corporate finance function?\n\nGeorg Glantschnig: An agent uses AI to execute tasks and take action on your behalf. Agents work alongside or on behalf of a person, team, or organization and range from simple, prompt-and-response agents that carry out a simple query or a single task like invoice approval to more advanced, fully autonomous agents that orchestrate end to end processes such as order to cash.\n\nEnsuring accuracy and compliance of financial operations and reporting is a fundamental responsibility of every finance department. With financial data dispersed across multiple data sources, financial transactions flowing in and recorded from internal and external sources, maintaining financial data accuracy is a daunting task, often done manually and prone to human errors.\n\nBy leveraging agents to automate key financial processes, finance professionals can benefit from time saved searching across systems without sacrificing, or even increasing, accuracy and compliance.\n\nFurthermore, the agent\u2019s ability to dynamically adapt and constantly learn makes an agent-driven automation far more sustainable than a traditional rule-based one that requires more ongoing maintenance.\n\nCFO Dive: Are fully autonomous AI agents a reality or just an aspiration at this stage and is the market ready for this?\n\nGeorg Glantschnig: Our customers\u2019 trust and confidence in AI is top of mind for us. Therefore, we started with assistive capabilities in 2024 across our full ERP portfolio. Today, 50% of our users are using Copilots in Dynamics 365 apps. In the same responsible way we\u2019re introducing agents, gradually increasing their autonomy at a pace suitable for each individual customer. Different customers and teams differ in their AI journey and how quickly they adopt new technologies, but we already seeing many examples for customers moving quickly.\n\nCustomers are already building their own agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio. For example, Pets at Home, the UK\u2019s biggest pet care company, created an agent for its profit protection team to more efficiently compile cases for skilled human review, which could have the potential to drive a seven-figure annual savings. Organizations like McKinsey & Company, Thompson Reuters, Clifford Chance, and more around the world are also seeing incredible impact from building their own custom agents in Copilot Studio.\n\nCopilot for Finance also provides both an assistive and automated agent experience to complete data reconciliation, enabling the user to choose the level of automation required. With assistive, users are involved in each step of the process and can \u201cgraduate\u201d to the fully agentic experience once confident.\n\nCFO Dive: From your company\u2019s perspective, how important is the human element when it comes to corporate finance adoption and use of AI agents, and how might that change as the technology evolves and becomes more mature?\n\nGeorg Glantschnig: Agents automate business processes and can vary in complexity, scope, and autonomy \u2014 from generating insights on request, to running discrete tasks, to dynamically planning, managing, and orchestrating complete processes independently. Agents won\u2019t interact with end users directly but with those users\u2019 copilots. In AI-first companies, we anticipate that every employee will have their own copilot, and they will be supported by tens of thousands of agents. Our objective is to have a copilot for every worker and an agent for every business process.\n\nWe anticipate that with time, humans will take a more supervisory role, overseeing the work done by the agents, and the agent\u2019s learning processes.\n\nAgents created in Copilot Studio are limited by the actions and tools that are explicitly defined by the author. Each interaction an author has with an agent is logged, so authors are able to review the record to see which actions are called by the agent and why.\n\nAgents created for Dynamics 365 include \u201chuman in the loop\u201d approvals. For example, the Account Reconciliation Agent in Dynamics 365 Finance automatically reviews and reconciles transactions between subledgers and the general ledger. When it finds discrepancies, it escalates them to a human for further review.\n\nHumans remain in control by selecting the functions the agent handles and can update these settings at any time. The agent suggests solutions for discrepancies based on previous human resolutions. As it works alongside humans, the agent learns and proactively proposes updates to rules and actions enabling it to gradually become more autonomous. At any time, humans can review the agent's operations, ensuring full visibility and establishing trust.\n\nCFO Dive: Is there a risk that certain roles within the corporate finance function could be displaced by AI agents in the future? If so, how much of this could we see?\n\nGeorg Glantschnig: AI agents are helping revolutionize many financial workflows, by automating and streamlining labor intensive processes like financial close. By doing so, financial professionals are able to spend more time focusing on providing strategic insights and driving business growth, while ensuring accuracy and organizational compliance. We are seeing AI agents help drive similar shifts across sales, service, and other business functions and are optimistic about the future of AI-first business processes.\n\nWe see the AI revolution as one that is fundamentally reshaping work and how work gets done. While it\u2019s too soon to determine the exact impact on the finance workforce, it\u2019s likely that some jobs will disappear, and some new ones will emerge. As mentioned above, administrative jobs might turn into supervisory roles, and we\u2019re seeing a new role of \u201cagent business administrators\u201d emerging \u2014 with a responsibility for setting up and continuously improving the agents.",

            "content": "I know some people are convinced this is a possibility, and there's precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the WannaCry vulnerability in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 after its support had officially ended.\n\nAlso: For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide\n\nOf course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that's the recommendation from Microsoft's official Product End of Support page:\n\nOnce a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.\n\nFor Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don't meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out the last time I looked at this issue, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs -- some only five or six years old -- will instead have the following options:\n\nInstall a non-Microsoft operating system. Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop Linux finally takes hold, although that's unlikely. ChromeOS Flex might be another option, but it has its own hardware compatibility requirements that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.\n\nMaybe 2026 will be the year when desktop Linux finally takes hold, although that's unlikely. ChromeOS Flex might be another option, but it has its own hardware compatibility requirements that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware. Ignore Microsoft's warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway. There are options to install Windows 11 on \"incompatible\" hardware, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can't afford a new one likely don't have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.\n\nThere are options to install Windows 11 on \"incompatible\" hardware, but they require a fair amount of technical experience.

I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach. Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best. History suggests that this is the most likely option.\n\nNothing in the company's behavior over the past year suggests they have any plans to extend the support deadline for Windows 10.\n\nMicrosoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like WannaCry, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.\n\nAlso: This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster\n\nThat incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company's reputation. That's why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.\n\nConsumers have the option to pay for updates for a year. I predict that few will do so. After that? Well, you're on your own.",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nWow, what a run it has been for Microsoft Teams!\n\nWhen Microsoft Teams was first introduced in late 2016, no one could have anticipated the journey that we\u2014Microsoft\u2019s customer zero\u2014would go on over such a short amount of time. The \u201cnew chat-based workspace in Office 365\u201d promised an entirely new experience that would bring people, conversations, content, and tools together in ways that empowered users\u2014including our employees\u2014to collaborate and achieve more.\n\nWe were eager to start using Microsoft Teams here at Microsoft. Our team\u2014Microsoft Digital Employee Experience\u2014deployed it across the company as soon as it launched. We\u2019ve learned a ton along the way, lessons that the product group used to make Microsoft Teams even more enterprise ready.\n\nOur employees\u2019 ability to collaborate has grown as Microsoft Teams has grown. We\u2019ve developed an amazing flywheel\u2014embracing new capabilities, collecting feedback from our employees, and funneling them back to our product group partners, which in turn has\n\nfueled more innovation in the product. we\u2019ve used Microsoft Teams to communicate, share ideas, and get work done.\n\nFast forward to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams allowed us to keep working and to stay connected as we shifted to working from home. We were able to come together through meetings, chats, and calls, collaborate, and automate business processes, all within a single app. Microsoft Teams enabled our employees and customers to successfully work remotely, for students to continue their education, and for all of us to stay connected on a personal level.\n\nHaving built a product that is now a staple in our everyday lives, the Microsoft Teams product group continues to innovate, and has taken the learnings from the past five years to improve its user experience. Things like creating more natural and engaging meeting experiences, enabling employees to connect seamlessly with those inside and outside of their networks, and providing ways to make remote presentations richer and more impactful have all helped elevate the Microsoft Teams experience.\n\nIn celebration of its fifth birthday, let\u2019s look at five ways Microsoft Teams has helped transform the way we work at Microsoft.\n\nNo. 1: Shifting successfully from on-site to remote to hybrid\n\nWhile colleagues in China were already home and working with Microsoft Teams, the Seattle area was the first US region to get hit hard by COVID 19. Around 50,000 Microsoft employees were some of the initial US residents to be asked to pack up their desks and work from home. With employees already being heavy Microsoft Teams users, product usage went up significantly on the first day of remote work. Microsoft Teams meetings more than doubled (2.5 times) globally from 2020 to 2021, and we anticipate this will continue to climb in 2022. Real-time connection and collaboration within Microsoft Teams were key components of transitioning from on-site to remote work, with users sending on average 45 percent more chats per week from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAs we shift to a new normal of hybrid work, Microsoft Teams will continue to be a critical component of our success. Preparing physical space (conference rooms), expanding capabilities within Microsoft Teams, and adapting to new cultural norms when conducting Microsoft Teams meetings will all be key for an improved hybrid meeting experience.\n\nNo. 2: Making Microsoft Teams a hub for inclusivity\n\nAn unexpected result of remote work has been an unprecedented 20 percent increase in meeting experience satisfaction. In our bi-annual employee survey, our net satisfaction (NSAT) for meeting experience climbed to 149, up from 125 two years prior. The primary reason is simple\u2014universal remote meeting participation created an even playing field. Our more inclusive atmosphere for all meant our formerly remote participants were no longer at a disadvantage relative to their peers who used to attend in person.\n\nA key priority as we shift to hybrid is to retain that inclusive environment and employee satisfaction. One way we can do this is by taking advantage of new features in Microsoft Teams, such as front row, as well as new hardware in meetings rooms such as AI-powered cameras, so everyone can participate in meetings. We will continue to take advantage of Microsoft Teams features that drive interaction and participation, like meeting chat and the \u201craise hand\u201d feature, as well as reactions, emojis, and integrated GIF support. This ensures our employees will have a more personal and interactive meeting experience, whether they\u2019re joining remotely or attending from a conference room.\n\nLearn how we\u2019re driving inclusive and effective meetings at Microsoft with Microsoft Teams.\n\nNo. 3: Fostering real-time and asynchronous collaboration\n\nOur monthly active use of Microsoft Teams channels has gone up nearly 200 percent. Microsoft Teams continues to be our hub for creating focused spaces for seamless collaboration, and has also helped our employees and their teams better communicate, collaborate, and manage access to files and notes. And as usage has gone up, so has satisfaction in the way we collaborate. We also saw a 42 percent increase in \u201cafter hours\u201d Microsoft Teams chats from 2020 to 2021, allowing users to communicate in a more flexible manner and fostering the need for an asynchronous way to collaborate. Additionally, our employees report that they are collaborating more effectively\u2014our collaboration NSAT increased by 10 percent after we started working remotely.\n\nWith apps like Yammer and Microsoft Power Platform now integrated into Microsoft Teams, this has further helped users actively engage with their colleagues in several new and exciting ways. And going forward, Microsoft Loop will enhance this real-time collaboration, allowing users to create content by combining a powerful and flexible canvas with portable components that move freely and stay in sync within Microsoft Teams and across other applications.\n\nNo. 4: Boosting your productivity with Microsoft Teams\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that companies that remained productive during the COVID era used the latest technology to continue working effectively and efficiently. Microsoft Teams has been a large factor in this. Companies like Accenture, Toyota, Kohler, Lumen, Ernst & Young, and Pfizer are just a few of the companies that use Microsoft Teams to keep their global enterprises running successfully.\n\nMicrosoft Teams\u2019 shift from a tool that was originally focused solely on collaboration, to an application that helps deliver on business process and automation, has enabled enterprises like Microsoft to help their employees stay productive during the unique challenges of remote and now hybrid work. Additionally, alongside the company\u2019s use of Microsoft Teams, Microsoft has also seen a sharp increase in the internal use of the Microsoft Power Platform, including a 27 percent increase in Microsoft Power Apps usage and a 93 percent increase in Microsoft Power Apps usage from 2020 to 2021. This growth has been fueled in part by how our employees are increasingly using the two platforms together.\n\nAt Microsoft, our employees use a set of helpful tips and tricks to get the most out of Microsoft Teams and keep their workday and usage of the application as productive as possible. While we\u2019ve introduced several new applications to Microsoft Teams over the past five years, we\u2019ve also learned and instilled best practices for things like Microsoft Teams meetings. This includes considerations like meeting length and established norms before you start a call, so participants know the expectations and outcomes for a meeting.\n\nRead these tips from Microsoft for staying productive in an evolving hybrid world.\n\nNo. 5: Learning and evolving\n\nAs Microsoft\u2019s customer zero, we\u2019re constantly learning from our employees on ways to improve and evolve Microsoft Teams, and this happens on a rapid basis. We share this feedback with our colleagues on the product group, and they use it to shape everything from how they roll out new Microsoft Teams features to the designing Microsoft Teams policies. Staying ahead of employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 growing needs has never been more important. And while those of us responsible for deploying Microsoft Teams to our 280,000 full-time employees and vendors are in this constant state of listening and learning, we\u2019ve realized that for our employees, having access to mechanisms that allow them to be more informed is an opportunity as well.\n\nThat\u2019s why this past year, we integrated Microsoft Viva\u2014an integrated employee experience platform\u2014into Microsoft Teams. Modules like Viva Learning help employees discover learning opportunities and recommended training to help them build their skills through the flow of their workday. And one thing the pandemic and remote work has taught us is that work fatigue and digital overload is real and can be challenging to our well-being. The Viva Insights module built into Microsoft Teams can help employees achieve better balance and reinforce boundaries between work and life.\n\nAs we anticipate the future, there is so much excitement in where Microsoft Teams is headed! We\u2019re preparing for advancements like Microsoft Mesh, which will enable presence and shared experiences through mixed reality, from anywhere and on any device. This is just one aspect of the continued evolution of the Microsoft Teams experience. There has been so much growth in the past five years for Microsoft Teams, but one thing we know for sure is that our employees will use Microsoft Teams to connect, collaborate, and explore with even more depth and dimension. Here\u2019s to the next five years of our Microsoft Teams journey!\n\nLearn more about advancing your meetings with the Microsoft Teams Meeting guide.\n\nDiscover reinventing Microsoft\u2019s Employee Experience for a hybrid world.\n\nRead more about using Microsoft Teams and ServiceNow to enhance end user support.",

            "content": "As he prepares to turn 70 later this year, Microsoft founder Bill Gates\u2019 new memoir explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his internal operating system.\n\nIn \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the first installment of a trilogy retracing his journey from an often misunderstood kid to a polarizing technology titan to an influential philanthropist, Gates dissects his brain\u2019s unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.\n\nTraf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.\n\nBy 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft\u2019s CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates\u2019 $100 billion personal fortune.\n\n\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates\u2019s drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn\u2019t touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.\n\n\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d\n\nThat might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.\n\nGate\u2019s self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father\u2019s side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.\n\nWhen he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.\n\n\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d\n\nGates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn\u2019t insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.\n\nEvans\u2019 death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.\n\n\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d\n\nEvans\u2019 death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.\n\nGates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \u201cKung Fu\u201d series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019 mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft\u2019s software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\n\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.\n\n\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won\u2019t be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest.",

Let\u2019s explore how your business can maximize the value of Microsoft\u2019s artificial intelligence.\n\nRELATED: The IT services and security strategies that support small businesses.\n\nFour Ways to Make the Most of Copilot\n\nThe scope of generative AI is often overwhelming for small and midsize businesses. Some companies respond by avoiding AI, while others go all in. Both approaches can lead to missed opportunities.\n\nHere are four ways to make the most of Copilot for Microsoft 365:\n\nStreamline routine tasks. Copilot can help streamline tasks such as managing emails, creating documents and tracking schedules. For example, Copilot in Outlook can summarize long email threads and reports to save time; Copilot in Word can help draft and edit documents. At scale, Copilot can use data from Outlook and Teams to provide a daily schedule for staff. Enhance data analytics. Copilot can also pull data from multiple sources to discover new patterns or trends. These sources can include Teams meeting notes, emails or data stored in Excel spreadsheets. Foster collaboration. Using Copilot, SMBs can receive post-meeting summaries that highlight key points and action items, known as an \u201cintelligent recap.\u201d In combination with details about current or upcoming projects, Copilot can help create project plans and timelines that account for staffing levels, required resources and milestones. Ensure data security and compliance. Copilot adheres to existing security, privacy and compliance policies within Microsoft 365. Businesses can set access restrictions based on user roles or other factors to ensure confidentiality.\n\nREAD MORE: Three ways Microsoft Copilot can boost productivity.\n\nBest Practices for Copilot Implementation\n\nWhile Copilot is intelligent and adaptable, businesses can pave the way to increased productivity with three best practices.\n\nClassify critical data. Copilot can intelligently allow or restrict access to critical data \u2014 so long as this data is properly classified and labeled. By classifying data before applying Microsoft 365 Copilot, businesses can improve access controls and reduce security risks. Prioritize data formatting. Format matters for data analysis and trend forecasting. For example, data in Excel must be in table format for Copilot discovery and analysis. Bridge the gap with expert assistance. Many small businesses have a gap between current and ideal IT environments. Legacy and agile applications may work side by side, and staff may lack the skills they need to best use AI. CDW experts can work with your business to determine whether your environment is conducive to Copilot deployment; they can also conduct assessments that pinpoint areas for improvement and ensure users have the knowledge and tools necessary to maximize value.\n\nCHECK OUT: Our list of 30 IT influencers in 2025.",

            "content": "Microsoft, a major buyer of carbon credits, is investing again in forest carbon removal projects. The tech giant has signed a long-term agreement with Chestnut Carbon, based in New York. Chestnut is known for developing nature-based carbon removal credits.\n\nThrough this partnership, Microsoft will get more than 7 million tons of carbon credits. These credits will come from Chestnut\u2019s ARR project, which covers the Southern United States, including Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana.\n\nThe partnership marks a significant step forward to their initial agreement from December 2023. The delivery of carbon credits will take place in multiple phases, with each phase operating under a 25-year term. As part of the project, approximately 60,000 acres of land will be restored by planting 35 million native hardwood and softwood trees, creating lasting environmental benefits.\n\nHow Chestnut\u2019s Sustainable Restoration Project Works\n\nChestnut\u2019s Sustainable Restoration Project targets marginal croplands and pastures across the United States. The company collaborates with local foresters, landowners, and nurseries to plant diverse hardwood and pine seedlings tailored to each region\u2019s ecology. These forests are designed to improve air and water quality, enhance wildlife habitats, and support local communities.\n\nBen Dell, CEO of Chestnut and Managing Partner of Kimmeridge said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be expanding our collaboration with Microsoft given their market leadership in net zero commitments and the signing of a second agreement within the span of a year reaffirms their view that Chestnut is delivering high quality removal credits.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that nature-based afforestation is currently the most scalable and cost-effective method for carbon removal. Furthermore, they remain committed to delivering high-quality credits while continuing to strengthen their market leadership. Chestnut Sustainable Restoration Project site preparation in Cleveland County, Arkansas.\n\nKey steps include:\n\nDesigning and planting sites based on regional soil, drainage, and land-use characteristics.\n\nMonitoring tree survival rates to ensure the project\u2019s long-term success.\n\nMeasuring carbon stocks after five years using proprietary technology verified by Gold Standard\u00ae.\n\nHigh-Quality, Removal-Based Carbon Credits\n\nMost significantly, Chestnut\u2019s Sustainable Restoration Project delivers measurable and durable carbon removal, distinguishing it from emissions-avoidance initiatives. Furthermore, the company ensures accurate carbon sequestration tracking by adhering to Gold Standard\u00ae verification.\n\nChestnut uses its proprietary technology to measure and monitor the stored carbon in trees rigorously for five years. Additionally, it issues credits based on carbon removal measurements rather than emissions avoidance.\n\nKey Features of the Project:\n\nDurability: Long-term conservation efforts mitigate risks from fire, disease, or other threats.\n\nAdditionality: Restores degraded agricultural lands to native ecosystems, creating benefits that would not exist without carbon credit markets.\n\nEnvironmental Impact: Enhances air, water, and wildlife habitats while supporting local economies and stakeholders\n\nMicrosoft Scaling Up Chestnut\u2019s ARR Portfolio for Long-Term Impact\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s commitment to the project is vital for its success. The collaboration enables Chestnut to expand its Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) portfolio to 500,000 acres by 2030.\n\nNotably the project aims to remove 100 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the next 50 years. With this milestone, it would be one of the largest nature-based carbon removal initiatives in the U.S.\n\nBrian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft noted,\n\n\u201cThis agreement with Chestnut Carbon is another positive step towards Microsoft\u2019s goal to become carbon negative by 2030. We look forward to the prospect of scaling forest restoration within the United States, attracting sophisticated private capital in the process. We are glad to see the Sustainable Restoration Project diversify the ecological impact of our global carbon removal portfolio.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Laconic Teams Up with Planet to Revolutionize Forest Carbon Insights for Smarter Carbon Credits Trading\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Carbon Removal Strategy\n\nDigging deeper into the tech leader\u2019s sustainability portfolio, carbon removal holds a key place. In recent years, the company has aggressively ventured into nature-based carbon credits, enhanced rock weathering, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), apart from DAC and CCS projects.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest sustainability report revealed that in 2023, the company contracted over 5 million metric tons of carbon removal to be retired within 15 years. Its strategy includes a balanced portfolio of solutions with varying durability, from short-term impact to long-term carbon storage.\n\nLow-durability solutions like forestry and soil-based methods store carbon for up to 100 years, offering high-volume potential in the short term.\n\nMedium-durability options, such as biochar, sequester carbon for up to 1,000 years and adhere to best practices to ensure safety.\n\nHigh-durability methods, including direct air capture (DAC) and BECCS, provide over 1,000 years of carbon storage and involve advanced monitoring for lasting impact.\n\nCommitment to Carbon-Negative Future\n\nAlong with forest removals, Microsoft has a strong focus on BECCS. This emerging technology captures carbon dioxide released from burning biomass and stores it underground, making it carbon-negative.\n\nNearly 80% of Microsoft\u2019s 2024 carbon credits came from BECCS projects. The company\u2019s largest purchase\u20143.3 million credits\u2014came from Stockholm Exergi in Sweden.\n\nMicrosoft aims to become carbon-negative by 2030 and offset its entire historical emissions by 2050. However, emissions rose by 29.1% in 2023, signifying the urgent need to purchase carbon credits from nature-based developers. All in all, this partnership with Chestnut Carbon marks a significant step forward in its sustainability journey and net-zero goals.",

But it came with a catch: two subscriptions. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro charges a whopping $200/mo for unlimited access to the model. The company\u2019s $20/mo service, ChatGPT Plus, also allows access to the o1 model, but with limited access.\n\nAt the beginning of February, Microsoft\u2019s chief of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, announced that access to the o1 model would be available to Copilot users \u201ceverywhere at no cost.\u201d Access to the model is provided by Copilot\u2019s \u201cThink Deeper\u201d function, which requires a few seconds to ponder and research an answer and spit out a response. Because the Copilot app on Windows is now just a PWA, or webpage, you can access it by either the Copilot app on Windows or via copilot.microsoft.com. You\u2019ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account. (The \u201cThink Deeper\u201d control in Copilot is essentially a toggle switch. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201con,\u201d or highlighted, before you enter your query.)\n\nMicrosoft quickly acknowledged that there was some sort of mysterious access limitation in place in the first iteration of Think Deeper, depending on how many people used it at the time. But now that\u2019s gone; on February 25, the Copilot Team said users now receive free, unlimited access to Think Deeper, as well as Copilot\u2019s Voice feature.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of excitement for Voice and Think Deeper and we know many of you have been hitting limits,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cThis should help. And if you haven\u2019t tried some of these experiences yet, there has never been a better time.\u201d\n\nWhat is Copilot Think Deeper good for?\n\nThink Deeper is essentially a more thoughtful version of Copilot, which recently seems to have trended toward more cursory, shorter replies. Don\u2019t consider it a search engine, however; when asked, Think Deeper noted that its information was current up to October 2023.\n\nInstead, Think Deeper excels at what you might call evergreen research \u2014 relating the evaporation cycle to hurricane development, or analysis of a given situation or historical event, for example. Think Deeper will write code and explain it, too: \u201cWrite a basic Windows application that can be used to draw a maze based upon the letters of the user\u2019s first name\u201d produced a thorough process to develop the application, generating custom C# source files after several seconds. (I haven\u2019t taken the time to test it out and/or debut it, however.)\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t shown any indication that it will charge for Think Deeper, either via an outright payment or subscription, or via the credit system that it sneakily implemented as part of an upgraded Microsoft 365 subscription that included Copilot Plus. A Microsoft representative didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nOf course, the AI industry moves like lightning, and OpenAI has already announced o3, which uses a \u201cprivate chain of thought\u201d to develop more complex answers. According to various benchmarks, o3 is significantly better at solving software engineering challenges and solving logical problems. But it almost certainly won\u2019t be free, either.",

Veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen notes that the affliction has even spread as far as the humble electric toothbrush.\n\n\"My electric toothbrush was acting up,\" he said. \"The internet says that I needed to reboot my electric toothbrush.\"\n\n\"Pretty much no part of that last sentence made any sense 40 years ago.\"\n\nCertainly, 40 years ago there was no internet in the way it is understood today. Toothbrushes were primarily operated by a vigorous motion of the wrist rather than an electric current. And a reboot was something most people associated with a new pair of wellies.\n\nTo be fair, the word \"reboot\" goes back more than four decades, but it has only recently become associated with everyday appliances. This writer has an oven that demanded a reboot after its clock got terribly confused about daylight saving time, and a car that refused to go into gear without a software update and a restart.\n\nChen has only to look as far as his own employer: It's been almost 40 years since Windows was first released. Users soon became accustomed to performing regular restarts to keep the system stable. This became an unwanted feature of the operating system as time went by thanks to a never-ending stream of updates, some of which require the computer to be turned off and on.\n\nThe same applies to consoles. Where once the insertion of a cartridge and a flick of the on switch was enough to kick off a few hours of mindless fun, now, if updates have not been assiduously applied, there can be a substantial wait while patches are downloaded, applied, and the inevitable reboot occurs. This, we're told, is progress.\n\nFour decades ago, the idea of a stranger in an online forum suggesting that a toothbrush must be rebooted to make it work would have been laughable. Now everything seems to need an update and a reboot. While technology has improved hugely over the years, the acceptance that everything needs to be \"smart\" is dumb.\n\nAnd as for Chen? \"Oh, by the way, my attempts to reboot the electric toothbrush were unsuccessful. I had to replace it.\"\n\nHopefully not with something powered by Copilot: \"I've auto-signed you up for Microsoft Dentistry 365. It'll only cost a molar or two.\" \u00ae",

For business leaders, this highlights the ethical and reputational risks of such actions.\n\nAlso Read: Are layoffs really necessary when adopting AI?\n\nDid Microsoft fail to prepare a proper exit plan?\n\nBalancing performance management with support structures such as severance packages, transition assistance, or extended benefits could cushion the impact, preserving morale and the company\u2019s image.\n\nThis move could spark similar policies across the tech industry, making it crucial for HR leaders to stay attuned to emerging trends.\n\nCompetitive pressures will demand a fine balance between performance-based decisions and employee engagement strategies that nurture talent retention.\n\nWhile performance-based terminations are sometimes necessary, HR leaders must approach them with fairness, empathy, and foresight to maintain workforce stability and protect the company\u2019s reputation.",

They emphasized that the split email system \u2014 where undergraduates use Google while graduate students and staff use Microsoft \u2014 has introduced complexity and confusion. VUIT also believes that since the professional world primarily uses Office products, undergraduate students gaining experience with OneDrive, Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Teams will help them in their professional lives.\n\n\u201cBy migrating undergraduate students to Microsoft 365, we can provide a more integrated and secure digital environment and improve the experience for undergraduates who move into graduate student or staff roles,\u201d the representative said.\n\nAccording to VUIT, cost was not a factor in this decision as they said the fees Vanderbilt pays Google for their products are small. VUIT stated that policy changes by Microsoft and Google, rising email security risks within Google and a general review of storage offerings prompted an uptick in discussion about making this change beginning in fall 2024.\n\n\u201cGraduate students have used Microsoft email for many years. This change will be a significant enhancement for entering graduate students who have previously completed a Vanderbilt undergraduate degree,\u201d the representative said. \u201cMoving from Gmail to Microsoft Exchange and then back after completing graduate studies is not a smooth process.\u201d\n\nDespite the change, students will be able to keep their Vanderbilt email addresses after graduation. VUIT is developing a plan that will allow students to opt-in to having an alumni email address. This email would be an @alumni.vanderbilt.edu address, and VUIT is hoping to pilot this with a group of current students.\n\n\u201cAs part of this pilot, you would migrate from Google to Microsoft before your peers and supply VUIT with feedback to help improve the process,\u201d the representative said. \u201cVUIT is open to working with student groups to proactively identify issues.\u201d\n\nSophomore Brinnan Smith said he will miss how user-friendly Google Workspace is, although he acknowledged Microsoft\u2019s professionalism as a platform.\n\n\u201cI think the switch is very disappointing but not completely unexpected,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI also feel like this change is against the wishes of the vast majority of students at Vanderbilt, so I feel like we aren\u2019t really being taken into account in this decision by the university.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now.\n\nA notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

However, it also comes with the removal of the free VPN in Microsoft Defender, which I\u2019ve found to be much more useful so far.\n\nMicrosoft says the VPN feature in Microsoft Defender will be removed on February 28, 2025.This means users have around a month to find an alternative.

This includes redirecting traffic originating from VPNs to a phony marketing website. Site visitors are also served Cloudflare challenges in an attempt to filter out bots.\n\nLast but not least, users who attempt to directly visit the final landing page (\"ads.mcrosoftt[.]com\") are rickrolled by redirecting them to a YouTube video linked to the famous internet meme.\n\nThe phishing page is a lookalike version of its legitimate counterpart (\"ads.microsoft[.]com\") that's designed to capture the victim's login credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, granting the attackers the ability to hijack their accounts.\n\nMalwarebytes said it identified additional phishing infrastructure targeting Microsoft accounts going back to a couple of years, suggesting that the campaign has been ongoing for some time and that it may have also targeted other advertising platforms like Meta.\n\nAnother notable aspect is that a majority of the phishing domains are either hosted in Brazil or have the \".com.br\" Brazilian top-level domain, drawing parallels to the campaign aimed at Google Ads users, which was predominantly hosted on the \".pt\" TLD.\n\nGoogle previously told The Hacker News that it takes steps to prohibit ads that seek to dupe users with the goal of stealing their information, and that it has been actively working to enforce countermeasures against such efforts.\n\n\"We expressly prohibit ads that aim to deceive people and we suspend advertisers' accounts if they are found to engage in this practice, as we have done here,\" a Google spokesperson told the publication when reached for comment.\n\nSmishing Attacks Impersonate USPS\n\nThe disclosure follows the emergence of an SMS phishing campaign that employs failed package delivery lures to exclusively target mobile device users by impersonating the United States Postal Service (USPS).\n\n\"This campaign employs sophisticated social engineering tactics and a never-before-seen means of obfuscation to deliver malicious PDF files designed to steal credentials and compromise sensitive data,\" Zimperium zLabs researcher Fernando Ortega said in a report published this week.\n\nThe messages urge recipients to open an accompanying PDF file to update their address to complete the delivery. Present within the PDF document is a \"Click Update\" button that directs the victim to a USPS phishing web page, where they are asked to enter their mailing address, email address, and phone number.\n\nThe phishing page is also equipped to capture their payment card details under the guise of a service charge for redelivery. The entered data is then encrypted and transmitted to a remote server under the attacker's control. As many as 20 malicious PDFs and 630 phishing pages have been detected as part of the campaign, indicating a large-scale operation.\n\n\"The PDFs used in this campaign embed clickable links without utilizing the standard /URI tag, making it more challenging to extract URLs during analysis,\" Ortega noted. \"This method enabled known malicious URLs within PDF files to bypass detection by several endpoint security solutions.\"\n\nThe activity is a sign that cybercriminals are exploiting security gaps in mobile devices to pull off social engineering attacks that capitalize on users' trust in popular brands and official-looking communications.\n\nSimilar USPS-themed smishing attacks have also utilized Apple's iMessage to deliver the phishing pages, a technique known to be adopted by a Chinese-speaking threat actor known as Smishing Triad.\n\nSuch messages also cleverly attempt to bypass a safety measure in iMessage that prevents links from being clickable unless the message is from a known sender or from an account to which a user replies. This is accomplished by including a \"Please reply to Y\" or \"Please reply to 1\" message in a bid to turn off iMessage's built-in phishing protection.\n\nIt's worth noting that this approach has been previously associated with a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit named Darcula, which has been used to extensively target postal services like USPS and other established organizations in more than 100 countries.\n\n\"The scammers have constructed this attack relatively well, which is probably why it's being seen so often in the wild,\" Huntress researcher Truman Kain said. \"The simple truth is it's working.\"\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include a statement from Google.)",

            "content": "Character change. That was the theme of January. After spending November running up after the Trump victory, and then December was all about squeezing all of the last shorts of the market with Tesla and quantum leading, January, really post 1/6 when the fiscal stimulus abated, was all about starting to get valuations down to more appropriate levels. It was the first monthly close below the VWAP of the prior month in over a year. Aka welcome to a world of instability and possibly a bear market.\n\nAs I talked about three weeks ago, we got our rally through Trump as POTUS as Yellen injected whatever TGA money she had left into the system and now we\u2019re running on fumes. There\u2019s a reason so few stocks have gone up through earnings so far. Without new money to continue to push the multiples higher, if growth slows down the stock gets sold. Something that wasn\u2019t true for the last two years thanks to the IRA bill.\n\nI will keep slamming the desk on this point in an attempt to save you all money, the BTFD impulse is dead. That is, unless until one of two things happen, possibly both. Either we get a debt ceiling uncap and Trump signs via Bassenet that we\u2019re going to flood the zone again or we get a massive washout, mostly in the mega cap stocks if we\u2019re being honest. A washout and not (and this part is important) not not not not instant rebound.\n\nWe can get the rebound with more TGA injections, but I don\u2019t think this admin is keen on saving stocks. In fact I think the opposite is true. I think this admin is trying to kill the wealth affect that tech stocks only going up creates. I say tech stocks, because most of the rest of the market excluding a few names trade at sub market multiples. So multiple compressions cannot hurt them that much because there is a floor if earnings stay at similar levels.\n\nThis admin would love if all tech stocks blew up, the rest of the market rallied and then we just flatline for 18 months while Apple goes from 240 to 140, Nvidia goes down 50%, MSFT/META/AMZN/GOOG all fall 25 - 35% and then they stay down for a little bit. The reason the last part is important is 2022 taught a lot of people bad lessons. It taught them if you just keep buying the dip you will be fine. That might be true, but it normally takes longer than a LEAP contract to fully recover.\n\nI keep harping on the megacaps because while they might screen as cheap relative to the market they\u2019re all the most expensive they\u2019ve been against themselves and priced nearly to perfection. Even META and GOOG are about 50% higher than (their own) historic multiples. Not exactly a bargain if anything goes wrong.\n\nWhat did work in January and likely will continue working is a value led portfolio. The top 25 S&P YTD are filled with forgotten names like CVS, Humana, Discover, 3M company, Starbucks, Mosaic, Corteva, and Walgreens (more on them later). This isn\u2019t exactly a who\u2019s who of sexy trend following momentum names. As I wrote about in my 100 thoughts piece, Momentum normally takes a long break after an 18 month run. Long the mag7/growth/tech is just long the momo trade that started in 2023. That trade is over\u2026.at least for now.\n\nThis is not a market where you just buy tech leaps and chill. In fact, that is likely to blow up even worse when it does blow. Right now every tech investor and their mother is crowding into META because they were the only good result out of the Mag names that reported this last week. They\u2019re up almost 20% YTD. Can they push higher? 100%. Hot money is normally buy at any price money. But if I\u2019m interested in owning Meta long term that hot money will eventually sell- often at a price lower than what they bought in at- that would provide you a good entry. No, outside Reddit and a few other names I started buying this week that I talk about below the fold, I don\u2019t really see anything of interest in the tech space and would much rather be anywhere else.\n\nBefore we start talking about this week one last thing about surviving the instability that this market is going to create. If your normal full size position is 10k, start by buying 2 - 3k on day one, wait a few more days, then add another 1 - 2k. Leg into the position over a number of days or weeks. Keep your position sizes small. Even if you think its a grand slam. Survival is the name of the game. If you can dodge the pullbacks, as everyone who followed my hedge I laid out three weeks ago before Trump got elected did on Monday, your returns will crush even if you do slightly under market preform the remaining part of the week. Being flat when the market is down 1, 2, 3% is a huge win over the long term. That\u2019s why, small positions and be light on your feet.\n\nThis week we got three pieces of news worth talking about. Deep Seek, Microsoft\u2019s forward cloud guidance, and Trump and the Fed. I think if I lie and say these are all bullish data points more people will subscribe, but I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it. Again, survival is the goal. None of these points were good for the indexes this week.\n\nFirst, what I wrote about Deep Seek mostly played out. The power source companies and the builders rebounded somewhat into the weekend, selling off with the market on Friday, but mostly doing okay given how bad Monday was. Meanwhile there was Nvidia. Nvidia bulls would like you to believe that the 6mm number that Deepseek said it cost them in manhours is CCP propaganda, and my response to that is in the linked piece. If you don\u2019t want to read it, here\u2019s a funny meme a friend of mine sent me which relays the same point:\n\nNvidia had its first close below the 200dma this week since it started its uptrend. Much like with anything else, can it go higher? Yes, but what Deepseek proves is that the future of compute isn\u2019t only in Nvidia\u2019s hands. Not a great look for a stock that was pricing in all that marketshare.\n\nNext, we had Fed meeting on Wednesday, where the FOMC signaled that no new additional rate cuts are on the table right now. The meeting was mostly a nothingburger, as it should be, but Trump used that opportunity (as he should) to continue blaming them for keeping inflation high. It was the IRA bill Donald! Not the Fed.\n\nNot that the Fed does deserve some of the blame. They also deserve to be shoved in a locker weekly just because they act all high and mighty and above all things political, while also totally not being above anything political. Saying that Trump notably didn\u2019t call for Jpow to be fired. No he\u2019s going to get his pound of flesh on Jpow soon, but what he did do is change the conversation. Since the Fed signaled they were going to start raising rates in November 2021, after every FOMC meeting all Fed officials come out and IMMIDATELY start talking down rates. As if their life depended on getting the 10y and 30y to yield the least number they possibly could. By publish this tweet/truth he\u2019s changing the conversation. The naturally dovish Fed officials cannot come out and talk about how they\u2019re going to 16 cuts this year, and go negative on STIRS next year anymore. The moment they do they\u2019re going to have to explain to an interviewer who\u2019s interested in making headlines, how cutting helps fight inflation (it doesn\u2019t). Follow up, if it doesn\u2019t, why are you thinking about cutting given inflation isn\u2019t going down anymore (ummmm no comment).\n\nNow, we\u2019re going to get less Fed speakers, and those who do speak having a slightly more hawkish tilt.\n\nAdd this to the fact the Trump admin has made sure to announce tariffs during market hours.\n\nAdd the fact that Trump hinted that \u2018stocks go down\u2019 when he did his interview with Jim Cremer back in December.\n\nAdd in how he hasn\u2019t tweeted anything positive about the stock market since he got in.\n\nAnd we\u2019re left with an Admin that continues to act like it wants the market to go down. It wants to kill the wealth effect. Imagine what the admin would like bitcoin to trade at. I\u2019m guessing the btc bulls won\u2019t like that number.\n\nMy sense is in the Trump Admin\u2019s perfect world, the average stock is higher but the megacaps have all come down. Leading to a market that is down 5 - 8% on the year. Next year would be a minor recovery year, but tech doesn\u2019t move up fast enough to fully make up the ground lost this year. Then in 2027 and 2028 we explode higher built on a much stronger, more broad foundation. Obviously this is just pretend, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m far off of what the admin would like the market to look like. They would like a lot of the punters to get washed out. The USD and the market have had a semi strong correlation, as they become the only game in town. By breaking the market, not only do you destroy the wealth effect which would kill some of the consumer based inflation, but you also weaken the dollar, helping spur on domestic manufacturing. Add in a tougher anti-illegal stance and you have the recipe for a helping the lower income population feel safer and make more money per hour, and close some of the wealth gap.\n\nWill he be successful. I sincerely doubt it. But he\u2019s sketching out a better more thoughtful plan about how to fix the ills of the USA than any POTUS since Reagan.\n\nShare\n\nHonestly, the Trump admin can only help with multiple expansion and contraction, and even then only in the short run. The market is perfectly happy to create a bubble or crash on its own. No for the market to go down and possibly stay down there needs to be real economic risks on the horizon. Not just stuff like Tariffs and Deep Seek either, both of which can help create potential new winners for every loser. No, what it needs is news about economic forecasts and bad read throughs.",

Investors and tech leaders are watching closely to see if these breakthroughs will lead to meaningful innovation or if the excitement is outpacing reality. The next phase of AI will depend on how well companies turn these technologies into practical, widely used solutions.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Hello Windows Insiders, today we are releasing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26120.3073 (KB5050090) to the Dev Channel. With this update, we are previewing the ability to use improved Windows Search to find files saved in your OneDrive with Windows Insiders with Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs. We also have a small Paint update rolling out (see below).\n\nStarting today, we are beginning to offer the same Dev Channel updates based on Windows 11, version 24H2 to Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel. These updates will be optional at first, so if you are in the Beta Channel today, you can upgrade when you are ready to do so.\n\nWe plan to make these updates recommended later this year, which means you will eventually get upgraded to 24H2-based updates automatically if you are in the Beta Channel. Until that happens, the Beta Channel will continue to receive both updates based on Windows 11, version 24H2 AND Windows 11, version 23H2 (but sometimes not at the same time). Please note that if you choose to upgrade to receiving updates based on Windows 11, version 24H2 in the Beta Channel, you may lose some feature rollouts.\n\nIf you are an Insider in the Dev Channel, you now have a window to switch from the Dev Channel to the Beta Channel if you would like. This window will only be open for as long as we\u2019re releasing the same 24H2-based updates across both the Dev and Beta Channels. By the end of February, the Dev Channel will jump ahead to receiving updates with higher build numbers and once this happens, the opportunity to switch between these channels will close. When the Dev Channel jumps ahead, things might not be as stable as the Dev Channel is today, so we highly encourage you to evaluate which channel you would like to be in during the time in which the window to switch is open.\n\nNew Copilot+ PC experiences\n\nFind photos saved in the cloud with improved Windows Search\n\nA few weeks ago, we began previewing improved Windows Search with Windows Insiders on Copilot+ PCs. In that first preview, we introduced semantic indexing along with traditional lexical indexing for finding files saved locally in indexed locations on Copilot+ PCs with 40+ TOPS NPU onboard.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce support for also finding photos saved in the cloud with improved Windows Search. Just use your own words to find photos stored and saved in the cloud by describing what they are about like \u201cEuropean castles\u201d or \u201csummer picnics\u201d in the search box at the top right corner of File Explorer. In addition to photos stored locally on your Copilot+ PC, photos from the cloud will now show up in the search results together. In addition to searching for photos, exact matches for your keywords within the text of your cloud files will show in the search results.\n\nFinding photos saved in the cloud currently works when searching within File Explorer directly. This will also work directly from the Windows search box on the taskbar in a future flight.\n\nYou can try this experience out today with your personal OneDrive when signed in with your Microsoft account and connected to the internet. If you are signed into OneDrive with a work or school account (Entra ID), you will only see matches for keywords you are searching for within the text of your cloud files in the search results \u2013 not photos. Third-party cloud providers will be able to support this experience with their services as well with documentation coming soon.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to introduce a new way to find your cloud content in Windows and will continue improving search results and capabilities over time. These improved Windows Search experiences continue to gradually roll out to Windows Insiders on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs, including finding photos saved in the cloud, so you may not see these experiences right away. Support for AMD and Intel-powered Copilot+ PCs is coming soon. See here for more details.\n\nYou can learn more about semantic search on Copilot + PCs here.\n\nFEEDBACK for File Explorer Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Files Folders and Online Storage > File Explorer Search.\n\nOther changes that are included in this Dev and Beta Channel update\n\nThis update (Build 26120.3073) includes other changes and improvements available to Windows Insiders across all Windows 11 PCs in addition to the features noted above that are exclusive to Copilot+ PCs. These changes are documented below in two buckets:\n\nNew features, improvements, and fixes that are being gradually rolled out for Insiders who have turned on the toggle to get the latest updates as they are available (via Settings > Windows Update*).\n\nNew features, improvements, and fixes rolling out to everyone in the Dev Channel.\n\nFor more information, see the Reminders section at the bottom of this blog post.\n\nChanges and Improvements gradually being rolled out to the Dev Channel with toggle on*\n\n[Settings]\n\nWe are starting to roll out the Settings homepage for commercial customers on PCs managed by an IT administrator. The feature will show some existing cards relevant to enterprise-managed PCs like \u201cRecommended settings\u201d and \u201cBluetooth devices\u201d as well as two new enterprise-specific device info and accessibility preferences cards. For commercial customers who also use their Microsoft account on their managed PC, there will also be a new accounts card indicating the presence of both work and school and Microsoft account types. We are starting the rollout of this gradually with managed commercial PCs who have both work and school, and Microsoft accounts presently seeing this experience first.\n\nFixes gradually being rolled out to the Dev Channel with toggle on*\n\n[Taskbar & System Tray]\n\nFixed an issue which was causing the taskbar preview windows to not display sometimes when hovering over open apps in the taskbar.\n\n[File Explorer]\n\nWe did some work to help address an issue where File Explorer might hang when browsing a folder with lots of media in it.\n\nFixed an issue where if you opened a File Explorer window and minimized it in, it might not be rendered correctly when you restored it.\n\n[Improved Windows Search]\n\nFixed the issue where in some rare cases, searching on Outlook while offline might result in some results not being found.\n\n[Live Captions]\n\nFixed an issue where live captions might show an icon in the taskbar, but the window wouldn\u2019t display on the screen, after disconnecting a second monitor.\n\n[Remote Desktop]\n\nFixed an issue which was causing Remote Desktop to show significant display / rendering issues when connecting to certain other computers.\n\n[Settings]\n\nFixed an issue which was causing Settings to crash when interacting with the Bluetooth & Devices page sometimes.\n\n[Other]\n\nFixed an issue where when using GDI+ to shrink an image, the colors may be wrong afterwards..\n\nFixed an issue which could cause shutdown to be noticeably slower on certain devices when a controller was connected.\n\nFixed an underlying issue causing the Windows Security pop up when signing into certain Wi-Fi networks to not be interactable. This may have also impacted interacting with this pop up for certain other options in Settings.\n\nFixed an issue where the description for virtual NICs wasn\u2019t displayed correctly in ncpa.cpl, it showed garbled characters.\n\nFixes for everyone in the Dev Channel\n\n[General]\n\nWe fixed the issue causing a 0xc0e90001 error to occur when booting into Windows Recovery (WinRE) on Arm64 PCs.\n\n[Other]\n\n[Memory leak] Fixed: Leaks occur when predictive input ideas show.\n\nFixed: Leaks occur when predictive input ideas show.

[USB audio device drivers] Fixed: The code 10 error message, \u201cThis device cannot start\u201d appears. This occurs when you connect to certain external audio management devices.\n\nKnown issues\n\n[General]\n\nAfter you do a PC reset under Settings > System > Recovery, your build version may incorrectly show as Build 26100 instead of Build 26120. This will not prevent you from getting future Dev Channel updates which will resolve this issue.\n\n[NEW] We\u2019re investigating an issue causing unexpectedly high DCOM CPU usage for some Insiders after opening the Performance section of Task Manager\n\n[Recall]\n\nThe following known issues will be fixed in future updates to Windows Insiders:\n\nRecall can be enabled or disabled from \u201cTurn Windows features on or off\u201d. We are caching the Recall binaries on disk while we test add/remove. In a future update we will completely remove the binaries.\n\nSome users may see a message to \u201cMake sure Recall is saving snapshots\u201d, while the Settings page for Recall shows saving snapshots is enabled. Reboot your device to resolve this issue.\n\nMake sure you update Microsoft 365 apps to the latest version so you can jump back into specific documents.\n\n[Click to Do]\n\nThe following known issues will be fixed in future updates to Windows Insiders:\n\nSometimes additional context is given when using more intelligent text actions powered by Phi Silica.\n\nThe intelligent text actions leverage the power of Microsoft\u2019s secure cloud to improve your text results by ensuring prompts and responses are safe and appropriate. This data is automatically deleted. Local moderation to ensure the safety of prompts and responses will be added in the future, replacing this cloud endpoint.\n\nIf any of your actions on image entities are no longer appearing, please ensure you have the latest updates for the Photos and Paint app from the Microsoft Store.\n\n[Live captions & real-time translation]\n\nThe following known issues will be fixed in future updates to Windows Insiders:\n\nSome Insiders may see a crash on first launch of live captions. Restart live captions if you encounter this issue and you will not see it again.\n\nIf audio is playing or the microphone is enabled, switching languages will crash live captions. Stop audio when changing languages to resume captions or translations.\n\n[Improved Windows Search]\n\nThe following known issues will be fixed in future updates to Windows Insiders:\n\n[NEW] The AI sparkle and underline animation in the File Explorer search box is not present in this build even when improved Windows Search is in use on your Copilot+ PC. If your search results are powered by improved Windows Search, you will see a notice at the bottom of File Explorer stating, \u201cSearch uses AI to find results\u201d and directing you to file feedback if something doesn\u2019t look right.\n\nThe AI sparkle and underline animation in the File Explorer search box is not present in this build even when improved Windows Search is in use on your Copilot+ PC.

In this build, the search box on the taskbar does not yet have the same underline and sparkles icon UI that the File Explorer search box has. This is coming in a future flight.\n\nIn some rare cases, improved Windows search experiences may not be available and may require a reboot to start working.\n\nIn some rare cases, File explorer search might be unresponsive and may require a reboot to start working.\n\nThe tip about the new search improvements appears whenever you set focus to the search box in File Explorer, rather than only once.\n\n[File Explorer]\n\nWe\u2019re investigating an issue causing File Explorer to be very slow to close for some Insiders when closing using the X button. This may also have an impact on the other title bar buttons.\n\n[Power and Battery]\n\n[NEW] The colors in the new battery icon aren\u2019t displaying correctly when you have your mode in Personalization > Colors set to certain options with Custom.\n\n[Settings]\n\n[NEW] The Home page of Settings may crash. If you are impacted by this, you should still be able to open specific Settings pages directly by searching for them from the taskbar.\n\nPaint Update\n\nWe are rolling out an update for Paint (version 11.2412.271.0 and higher) to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels. In this update, we are introducing the Copilot menu to Paint where you can access all the intelligent features which help you complete your image generation and editing tasks faster. Clicking on the Copilot icon from the toolbar will expand into a drop-down menu where you can easily access the features Cocreator, Image Creator, Generative erase, and Remove background. Note that Cocreator is only available on Copilot+ PCs. Within the dropdown, each feature will also include a short description to help you choose the right tool.\n\nFEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Apps > Paint.\n\nReminders for Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel\n\nWindows Insiders in the Dev Channel receive updates based on Windows 11, version 24H2 via an enablement package (Build 26120.xxxx).\n\nvia an enablement package (Build 26120.xxxx). Updates delivered to the Dev Channel are in a format that offers a preview of enhancements to servicing technology on Windows 11, version 24H2. To learn more, see https://aka.ms/CheckpointCumulativeUpdates.\n\nMany features in the Dev Channel are rolled out using Control Feature Rollout technology, starting with a subset of Insiders and ramping up over time as we monitor feedback to see how they land before pushing them out to everyone in this channel.\n\nFor Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel who want to be the first to get features gradually rolled out to you , you can turn ON the toggle to get the latest updates as they are available via Settings > Windows Update*. Over time, we will increase the rollouts of features to everyone with the toggle turned on.

Features and experiences included in these builds may never get released as we try out different concepts and get feedback. Features may change over time, be removed, or replaced and never get released beyond Windows Insiders. Some of these features and experiences could show up in future Windows releases when they\u2019re ready .\n\n. Some features in active development we preview with Windows Insiders may not be fully localized and localization will happen over time as features are finalized. As you see issues with localization in your language, please report those issues to us via Feedback Hub.\n\nPlease note that some accessibility features may not work with features like Recall and Click to Do while in preview with Windows Insiders.\n\nBecause the Dev and Beta Channels represent parallel development paths from our engineers, there may be cases where features and experiences show up in the Beta Channel first.\n\nCheck out Flight Hub for a complete look at what build is in which Insider channel.\n\nThanks,\n\nAmanda & Brandon",

New Jersey is our home, and we\u2019re excited to continue our partnership with the state by making it a leader in AI advancement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI is rapidly evolving and New Jersey is capitalizing on this moment to cement our place as a national leader in the industry. By bringing together world-class leaders like Princeton, Microsoft, and CoreWeave, Governor Murphy is building upon the Garden State\u2019s longstanding legacy in innovation and helping advance cutting-edge AI technologies,\u201d said New Jersey Economic Development Authority Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. \u201cThe opportunity presented by AI aligns with Governor Murphy\u2019s vision for cultivating high-growth sectors, with the goal of creating family-sustaining career opportunities. Showcasing New Jersey\u2019s bustling innovation community, talent pool, and robust resources will help AI companies recognize the state\u2019s value proposition for growing innovative companies of the future.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, CoreWeave, the NJEDA, and Princeton University are founding equity partners in the newly created NJ AI Hub. Together, they expect to invest over $72 million to support the long-term success of the Hub, including up to $25 million of non-binding commitment from the NJEDA.\n\nA portion of NJEDA\u2019s and CoreWeave\u2019s committed funding will include a planned NJ AI Venture Fund that will support innovation commercialization through equity investments.\n\nMicrosoft, CoreWeave, the NJEDA, and Princeton University will focus on the following three pillars of programming at the NJ AI Hub:\n\n1. Research and development: The NJ AI Hub will help companies across a range of industry sectors integrate and apply AI in their businesses and use it to advance their research and development efforts. The Hub will focus on applications of AI in several industry sectors that have strong footprints in New Jersey such as the life sciences, clean energy and climate resilience, telecommunications and cybersecurity, and infrastructure and logistics. The NJ AI Hub will also actively engage New Jersey\u2019s research universities on applied research in AI and will host events to connect companies developing and using AI tools with cutting-edge research and potential collaborators.\n\n2. Commercializing and accelerating innovation: An AI accelerator will be operated at the NJ AI Hub, which will help facilitate the growth of the early-stage AI ecosystem in New Jersey. The accelerator will host cohorts of start-up ventures and will provide them with essential support services such as workspace, compute power, legal assistance, and business development advice. In addition, these start-ups will have coordinated access to the NJ AI Hub\u2019s corporate partners for mentorship and networking opportunities.\n\n3. Strengthening AI education and workforce development: The Hub will work closely with New Jersey\u2019s higher education community to promote high-quality talent development at all levels and will leverage the resources of Microsoft\u2019s TechSpark program . By developing shared curricula, projects, and teaching tools for AI courses, training community college faculty in teaching AI, and creating upskilling opportunities to help workers across disciplines apply AI in their work, the Hub will coordinate efforts to build the State\u2019s pool of AI talent. Ongoing collaboration with employers will ensure that education and training programs are providing trainees with industry-recognized credentials and in-demand skills for the workforce. The NJ AI Hub will also be able to connect employers with opportunities to host AI apprenticeships, develop customized upskilling training for their workers, recruit talent from New Jersey schools for jobs and internships, and partner with project-based AI courses at the college and graduate level.\n\nThrough this new AI Hub, Microsoft will be bringing its TechSpark program to New Jersey. Founded in 2017, Microsoft TechSpark fosters inclusive economic opportunity across the U.S., including job creation and innovation, by working in communities and investing in local organizations. TechSpark operates across all 50 states and to date, TechSpark has helped secure more than $700 million in community funding for local innovation, trained 65,000 people in critical technology skills, and created 4,500 jobs.\n\nPlans for an AI Hub were announced by Governor Murphy and President Eisgruber in 2023. Pending NJEDA Board approval, the NJ AI Hub will be supported through the NJEDA\u2019s Strategic Innovation Center (SIC) initiative. The NJEDA has executed a non-binding term sheet to support the NJ AI Hub\u2019s operating budget for up to five years. In total, the NJEDA is anticipated to invest up to $25 million to support the NJ AI Hub and the NJ AI Venture AI Fund.\n\nFor further updates, please visit the NJ AI Hub website at njaihub.org",

While Microsoft said that features already built into its Web browser, like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, help to notify users of and block known scam sites, their models will help to protect users against new or undiscovered scams in Web sites, messages and emails.\n\n\"Scams have become more sophisticated, often moving after a few hours to evade detection,\" said Microsoft, in a blog post. \"This makes early detection crucial for protecting users. Scareware can appear unexpectedly, especially in rogue online advertisements. For example, you might accidentally click on a misleading banner ad while searching for a product manual, leading you to a scareware site instead of the PDF file you were trying to download.\"\n\nScareware blocker works by analyzing full-screen pages and comparing them to a database of known scams compiled with help from the scam-fighting community. The process operates entirely on the user's computer, ensuring privacy by not storing or transmitting images to the cloud, according to Microsoft. If a potential scam site is found, scareware blocker will exit full screen, kill any audio or visual elements on the site and display a warning that the site might be fraudulent.\n\n[Click on image for larger view.] Figure 1. The warning page that will pop up when a potential scam site is visited.\n\nAfter regaining control, users can report malicious sites through Scareware Blocker to help protect others. They may submit a screenshot and diagnostics to Microsoft, aiding Defender SmartScreen in detecting scams. If they choose not to report, the page is automatically discarded.\n\nWhile Microsoft is confident that its new feature will help to identify new scareware attempts, it acknowledges that it won't completely alleviate the problem. \"While we recognize that the scareware blocker may not catch every scam -- especially as tactics evolve -- we are committed to empowering users with solutions while we improve our defenses.\"\n\nUsers who have access to Edge previews can start test-driving the feature now by making sure their browser is up to date and turning on \"scareware blocker\" preview under \"Privacy Search and Services.\"",

All will work across Microsoft AI\u2019s offices in Silicon Valley and London.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Suleyman said that the APU is looking to hire economists, psychologists, \u201cand beyond,\u201d as well as those with backgrounds in emerging fields such as quantum, nuclear, and silicon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for [people] to capture this hyper-evolutionary space and let us know what\u2019s happening and why it matters,\u201d Suleyman said. \u201cThese roles are incredible, rare opportunities to dig deep and think imaginatively about AI, working from a vantage point at the cutting edge of AI science and product development.\u201d\n\nThe formation of the APU comes shortly after Microsoft created a new internal dev-focused AI organization called CoreAI \u2014 Platform and Tools. A combination of the company\u2019s existing Developer Division and AI platform teams, CoreAI effectively rejiggered Microsoft\u2019s developer divisions to ensure AI remains a top priority.\n\nIn a memo published on Microsoft\u2019s blog in early January, Nadella said that Microsoft\u2019s focus for the coming year will be \u201c[AI] model-forward\u201d applications that \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we begin the new year, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re entering the next innings of this AI platform shift,\u201d Nadella continued. \u201cThirty years of change is being compressed into three years!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Microsoft that\u2019s reorganizing and hiring to study AI impacts and guide the tech\u2019s development.

Or does it just feel like that sometimes?\n\nThe OED defines the word as \"Entreaty or earnest desire that something may be averted or removed.\"\n\nAccording to Microsoft:\n\nA deprecation announcement is an advance notice or a 'save the date' courtesy to signal that the product will be retired or removed in the future.\n\nDeprecated features in Windows 11 include the irritating Suggested Actions feature, designed to provide a helpful list of shortcuts when copying information, such as creating a calendar event when copying a date. The deprecation announcement for the feature came in 2024, although Microsoft did not set a date for actual removal.\n\nMicrosoft told us it was deprecating the veteran NTLM protocols in June 2024, and Microsoft began actually removing the technology from Windows later that year.\n\nThis all leads us to the thorny issue of Windows 10. Has it been deprecated? While the AI overview provided by Google says, \"Yes, Windows 10 is considered deprecated, meaning Microsoft has ended major development and support for it,\" we'd contend that the correct answer is no. Support will end for most versions on October 14, 2025, and development continues, as evidenced by the Windows Insider program.\n\nHeaven forbid that AI overviews might occasionally be wrong.\n\nFor Microsoft, a deprecation announcement is a planning thing. It is a way of saying that a service is going away at some point, and admins should stop onboarding new users.\n\nAs for Windows 10, however, the end of support is still looming. While the operating system is not deprecated, Microsoft has clearly stated the end-of-life date.\n\nThe company is fervently hoping that users are listening. \u00ae",

Surface Laptop 5G will be available later in 2025, enabling your team to work comfortably and productively from virtually anywhere. We\u2019ll share more details on Surface Laptop 5G in the coming months.\n\nThe new Surface Laptop is a true business machine, designed to meet the needs of modern professionals and enhance productivity in any work environment.\n\nSurface Pro for Business with Intel Core Ultra processors (Series 2)\n\nAvailable starting Feb. 18, 2025, starting at $1,499.99 (MSRP)\n\nSurface Pro is the go-to device for customers that are looking for a device that can do it all, offering powerful performance, incredible versatility and enterprise-grade security from Microsoft. It quickly adapts to your team\u2019s needs, whether that is typing a report with a Surface Pro Keyboard[xi], taking notes with the Surface Slim Pen[xi] or using the AI-powered ultrawide camera to keep you in frame on Teams calls. With the versatile design of Surface Pro, it can replace the need to use a tablet and a laptop with one device that can give you the best of both.\n\nThe new Surface Pro is built with the latest Intel Core Ultra processors (Series 2), delivers up to 28% more performance[xii], up to 98% more graphics performance[vii] and up to 2x the battery life during Teams calls[xiii] compared to Surface Pro 9. It also features enhanced local AI processing power with an NPU to amplify your team\u2019s intelligence, efficiency and creativity through Copilot+ PC experiences designed for work.\n\nWhen paired with the Surface Pro Flex Keyboard[xi], Surface Pro transforms into a highly versatile Windows laptop. The keyboard can be used either attached or wirelessly, allowing users to adapt quickly and work efficiently in any environment, from the office to an airplane or train seat. This flexibility enables users to have a comfortable and premium typing experience that enhances productivity wherever they work.\n\nThe 13-inch PixelSense display extends the versatility of Surface Pro even further. It\u2019s designed to be used easily with touch and pen input as a tablet or a laptop, and the anti-reflective and adaptive color technology helps users to clearly see the content on the screen in almost any lighting environment and reduces reflections by up to 50%. The new optional OLED display delivers new levels of peak brightness and immersive colors that improve readability in even fluorescent office lighting environments or even in direct sunlight.\n\nSurface Pro also offers versatile and secure sign-in options. Customers can sign in with facial recognition with the built-in Windows Hello Camera or the built-in NFC reader with security keys like the YubiKey 5C NFC to securely get to work without using a password. Surface Pro is also certified for use with Imprivata Enterprise Access Management (EAM), enabling healthcare providers to tap their NFC-enabled badge or security key to quickly sign in and out. This enhances healthcare workflows and safeguards patient data by logging users off instantly, reduces errors by preventing clinicians from charting under the wrong profile, and increases productivity by providing fast and secure user switching.\n\nAcross industries \u2013 from retail to education \u2013 our customers call out the importance of sustainability in making device purchases, and Surface Pro is designed with those goals in mind. The enclosure is made with a minimum of 89% recycled content, including 100% recycled aluminum alloy and 100% recycled rare earth metals[xiv]. It is also designed for serviceability, with replaceable components such as the motherboard, battery, cameras and a removable SSD that can be accessed through an easy-to-open door behind the kickstand[xv].\n\nSurface Pro is the perfect device for on the go productivity, delivering lightning-fast performance, AI-accelerated power, all in a thin, light and versatile package.\n\nSecure by design and by default\n\nIn line with Microsoft\u2019s Secure Future Initiative commitment, security is our top priority, and we\u2019re intently focused on designing our products to be secure by design and by default. We continually raise the bar to deliver robust defense against the evolving threat landscape for both our customers and the entire Windows ecosystem.\n\nWindows 11, our most secure operating system yet, dramatically reduces exposure to attack by enabling advanced security tools and technologies by design and by default. This protects against phishing, malware, ransomware and other evolving threats.\n\nBeyond Windows, every layer of a Surface device, from the hardware to the cloud is maintained and protected by Microsoft. This gives customers ultimate control, proactive protection and peace of mind wherever and however they work. Our team constantly thinks about how malicious actors could threaten your business and seamlessly ensures you always have the latest through Windows Update, ensuring you and your teams remain protected and secure.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are the most secure Windows PCs ever, with the Microsoft Pluton security processor enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs. Pluton, a chip-to-cloud security technology designed by Microsoft and embedded by silicon partners directly into the CPU, ensures Zero Trust principles at the core. This design helps protect sensitive information such as passwords, user identities and encryption keys from potential attacks. It acts as a secure vault within the computer, ensuring that even if someone gains physical access to the device, they cannot easily steal critical data.\n\nPluton receives regular updates directly from Microsoft, ensuring it always has the latest security features and protections against evolving threats. Microsoft is also working across the Windows ecosystem to update the capabilities of Pluton by introducing the Key Storage Provider (KSP) on Intel Core Ultra (Series 2), Snapdragon X Series and AMD Ryzen AI 300 series processors. This will allow for more secure storage and management of cryptographic keys, further strengthening the overall security of the device, and we\u2019ll share more details on this in the coming months.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures every layer of a Surface device is protected, providing a seamless and secure experience for users and peace of mind for IT professionals.\n\nLearn more about what\u2019s new with Microsoft Pluton on the Windows IT Pro Blog.\n\nUnlocking AI productivity with Windows\n\nThese great new Surface Copilot+ PCs are part of an expanding ecosystem of Windows commercial solutions that serve every job, in every organization. We\u2019re listening to our customers and providing them with more choice so that they can find a Copilot+ PC that fits every need.\n\nAt Ignite, we introduced several AI features that enhance workflows, and boost communication and collaboration by tapping into the NPU on Copilot+ PCs. One of these new experiences is the new and improved Windows Search experience[xvi]. It allows users to find files using associated words and phrases, without needing to remember exact file names or content for both local and active OneDrive for Business files. For example, users can find a document about sustainability by searching for \u201cgreen presentation.\u201d They can also search images based on their content, including text found in an image. Removing the need for precise keyword matching in file names or content can save valuable time, enabling users to intuitively search for files, information or settings in the ways that they can easily remember.\n\nWindows, combined with Microsoft 365 and Surface devices, provides a powerful platform for businesses to securely boost productivity, simplify workflows and enhance collaboration. With tools like Windows Autopatch, Autopilot in Intune, and Windows Backup and Hotpatch, deploying and managing these new PCs securely has never been easier.\n\nNew Security Copilot in Surface Management Portal (Preview)\n\nAvailable in public preview starting Feb. 24, 2025\n\nStreamline the management of Surface devices within your organization with the Surface Management Portal in Microsoft Intune. This powerful tool provides IT admins with a centralized platform to monitor, manage and secure all Surface devices, ensuring they are always up-to-date and performing optimally. Capabilities like device health monitoring, warranty and servicing management help businesses maintain a secure and efficient IT environment, reducing downtime and enhancing productivity of their employees.\n\nWe are excited to share that later this month, customers will have access to Security Copilot in the Surface Management Portal. Copilot provides the power of generative AI in Intune to simplify and enhance the device management experience for IT admins.\n\nWith Copilot, IT admins can quickly search for and resolve specific device issues, summarize warranty information, and access support tickets and service orders related to their organization\u2019s Surface devices. This reduces the time and effort needed for routine maintenance tasks, creating more time to focus on other initiatives. In addition, Copilot pulls contextually relevant data from your Intune-enrolled Surface devices along with public information into a single view, streamlining the management process and enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nWe\u2019ve been in private preview with a select group of customers, allowing us to gather critical feedback and insights that have shaped the current experience. Starting Feb. 24, customers can join the public preview, and the insights and learnings we\u2019ll gain can help us shape the future of the Surface Management Portal.\n\nLearn more about Security Copilot in Surface Management Portal on the Surface IT Pro Blog.\n\nNew Surface USB4 Dock\n\nAvailable starting Feb. 18, 2025, at $199.99 (MSRP)\n\nEnhance your team\u2019s workspace with the new Surface USB4 Dock, the essential dock for productivity and connectivity. Connect and power devices like the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop with accessories via two USB-C, one USB-A, Ethernet and HDMI ports. This new dock delivers fast charging with the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop with up to 65W power passthrough and enables fast data transfer of up to 40 Gbps. Dual 4K monitor support, via USB-C or HDMI transforms your workspace into a three-screen powerhouse.\n\nNew Surface Hub 3 experiences\n\nSurface Hub 3 is the first-party Teams Rooms touch board. We\u2019ve brought iconic Surface design together with the inclusive and collaborative Teams Rooms experiences that define the meeting space. It\u2019s helped our customers create a consistent experience across Hub and other conference rooms and collaborative spaces, for both the teams meeting in those spaces and the IT administrators managing the technology.\n\nNow, we\u2019re partnering with Teams to bring new experiences to Surface Hub 3. Microsoft Edge on Surface Hub 3 will offer seamless access to websites, third-party web apps and personal content[xvii], with an easy-to-use home screen button for walk-up browsing. Edge will run in Kiosk Mode for privacy and security, and Edge sessions can be shared into Teams meetings.[xviii] General availability for Edge on Hub 3 is targeting Q3 2025.\n\nEmployees want the option to share content however is best for them \u2013 so we\u2019re also adding Miracast support to Teams Rooms on Windows devices. Miracast makes it possible to wirelessly project content from a Surface PC to Surface Hub 3.\n\nLearn more about the new experiences coming to Surface Hub 3 on the Surface IT Pro Blog.\n\nOrder today\n\nWith Windows 10 End-of-Support upcoming on Oct. 14, 2025, now is the time to transition your fleet from Windows 10 to Windows 11 with confidence.

            "content": "We all know we\u2019re not going back to the way we worked before the COVID-19 pandemic. Flexible work is here to stay. We\u2019ve learned a lot over the past few years, but really, we\u2019re still at the very start of this journey. How do we find new ways to engage with each other and stay connected? What are the innovations that will let us share experiences, together, even if we\u2019re halfway around the world?\n\nMicrosoft Mesh addresses those questions head-on, enabling shared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. This truly has the potential to revolutionize the hybrid workplace\u2014and the first step in that revolution? Avatars.\n\nAn avatar is a digital representation of yourself. You may have used avatars before for things like gaming profiles or social media, but in a business setting? That\u2019s brand new for all of us.\n\nAs members of the Microsoft Digital Employee Experience organization, we\u2019re responsible for the technology experiences of customer zero: people working at Microsoft. We knew people would have many questions about avatars. How do they affect connections between coworkers? How do they impact meeting effectiveness and outcomes? Can an avatar ever truly be seen as \u201cprofessional\u201d?\n\nEverything we do at Microsoft is backed by data, feedback, and research. To tackle these questions, that\u2019s where we had to start.\n\n[Read our blog post about how Avatars for Microsoft Teams is rolling out to general availability in phases starting this week. Learn how you can get more out of your meetings with our Microsoft Teams Meeting guide. Explore how we\u2019re making Microsoft Teams Premium better for customers. Discover how we\u2019re transforming Microsoft with Microsoft Teams.]\n\nDoing the research\n\nIt\u2019s important that the work we do supports the creation of a \u201cresponsible metaverse,\u201d an inclusive space that\u2019s designed with people\u2019s wellbeing in mind. With that in mind, we engaged with stakeholders and partners to support research and development on diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. We worked with Microsoft researchers, Microsoft Mesh developers and product engineers, and partners both inside and outside of Microsoft. Together, we spent months gathering survey data and user feedback.\n\nThese surveys covered a lot of ground, including:\n\nInclusive options for creating an avatar\n\nOverall experience with avatar movement\n\nAvatars\u2019 responses to audio cues\n\nVariety in customization and representation\n\nAfter poring through literally thousands of pieces of feedback, one fact became crystal clear: personalization is king. People want to be able to represent themselves in accordance with their preferences, in detail.\n\nWe also found a lot of diversity in how people respond to avatars. Some people find that avatars offer a new level of inclusivity and comfort; others found them distracting or odd. Both reactions are valid, and we wanted to make sure people had guidance for navigating these new experiences.\n\nTaking business etiquette to virtual spaces\n\nAs we sifted through all this research, we realized that\u2014after the initial question of, \u201cHow do I customize my avatar?\u201d\u2014the second question on people\u2019s minds was, \u201cHow should I use avatars?\u201d This summarizes infinite questions about appropriateness. Are avatars useful in all meetings? When is it okay make an avatar dance, and when is it not? This is a whole new world of business etiquette, something no one had experienced before.\n\nIn the past, business etiquette and company culture has been learned in person, often picked up by watching others interact and interpreting subtle queues like body language. Clearly, we couldn\u2019t do that here. We needed avatar etiquette. So, armed with our research and key findings, we created guidance for Microsoft employees that we can use as we entered this new world together.\n\nAvatar etiquette\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules about when to use an avatar. Like so many things at work, whether an avatar is appropriate or not depends on context.\n\nUnderstand how avatars currently work\n\nToday\u2019s avatar movement is based solely on audio and any avatar reaction you may choose. Your avatar\u2019s mouth movement is driven by the sound of your voice, and it can\u2019t mimic your body\u2019s movements.\n\nHowever, it does move a bit on its own. This could come across as insensitive or inappropriate, depending on the context.\n\nAs avatar technology evolves, our best practices and etiquette will evolve too. For now, here are the questions we ask ourselves when deciding whether to use an avatar or not.\n\nWhat kind of meeting is it? What\u2019s its intent?\n\nStrategic, tactical, social\u2014the meeting type influences if an avatar is appropriate. Think about the intent and hoped-for outcomes.\n\nIn general, if you would otherwise have your camera off, it\u2019s great to use an avatar instead. Here are some examples:\n\nA weekly sync with your immediate team\n\nA hybrid social event for your organization\n\nAn ideation session\n\nA lunch-and-learn session where you may be eating\n\nThere are some meetings where we recommend not using an avatar:\n\nA one-on-one meeting\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019ve discussed it and would both like to use them.\n\nPerformance reviews (but you probably knew that, right?).\n\nIf you\u2019re involved in a sensitive conversation where body language and facial expression help with engagement. Using your video is best for that.\n\nWill you be presenting?\n\nWhether or not an avatar is appropriate while presenting depends on your audience and presentation content. Who are you presenting to? What is your content and desired outcome?\n\nFor some presentations, you probably won\u2019t want to use an avatar (like a proposal to leadership). But for others (like a learning session), it may actually add to your presentation! Consider your audience, content, and desired outcome. This will help you decide. Avatars can be a great ice breaker!\n\nWhen in doubt, ask!\n\nAvatars are new for all of us, so it\u2019s important to bring a growth mindset when using them.\n\nHave a conversation with your coworkers about how your team feels about avatars. Are there specific guidelines you want to set for your team?\n\nAre there times avatars might feel like a distraction?\n\nIf you\u2019re a presenter in someone else\u2019s meeting, ask them if they have a preference for how you show up.\n\nWhat makes you feel the most comfortable? Your preferences matter, too!\n\nRemember: it can take a while for people to grow comfortable with new technology, especially when it feels personal. If we all treat each other with mutual respect\u2014including our \u201cavatar selves\u201d\u2014we\u2019ll go a long way toward making every meeting inclusive and effective.\n\nWhen is it okay to bust a move?\n\nFist bumps, the wave, peace out\u2014there are a lot of super fun avatar reactions to play with. They add a lot of energy and enthusiasm to a meeting, but sometimes, it\u2019s best to stay still.\n\nThink about it this way: if you were in a physical room with the other meeting attendees, would you do that same physical reaction? If the answer is no, then wait until the moment\u2019s right.\n\nAnd please do remember, an avatar\u2019s movement does not currently mirror the movement of the person behind the avatar. So, if you need to step away during a meeting, remember to tell people. They can\u2019t tell from your avatar!\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nOne key thing to keep in mind: an avatar represents the way that person wants to be represented. This may sometimes mean your avatar doesn\u2019t look the way others expect. That\u2019s okay! The goal is for you to feel accurately represented and fully included. You\u2019re the only one who decides what that means to you.\n\nThat said, sometimes we do want an outside opinion. If you feel like you\u2019re having a tough time getting your avatar right, ask a trusted teammate for feedback. It can be fun to hop on a call and do it together.\n\nPlease do be aware of and avoid cultural appropriation and remember our commitment to being diverse and inclusive. If you\u2019re not finding the right options for customizing your avatar, let us know by providing feedback through the Teams desktop app. The avatar team is eagerly working to make improvements that allow everyone to be expressive, engaged, represented, and heard.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s going to take all of us to create a responsible metaverse. Like all forms of etiquette, our guidance will evolve over time to make sure it meets the needs of a diverse global workforce. We\u2019ll continue to iterate and present new features, customization options, and overall experiences with avatars that support a new and connected way to show up in our world of flexible work.\n\nRead our blog post about how Avatars for Microsoft Teams is rolling out to general availability in phases starting this week, and the latest Mesh product and customer news.

            "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines but falling short on estimates for its Intelligent Cloud business.\n\nMicrosoft stock fell 6% after the market opened Thursday on the news.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue of $40 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase but shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting $25.8 billion.\n\nThe company said it saw 13 percentage points of growth in Azure from AI services. Cloud gross margin, however, decreased to 70% on the company's artificial intelligence build-out.\n\n\u201cWe are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \u201cAlready, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.\u201d\n\nDuring the company's earnings call, Microsoft said its Intelligent Cloud revenue for the current quarter would land between $25.9 billion and $26.2 billion, sending shares lower.\n\nThe earnings announcement comes as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek\u2019s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley\u2019s tech titans.\n\nMicrosoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in AI data centers, with Microsoft saying it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 alone. But China's DeepSeek sent a jolt through the tech sector, saying it trained its AI model on systems that use less power than leading AI chips and at a fraction of the price of those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META).\n\nThat has investors questioning whether Silicon Valley is making the right investments.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, however, attempted to downplay any fears saying that the company\u2019s fleet of data centers is \u201cfungible\u201d and that its investments help the company scale long-term business.\n\n\u201cThe big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that [are] the customers,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 on revenue of $69.6 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nWhile Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively.",

Within that, server products and cloud services revenue increased by 21 percent (Azure) and other cloud services grew 31 percent.\n\n\u201cThis quarter Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion, up 21 percent YoY,\u201d said Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Microsoft. \u201dWe remain committed to balancing operational discipline with continued investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, revenue for Microsoft Cloud overall in the previous quarter was $38.9bn, while Microsoft's Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33 percent (34 percent in constant currency).\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of the earnings call, Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said: \"[It's] another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings, but we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range.\"\n\nCFO Amy Hood responded to Weiss, stating that Microsoft was working from a \"pretty capacity-constrained place,\" suggesting that once the heavy capex period is over, this will improve.\n\n\"You have to have a space, which I generally call long-lived assets. That\u2019s the infrastructure and the land. And then you have to have kits. We\u2019re continuing, and you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short [of] power and space. And so, as you see, those investments land that we\u2019ve made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year.\"\n\nCapital expenditures remained high at $22.6bn for the quarter, up from $20bn the previous quarter. Hood noted that capex is expected to remain similar in the next two quarters as well.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella noted that the annual revenue run rate for Microsoft's AI business - a big driver of high capex - was now $13 billion, an increase of 175 percent YoY and up from $10bn during the previous quarter.\n\nNadella was also keen to focus on the company's improved efficiency with AI. \"We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price-performance gain for every hardware generation, and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And, as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand.\"\n\nThis is unsurprising, given how Chinese AI company DeepSeek's cheaply-trained model caused tech shares to slump, and brought into question the massive amounts of investment that have gone into AI, and are continuing to be made.\n\n\"We are working super hard on all the software optimizations - not just the optimizations that have come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI,\" Nadella added.\n\nDespite this, Nadella was clear that Microsoft would continue to invest in its data centers and hardware.\n\n\"Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years. And we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history.\n\n\"Our data centers, networks, racks, and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next-gen AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of Moore\u2019s law and refresh our fleet, as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost, and HSM,\" Nadella said.\n\nThe company previously announced plans to spend $80bn on AI data centers this year alone.\n\nNadella added that soon customers will be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models locally on its Copilot+ PCs as well as Microsoft's GPUs.\n\nCommercial bookings - new contracts with large customers - were up YoY by 67 percent, which according to Microsoft's VP of investor relations Brett Iverson was largely-driven by large Azure contracts with OpenAI.\n\nFollowing the recent $500bn \"Stargate\" data center initiative announced by OpenAI, Microsoft is no longer the AI company's exclusive cloud provider though retains the \"right of first refusal (ROFR)\" and \"to further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\"\n\nSpeaking on this during the earnings call, Nadella said: \"We remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI... they've committed in a big way to Azure.\"\n\nNadella added: \"Their success is our success.\"\n\nTotal revenues for Microsoft rose 12 percent to $69.6 billion, and the company had a profit of $3.23 per share, beating expectations of $3.11 per share.",

That\u2019s a 19 percent increase year over year.\n\nWithin this segment, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21 percent year over year. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31 percent. Azure AI services attributed 13 points to this growth.\n\nServer business revenue decreased 3 percent, \u201cslightly below expectations, driven by slower, unexpected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch,\u201d Hood said. \u201cEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1 percent, below expectations, with lower-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella added that the vendor saw a good ratio for storage, data services and app services underneath AI workloads and that VMware migration work was \u201cin good shape.\u201d\n\nNadella said the vendor is working to \u201ctweak the incentives, go-to-market\u201d in the scale motion.\n\n\u201cAt a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins so you just don\u2019t keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cYou would rather win the new than just protect the past.\u201d\n\nPositive E5, Microsoft AI Momentum\n\nGood news in the quarter came from increased license upgrades to E5 licenses, work sometimes done by Microsoft solution providers.\n\nPaid M365 Commercial seats grew 7 percent year over year. M365 Commercial products revenue increased 13 percent, \u201csignificantly ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better-than-expected performance of M365 suite,\u201d Hood said.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI business surpassed a $13 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double year over year and more than the $10 billion-plus Microsoft predicted the prior quarter.\n\nAzure AI services saw \u201cbetter-than-expected results,\u201d more than doubling year over year, Hood said. She credited \u201coperating teams pulling in some delivery dates, even by weeks.\u201d\n\nShe said the vendor continues to be capacity-constrained, seeing more AI demand than it can meet. \u201cYou have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right\u2014that's the infrastructure and the land,\u201d Hood said.\n\n\u201cWe have been short power and space. And so as you see those investments land that we\u2019ve made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals.\u201d\n\nNadella shared updated user metrics around some of Microsoft\u2019s products during the call, including:\n\n19,000 paid Microsoft Fabric customers, making Fabric \u201cthe fastest-growing analytics product in our history.\u201d\n\nPower BI has more than 30 million monthly active users, up 40 percent since last year.\n\nThe number of Azure OpenAI applications running on Azure databases and Azure App Service more than doubled year over year.\n\nMore than 200,000 monthly active users on Azure AI Foundry.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Phi family of small language models (SLMs) has been downloaded more than 20 million times.\n\nGitHub Copilot in Visual Studio (VS) Code has more than 1 million sign-ups.\n\nGitHub is home to 150 million developers, up 50 percent over the past two years.\n\nCustomers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability have expanded their seat counts collectively more than tenfold over the past 18 months.\n\nThe number of people who use Copilot daily more than doubled quarter over quarter.\n\nCopilot usage intensity increased more than 60 percent quarter over quarter.\n\nMore than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio, collectively creating more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone, more than double quarter over quarter.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s bridge data cloud grew more than 25 percent year over year and adds every day billions of emails, documents and chats; hundreds of millions of Teams meetings, and millions of SharePoint sites.\n\nDAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician patient encounters, up 54 percent quarter over quarter.\n\n15 percent of premium-price laptops sold in the U.S. over the winter holidays were Copilot+ PC.\n\nCustomers now use Microsoft Purview to audit more than 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use.\n\nDeepSeek \u2018Good News\u2019 For Microsoft\n\nWhen asked on the call about DeepSeek, the Chinese AI lab that wowed AI users this week with a powerful model possibly built for less capital than expected, Nadella said AI is seeing the benefits of any compute cycle, with optimizations bringing down costs, and called the powerful model capable of running locally \u201cgood news\u201d for Microsoft as a hyperscaler and PC platform provider.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has some real innovations,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cObviously, now that all gets commoditized. And it\u2019s going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right?\u201d\n\nJust before Wednesday\u2019s call, Microsoft revealed in a blog post that DeepSeek R1 is now available in the model catalog on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub. However, multiple news outlets also reported that Microsoft and Microsoft-backed OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek improperly accessed OpenAI data.\n\nNadella reiterated the vendor\u2019s close partnership with OpenAI, saying \u201dtheir success is our success,\u201d and said that Microsoft itself has done work to optimize inference.\n\nMicrosoft Q2 In Detail\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue during the quarter of $69.6 billion, a 12 percent increase year over year. It brought in $31.7 billion in operating income, up 16 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nCommercial bookings grew 75 percent ignoring foreign exchange, \u201csignificantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI,\u201d Hood said.\n\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 36 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange. Microsoft expects to recognize about 40 percent of that as revenue in the next 12 months. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18 percent year over year. Capital expenditures were $22.6 billion, meeting company expectations, Hood said.\n\nThe vendor brought in $24.1 billion in net income, up 10 percent year over year. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion, up 21 percent year over year.\n\nIn Microsoft\u2019s productivity and business processes segment, the vendor saw $29.4 billion in revenue, up 13 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nWithin this segment, Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services revenue saw 15 percent growth year over year. Dynamics products and cloud services revenue grew 14 percent ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s \u201cmore personal computing\u201d segment saw $14.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, about flat year over year. Windows original equipment manufacturing and devices revenue grew 4 percent year over year.\n\nHood noted that the OEM results were \u201cahead of expectations\u201d with drivers including \u201ccommercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs,\u201d appearing to reference the economic policy of newly sworn in U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock traded at about $422 a share after hours Wednesday, down about 5 percent.\n\nMicrosoft Q3 Forecast\n\nNext fiscal quarter, Microsoft expects the productivity and business processes segment to see revenue growth between 11 percent and 12 percent, or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion, according to the vendor.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth should be between 14 percent and 15 percent. M365 Commercial products should be relatively unchanged year over year. Dynamics 365 should see growth in the midteens.\n\nThe \u201cintelligent cloud\u201d segment should see revenue growth between 19 percent and 20 percent, or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Azure should grow between 31 percent and 32 percent. The on-premises server business should decline in the mid single digits. Enterprise and partner services revenue growth should be low to mid single digits.\n\nThe \u201cmore personal computing\u201d segment should see revenue between $12.4 billion and $12.8 billion. Microsoft expects Windows OEM and devices revenue to decline in the low to mid single digits. Windows OEM revenue should be relatively flat year over year, but Hood warned that \u201cactual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft grappled with cloud capacity constraints as AI workloads increased consumption of Azure compute in the three months ending Dec. 31, company executives said Wednesday.\n\nThe hyperscaler has close to $300 billion in cloud contracts on its books that have yet to be counted toward revenue, according to CFO Amy Hood. \u201cWe have been short power and space,\u201d Hood said, speaking during the company\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call.\n\nDespite ongoing capacity challenges, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business grew 21% year over year, yielding $40.9 billion in revenues and accounting for nearly 60% of the company\u2019s total quarterly revenues. Azure and other cloud services segment revenues grew 31%, with AI services contributing 13 percentage points to the increase.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs large language models devour cloud resources, Microsoft is pouring massive capital into infrastructure buildouts. The company is on pace to spend roughly $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers this fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history,\u201d Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said Wednesday.\n\nAs the primary backer of OpenAI, Microsoft added a significant cloud consumption engine to its Azure ecosystem. The ChatGPT builder trains and runs its LLMs in Azure data centers, competing with enterprise customers for capacity.\n\nMicrosoft freed OpenAI to source compute outside of Azure earlier this month as part of a federally orchestrated $500 billion AI infrastructure push dubbed Stargate. In the agreement, however, Microsoft retains first right of refusal on OpenAI workloads.\n\nAzure commercial bookings spiked 67% year over year and were \u201csignificantly ahead of expectations\u201d during the final months of 2024, largely driven by OpenAI, Hood said. Renewals and add-ons to enterprise contracts and commitments by existing customers to migrate additional workloads helped drive the increase.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at customers who purchased Copilot during its first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10X over the past 18 months,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMicrosoft expects the capacity crunch to begin to ease later this year, according to Hood. By the end of the company\u2019s current fiscal year on June 30, the company foresees capacity to be \u201croughly in line with near-term demand,\u201d Hood said.\n\nThe company\u2019s capital expenditures including finance leases were $22.6 billion in Q2. More than half of cloud and AI infrastructure spend was on long-term assets, Hood said. The remainder went toward CPU and GPU services to satisfy immediate demand.",

Microsoft stock dropped Thursday following the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report and outlook.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based software giant late Wednesday beat analyst estimates for total revenue and earnings in fiscal Q2, but came up short with its March-quarter sales guidance. Also, its Azure cloud computing infrastructure growth and outlook disappointed.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure business grew 31% year over year in fiscal Q2, at the low end of its guidance range and a deceleration from prior quarters. The company predicted Azure growth in the current quarter of 31% to 32% in constant currency, dashing hopes for a re-acceleration of growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nAzure growth in the December quarter included 13 percentage points from AI services, which increased a greater-than-expected 157% year over year.\n\n\"Demand continued to be higher than our available capacity,\" Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nShe added, \"While we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY2025, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand, given our significant capital investments.\"\n\nMicrosoft Stock Gets Price-Target Cuts\n\nAt least three Wall Street firms lowered their price targets on Microsoft stock after the earnings report.\n\nMizuho Securities analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated his outperform rating on Microsoft stock but trimmed his price target to 500 from 510. He pointed to Microsoft's revenue guidance miss for the current quarter as the reason.\n\n\"Despite the disappointment, we remain confident that Microsoft's revenue growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and we continue to be very bullish on its tangible GenAI (generative artificial intelligence) adoption and monetization levers,\" Moskowitz said in a client note. \"MSFT remains one of our top picks for calendar 2025.\"\n\nMSFT Stock Retreats After Report\n\nOn the stock market today, Microsoft stock sank 6.2% to close at 414.99.\n\nIn the December quarter, Microsoft earned $3.23 a share, up 10% year over year, on sales of $69.6 billion, up 12%. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Microsoft to earn $3.11 a share on sales of $68.9 billion.\n\nFor the March quarter, Microsoft targeted revenue of $68.2 billion, vs. the consensus estimate of $69.8 billion, based on the midpoint of its outlook. Foreign exchange rate effects likely will lower its total revenue by about $1 billion in the period, Hood said.\n\nFocused On Full Tech Stack\n\nChief Executive Satya Nadella said Microsoft is focused on providing the full technology stack for AI. That includes the cloud infrastructure layer with Azure, the data layer with Microsoft Fabric, and the platform and tools layer with Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot and other applications.\n\n\"We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history,\" Nadella said on the call.\n\nThe company's capital expenditures in the December quarter rose 62% year over year to $15.8 billion, vs. the consensus estimate of $15.6 billion.\n\nManagement indicated that capex spending will remain \"at similar levels\" in the March and June quarters.\n\nMicrosoft stock is in the IBD Long-Term Leaders Portfolio.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy DeepSeek's Progress May Actually Be Good News For AI Chipmakers\n\nSynopsys Purchase Of Ansys Will Fulfill Company's Goal\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open",

The company also gave a disappointing quarterly revenue forecast.\n\nHere's how the company did in comparison with Wall Street expectations, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.23 vs. $3.11 expected\n\n$3.23 vs. $3.11 expected Revenue: $69.63 billion vs. $68.78 billion expected\n\nWith respect to guidance, Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, called for $67.7 billion to $68.7 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue compared with the $69.78 billion consensus from LSEG.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue grew 12.3% year over year in the fiscal second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. That represents the slowest growth since mid-2023. Net income of $24.11 billion was up from $21.87 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company's Intelligent Cloud segment, which contains the Azure cloud, contributed $25.54 billion in revenue. That was up about 19% but below the $25.83 billion consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.\n\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services jumped 31%, down from 33% in the prior quarter. Microsoft now has a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate for artificial intelligence, CEO Satya Nadella was quoted as saying in the statement.\n\nOf the growth in the fiscal second quarter, 13 percentage points came from AI. Microsoft does not disclose Azure revenue in dollars. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had been looking for 31.9% and 31.1% growth, respectively.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Hood sees 31% to 32% in Azure growth at constant currency, as the company addresses execution challenges and continues to endure capacity constraints. StreetAccount's consensus at constant currency was 33.4%. In October, Hood had said Azure growth would accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year in comparison with the first half.\n\nMicrosoft might revamp its sales function to better address market conditions.\n\n\"Primarily these are customers we reach through partners and through some more indirect methods of selling,\" Hood said. \"And really the art form there is as these customers which we reach in this way are trying to balance. How do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals? We then took our sales motions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office productivity software subscriptions and LinkedIn, posted $29.44 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue. That was up 13.9% and more than StreetAccount's $28.89 billion consensus.\n\nThe More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, Bing, Surface and Xbox, delivered $14.65 billion in revenue. The number was flat year over year and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $14.29 billion.\n\nSales of devices and of Windows operating system licenses from device makers were up 4%.

The Redmond, Washington-based software maker posted revenue of $69.6 billion in the quarter, up 12% from the previous year, also beating expectations.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet Research expected Microsoft to generate revenue of $68.87 billion in the last three months of the year.\n\nSales from Microsoft\u2019s cloud-focused business segment that includes its flagship Azure computing platform grew 19% from the same time last year to $25.5 billion, which was less than the $25.83 billion forecast by FactSet analysts.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s productivity business segment, which includes its Office suite of email and other workplace products, grew 14% to $29.4 billion.\n\nIts personal computing business, led by its Windows division, remained steady at $14.7 billion, with a drop in consumer device sales offset by growth in advertising revenue tied to the Bing search engine.\n\nMicrosoft shares dropped 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday but were still higher than Monday, when the tech giant was hit by a broader tech stock sale caused by a frenzy over the new ChatGPT competitor developed by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft is a close partner of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and also sells its own AI chatbot services, branded as Copilot.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competes against Azure with Google Cloud Platform and in productivity tools with G Suite and Google Workspace. Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) macOS operating system also goes head to head against Microsoft\u2019s Windows, and its iPhone and iPad products have been a thorn in its side. Lastly, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (XTRA:SAP), and many others compete with at least some subset of Microsoft\u2019s product portfolio.\n\nAside from Azure, Copilot is a suite of AI-powered integrations into various Microsoft products to enhance productivity and streamline tasks. Microsoft 365 Copilot automates writing in Word, modeling in Excel, and email management in Outlook while GitHub Copilot, developed via a collaboration with OpenAI, automates code completion.\n\nCustomers who pay for Microsoft's products and services to enable their own GenAI goals will likely be buying infrastructure, developer tools, and data analytics platforms. Azure sits at the center of Microsoft\u2019s AI ambitions, and it allows enterprise customers to do everything from accessing large language models (LLMs) to analyzing large volumes of data in real-time.\n\nAI is probably the hottest topic in the world of investing today, and the debate for Microsoft is simple. How big is the AI benefit, when will we see it flow into revenue, and how much will it cost from an operating expense and capital expenditure perspective?\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales up 12.3% year on year to $69.63 billion. Its GAAP profit of $3.23 per share was 4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nMicrosoft shows that fast growth and massive scale can coexist despite the conventional wisdom about the law of large numbers. The company\u2019s revenue base of $134.2 billion five years ago has nearly doubled to $261.8 billion in the last year, translating into an exceptional 14.3% annualized growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s growth over the same period was also higher than its big tech peers, Amazon (18.5%), Alphabet (17%), and Apple (8.5%). Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. With these benchmarks in mind, we think Microsoft is a bit expensive (but still worth owning).\n\nQuarterly Revenue of Big Tech Companies\n\nWe at StockStory emphasize long-term growth, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Microsoft\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 13.3% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were good and suggest demand was strong.\n\nMicrosoft Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Microsoft reported year-on-year revenue growth of 12.3%, and its $69.63 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its newer AI-enabling products.\n\nSoftware is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend.\n\nIntelligent Cloud: Azure & Cloud Computing\n\nThe most pressing question about Microsoft\u2019s business is how much AI can boost its revenues. The company's cloud computing division, Intelligent Cloud, is one we watch carefully because its Azure platform and server/database offerings could be the biggest beneficiaries of the AI megatrend.\n\nIntelligent Cloud is 36.5% of Microsoft\u2019s total sales and grew at a 16.9% annualized rate over the last five years, faster than its consolidated revenues. The previous two years saw deceleration as it grew by 13.2% annually.\n\nMicrosoft Intelligent Cloud Quarterly Revenue\n\nIntelligent Cloud\u2019s 18.7% year-on-year revenue growth met expectations in Q4.\n\nYear-On-Year Revenue Growth of Hyperscaler Cloud Vendors\n\nIn terms of market share, Azure is a close second as its run-rate revenue (current quarter\u2019s sales times four) is around $80 billion versus roughly $100 billion and $45 billion for AWS and Google Cloud. If Azure wants to catch up to AWS in the coming years, growth will have to accelerate beyond its current levels.\n\nKey Takeaways from Microsoft\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nInvestor sentiment has recently soured a bit around capex, the GenAI impact on topline, and the OpenAI relationship. It was therefore encouraging to see Microsoft narrowly top analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter, as Personal Computing and Business Services beat while Intelligent Cloud was in line. Within Intelligent Cloud, the all-important Azure constant-currency revenue growth came in at 31%, missing investor expectations of 32-33%. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter but not enough to appease some of the market's concerns. The stock traded down 3.8% to $424.89 immediately following the results.\n\nIs Microsoft an attractive investment opportunity right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

It spent $22.6 billion on capital expenses, almost twice as much as a year earlier.\n\nMicrosoft has said it would spend around $80 billion in data centers this fiscal year, which ends in June.

In a blog post, Microsoft said that the version of R1 on Azure AI Foundry has \u201cundergone rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations,\u201d including \u201cautomated assessments of model behavior and extensive security reviews to mitigate potential risks.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, Microsoft said, customers will be able to use \u201cdistilled\u201d flavors of R1 to run locally on Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft\u2019s brand of Windows hardware that meets certain AI readiness requirements.\n\n\u201cAs we continue expanding the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry, we\u2019re excited to see how developers and enterprises leverage [\u2026] R1 to tackle real-world challenges and deliver transformative experiences,\u201d continued Microsoft in the post.\n\nThe addition of R1 to Microsoft\u2019s cloud services is a curious one, considering that Microsoft reportedly initiated a probe into DeepSeek\u2019s potential abuse of its and OpenAI\u2019s services.

According to a test by information-reliability organization NewsGuard, R1 provides inaccurate answers or non-answers 83% of the time when asked about news-related topics. A separate test found that R1 refuses to answer 85% of prompts related to China, possibly a consequence of the government censorship to which AI models developed in the country are subject.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Customer spending on Azure and artificial intelligence justifying growing capital expenditures. And a potential wave of Windows PC sales. These are some of the top items slated to come up Wednesday when Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant Microsoft reports its second fiscal quarter earnings, covering the three months ended Dec. 31. Financial analyst firms differed on whether they thought Microsoft will beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations. In a Monday report, analyst firm Bernstein predicted second fiscal quarter revenue of $69.1 billion, ahead of Wall Street consensus of $69 billion. Bernstein predicts operating income of $30.8 billion, ahead of Wall Street consensus of $30.2 billion and above Microsoft\u2019s topline guidance of $30.5 billion. [RELATED: Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat Brings Consumption Model To AI Agents] KeyBanc, meanwhile, said to expect second quarter revenue of $68.2 billion, representing 10 percent growth year over year. The firm also predicted operating income for the quarter of $29.8 billion. Here\u2019s more of what to expect during Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings report from Microsoft.\n\nDeepSeek, Stargate, AI CapEx Analysts on Wednesday's call will likely seek comments from Microsoft\u2019s leadership on how some of this week\u2019s biggest headlines affect the vendor\u2019s artificial intelligence business, asking about free Chinese-made AI chatbot DeepSeek and the Stargate initiative of upwards of $500 billion in AI infrastructure spending. At least one analyst firm played down the implications of DeepSeek suddenly capturing the world\u2019s attention\u2013even eliciting public remarks from President Donald Trump\u2013for its claim that its training only cost $6 million and used lower-quality chips. DeepSeek caused an investor flurry that saw Nvidia lose about $600 billion of market value, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history, according to the BBC. DeepSeek\u2019s advancement could bode well for AI vendors including Microsoft, assuming those vendors can implement the same advancements and cost-saving strategies as DeepSeek, according to reports this week from Morgan Stanley. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said the vendor plans to spend $80 billion on capital expenditures this fiscal quarter, much of that for AI. And the vendor\u2019s investment in its Phi small language models (SLMs) to cut down on AI costs signals Microsoft\u2019s focus on cost efficiency over building the most-intelligent frontier model, according to Morgan Stanley. As for the Stargate partnership involving Microsoft-backed ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft cloud and AI rival Oracle and investment firm SoftBank, analysts may seek clarification around Microsoft\u2019s relationship to Stargate and OpenAI. Microsoft revealed earlier this month that it and OpenAI made a new agreement that gives OpenAI the ability to seek other capacity sources with Microsoft holding a right of first refusal (ROFR). Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s new agreement through 2030 gives Microsoft access to OpenAI intellectual property (IP) for use within Copilot, exclusivity on OpenAI application programming interfaces (APIs) and other benefits with a revenue sharing agreement. A quarterly survey of CIOs showed that 95 percent of respondents expect to adopt Microsoft generative AI products over the next 12 months, up from 63 percent a year ago, according to Morgan Stanley. And 97 percent of CIOs plan to utilize Microsoft's AI products over the next three years.\n\nAzure Acceleration Hopes The tech world is watching for new details from Microsoft on how Azure\u2019s revenue is accelerating against larger capital expenditures to meet the needs of the AI era. Microsoft also saw a ramp up in CapEx to meet cloud needs before a major decrease in spending, which is expected for AI as well, Bernstein said in a report Monday. The investment firm expects Azure should grow 32 percent for the quarter and 36 percent growth next quarter, both ahead of Wall Street consensus. Azure instances increased about 17 percent quarter over quarter and 28 percent year over year in 2024\u2019s final quarter, according to a KeyBanc report Friday. However, most of those instances came from increased central processing unit (CPU) offerings, likely not Azure AI revenue. Nvidia Azure instances held steady, but saw the lowest sequential growth in almost three years. The increases came with the launch of Microsoft Azure Cobalt CPUs, Intel CPUs and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CPUs, according to KeyBanc. KeyBanc predicts $18.25 billion in Azure revenue for the quarter, above Wall Street consensus. More VARs called Azure a likely recipient for increased spend by Microsoft customers, according to a quarterly survey by KeyBanc. Azure received 82 percent of responses compared to 74 percent the prior quarter. A recent survey of Microsoft Azure channel partners showed positive activity in the quarter thanks to \u201cfavorable exposure to upper mid-market/enterprise organizations which remain early in their cloud migrations, improving offering and packaging of its data solutions (including Fabric), and AI partnerships \u2013 particularly concerning OpenAI Services,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley. The firm\u2019s quarterly CIOs survey showed that respondents prefer Azure to Amazon Web Services for public cloud. CIOs said that more than 50 percent of app workloads reside in Azure today compared to 33 percent in AWS. More than 40 percent of CIOs said they expect to use Azure OpenAI Service over the next 12 months, according to the survey.\n\nCopilot Chat, M365 Upgrades, AI Agents Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella might have thoughts to share on the vendor\u2019s latest AI product business model, Copilot Chat, which brings consumption and spending against Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) to the emerging AI agents field. Copilot Chat could be \u201can attractive on-ramp to the seat-based Microsoft 365 Copilot for enterprises, particularly in scenarios where adopting the full Microsoft 365 Copilot right away is cost prohibitive,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a report this month. Copilot Chat autonomous agents enter paid preview on Feb. 1. Morgan Stanley also found that Microsoft is the top vendor for customers to leverage for AI agent strategies, which is positive news as the era of autonomous AI programs takes off. On the downside, slower Copilot adoption and moderating Microsoft 365 license upgrades could prove trouble for the vendor, according to Morgan Stanley. Thirty percent of CIOs use E5, up from 27 percent the prior quarter. But only 11 percent of CIOs who use M365 today plan to upgrade to E5 in the next 12 months, down from 22 percent the prior quarter. CIOs report 17 percent in expected Microsoft 365 Copilot penetration across their organizations over the next 12 months, growing to 38 percent penetration over the next three years, according to Morgan Stanley data. However, that is a decrease from the prior survey. The firm predicts $2.6 billion in M365 Copilot revenue for Microsoft in fiscal year 2025 and $6.1 billion in revenue the following fiscal year. That represents 8 percent penetration and 18 percent penetration, respectively. More VARs see Microsoft Copilot offers in production, up to 13 percent in KeyBanc\u2019s latest quarterly survey compared to 6 percent the prior quarter. VARs reported that the main inhibitors to Copilot adoption were cost, security and lack of use cases. Customers upgrading their licenses\u2013which can be due to the efforts of Microsoft solution providers\u2013is more of a contributor to M365 average revenue per user (ARPU) compared to Copilot for now, according to Morgan Stanley. Microsoft\u2019s software-as-a-service Copilot offer excluding GitHub could have a revenue run rate between $800 million and $1.2 billion, according to a Bernstein report Monday. Bernstein predicted $29 billion in second fiscal quarter revenue for Microsoft\u2019s \u201cproductivity and business processes\u201d segment, ahead of Wall Street consensus of $27.6 billion. This segment includes Microsoft 365 Commercial products, M365 Consumer products, LinkedIn and Dynamics.\n\nAI PC Wave Analysts could seek more color from Microsoft leaders on potentially higher PC buying this year with AI PCs on the market and Windows 10 end of support slated for October. Solution providers have told CRN that AI PC enthusiasts still look for a killer app to justify higher prices. Earlier this month computer makers showed off their latest AI PC offerings at CES 2025. International Data Corp. reported that PC shipments in the last quarter of 2024 grew 1.8 percent from the prior year with global volumes reaching 68.9 million shipments. Gartner predictedthat IT devices spending will reach $810 million in 2025, up 10.4 percent year over year. Optimism from the channel might not yet translate into dollars, at least for Microsoft. At least two analyst firms, KeyBanc and Bernstein, predicted Microsoft\u2019s \u201cmore personal computing\u201d segment\u2013which includes revenue from Windows OEMs, devices, video games and news advertising\u2013to come in below Wall Street expectations, coming in around $14 billion for the quarter.",

            "content": "At the 2024 Ignite conference last November, we announced scareware blocker for Microsoft Edge which will provide a new, first line of defense against scams. Today, we\u2019re excited to share more about how it works and invite you to preview the feature.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen it yourself. There are more scams than ever before, on your phone, in your inbox, and in your browser. In fact, our data shows that in 2024, Edge blocked five times more scams on average than it blocked just three years earlier.\n\nToday, Edge uses Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams as people encounter them. But what if you\u2019re the first person to see a new scam before it can be blocked? What if a scam hits your coworkers, your friends, or your family? The FBI reports that victims lose over a billion dollars per year to tech support and related scams. While no one is immune, these scams particularly prey on vulnerable elderly communities.\n\n\u201cScareware\u201d scams are a particularly convincing type of tech support scam. They use aggressive web pages to convince victims into thinking their system is infected with malware, pressure them to call a fake tech support number, and try to gain access to the computer. Last year, Hollywood even made a blockbuster action movie with scareware scammers as the villains.\n\nScareware blocker uses a machine learning model to recognize the tell-tale signs of scareware scams and puts users back in control of their computer. We call on users who want to combat scams to help us test our preview. Read on to learn how you can help!\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Scareware blocker fights tech scams\n\nAnatomy of a scareware scam\n\nUsers can always close a full screen scareware page by PRESSING AND HOLDING the ESC key. We\u2019re hopeful that raising awareness will help users protect themselves, even if they are not using scareware blocker.\n\nWhile users have become more cautious with passwords and the files they download, scareware isn\u2019t on most people\u2019s radar. Even the most cautious can fall victim to scareware, as scam websites prey on their caution to create anxiety.\n\nScams move fast to evade detection\n\nScams have become more sophisticated, often moving after a few hours to evade detection. This makes early detection crucial for protecting users. Scareware can appear unexpectedly, especially in rogue online advertisements. For example, you might accidentally click on a misleading banner ad while searching for a product manual, leading you to a scareware site instead of the PDF file you were trying to download.\n\nScareware uses full screen mode just like video sites\n\nScareware sites often use full screen mode, just like popular video sites. Users know they can press ESC to exit full-screen mode, but scareware sites try to camouflage the ESC option, leaving users unsure of what to do next.\n\nScareware uses audio and keyboard mouse tricks to incite panic\n\nScareware sites also use audio and keyboard/mouse tricks to incite panic. They might play a warning from a computer-generated voice, leading victims to believe their computer has an identity theft virus and urging them to call support immediately. Savvy users might suspect a full-screen web page and press ESC, but scareware sites may try to hijack the keyboard and mouse to prevent escape.\n\nHow scareware blocker will help\n\nAs mentioned above, most people who land on a scam in Edge will be protected by Defender SmartScreen, which provides real-time checks on new and unfamiliar sites where abuse is more likely to hide. Once an abusive site is detected, SmartScreen can protect users worldwide within minutes.\n\nScareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us. The model runs locally, without saving or sending images to the cloud.\n\nWhen scareware blocker suspects a page is a scam, Edge will put users back in control by exiting full screen mode, stopping aggressive audio playback, warning the user, and showing a thumbnail of the page they were just viewing:\n\nSend feedback to protect others & avoid false alarms\n\nOnce the user is back in control of their browser, scareware blocker will let them report the malicious site to protect others. Users can share a screenshot of the scam and other diagnostics with Microsoft, helping the Defender SmartScreen service detect scareware outbreaks across multiple machines. If they don\u2019t choose to report, the scareware blocker model will discard the page.\n\nTo reduce false alarms, users can also report when scareware blocker makes a mistake and blocks a legitimate page.\n\nSending this feedback makes a difference. By reporting false alarms, you help us make the feature more reliable to catch the real scams. Beyond just blocking individual scam outbreaks, our Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit goes even further to target the cybercrime supply chain directly.\n\nHelp us stand up to scams by enabling scareware blocker\n\nWhile we recognize that the scareware blocker may not catch every scam\u2014especially as tactics evolve\u2014we are committed to empowering users with solutions while we improve our defenses.\n\nScareware blocker is rolling out now as a preview for all Edge users on Windows PCs. To enable in Edge, first make sure that previews are allowed by your administrator and also that Edge is fully up to date. You may want to restart the browser once more to make sure your Edge client has the preview.\n\nAfter making sure you have the latest updates, you should see the scareware blocker preview listed under \u201cPrivacy Search and Services\u201d as shown below. Your feedback will help us block scams faster and improve the model to reduce false positives!",

Microsoft Purview is Microsoft\u2019s solution for securing and governing data in generative AI.\n\nI\u2019m often asked how long it takes to deploy Microsoft Purview. The answer depends on the specifics of the organization and what they want to achieve. Microsoft Purview should enable a comprehensive data governance program but it can provide risk mitigation for generative AI in the short term while the program is underway.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Secure and govern your entire data estate. Explore solutions\n\nOrganizations need AI solutions to add value for their customers and to stay competitive. They can\u2019t wait for years to secure and govern these systems.\n\nFor the organizations deploying generative AI, \u201chow long does it take to deploy Microsoft Purview?\u201d isn\u2019t the right question.\n\nThe risk mitigation Microsoft Purview provides for AI can begin on day one. This includes Microsoft AI, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, AI that an organization builds in-house, and AI from third parties like Google Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\nThis post will discuss ways we can secure and govern data used or generated by AI quickly, with minimal user impact, change management, and resources required.\n\nThese Microsoft Purview solutions are:\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI\n\nMicrosoft Purview Information Protection\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Loss Prevention\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communications Compliance\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management\n\nMicrosoft Purview Audit and Microsoft Purview eDiscovery\n\nMicrosoft Purview Compliance Manager\n\nHere are short term steps you can take while the comprehensive data governance program is underway.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI (DSPM for AI) provides visibility into data security risks. It reports on:\n\nUser\u2019s interactions with AI.\n\nSensitive information in the prompts users share with the AI.\n\nWhether the sensitive information users share is labeled and thus is protected by durable security policy controls.\n\nWhether and how user interactions may be violating company policy including codes of conduct and attempts at jailbreak, where users manipulate the system to circumvent protections.\n\nThe risk level of users interacting with the system, such as inadvertent or malicious activities they may be involved in that put the organization at risk.\n\nDSPM for AI reports on this for each AI application and can drill down from the reports to the individual user activities. DSPM for AI collects and surfaces insights from the other Microsoft Purview solutions around generative AI risks in a single screen.\n\nCustom sensitive information types, sensitivity labels, and information protection rules are reasoned over by DSPM for AI, but if these are not available, more than 300 out-of-the-box sensitive information types are available from day one.\n\nDSPM for AI will use these to report on risk for the organization without additional configuration. The organization\u2019s administrators can configure policy to mitigate these risks directly from the DSPM for AI tool.\n\nFigure 1. DSPM for AI shows interactions with Microsoft 365 Copilot, enterprise generative AI from other providers, and AI developed in-house.\n\nFigure 2. DSPM for AI Reports on generative AI user interactions with sensitive data.\n\nA big concern that organizations have in widely deploying generative AI is that it will return results that contain sensitive information that the user should not have access to. SharePoint sites have been created over the years, are unlabeled, and may be accessible to the entire organization through the AI. The \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d that may have prevented the sensitive information from being inappropriately shared is now negated by the AI that reasons over and returns the data.\n\nData assessments, part of DSPM for AI, and currently in preview, identifies potential oversharing risks and allows the administrator to apply a sensitivity label to the SharePoint sites, the sensitive data, or initiate an Microsoft Entra ID user access review to manage group memberships.\n\nThe administrator can engage the business stakeholder who has knowledge of the risk posed by the data and invite them to mitigate the risk or apply the policy at scale from the Microsoft Purview administration portal.\n\nFigure 3. Data assessment\u2014visualize risk, review access, and deploy policy.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Information Protection\n\nThe document access controls of Microsoft Purview Information Protection, including sensitivity labels, are enforced when the data is reasoned over by AI. The user is given visibility in context that they are working with sensitive information. This awareness empowers users to protect the organization.\n\nThe sensitivity labels that enforce scoped encryption, watermarking, and other protections travel with the document as the user interacts with the AI. When the AI creates new content based on the document, the new content inherits the most restrictive label and policy.\n\nMicrosoft Purview can automatically apply sensitivity labels to AI interactions based on the organization\u2019s existing policy for email, desktop applications, and Microsoft Teams, or new policy can be deployed for the AI.\n\nThese can be based on out-of-the-box sensitive information types for a quick start.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Loss Prevention\n\nThe Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention policies that the organization currently uses for email, desktop applications, and Teams can be extended to the AI or new policy for the AI can be created. Cut and paste of sensitive information or transfer of a labeled document into the AI can be prevented or only allowed with an auditable justification from the user.\n\nA rule can be configured to prevent all documents bearing a specific label from being reasoned over by the AI. Out-of-the-box sensitive information types can be used for a quick start.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance\n\nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the ability to detect regulatory compliance (for example, SEC or FINRA) and business conduct violations such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content.\n\nOut-of-the-box policies can be used to monitor user prompts or AI-generated content. It provides policy enforcement in near real time and also audit logs and reporting.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates signal to identify potential malicious or accidental behaviors from legitimate users. Pre-configured generative AI-specific risk detections and policy templates are now available in preview.\n\nAs the Insider Risk Management solution algorithms determine a user to be engaging in risky behavior, the data loss prevention (DLP) policies for that user can be made stricter using a feature called Adaptive Protection. It can be configured with out-of-the-box policies. This continuous monitoring and policy modulation mitigates risk while reducing administrator workload.\n\nAI analytics can be activated from the Microsoft Purview portal to provide insights even before the Insider Risk Management solution is deployed to users. This quickly surfaces AI risks with minimal administrative workload.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management\n\nMicrosoft Purview can enforce AI Data Lifecycle Management, with retention of AI prompts, prompt returns, and the documents AI creates for a specified time period. This can be done globally for every interaction with an AI solution. It can be done with out-of-the-box or custom policies. This will keep these interactions available for future investigations, for regulatory compliance, or to tune policies and inform the governance program.\n\nA policy for deletion of AI interactions can be enforced so information is not over-retained.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Audit and Microsoft Purview eDiscovery\n\nThe organization will need to support internal investigations around the use of AI. Microsoft Purview Audit logs and retains these interactions. They also need to support their legal team should they have to produce AI interactions to support litigation.\n\nMicrosoft Purview eDiscovery can put a user\u2019s interactions with the AI as well as their other Microsoft 365 documents and communications on hold so that their availability to support investigations is maintained. It allows them to be searched based metadata, enhancing relevancy, annotated, and produced.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Compliance Manager\n\nMicrosoft Purview Compliance Manager has pre-built assessments for AI regulations including:\n\nEU Artificial Intelligence Act.\n\nISO/IEC 23894:2023.\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023.\n\nNIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) 1.0.\n\nThese assessments are available to benchmark compliance over time, report on control status, and maintain and produce evidence for both Microsoft and the organization\u2019s activities that support the regulatory compliance program.\n\nMicrosoft Purview is an AI enabler\n\nWithout security, governance, and compliance bases being covered, the AI program puts the organization at risk. An AI program can be blocked before it deploys if the team can\u2019t demonstrate how it is mitigating these risks.\n\nThe actions suggested here can all be taken quickly, and with limited effort, to set up a generative AI deployment for success.\n\nLearn more\n\nLearn more about Microsoft Purview.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our website.

            "content": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently announced the general availability of AWS provided Subscriber Access Licenses (SAL) for Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS). In this blog post we are going to show you how AWS License Manager is used to provide subscription licenses for Microsoft RDS running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).\n\nWhat is Microsoft Remote Desktop Services?\n\nMicrosoft RDS provides a session-based Windows Server virtual desktop environment, primarily used for GUI applications which must run inside a Windows Server session. By default, Windows Server allows two free remote connections for administrative purposes. If more than two sessions are needed on the same server then Remote Desktop Services roles must be installed and additional licensing is necessary.\n\nFigure 1. Microsoft RDS role options in Windows Server\n\nDepending on the size and complexity of your Remote Desktop Services environment, there are multiple Microsoft RDS roles which can be used. At a minimum, you must have a Remote Desktop Session Host (RD Session Host) and a Remote Desktop Licensing (RD Licensing) server. The RD Session Host role allows multiple sessions on the same Windows Server, while the RD Licensing server manages the licenses for the user sessions. When using AWS License Manager to provide SALs for Microsoft RDS, new AWS-managed RD Licensing servers will be created.\n\nWhy should I use AWS SALs for Microsoft RDS?\n\nLicensing flexibility: Previously, Microsoft RDS could only be brought to AWS using a Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) model, which required maintaining active Software Assurance on Remote Desktop User Client Access Licenses (CALs) or by claiming Microsoft RDS SALs on your Services Provider Licensing Agreement (SPLA). However, Microsoft announced they will no longer allow SPLA licenses to be brought to Listed Providers after September 30, 2025. Using AWS SALs provides an alternative to maintaining active Software Assurance on RDS CALs, as well as ensuring business continuity for companies currently claiming Microsoft RDS SALs on their SPLA.\n\nNo prerequisite of using AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory: AWS License Manager provides a managed RD Licensing server that reduces your need to manage the licensing server infrastructure. The managed RD Licensing server integrates directly with your AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory or your self-managed Active Directory. This means you do not have to change your current Microsoft RDS architecture to use AWS-provided SALs; you just need to point your RD Session Hosts to the AWS RD Licensing servers. You also have the ability to register multiple Active Directories under one AWS account.\n\nAllow more than two concurrent user sessions: Customers can use Microsoft RDS to allow more than two concurrent user sessions on Windows Server EC2 instances. This feature can also be used on AWS license-included Microsoft Visual Studio on EC2 and/or Microsoft Office on EC2.\n\nScalability: AWS provided licenses for Microsoft RDS are billed on a per-user, per-month basis. With this pay-as-you-go model, you can increase or decrease your licensing usage based on your monthly demand.\n\nLet\u2019s review the steps necessary to run Microsoft RDS with AWS SALs using AWS License Manager.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nActive Directory: During the provisioning process, AWS License Manager will need to link to an existing Active Directory domain. Both AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory and self-managed Active Directory options are supported. While AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory is not required as a prerequisite for deploying AWS SALs for Microsoft RDS, it is a requirement if you want to use other user-based subscriptions such as Visual Studio and Microsoft Office.\n\nIf you would like to use an AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory and don\u2019t already have one configured, use the following links for more information on AWS Managed Microsoft AD prerequisites and how-to Create your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory in the AWS Directory Service User Guide.\n\nService Account: AWS License Manager will need a user account inside your Active Directory domain to be used for joining the managed RD Licensing server to your domain. This service account is necessary for both Self-managed Active Directory and AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory. AWS License Manager will reference the service account using credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.\n\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Secrets Manager.\n\n2.

The BBC has also reached out to TikTok for comment.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the US president had addressed a gathering of Republican politicians in Florida and spoke about the proposed sale of TikTok.\n\n\"We'll see what happens. We're going to have a lot of people bidding on it,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can save all that voice and all the jobs, and China won't be involved, we don't want China involved, but we'll see what happens,\" he added.\n\nPrevious names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den.\n\nThe biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump said Monday evening that Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April.\n\n\u201cI would say yes,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if Microsoft was one of the companies interested in helping to bring about a new ownership of TikTok, a requirement set by Congress to keep the app functioning in the U.S.\n\nTrump added that other companies were also interested in purchasing TikTok, but wouldn\u2019t provide a list.\n\n\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.\n\nThe president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he\u2019s proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.\n\nLast week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSeveral other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.\n\nAfter the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.\n\nIn media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.\n\nLawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.\n\nTrump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.\n\nMicrosoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d",

Opportunities created by development of this land \u2014 from job creation to strengthening our local economy \u2014 will resonate for generations to come,\" he added.\n\nCity officials said the sale of the land was only recently finalized and they didn't yet have a timetable for its development by Microsoft. It's unknown whether the company will seek federal, state or local incentives to build the data center.\n\n\"This will go through our development process just like anything else, but we have had discussions with them,\" Bogdala said in an interview.\n\nIn an email to the Journal Sentinel, Microsoft said the Kenosha data center has no connection to design changes, and a pause in some construction, in Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe company did not disclose a construction timetable and said potential employment numbers haven't been finalized.\n\n\"We will provide updates as information becomes available,\" the company said about the project.\n\n\"We chose Kenosha for its strategic location, productive workforce, and strong infrastructure. This decision builds on Wisconsin's heritage of business innovation and Microsoft's history of investment in the state,\" the company said.\n\nThe data center will have a major economic impact, growing the area's tax base and diversifying the economy, Samantha Kerkman, Kenosha County Executive, said in the news release.\n\n\"We\u2019re excited about Microsoft\u2019s decision to continue investing in the southeastern part of our state, which I\u2019m proud has been a key focus for our economic support, development, and growth efforts,\" Gov. Tony Evers said in the release.\n\nData centers house thousands of computers, in one or more buildings, linked to the outside world by fiber optic cables. They enable most everyday online activities, including social media, streaming video, banking, ChatGPT and much more.\n\nMount Pleasant project will be one of the largest data centers in the country\n\nMicrosoft's investment in Mount Pleasant includes around 1,500 acres.\n\nThe first phase alone of that data center will likely require the same amount of electricity needed to power more than 300,000 homes, according to information obtained by the Journal Sentinel.\n\nPut into context, the City of Milwaukee has around 262,000 housing units.\n\nMicrosoft's pledge to spend billions in Mount Pleasant spelled a comeback story for a business park where tech giant Foxconn had once said it would create 13,000 jobs but fell far short of that goal.\n\nMicrosoft's push in southeast Wisconsin also includes an investment in training programs for careers in data center technology.\n\nThe company has said it expects around 300 people to be working at the Mount Pleasant site by 2026 \u2014 a mix of contractors and permanent staff. The number of jobs could ultimately grow to about 2,000. Permanent jobs at data centers include a variety of roles from security guards to technicians and engineers.\n\nThe efforts build on the company's previous investments in business and workforce development in Wisconsin and bring in many of the same partners, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Connected Systems Institute, the Green Bay Packers and the TitletownTech venture capital firm, and Gateway Technical College.\n\nThis article has been updated with new information.",

            "content": "Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET\n\nThose of you with plain old Microsoft 365 subscriptions may have noticed that Copilot now pops up in Word and other applications in the suite. How did it get there when you didn't buy or request Copilot and don't necessarily want it? Blame it on Microsoft's usual sleight of hand.\n\nAlso: The Microsoft 365 Copilot launch was a total disaster\n\nIn an effort to push Copilot, Microsoft has added the AI to its Microsoft 365 Family and Personal plans. Open Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote, and you'll now see a Copilot icon on the ribbon. That's not so bad, as you can easily ignore it. But launch Microsoft Word, and Copilot gets in your face with an icon in the left margin and a huge, annoying message prompting you to \"Draft with Copilot.\"\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nIt also seems pretty sneaky, right? To be fair, I can't fault Microsoft for trying to add AI to Office. But the way the company went about it was, to use my favorite Yiddish phrase, meshugganah. Or, as my ZDNET colleague Ed Bott wrote, the Microsoft 365 Copilot launch was a total disaster.\n\nSetting aside Microsoft's messy rollout, what if you simply don't want Copilot? How do you get rid of it?\n\nYou have a couple of options.\n\nHow to disable Copilot in Word\n\nFor your first option, you can disable Copilot from Microsoft Word so it doesn't show up at all.\n\nYou can't yet do that for the other applications in the suite, though Microsoft has promised a disable option for Excel, PowerPoint, and the rest sometime in February.\n\n1. Make sure you're running the latest version of Microsoft 365 You can disable Copilot in Word both on Windows and on a Mac. Just make sure you're running the latest version of Microsoft 365. To do that on Windows, go to File in Word, Excel, or another program, select Account, click the Update Options button, and then select Update Now. Even then, you may need to refresh or close and reopen Microsoft 365 a couple of times before the option appears. Also: Can you still get a Windows 10 upgrade for free in 2025? Short answer: Maybe To perform the same steps on a Mac, click the Help menu and then select Check for Updates. Allow the latest updates to download. Show more\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\n2. Go to Options or Preferences and uncheck 'Enable Copilot' To disable Copilot in Word for Windows, click File, select Options, and then select Copilot from the Word Options window. Simply uncheck the box for \"Enable Copilot\" and click OK. When you return to Word, the Copilot icons and message will be gone. To disable Copilot in the Mac version of Word, click the Word menu and select Preferences. Open the Copilot icon in the Preferences window and uncheck the box for \"Enable Copilot.\" Close the Preferences window and return to Word to see that Copilot is now gone. Show more\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nHow to remove Copilot from your Microsoft 365 subscription\n\nFor your second option, you may want to manage your Microsoft 365 plan to remove Copilot. The change won't take effect right away. Instead, Copilot waits until your next renewal period to vanish.\n\nAlso: Agents have entered the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat\n\nYou can change your Microsoft 365 subscription to revert to the classic and less expensive non-Copilot plan. The change won't actually take effect until your next renewal date. But at least switching your plan now will ensure that you're not automatically renewed at the higher price.\n\nGo to the Microsoft 365 section under Subscriptions on your Microsoft account page if you're not already there. Click the dropdown box for Manage Subscription and click the link for Cancel Subscription.\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nTo try to hang onto your business, Microsoft will offer other plans, including the Classic plan sans Copilot. But here's the frustrating part: If you get a discount on your subscription or if you purchased it through a different vendor than Microsoft, you may not be able to pull this off.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots\n\nIn my case, the Microsoft 365 Family Classic plan shows a price tag of $99.99 without the discount, which would be higher than the discounted price of $90.99 for the plan with Copilot. If you're in a similar boat, your best bet is to contact Microsoft or the vendor from which you purchased Microsoft 365. Otherwise, choose the lower-cost classic plan to complete the switch.\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nAh, but here's one last fly in the ointment. In its recent announcement about the new Microsoft 365 Copilot plans, Microsoft said that existing subscribers could switch to Microsoft Basic or to the new Personal Classic or Family Classic plans, but only for a limited time. So you'll want to make the switch before it's too late.\n\nPlus, the company said that \"for certain new innovations and features\" -- whatever that means -- you'll need a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription with Copilot. Even if you're able to change to a classic plan, you may eventually have no choice but to accept a Copilot plan with the higher price tag.\n\nFAQs Show more\n\nIs Copilot free to use in Microsoft 365?\n\nIs Microsoft freely bestowing Copilot on customers out of the goodness of its corporate heart? Not quite. There's a price hike waiting in the wings for you.\n\nFor the privilege of using Copilot, US subscribers to Microsoft 365 Personal will end up paying $99.99 per year or $9.99 per month, up from $69.99 per year or $6.99 per month. Subscribers to Microsoft 365 Family would eventually have to cough up $129.99 per year or $12.99 per month, up from $99.99 per year or $9.99 per month.\n\nAlso: Microsoft to force new Outlook app in Windows 10 with no way to block it\n\nYour cost will vary based on whether you receive a discount on your subscription. For instance, I currently pay $69.99 for an individual Microsoft Family subscription thanks to a discount from my business plan. But that price would go up to $90.99 with the Copilot option added.\n\nBefore you blow a fuse, the price hike doesn't actually kick in until your next renewal date. For now, you're able to use Copilot without any increase in the cost of your plan. But if you do nothing and wait for your subscription to renew, the higher price will automatically kick in.\n\nCan anyone try Copilot in Microsoft 365?\n\nMicrosoft's hocus-pocus doesn't end here. The Copilot built into Microsoft 365 isn't available to everyone, nor is it unlimited. A Microsoft 365 Family plan normally allows up to six people to take advantage of the different features. But here, only the owner of the plan gets access to Copilot.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?\n\nPlus, Microsoft doles out the use of Copilot in Microsoft 365 on a credit basis, granting the owner of the plan up to 60 credits per month. Each use of the AI chews up one credit. Try to use more than 60 in a month, and you'll be stopped and prompted to upgrade to the unlimited and more expensive Copilot Pro plan.\n\nHow to view your current Microsoft 365 subscription\n\nTo view your current Microsoft 365 subscription, sign into your Microsoft account website. Click the link at the top for \"Manage Microsoft 365 Family\" or \"Manage Microsoft 365 Personal.\" The resulting page shows you your renewal date, the price you'd pay at that point, and the number of credits you've used so far.\n\nScreenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET",

Early testing suggests that the quality of DeepSeek rivals that of U.S.-based AI products.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors.\n\nDeepSeek has emerged despite export controls issued by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nIvan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, described DeepSeek as \"the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race.\"\n\n\"The potential power and low-cost development of DeepSeek is calling into question the hundreds of billions of dollars committed in the U.S,\" Feinseth said in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card and an RTX 5070 laptop as he gives a keynote address at CES 2025, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nev., Jan. 6, 2025. Steve Marcus/Reuters\n\nAlphabet, the company behind AI chatbot Gemini, saw shares drop about 3% on Monday. The stock price of Amazon, which offers its own AI-fueled shopping assistant, also fell about 3%.\n\nThe dip interrupts a yearslong surge for many tech giants, driven in part by enthusiasm about the future of AI. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed more than 30% in 2024, sustaining much of its sky-high 43% growth over the year prior. Many analysts expected those robust gains to continue this year.\n\n\"When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis. That's exactly what we're seeing today,\" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in a statement on Monday.",

            "content": "[Editor\u2019s note: This content was written to highlight a particular event or moment in time. Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nModern workers are increasingly mobile and require the flexibility to get work done outside of the office. Here at Microsoft headquarters in the Puget Sound area of Washington State, every weekday an average of 45,000 to 55,000 Microsoft employees use a virtual private network (VPN) connection to remotely connect to the corporate network. As part of our overall Zero Trust Strategy, we have redesigned our VPN infrastructure, something that has simplified our design and let us consolidate our access points. This has enabled us to increase capacity and reliability, while also reducing reliance on VPN by moving services and applications to the cloud.\n\nProviding a seamless remote access experience\n\nRemote access at Microsoft is reliant on the VPN client, our VPN infrastructure, and public cloud services. We have had several iterative designs of the VPN service inside Microsoft. Regional weather events in the past required large increases in employees working from home, heavily taxing the VPN infrastructure and requiring a completely new design. Three years ago, we built an entirely new VPN infrastructure, a hybrid design, using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) load balancing and identity services with gateway appliances across our global sites.\n\nKey to our success in the remote access experience was our decision to deploy a split-tunneled configuration for the majority of employees. We have migrated nearly 100% of previously on-premises resources into Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365. Our continued efforts in application modernization are reducing the traffic on our private corporate networks as cloud-native architectures allow direct internet connections. The shift to internet-accessable applications and a split-tunneled VPN design has dramatically reduced the load on VPN servers in most areas of the world.\n\nUsing VPN profiles to improve the user experience\n\nWe use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to manage our domain-joined and Microsoft Azure AD\u2013joined computers and mobile devices that have enrolled in the service. In our configuration, VPN profiles are replicated through Microsoft Intune and applied to enrolled devices; these include certificate issuance that we create in Configuration Manager for Windows 10 devices. We support Mac and Linux device VPN connectivity with a third-party client using SAML-based authentication.\n\nWe use certificate-based authentication (public key infrastructure, or PKI) and multi\u2011factor authentication solutions. When employees first use the Auto-On VPN connection profile, they are prompted to authenticate strongly. Our VPN infrastructure supports Windows Hello for Business and Multi-Factor Authentication. It stores a cryptographically protected certificate upon successful authentication that allows for either persistent or automatic connection.\n\nFor more information about how we use Microsoft Intune and Endpoint Manager as part of our device management strategy, see Managing Windows 10 devices with Microsoft Intune.\n\nConfiguring and installing VPN connection profiles\n\nWe created VPN profiles that contain all the information a device requires to connect to the corporate network, including the supported authentication methods and the VPN gateways that the device should connect to. We created the connection profiles for domain-joined and Microsoft Intune\u2013managed devices using Microsoft Endpoint Manager.\n\nFor more information about creating VPN profiles, see VPN profiles in Configuration Manager and How to Create VPN Profiles in Configuration Manager.\n\nThe Microsoft Intune custom profile for Intune-managed devices uses Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier (OMA-URI) settings with XML data type, as illustrated below.\n\nInstalling the VPN connection profile\n\nThe VPN connection profile is installed using a script on domain-joined computers running Windows 10, through a policy in Endpoint Manager.\n\nFor more information about how we use Microsoft Intune as part of our mobile device management strategy, see Mobile device management at Microsoft.\n\nConditional Access\n\nWe use an optional feature that checks the device health and corporate policies before allowing it to connect. Conditional Access is supported with connection profiles, and we\u2019ve started using this feature in our environment.\n\nRather than just relying on the managed device certificate for a \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d for VPN connection, Conditional Access places machines in a quarantined state while checking for the latest required security updates and antivirus definitions to help ensure that the system isn\u2019t introducing risk. On every connection attempt, the system health check looks for a certificate that the device is still compliant with corporate policy.\n\nCertificate and device enrollment\n\nWe use an Azure AD certificate for single sign-on to the VPN connection profile. And we currently use Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) and Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) to deploy certificates to our mobile devices via Microsoft Endpoint Manager. The SCEP certificate we use is for wireless and VPN. NDES allows software on routers and other network devices running without domain credentials to obtain certificates based on the SCEP.\n\nNDES performs the following functions:\n\nIt generates and provides one-time enrollment passwords to administrators. It submits enrollment requests to the certificate authority (CA). It retrieves enrolled certificates from the CA and forwards them to the network device.\n\nFor more information about deploying NDES, including best practices, see Securing and Hardening Network Device Enrollment Service for Microsoft Intune and System Center Configuration Manager.\n\nVPN client connection flow\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the VPN client-side connection flow.\n\nWhen a device-compliance\u2013enabled VPN connection profile is triggered (either manually or automatically):\n\nThe VPN client calls into the Windows 10 Azure AD Token Broker on the local device and identifies itself as a VPN client. The Azure AD Token Broker authenticates to Azure AD and provides it with information about the device trying to connect. A device check is performed by Azure AD to determine whether the device complies with our VPN policies. If the device is compliant, Azure AD requests a short-lived certificate. If the device isn\u2019t compliant, we perform remediation steps. Azure AD pushes down a short-lived certificate to the Certificate Store via the Token Broker. The Token Broker then returns control back over to the VPN client for further connection processing. The VPN client uses the Azure AD\u2013issued certificate to authenticate with the VPN gateway.\n\nRemote access infrastructure\n\nAt Microsoft, we have designed and deployed a hybrid infrastructure to provide remote access for all the supported operating systems\u2014using Azure for load balancing and identity services and specialized VPN appliances. We had several considerations when designing the platform:\n\nRedundancy. The service needed to be highly resilient so that it could continue to operate if a single appliance, site, or even large region failed.\n\nThe service needed to be highly resilient so that it could continue to operate if a single appliance, site, or even large region failed.

Automation. Being able to programmatically administer the service was critical. It needed to work with existing automation and monitoring tools.\n\nWhen we were designing the VPN topology, we considered the location of the resources that employees were accessing when they were connected to the corporate network. If most of the connections from employees at a remote site were to resources located in central datacenters, more consideration was given to bandwidth availability and connection health between that remote site and the destination. In some cases, additional network bandwidth infrastructure has been deployed as needed. The illustration below provides an overview of our remote access infrastructure.\n\nVPN tunnel types\n\nOur VPN solution provides network transport over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The VPN appliances force Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 for SSL session initiation, and the strongest possible cipher suite negotiated is used for the VPN tunnel encryption. We use several tunnel configurations depending on the locations of users and level of security needed.\n\nSplit tunneling\n\nSplit tunneling allows only the traffic destined for the Microsoft corporate network to be routed through the VPN tunnel, and all internet traffic goes directly through the internet without traversing the VPN tunnel or infrastructure. Our migration to Office 365 and Azure has dramatically reduced the need for connections to the corporate network. We rely on the security controls of applications hosted in Azure and services of Office 365 to help secure this traffic. For end point protection, we use Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection on all clients. In our VPN connection profile, split tunneling is enabled by default and used by the majority of Microsoft employees. Learn more about Office 365 split tunnel configuration.\n\nFull tunneling\n\nFull tunneling routes and encrypts all traffic through the VPN. There are some countries and business requirements that make full tunneling necessary. This is accomplished by running a distinct VPN configuration on the same infrastructure as the rest of the VPN service. A separate VPN profile is pushed to the clients who require it, and this profile points to the full-tunnel gateways.\n\nFull tunnel with high security\n\nOur IT employees and some developers access company infrastructure or extremely sensitive data. These users are given Privileged Access Workstations, which are secured, limited, and connect to a separate highly controlled infrastructure.\n\nApplying and enforcing policies\n\nIn Microsoft Digital, the Conditional Access administrator is responsible for defining the VPN Compliance Policy for domain-joined Windows 10 desktops, including enterprise laptops and tablets, within the Microsoft Azure Portal administrative experience. This policy is then published so that the enforcement of the applied policy can be managed through Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Microsoft Endpoint Manager provides policy enforcement, as well as certificate enrollment and deployment, on behalf of the client device.\n\nFor more information about policies, see VPN and Conditional Access.\n\nEarly adopters help validate new policies\n\nWith every new Windows 10 update, we rolled out a pre-release version to a group of about 15,000 early adopters a few months before its release. Early adopters validated the new credential functionality and used remote access connection scenarios to provide valuable feedback that we could take back to the product development team. Using early adopters helped validate and improve features and functionality, influenced how we prepared for the broader deployment across Microsoft, and helped us prepare support channels for the types of issues that employees might experience.\n\nMeasuring service health\n\nWe measure many aspects of the VPN service and report on the number of unique users that connect every month, the number of daily users, and the duration of connections. We have invested heavily in telemetry and automation throughout the Microsoft network environment. Telemetry allows for data-driven decisions in making infrastructure investments and identifying potential bandwidth issues ahead of saturation.\n\nUsing Power BI to customize operational insight dashboards\n\nOur service health reporting is centralized using Power BI dashboards to display consolidated data views of VPN performance. Data is aggregated into an SQL Azure data warehouse from VPN appliance logging, network device telemetry, and anonymized device performance data. These dashboards, shown in the next two graphics below, are tailored for the teams using them.\n\nWith our optimizations in VPN connection profiles and improvements in the infrastructure, we have seen significant benefits:",

That way, users can easily hop between smartphones, tablets, and laptops or desktops without feeling that they have to learn a completely new user interface and way of doing day-to-day things.\n\nAside from this hidden feature, Microsoft has added written and shortcut instructions to the Snap Menu which arrived with Windows 7. Even though Snap has been around for over 16 years now, it seems that not all Windows users are familiar with it.\n\nSo, adding instructional text and icons will help those who are new to PCs or are transferring from macOS, and could even spawn some power users as they discover the keyboard shortcuts that will make their workflow more efficient.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Microsoft) (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nHopefully, the \u2018Drag Tray\u2019 will make it to the general release of Windows 11.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nTraditional app-development efforts can take months to translate business requirements into a usable application or feature. For the business user, waiting can be the hardest part. You come up with an idea to improve efficiency or productivity at work\u2014not only will it make your life easier, but you think it could transform the way your peers work as well. You share the idea with your managers, create a formal proposal, and submit it to your company\u2019s engineering team. Then you wait.\n\nOnce you see how your idea was interpreted from requirements and provide feedback on the prototype, you have to wait again. This time it\u2019s for the engineering team to wade through their backlogged change requests. Even the best idea can fall short, run over budget, or fail when business-focused teams are only peripherally plugged into the process of building the solutions they need to solve their business problems.\n\nEnter citizen development.\n\nCitizen development\u2014the creation of business applications and features by the employees who use them\u2014is an opportunity for business users to stretch beyond their day-to-day activities with innovative ways to improve their own business processes. Citizen development is not small groups of developers across the company creating an unmanageable amount of shadow IT applications; when done properly, it\u2019s a mutually beneficial partnership\u2014a win-win proposition for both business users and IT.\n\nTo show you how this works, here\u2019s the story of how three launch program managers at Microsoft dreamed up an idea to get their work done more efficiently. They imagined an intelligent launch assistant app that would provide convenient access to quick tasks, centralize some satellite workflows, and provide more user-friendly views of their product launch data. Armed with only their business knowledge and some prior experience with HTML and design, they decided\u2014on their own\u2014to learn Microsoft Power Apps to try and build the app they envisioned. Power Apps turned out to be the right choice, as it was designed to give business users the tools they need to drive innovation and create new applications\u2014with no coding skills required.\n\nThe team leveraged their expertise and, after doing some reading, Power Apps tutorials, and a little research, felt much less intimidated by the prospect of developing their own intelligent launch assistant. The launch managers had unknowingly begun their journey toward becoming citizen developers. In just over a month, they went from having an early prototype to a feature-rich application that more than a hundred other launch managers now use daily!\n\n[Learn how to build connected business solutions with Microsoft Power Automate.

Find out how to transform payroll processes with Microsoft Power Automate.]\n\nBuilding an intelligent launch assistant app\n\nThe Launch team at Microsoft oversees all launches of Microsoft products and devices, including system changes and compliance projects. The launch managers, being change agents who drive consistency and process simplification, had already identified some ongoing challenges in their processes. Launch workflows spanned multiple tools, and the team needed to reference data stored in different locations to get a full view of their projects.\n\nAfter deciding on key features for their proof of concept, the launch managers took part in a company hackathon to kickstart prototype development of the launch assistant app. By the end of that immersive, collaborative event, the team had built their first prototype and was feeling more confident about what they could accomplish as citizen developers using Power Apps.\n\nMicrosoft Digital supports every employee and team at Microsoft\u2014including these launch managers\u2014by deploying and managing the products and solutions they use to get work done. That includes managing the development, governance, and lifecycle for line-of-business applications. One of our core charters is to empower users to do more. In that vein, through technology and collaboration, we support efforts like citizen development.\n\nIn Microsoft Digital, we were excited to see the progress that was made in such a short time, but we were navigating relatively new territory. While the prototype was promising, it still represented a culture shift, and we had a little trepidation about using citizen development for apps that support essential business functions.\n\nA few factors in this project helped us decide to cautiously continue along the citizen-development path. One, the existing launch workflows and tools were still in place, so there would be no disruption of operations. And two, the citizen developers were making progress, very quickly. Their velocity was outpacing any lingering concern, and we determined that whether they created something that could be rolled out broadly, or a prototype of something we would build for them, either outcome would be a step forward.\n\nMore nimble than agile\n\nOur engineering teams generally use agile development methods while building out apps and solutions for the different business groups at Microsoft. With discovery, development, and iterating, even in two-week sprint cycles, it can still take months for us to develop a functioning app that the business users will adopt and continue to use. No matter how much time our engineers spend with a team learning about a businesses\u2019 processes, only a business user truly understands the context, relationships, and flow of every scenario.\n\nAs illustrated in this graphic, some of the benefits we saw while working in cooperation with the Launch team\u2019s citizen developers included improved engineering resource allocation, reduced development backlogs, and a greatly accelerated application-building process.\n\nIn 40 days, the citizen developers released more than 250 iterations that evolved the app from an early prototype that only the citizen developers were using to a fully functioning app that has been widely adopted by the other launch managers at Microsoft. They were truly nimble. When something they built or changed didn\u2019t come out quite right, they fixed it immediately themselves, or rolled back to a prior iteration in Power Apps and started over. They didn\u2019t need to request a change or log a bug and wait for our engineers to resolve it during the next sprint.\n\nThe first 100 or so iterations happened very quickly\u2014sometimes dozens in a day. However, as the app grew more complex and was being more widely adopted, the iteration cadence slowed down accordingly. As more features in the app were connecting to our Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform and the Microsoft SharePoint lists that they created to centralize the data from other workflows, it made sense to begin meeting regularly to discuss guardrails and risks before each iteration was released. The citizen developers started giving our engineers weekly demos of the prototype and talking about their planned features, providing us an opportunity to provide guidance and answer questions.\n\nA fully functional app and a living prototype\n\nThe phone and tablet versions of the intelligent launch assistant app pulled together views of all the information pertaining to a launch, including key dates and other information about the launch manager\u2019s project, including the risks that are managed daily.\n\nRoughly 50 percent of the information displayed in the launch assistant home page comes from data in the Microsoft Dynamics 365-based platform that serves as the \u201csingle version of truth\u201d for all work activities across the operations teams at Microsoft. The citizen developers enhanced the experiences of several tracking and management features that weren\u2019t in Dynamics 365 by creating SharePoint lists as a backend for the related data. Using Microsoft Power Apps, it was easy to connect to both Dynamics 365 and the SharePoint lists to create consolidated views and tasks.\n\nAs this next graphic shows, the app experience is intuitive, and the citizen developers can continually adjust the UI to mirror more optimized versions of their business processes.\n\nThe app, now broadly available to all launch managers at Microsoft, also serves as a living prototype. Launch managers enjoy a transformed workflow, while we see the impact of new features as they are being used in the production environment. We evaluate those features and experiences before investing money in engineering resources to build or integrate them into the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform.\n\nLessons learned and best practices\n\nWe have spent years refining our application-development processes, and we expected to face challenges and learn new things as the traditional processes were disrupted by empowering more business-focused individuals to develop the solutions they need. This effort has been successful and educational, so we\u2019re sharing a few of our learnings and best practices.\n\nPartnering helps set everyone up for success\n\nWith open communication and a growth mindset, a strong partnership between the business and engineering teams is crucial in helping ensure the success of a citizen development program. For example, we learned that we didn\u2019t start discussing risks and guardrails for each team and role soon enough. As a result, we were initially very reactionary, addressing issues as we encountered them rather than taking a more holistic approach. As we got further into the process, we were better able to determine which changes need to be monitored more closely, and to be more mindful about where test data in the production environment was being stored. In one case, we almost sent a report to executive leadership that included test data from one of our intelligent launch assistant experiments.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to communicate early with engineers about the benefits that come with this shift in paradigm. They need to understand that citizen development isn\u2019t intended to replace traditional development, nor does it suggest that they aren\u2019t doing a good job. It\u2019s just an effort to better align activities with core skillsets.\n\nSome traditional development processes still apply\n\nIn the early phases, most of the launch assistant app users were citizen developers who could make and publish every change as a new iteration. As the user base grew, and the app features became more complex, every iteration and change required more consideration. The team moved to a role-based model in which only a few citizen developers who fully understood how the changes would impact users of the app could publish new iterations.\n\nNot being professional developers, the citizen developers did not start keeping meticulous version notes until they realized why they were useful. More than once during the 250 iterations, they needed to roll back to a prior version after a change didn\u2019t go as planned. Having notes that explained what changed in each iteration helped in identifying which version introduced the change.\n\nUse Power Apps to create living prototypes that can speed engineering decisions\n\nCitizen developers know inherently how they want to use an application within the framework of their processes, and that insight provides a high-value impact when it complements engineering\u2019s efforts.\n\nWhen business users become citizen developers and build Microsoft Power Apps solutions to address their business problems without code, it can ultimately be a benefit for engineers. We can see how a feature or functionality performs in production, how quickly users adopt it, and verify its continued use\u2014while we plan and weigh the benefits of integration into our platform. Ultimately, when we do invest in hardening a feature for scalability, we anticipate no noticeable impacts to the user, other than performance or planned UI improvements.\n\n\n\nNow, are you wondering how to become a citizen developer at your company?

Google has also been linked with the Israeli military, having offered its AI technology to the groups.\n\nThe documents include commercial records from Israel's defense ministry and files from Microsoft's Israeli subsidiary. They suggest that Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform was used across Israel's air, ground, and naval forces, and by its intelligence department.\n\nFurthermore, the documents show that while some of this was for administrative purposes, The Guardian reports that it was also used to help with combat and intelligence activities. The Guardian also conducted interviews with sources from across Israel\u2019s defense and intelligence establishment.\n\nMicrosoft staff also reportedly worked closely with the IDF\u2019s intelligence directorate, including its elite surveillance division, Unit 8200.

He\u2019s now called Copilot. And not only is he just as repulsively irritating as his predecessor, he\u2019s also costing you a lot of money without you, probably, even realising. But, of course, this time he\u2019s better. He\u2019s not just a shit algorithm: he\u2019s a shit algorithm with the magic fairy dust of AI.\n\nThere will be many genuinely transformative uses of AI.

That gives me access to online versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel and other programmes that let me get on with my work. It\u2019s a fair deal. They\u2019re good programmes. I don\u2019t mind a bit paying \u00a380 a year or so for family access to Microsoft\u2019s suite of stuff. It\u2019s a lot less fiddly than buying a boxed package of Word every couple of years and downloading it onto your computer from CDs.\n\nAbout a week ago, when I opened a new document, I was presented not with a nice blank page but with a hovering header asking me \u2014 Jesus wept \u2014 whether I wanted to \u201cdraft an itinerary for a college reunion in London\u201d or \u201cwrite a bedtime story for an eight-year-old about dinosaurs\u201d. I spent the traditional 45 minutes Googling \u201chow do I kill Copilot?\u201d, and similar, to no avail (a friend who asked Copilot how you turn Copilot off was told politely that \u2014 fancy! \u2014 this was something Copilot couldn\u2019t help with). Even as I write these words, a little blue and magenta icon follows my cursor down the page in the left-hand margin suggesting \u201cDraft with Copilot: (Alt+I)\u201d.\n\nIt was only when I grumbled about this on social media that I discovered that this wasn\u2019t just an annoyance, but a grift. I had a nice response from someone seeming to be a Microsoft employee reassuring me that, no, Copilot wasn\u2019t stealing my data and that turning it off was just a matter of finding the right checkbox in this or that options menu. But I also had a response from someone saying, and I think it\u2019s only fair to credit him by quoting his unimprovable explanation in full: \u201cMicrosoft is going to price gouge you by adding their genAI to your subscription without your consent, and they are not transparent about how to avoid this bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shows utter contempt both for Microsoft\u2019s customers and for the spirit of contract law.\u201d\n\nHe explained that any and all subscribers to Office 365 have been quietly moved, on an increased annual rate, to the AI-enhanced version of the product. The only way to change it is to log in to your Microsoft account, cancel your subscription altogether, and resubscribe to the \u201cclassic\u201d version. You must be joking, I thought.

In case anyone\u2019s interested, here\u2019s the link he sent me.\n\nI have been, all of us have been, without so much as asking me, \u201cupgraded\u201d (aka, in the excellent formulation of the tech writer Cory Doctorow, \u201censhittified\u201d) to a version of a programme I paid for which contains features I neither need nor want. Those features, if what we\u2019re told about the resource greediness of AI is correct, are colossally wasteful of computing power and damaging to the environment. They are (given AI\u2019s extreme unreliability when it comes to real-world outcomes), at the very best experimental or unpredictable. And the functioning of the features is dependent (though that\u2019s a semi-separate story) on stealing copyright material from artists and writers without asking them. And I\u2019m being charged \u00a325 or so more a year for the privilege. Even my email is now getting vomit-making Copilot spam. Every day brings new questions \u2014 challenges big and small. We could all use a little help. A nudge to get started or a reliable partner to get you to the finish line. No matter the moment, Copilot is your companion for every day, just because, in attempting to turn it off, I\u2019ve interacted with Copilot.\n\nNo doubt this inertia selling is in some way legal. There\u2019ll be something buried in the Terms and Conditions that allows them to \u201cupgrade\u201d you, and charge you, for this useless crap. But it shows utter contempt both for Microsoft\u2019s customers and for the spirit of contract law. As someone who has already been charged for their supposedly enhanced subscription, and whose every interaction with his computer is now fouled by Copilot, I\u2019d be interested to know where I apply for my refund.\n\nThis is where I suspect that Microsoft\u2019s sharp practice is a window into a wider problem. Those venture capitalists I mentioned, they don\u2019t work on the principle that there\u2019s a point you could reach where there\u2019s \u201cenough tech\u201d: the whole house of cards collapses if there isn\u2019t a new big thing. Gen AI is the latest in a long series of hopeless \u2014 or limitedly applicable \u2014 ideas that are supposed to be the future (Blockchain, Web3, VR, NFTs) but into which far more investment money has been poured than is likely to be made back. So it\u2019s being forced on us, by hype and by sleight of hand. The same issue applies to the idea, endorsed by our idiot Government, that unless writers and artists specifically object, Big Tech should be allowed to train their models on our work for free.\n\nTo hell with that. If the only way you can sell something is by hoping people won\u2019t notice or won\u2019t bother to object or won\u2019t take the trouble to find out how to get rid of it, what you have isn\u2019t a product: it\u2019s a parasite.",

            "content": "Microsoft has officially revealed that it has been working on \"improving the battery iconography in Windows 11.\" Thanks to a Windows enthusiast and data miner, we saw these changes in December 2024. However, Microsoft has fully revealed the key changes, explaining how to tweak the UI and toggle a battery percentage display in the taskbar.\n\nFriday's Windows blog post discusses the taskbar battery icon changes. The post is timed to accompany the release of Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26120.3000 (KB5050103) to the Dev Channel. Microsoft's battery icon redesign gets top billing.\n\nTo make the Windows 11 UI more intuitive, Microsoft has enabled color battery icons in the taskbar. Assuming normal color vision, the color changes should quickly confirm the battery's charging state with a sideways glance. So, what do all the colors mean? We've made a handy list below.\n\nGreen : battery charging and in a good state\n\n: battery charging and in a good state Yellow : your PC using battery in energy-saving mode\n\n: your PC using battery in energy-saving mode Red : you have a critically low battery and should seek a charger\n\n: you have a critically low battery and should seek a charger Black: Microsoft's blog doesn't explain it, but we will assume black means your PC is using battery and it hasn't drained enough to trigger energy saving mode or gone into critical low battery territory.\n\nMicrosoft notes that these new battery colors will be visible in the Windows 11 taskbar and the quick settings flyout and Settings. In a future update, Microsoft also wants the new icons on the Lock screen.\n\nThere are a couple of other Windows 11 battery icon changes worth highlighting. Firstly, Microsoft has decided to use a few more pixels to enhance the battery icon's glanceability.\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nLast but not least, in Settings, Windows 11 users can decide whether they want a battery percentage figure next to the icon. With the newest breed of energy-sipping laptops, perhaps some can banish their battery remaining anxiety and toggle the percentage indicator off.\n\nWindows Insiders are also playing with a new Gamepad keyboard layout for the touch keyboard in Windows 11, new Narrator functions, and may be pleased with a quintet of Fire Explorer fixes. Lots and lots of known issues remain.",

            "content": "Microsoft recently announced the 2025 release wave 1 plan for Dynamics 365, containing features that will become available between April and September 2025. Per usual, Microsoft is managing the release of Dynamics 365 through a structured process known as release waves, which occur twice annually; Release Wave 1, just announced, and then Release Wave 2, containing features to become available between October 2025 and March 2026. Each release wave always follows a detailed schedule to ensure customers and partners are well-informed and prepared for upcoming changes.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 2025 Release Wave 1, introduces a range of enhancements across various applications, emphasizing AI integration and user productivity. Here\u2019s an overview of the key features:\n\nDynamics 365 Sales\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nAI-Powered Assistance: Introduction of Copilot to automate tasks such as intent determination, enabling sellers to focus on high-priority activities.\n\nEnhanced User Experience: A redesigned interface ensures sellers have timely access to actionable insights, facilitating better decision-making.\n\nDynamics 365 Customer Service\n\nAgentic Capabilities: Enhanced case and knowledge management with AI-driven routing to improve service efficiency.\n\nExtended Copilot Features: New tools for customer service representatives and supervisors aimed at boosting productivity.\n\nDynamics 365 Finance\n\nSimplified Tax Management: Tools to streamline complex tax processes and ensure regulatory compliance.\n\nAutomated Account Reconciliations: Utilization of agents to enhance accuracy and efficiency in financial reconciliations.\n\nDynamics 365 Supply Chain Management\n\nSupplier Communication Automation: Improved operational efficiency through automated interactions with suppliers.\n\nAI in Manufacturing: Integration of AI to align production data with actual processes, enhancing manufacturing precision.\n\nDynamics 365 Business Central\n\nIntelligent AI Agents: Introduction of agents to automate tasks like sales order creation from emails, leveraging natural language processing.\n\nEnhanced Integrations: Improved connectivity with platforms such as Shopify and Dynamics 365 Field Service for streamlined operations.\n\nBy introducing more intuitive workflows and smarter resource management tools, Microsoft enhances user productivity and satisfaction, making Dynamics 365 a more attractive option for organizations seeking efficient and user-friendly solutions. And as stated above, the release offers seamless integrations with other Microsoft products and third-party applications like Shopify, providing a unified ecosystem that enhances operational efficiency and collaboration, thereby strengthening Microsoft\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important for enterprises to thoroughly study the fit between their business, organizational and technical requirements and the Microsoft Dyanamics 365 roadmap. Implementing Dynamics 365 can be intricate, especially for larger organizations with complex processes. This complexity often necessitates collaboration with certified partners to ensure a smooth transition. And while Dynamics 365 offers extensive customization options, excessive modifications can lead to increased maintenance burdens and potential system issues. It\u2019s crucial to balance customization with system stability.\n\nThe platform\u2019s comprehensive features may require significant training efforts. Without adequate training and change management strategies, organizations might face low user adoption rates, impacting the system\u2019s effectiveness. While the Shopify integration is promising, integrating Dynamics 365 with non-Microsoft products can be challenging, sometimes requiring additional tools or middleware to achieve seamless connectivity. Handling large datasets can occasionally result in slow processing times. Additionally, as a cloud-based solution, its performance is contingent on reliable internet connectivity. The initial setup, customization, and ongoing subscription fees can be substantial. For smaller businesses, these costs might be prohibitive, necessitating a thorough cost-benefit analysis. And while Microsoft provides extensive documentation, it can be overwhelming for users. Additionally, the quality of support can vary, with some users reporting mixed experiences with Microsoft\u2019s customer service.\n\nAlso, transferring data from legacy systems to Dynamics 365 can be complex and time-consuming, requiring careful planning to ensure data integrity and minimize disruptions. Some users have reported challenges with the clarity and consistency of Microsoft\u2019s documentation, which can complicate the implementation and customization processes. Implementing a new ERP system like Dynamics 365 often requires significant changes in business processes. Without effective change management strategies, organizations may encounter resistance from employees, leading to suboptimal utilization of the system.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nWhere is Microsoft Dynamics 365 on the scoreboard? As of 2023, Microsoft Dynamics holds approximately 25.74% of the ERP market, positioning it ahead of competitors such as Workday (16.15%), SAP ERP (9.37%), and SAP S/4HANA (9.05%). Over 48,279 companies globally have adopted Microsoft Dynamics as their ERP solution. The majority of these customers are based in the United States (49.31%), followed by the United Kingdom (12.97%) and Canada (6.81%). In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, Microsoft Dynamics generated revenue of $5.44 billion, marking 16% year-over-year growth. This growth rate surpasses Microsoft\u2019s overall growth trajectory. In the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024, Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased by 22%, with Dynamics 365 specifically experiencing 28% growth. This growth rate is three times the average market growth. The global Microsoft Dynamics market is projected to grow from $10.89 billion in 2023 to $34.22 billion by 2033, reflecting a 12.2% CAGR over the forecast period.\n\nStudy the success stories within Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 customer base. G&J Pepsi aimed to enhance customer service, increase revenue, and achieve cost savings in a post-pandemic economy, so it implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service, Remote Assist, and Sales and achieved a profit increase of $30 million by optimizing field operations and sales processes. Discovery Cube needed to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs to better serve educational missions. It implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and CRM solutions and tripled productivity and reduced costs by 68%, enabling the organization to focus more resources on educational initiatives. Ernst & Young (EY) sought to modernize its global sales operations to improve efficiency and client engagement, so it deployed Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales to streamline sales processes and enhance data-driven decision-making. As a result, EY reinvented its sales approach globally, leading to improved client relationships and operational efficiency. Saint-Gobain Baltic aimed to enhance production efficiency and maintain high-quality standards in manufacturing processes, so it implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to streamline manufacturing operations. The company achieved greater control over production processes, leading to improved efficiency and product quality.\n\nMicrosoft demonstrates best practice for managing cloud ERP releases with wave model. Cloud ERP customers should expect frequent, automated feature updates from their ERP providers, typically following a quarterly or biannual release cycle. These updates should include enhanced AI-driven automation, improved integrations, and security enhancements while ensuring backward compatibility to prevent disruptions. Providers should offer early access programs, sandbox environments for testing, and feature toggles to allow phased adoption. Real-time performance monitoring and proactive issue resolution should be part of the post-release support. Additionally, in-app guidance, webinars, and role-based training should accompany major releases to drive user adoption. Cloud ERP vendors must ensure that updates are seamless, minimally disruptive, and aligned with customer needs, leveraging AI-powered insights and customer feedback for continuous innovation.",

            "content": "Phil Spencer has teased Microsoft\u2019s plan to release Xbox games on Nintendo Switch 2, reinforcing recent reports that indicate the company is set to back the next-gen console in a big way.\n\nA number of Xbox games are reportedly coming to Switch 2, including Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection . Windows Central\u2019s Jez Corden has reported that most if not all Xbox games will launch on Switch 2 if the console is able to run them well enough.\n\nSpeaking in the latest episode of the Gamertag Radio podcast, Spencer said Microsoft was \u201creally looking forward\u201d to supporting Nintendo Switch 2 with Xbox games.\n\n\u201cNintendo and their innovation, what they mean in this industry, I just always applaud the moves that they make,\u201d Spencer said when asked to react to the Switch 2 reveal.\n\n\u201cThey did a little flash video. I know we\u2019ll get more detail over time. Really looking forward to supporting them with the games that we have. I just think they\u2019re such an important part of this industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard with what\u2019s publicly out there now about the platform for everybody to get their hands around it, but who would ever bet against the success of that team? They are just masterful in what they do. Switch is a massive success. And I think Switch 2 will be as well.\u201d\n\nNintendo Switch 2 - First Look 28 Images\n\nSpencer also revealed that he had personally congratulated Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa on the Switch 2 reveal, and praised the decision to make a bigger console this time around. \u201cMy old eyes appreciate the larger screen!\u201d Spencer joked. \u201cIt\u2019s not always true that I can read all the text!\u201d\n\nOf course, Microsoft\u2019s support of Switch 2 follows already existing support of the original Switch, which is home to the likes of Minecraft and Obsidian\u2019s Pentiment and Grounded. And it comes amid a significant multiplatform push for Microsoft, which is releasing more of its games on rival consoles day-and-date. For example, id Software\u2019s Doom: The Dark Ages launches on PlayStation 5 at the same time as Xbox Series X and S and PC. The PS5 version of MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set for this spring.\n\n\"I want everybody to be able to play on Xbox and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just PlayStation \u2014 we love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's going to continue, we'll just continue to do more of it,\u201d Spencer added.\n\n\u201cBecause what we learned is put the games first. Make sure the games can be as great as they can. We love the experience on our own hardware, our own platform. But our games will show up in more and more places, no doubt.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal? I love it and am absolutely buying that console It was a little tame but I'll still buy the Switch 2 I liked it but need to see more before I make a decision It was a little underwhelming so I'm not really bothered The reveal was pretty iffy and I don't care for the console either Something else! Answer See Results\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only game maker reportedly set to release titles for Nintendo Switch 2. Square Enix is allegedly ready to release Final Fantasy 7 Remake on Switch 2 in 2025 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in 2026. Konami is allegedly preparing a Switch 2 port of Metal Gear Solid Delta , which is due out at some point this year. And could Hollow Knight: Silksong finally re-emerge on Nintendo Switch 2?\n\nUbisoft is reportedly preparing a port of Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage for the Switch 2\u2019s launch window. The upcoming Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows , currently only down for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC, is also reportedly coming to Switch 2, although at a later date outside the launch window.\n\nOther Ubisoft ports allegedly include games from The Division series and Rainbow Six Siege . The Mario + Rabbids games are also reportedly coming to Switch 2, potentially in a single package, which wouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise given the Nintendo link and previous comments from Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot .\n\nFrench video game and accessories maker Nacon was the first third-party publisher to go on the record and say it\u2019s making games for Nintendo Switch 2, which it expats to come out between April and September this year. Nacon publishes the likes of Greedfall 2, Test Drive Unlimited, and RoboCop: Rogue City.\n\nNintendo is set to hold a Switch 2 Direct in April . We\u2019ll hopefully know more by then.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

To meet this opportunity, Microsoft South Africa today announced the launch of Microsoft\u2019s AI skilling initiative for South Africa, a programme aimed at empowering one million South Africans with growing in-demand digital skills by 2026.\n\n\u201cHarnessing the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic vision, but a tangible reality for organisations seeking to achieve exponential growth and optimisation,\u201d says Lillian Barnard, President for Microsoft Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have set an ambitious target to deliver future ready skills to four million African youth for digital, cyber and AI technologies. Through this initiative, we believe we will make significant strides toward reaching this goal. By providing skilling opportunities and access to industry recognised certifications, our youth will be well positioned to compete on the global stage.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI skilling initiative training programme provides insight into the strategic aspects of AI and empowers leaders with the tools and knowledge to navigate the rapidly advancing AI landscape, unlock its potential, and drive their organisations towards unprecedented success.\n\nIn Africa and South Africa, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report 2025 underscores a critical skills gap, with more than 60% of companies identifying it as a key barrier to business transformation by 2030. The report emphasises the urgent need for upskilling and reskilling to meet the demands of emerging roles in technology, AI and green industries.\n\nAt the heart of this initiative lies a commitment to empowering South Africans by equipping them with advanced AI skills. Recognising the growing importance of AI in job markets today, and the future, Microsoft aims to bridge the skills gap and create new employment opportunities for young people. By providing comprehensive training in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the skilling initiative will prepare more people for high-tech jobs in various industries, significantly boosting youth employment and enabling inclusive economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe launch of this AI skilling initiative for South Africa is not just about individual advancement, but more importantly about uplifting entire communities. We believe that by democratising access to AI education we are creating a more equitable digital future for all,\u201d says Barnard.\n\nThe programme targets a broad audience, and in South Africa will prioritise all sectors from companies to government and youth, ensuring that everyone can participate in the digital economy. The content is designed to educate individuals on the fundamentals of AI, empowering them to integrate this powerful technology into their everyday lives.\n\nAligned to this initiative, Microsoft has introduced a free to learn AI Skills Navigator portal where people can take an assessment to guide them on their AI knowledge journey. It is a comprehensive tool designed to help individuals and organisations build AI skills currently in demand and for the future and offers a variety of learning paths tailored to different roles, expertise levels, and learning goals.\n\n\u201cThe programme is not just about employment but fostering a culture of innovation. Digital skills are the foundation of modern innovation and through this initiative, we want to ensure that South Africans are at the forefront of technological advancement,\u201d adds Barnard.\n\nThe success of Microsoft\u2019s AI skilling initiative will be amplified through strategic partnerships with educational institutions, ICT training providers, government, non-governmental organisations, and public and private sector organisations. These collaborations with trusted implementation partners like Afrika Tikkun Services and Youth Employment Service (YES) will be instrumental in ensuring that the training that is provided is relevant, impactful and aligned with the needs of industries.\n\nThe Future of Jobs 2025 report echoes the importance of collaborative efforts across public, private, and educational sectors for building a resilient and equitable workforce in South Africa, and Africa.\n\nAs the country, and the continent continues to embrace digital transformation, initiatives like this one will become increasingly crucial in ensuring that no one is left behind. By making AI education more accessible on a larger scale, Microsoft is working to empower underserved communities with capabilities in cutting-edge technology and contributing to building a brighter, more prosperous future for all South Africans.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, the continent could become a more significant player in the global economy, drawing on AI to revolutionise industries and boost productivity. Together, by delivering on the promise of AI, we can chart a course for Africa to become the next global economic powerhouse,\u201d says Barnard.\n\nImage caption: Lillian Barnard, President of Microsoft Africa speaking at the AI Tour in Johannesburg, announcing the launch of Microsoft\u2019s AI skilling initiative in South Africa, targeting 1 million people by 2026.",

For more information, see the Reminders section at the bottom of this blog post.\n\nNew features gradually being rolled out to the Dev Channel with toggle on*\n\nImproving the battery iconography in Windows 11\n\nIntroducing new and improved battery icons in Windows 11! These icons have been designed to communicate battery status of your PC with just a quick glance. Key changes include colored icons to indicate charging states, simplified overlays that don\u2019t block the progress bar, and an option to turn on battery percentage.\n\nWhen your battery icon is green, this shows that your PC is charging and in a good state. A yellow battery icon will let you know that your PC using battery in energy saving mode \u2013 this automatically happens when your battery is less than or equal to 20% to preserve power. When the battery icon is red, you have a critically low battery and should plug in your PC as soon as possible. You will see these new battery icons on the taskbar in the system tray, in the quick settings flyout, and in Settings. The new battery icons will begin showing on the Lock screen in a future flight.\n\nAs always, your PC\u2019s battery status and more will also be available to you when you hover over the battery icon in the system tray and under Settings > System > Power & battery where you can also adjust the battery level percentage in which energy saver mode kicks on for your PC.\n\nAlong with the updates to the battery icon, we are also introducing the ability to show your battery percentage next to the battery icon in the system tray \u2013 a highly requested feature by Insiders and customers. To enable this, go to Settings > Power & battery and toggle on the \u201cBattery Percentage\u201d setting.\n\n[We are beginning to roll this out to Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, so the experience isn\u2019t available to all Insiders just yet as we plan to monitor feedback before pushing it out to everyone.]\n\nFEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Desktop Environment > System Tray.\n\nChanges and Improvements gradually being rolled out to the Dev Channel with toggle on*\n\n[Input]\n\nAfter being temporarily disabled to address some issues with Build 26120.2213, we are beginning to roll out a new Gamepad keyboard layout for the touch keyboard in Windows 11 again. This change introduces the ability to use your Xbox controller to navigate and type. This includes button accelerators (example: X button for backspace, Y button for spacebar) additionally the keyboard keys have been vertically aligned for better controller navigation patterns.\n\n[Narrator]\n\nWe have added new functionalities to Narrator scan mode. Jump to list item (I\u2019) allows you to quickly access and jump to a list item on a page or a document. Beginning and end of element (Comma (,) and Period (.)) allow you to quickly jump to the beginning or end of large tables, lists or landmarks. This is most helpful when navigating through long emails, news articles, and wiki pages.

            "content": "Nicholas Shkoda/Getty Images\n\nYou'd think that Microsoft's marketing team would have learned something after last year's shambolic rollout of the Recall feature. Maybe, before trying another rollout, they might talk to a few customers, do some focus groups, even ask a few members of the press and analyst community for their advice.\n\nBut no.\n\nAlso: How to remove Copilot from your Microsoft 365 plan\n\nShortly after the New Year, someone in Redmond pushed a button that raised the price of its popular (84 million paid subscribers worldwide!) Microsoft 365 product. You know, the one that used to be called Microsoft Office? Yeah, well, now the app is called Microsoft 365 Copilot, and you're going to be paying at least 30% more for that subscription starting with your next bill.\n\nMicrosoft 365 gets a new logo, a new name, and a higher price. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nAs far as I can tell, the response from customers has been overwhelmingly negative. I monitor Microsoft-focused online forums obsessively, and I read hundreds of complaints without seeing a single compliment. Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.\n\nAlso: Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare\n\nWhat went wrong? Where do I begin?\n\nThey botched the price increase\n\nLet me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.\n\nSo, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. \"Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!\"\n\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 in 2025\n\nNetflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.\n\nBut no. Instead, they made it a 30% price increase and blamed it all on artificial intelligence. Bad idea. Why? Because...\n\nNo one wants to pay for AI\n\nThere's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like writing code and finding patterns in large databases.\n\nBut in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?\n\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\n\nTo top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.\n\nBut good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, \"As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (Entra ID) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available.\"\n\nIf you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nLet me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.\n\nThe announcement was bungled, too\n\nI pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.\n\nInstead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.\n\nThis po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nThat notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.\n\nIt could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their price had gone from \u20ac10 a month to \u20ac13,000. (Those pesky decimals.)\n\nAlso: Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare\n\nOh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.\n\nWell, surely you can just turn it off. Right?\n\nThe smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, \"We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!\"\n\nInstead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means\n\nAs for the other Office apps? \"Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe.\"\n\nSeriously, the support page that explains where you can find that box in Word says, \"We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025.\" Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.\n\nMeanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As one writer pointed out (with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.\n\nHow long will the Classic option last?\n\nIf you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.\n\nAlso: The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself\n\nThat's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.\n\nWhy is Microsoft doing this?\n\nI have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.\n\nSo, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nMicrosoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.\n\nAlso: How I easily added AI to my favorite Microsoft Office alternative\n\nHere's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, \"So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?\"\n\nI feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.",

But Microsoft (MSFT) stock analysts are counting on an improvement in the March quarter with a reacceleration in its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet expect Microsoft earnings of $3.11 a share on sales of $68.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 6.1% in earnings and 11.1% in sales. It also would mark its slowest earnings growth in eight quarters and slowest sales growth in six quarters.\n\n\u2191 X Big Tech Earnings Take Center Stage As Stocks Rally Near Highs See All Videos NOW PLAYING Big Tech Earnings Take Center Stage As Stocks Rally Near Highs\n\nAnalysts see Microsoft's Azure cloud computing infrastructure business growing revenue at 30.2% year over year in the December quarter, down from 31.1% in the September quarter. On a constant currency basis, Azure revenue is seen rising 32%, vs. 34% in the September quarter.\n\nHowever, for its fiscal third quarter, Microsoft's Azure revenue is forecast to rise 31.7%, or 33.4% in constant currency. The Azure business should be helped by more data center capacity coming online, analysts say.\n\nFor the March quarter, Wall Street is modeling Microsoft earnings of $3.16 a share, up 7.5%, on sales of $69.8 billion, up 12.8%.\n\nMicrosoft stock has been consolidating for the past 29 weeks with a buy point of 468.35, according to IBD MarketSurge charts. That buy point is also its all-time high, reached on July 5.\n\nOn the stock market today, Microsoft stock slid 0.6% to close at 444.06.\n\nMicrosoft Stock Sentiment Rising\n\nSentiment in Microsoft stock is improving as it benefits from its investments in artificial intelligence in both cloud computing infrastructure and in software applications, BofA Securities analyst Brad Sills said in a client note Tuesday.\n\nSills has a buy rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 510.\n\n\"We expect Q2 results to drive better sentiment on the shares, given a likely Q3 Azure outlook for accelerating growth,\" Sills said. \"Also, we think the company is likely to raise the fiscal 2025 margin outlook. Microsoft typically updates the full-year margin outlook in Q2.\"\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill on Wednesday reiterated his \"top pick\" buy rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 550.\n\nMicrosoft has positioned itself as a \"key beneficiary\" of the generative AI megatrend thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications, Thill said in a client note.\n\n\"While we are in the early innings of AI adoption, we continue to be bullish on Microsoft's Copilots' ability to drive revenue uplift in calendar 2025 and beyond,\" Thill said. \"We highlight that enterprise adoption continues to build as enterprises start going from pilots to mass rollouts.\"\n\nTraction Elusive For Copilot Services\n\nOther analysts are more cautious on Microsoft and its prospects for monetizing AI.\n\nIn a client note Thursday, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci kept his neutral rating on Microsoft stock.\n\nInvestors want to hear more about traction for Microsoft's Copilot AI services, which \"has been elusive so far,\" he said. The slow adoption of Copilot services was signaled by Microsoft's move to bundle it with Microsoft 365 and raise prices rather than continuing to sell Office Copilot features as an add-on service, he said.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood concurred in a report Thursday.\n\n\"While the new approach should help drive broader adoption, it does signal that its original pricing/packaging strategy has struggled to gain adoption and that it will likely take more time for GenAI to help bend the growth curve for M365,\" Wood said. He rates Microsoft stock as buy with a price target of 475.\n\nMicrosoft stock is in the IBD Long-Term Leaders Portfolio.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nNetflix Stock Gains A New Bull.

            "content": "Great news, Linux fans! Support for the Copilot key is coming in the 6.14 kernel. What do you think it should do?\n\nA year ago, Microsoft decided that what Windows PC keyboards really needed was a Copilot key. It had been years since the IT mega-corp added a key, but with Microsoft's AI obsession, the addition of one to invoke the unloved assistant carried a certain inevitability.\n\nAs 2024 wore on, Microsoft realized that not every user wanted Copilot to pop up when the Copilot key was pressed, and so allowed it to be customized via the Settings app. Microsoft's handy PowerToys application suite also permitted users to make the key do more than fire up a generative AI assistant.\n\nHowever, PCs and their keyboards are not only for Windows. Some are pressed into service as Linux machines where the Copilot key has no meaning. Until now. Or rather, as soon as the Linux 6.14 kernel arrives.\n\nEarlier this week, Lenovo's Mark Pearson dropped in a change to the atkbd keyboard driver in Linux to ensure proper support for the key. However, it's up to whatever is being used as a desktop environment to decide what to do with it.\n\nPearson wrote: \"Microsoft defined Meta+Shift+F23 as the Copilot shortcut instead of a dedicated keycode, and multiple vendors have their keyboards emit this sequence in response to users pressing a dedicated 'Copilot' key.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the default keymap table in atkbd does not map scancode 0x6e (F23) and so the key combination does not work even if userspace is ready to handle it.\n\n\"Because this behavior is common between multiple vendors and the scancode is currently unused, map 0x6e to keycode 193 (KEY_F23) so that key sequence is generated properly.\"\n\nIt's a simple enough change. However, it does raise the question of what the community would like this key to be used for. Maybe it could open a browser with https://copilot.microsoft.com/ ready loaded, possibly with \"Which is better? Vim or Emacs?\" as the first request. Or perhaps something as prosaic as a task switcher.\n\nEither way, support for the Copilot key is on its way. What would you like it to do?

We\u2019ve been refining and optimizing the way we use the cloud for years, and as such, our answer isn\u2019t just about how much we\u2019ve been able to push down our monthly Azure bill.\n\nOur migration from managing our own datacenters to Microsoft Azure has been a process of learning and growing. We\u2019ve moved more than 600 services and solutions comprised of approximately 1,400 components to Azure-based cloud technologies that require less specialized skill sets to use and provide quicker, more agile access to infrastructure and solutions.\n\nWe\u2019re the Microsoft Digital team and we have led the company\u2019s move from the datacenter to the cloud, enabling best-in-class platforms and productivity services for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. This strategy harmonizes the interests of our employee users of our services, our developers, and our team of IT implementers who provide the core of our IT operations.\n\nThe freedom to provision resources in minutes instead of days has radically changed the way we in Microsoft Digital enable teams across the company to spin up the environments and resources they need on demand, which in turn empowers our engineering teams to respond more quickly to our evolving business needs.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve found that easy provisioning and quick deployments can be costly. An unmanaged or undermanaged enterprise estate in Microsoft Azure can quickly lead to significant cloud billing costs and under-utilized resources. But in our journey to the cloud, we\u2019ve learned that there are many smart ways to optimize how you use the cloud, tricks of the trade that we\u2019re using to keep our costs down while we transform the way we work. In this blog post, we\u2019ll share the lessons we\u2019ve learned here at Microsoft on how you can fine-tune your use of Microsoft Azure at your company.\n\n[Read our related blog post on our lessons learned deploying and optimizing Microsoft Azure internally at Microsoft. | Learn how we\u2019re implementing Microsoft Azure cost optimization internally at Microsoft. | Read more about turning to DevOps engineering practices to democratize access to data at Microsoft. | Explore how Microsoft uses a scream test to silence its unused servers.]\n\n\ufeff\n\nWatch to learn how optimizing our Microsoft Azure workloads is helping Microsoft operate more efficiently.\n\nAdopting modern engineering practices\n\nModern engineering practices underpin everything we do in Microsoft Azure, from single resource deployments to enterprise-scale, globally distributed Azure-based solutions that span hundreds of resources. Our modern engineering vision has created culture, tools, and practices focused on developing high-quality, secure, and feature-rich services to enable digital transformation across the organization.\n\nOur operations and engineering teams have journeyed through several phases of efficiency maturity. Through each of these phases, our operations substructure had to evolve, and many of those changes resulted in increased efficiency, not just with the bottom line on our monthly Azure bill, but with the way we do service management in Azure, including development, deployment, change management, monitoring, and incident management. \u2014Pete Apple, principal program manager for Microsoft Azure engineering, Microsoft Digital\n\nPete Apple is a Principal Program Manager for Microsoft Azure Engineering in Microsoft Digital. He and his team have been responsible for overseeing and implementing our massive migration to the cloud over the past 8 years. They\u2019re also responsible for ensuring that the company\u2019s enterprise estate in Microsoft Azure is running at top efficiency.\n\n\u201cOur operations and engineering teams have journeyed through several phases of efficiency maturity,\u201d Apple says. \u201cThrough each of these phases, our operations substructure had to evolve, and many of those changes resulted in increased efficiency, not just with the bottom line on our monthly Azure bill, but with the way we do service management in Azure, including development, deployment, change management, monitoring, and incident management.\u201d\n\nWe went through three phases on our journey to greater efficiency in Microsoft Azure. Phase one focused on improving operational efficiency, phase two examined how we could deliver value through innovation, and in phase three we embraced transforming our digital ecosystem. Here\u2019s a summary of the three phases:\n\nImproving operational efficiency\n\nAt Microsoft Digital, we play a pivotal role in Microsoft business strategy, as most business processes in the company depend on us. To help Microsoft transform on our journey to the cloud, we identified key focus areas to improve in this first phase of our transformation: aligning services, optimizing infrastructure, and assessing our culture.\n\nThe first phase involved culture and structure as much as it did strategy and platform management. We realigned our organization to better support a brand-new way of providing services and support to the company in Microsoft Azure. Our teams needed to realign to eliminate information silos between different support areas. In many cases, teams that started to work together realized they had duplicate projects with similar goals.\n\nReducing projects and streamlining delivery methods freed up engineering resources to accomplish more in less time, while automated provisioning and self-service tools helped our teams plan their own migrations and accurately assess their portion of our Microsoft Azure estate.\n\nOur engineering culture underwent a radical change in phase one. We moved toward empowering our engineers to create business solutions, not just create and manage processes. This led to a more holistic view of what we were trying to accomplish\u2014as individuals and as teams\u2014and it increased innovation, creativity, and productivity throughout our engineering processes.\n\nDelivering value through innovation\n\nWe migrated more than 90 percent of our IT infrastructure to Microsoft Azure in phase one. In phase two, we embraced the Azure platform and cloud-native engineering design principles by adopting Infrastructure as Code and continuous deployment. We redefined operations roles and retrained people from traditional IT roles to be business relationship managers, engineering program managers, service engineers, and software engineers.\n\nWe also radically simplified our IT operations. The rapid provisioning and allocation process in Microsoft Azure enabled us to increase our speed 40-fold by eliminating, streamlining, and connecting processes, and by aligning processes for Azure. Azure native solutions, especially platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings were adopted across all aspects of the engineering and operations lifecycle. These included infrastructure as code with ARM templates, APIs, and PowerShell.\n\nThis final phase is never really final. Continual evaluation and optimization of our Microsoft Azure environment is built into how we manage our resources in the cloud. As new features and engineering approaches arise, we\u2019re adapting our methods and best practices to get the most from our investment. \u2014Heather Pfluger, general manager, Infrastructure and Engineering Services, Microsoft Digital\n\nSolutions that were lifted-and shifted into Microsoft Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources are regularly reassessed for migration or refactoring into PaaS offerings. We also adopted Microsoft Azure Monitor for consolidated monitoring not only for our Azure resources, but also on-premises resources.\n\nEmbracing the digital ecosystem\n\nOur final phase is focusing on developing intelligent systems on Microsoft Azure to deliver reliable, scalable services and to connect operations processes across Microsoft. Automation has been built more deeply into our support and development processes by embracing a DevOps culture and open-source standards in our solutions.\n\nTogether, Microsoft Azure PaaS offerings and Microsoft Azure DevOps enable our engineers to focus on features and usability, while the ARM fabric and Microsoft Azure Monitor provide unified management to provision, manage, and decommission infrastructure resources securely.\n\n\u201cThis final phase is never really final,\u201d says Heather Pfluger, the general manager of Infrastructure and Engineering Services in Microsoft Digital who manages Microsoft\u2019s internal Microsoft Azure profile. \u201cContinual evaluation and optimization of our Microsoft Azure environment is built into how we manage our resources in the cloud. As new features and engineering approaches arise, we\u2019re adapting our methods and best practices to get the most from our investment.\u201d\n\nGaining efficiency from past experience\n\nApple, who works on Pfluger\u2019s team, adds that customers\u2019 migrations can benefit from taking a shortcut that Microsoft didn\u2019t take.\n\n\u201cAs early adopters, our migration practices were pushing the toolsets available,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we looked at our on-premises environment and what was available in Azure, it made sense to move a significant portion of our solutions directly into IaaS resources.\u201d\n\nApple talks about the tradeoffs made between agility and efficiency.\n\nThere are much better tools and best practices in-place now to migrate on-premises solutions directly into PaaS resources, eliminating the need to lift-and-shift and saving the cost of creating and maintaining those IaaS resources. \u2014Pete Apple, principal program manager for Microsoft Azure engineering, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cThese solutions were being lifted from the datacenter and shifted straight into Azure Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, and Storage Accounts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis allowed us to recreate the on-premises environment in the cloud so we could get it out of the datacenter quickly, but it still left us with some of the maintenance tasks and costs inherent with IaaS infrastructure and room for further optimization with PaaS-based solutions.\u201d\n\nAfter the lift-and-shift migration, Apple\u2019s teams re-engineering and re-platformed the IaaS solutions to use PaaS solutions such as Microsoft Azure SQL Database and Microsoft Azure Web Apps. Apple explains the shortcut, \u201cThere are much better tools and best practices in-place now to migrate on-premises solutions directly into PaaS resources, eliminating the need to lift-and-shift and saving the cost of creating and maintaining those IaaS resources.\u201d\n\nManaging data and resource sprawl with agility\n\nWe\u2019re also undergoing specific efforts across our Microsoft Azure estate to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Azure infrastructure supports the entire Microsoft cloud, including Microsoft 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and Microsoft Dynamics 365. While most of these offerings do not allow for direct resource optimization, understanding the fundamentals of cloud scaling and billing is a critical aspect of using them efficiently. Data sprawl is a constant consideration for us.\n\nDan Babb is the Principal Software Engineering Manager responsible for Microsoft Digital\u2019s implementation of Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics for big data ingestion, migration, and exploration. It\u2019s a massive data footprint, with more than 1 billion read operations and 10 petabytes of data consumed monthly through Apache Spark clusters.\n\nSmall specifics with Spark clusters can make a big difference.\n\n\u201cEach job that comes through Azure Synapse Analytics is run on a Spark cluster for compute services,\u201d Babb says. \u201cThere\u2019s a large selection of compute sizes available. The largest ones process data the quickest, but, naturally, they\u2019re also the most expensive. We all like things to be done quickly, so many of our engineers were using very large compute sizes because they\u2019re fast.\u201d\n\nBabb clarifies that just because you can use the fastest method doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\n\u201cMany of our jobs aren\u2019t crucially time-sensitive, so we stopped using the bigger cluster sizes because we didn\u2019t need to,\u201d he says.\n\nBabb emphasizes that accurately assessing the workload and priority of each job has significantly reduced costs.\n\n\u201cProcessing a workload on a smaller instance for 20 minutes instead of using a larger instance for 5 minutes has resulted in significant cost savings for us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring our subscriptions and if a really big cluster size gets spun up, an Azure Monitor Alert notifies our engineering leads they can follow up to ensure that the cluster size is appropriate for the job it\u2019s running.\u201d\n\nApple says this is a way of cost cutting that is being widely adopted across our organization.\n\n\u201cOur business program managers are realizing that they can save money by slowing down projects that don\u2019t need to be rushed,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, we had some folks in Finance who realized that some of their batch reporting didn\u2019t really need to be out in one hour, it was fine if it took eight hours because they only had to run their reports once per day.\u201d\n\nBabb\u2019s team is also designing for distributed processing, creating solutions that are dispersed across clusters and Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics workspaces to create distributed platform architecture that is more flexible and less prone to a single point of failure.\n\n\u201cIf we run into an issue with a component or workspace and we have to take it down, it doesn\u2019t affect the entire solution, just the single cluster or workspace and the job it was running,\u201d he says.\n\nUsing multiple workspaces and clusters has also made it much easier to get granular reporting and cost estimation. Babb\u2019s team members are using monitoring and reporting that enable them to understand the exact cost for any specific job, from ingestion to storage to report generation.\n\nDesigning for Zero Trust\n\nThe Zero Trust security model is pervasive across our Microsoft Azure environment. Based on the principle of verified trust\u2014to trust, you must first verify\u2014Zero Trust eliminates the inherent trust that is assumed inside the traditional corporate network. Zero Trust architecture reduces risk across all environments by establishing strong identity verification, validating device compliance prior to granting access, and ensuring least privilege access to only explicitly authorized resources.\n\nThe Zero Trust model assumes every request is a potential breach. As such, every request that travels through our Microsoft Azure or on-premises environments must be verified as though it originates from an open network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, Zero Trust teaches us to \u201cnever trust, always verify.\u201d Every access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before granting access. Micro-segmentation and least privileged access principles are applied to minimize lateral movement. Rich intelligence and analytics are used to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.\n\nThroughout the Zero Trust model in Microsoft Azure, opportunities exist for simplification and increased efficiency. Microsoft Azure Entra ID allows us to centralize our identity and access workload, which simplifies identification and authorization across the hybrid cloud. Azure\u2019s flexible network infrastructure allows us to implement complex and agile micro-segmentation scenarios in minutes with Microsoft Azure Bicep Templates, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Networks. Our engineers are creating connectivity scenarios and solutions that were simply unimaginable using traditional networking practices.\n\nMei Lau is a Principal Program Manager for Security Monitoring Engineering. Her team\u2019s job is to ensure that across the increasingly complex and dynamic Microsoft Azure networking environment, Zero Trust principles are adhered to and Microsoft\u2019s network environment remains safe and secure.\n\nHer team is using Microsoft Sentinel to deliver intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise at Microsoft. Sentinel allows her security experts to detect attacks and hunt for threats across millions of network signals.\n\nReal-time detection data is more expensive than some of the other data storage options we have. As convenient as it would be to have it all, it\u2019s not that critical. We move our older data into Azure Data Explorer where it\u2019s less expensive to store, but still allows us to use Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries just like we would in Sentinel. \u2014Mei Lau, principal program manager, Security Monitoring Engineering, Microsoft Digital Security and Resilience\n\nWith that much traffic to collect and examine, Lau notes that cost in Sentinel comes down to one primary factor: data ingestion.\n\n\u201cWe want our investigation scope to be as detailed as possible, so naturally, the inclination is to keep all the data we can,\u201d she says.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that you need to be careful to keep your costs down.\n\n\u201cReal-time detection data is more expensive than some of the other data storage options we have,\u201d Lau says. \u201cAs convenient as it would be to have it all, it\u2019s not that critical. We move our older data into Azure Data Explorer where it\u2019s less expensive to store, but still allows us to use Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries just like we would in Sentinel.\u201d\n\nIn Microsoft Sentinel, threat detections result in stored data, so Lau and her team are also diligent about the accuracy and usefulness of the more than 200 detection rules that are configured in Sentinel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continually monitoring and managing detections that fire false positives,\u201d she says. \u201cWe generally want at least 80 percent fidelity for a healthy detection. If we don\u2019t achieve that, we either refine the detection or remove it.\u201d\n\nOur governance model provides centralized control and coordination for all cost-optimization efforts. Getting this right is pivotal for any organization looking to get the most out of being on the cloud in Azure. \u2014Pete Apple, principal program manager for Microsoft Azure engineering, Microsoft Digital\n\nLau\u2019s team proactively monitors data storage in Microsoft Sentinel to look for sudden spikes in usage or other indicators that data usage practices might need to be assessed. It all contributes to a more efficient and streamlined threat management system that does its job well and doesn\u2019t break the bank.\n\nObserving results and managing governance\n\nTo ensure effective identification and implementation of recommendations, governance in cost optimization is critical for our applications and the Microsoft Azure services that those applications use.\n\n\u201cOur governance model provides centralized control and coordination for all cost-optimization efforts,\u201d Apple says. \u201cGetting this right is pivotal for any organization looking to get the most out of being on the cloud in Azure.\u201d\n\nOur model consists of several important components, including:\n\nMicrosoft Azure Advisor recommendations and automation. Advisor cost management recommendations serve as the basis for our optimization efforts. We channel Advisor recommendations into our IT service management and Microsoft Azure DevOps environment to better track how we implement recommendations and ensure effective optimization.\n\nAdvisor cost management recommendations serve as the basis for our optimization efforts.

The data that these dashboards provide empower engineering leaders to observe and track important Microsoft Azure cost components in their service hierarchy to ensure that optimization is effective. Improved Microsoft Azure budget management. We perform our Azure budget planning by using a bottom-up approach that involves our finance and engineering teams. Open communication and transparency in planning are important, and we track forecasts for the year alongside actual spending to date to enable accurate adjustments to spending estimates and closely track our budget targets. Relevant and easily accessible spending data helps us identify trend-based anomalies to control unintentional spending that can happen when resources are scaled or allocated unnecessarily in complex environments.\n\nImplementing a governance solution has enabled us to realize considerable savings by making a simple change to Microsoft Azure resources across our entire footprint. For example, we implemented a recommendation to convert Microsoft Azure SQL Database instances from the Standard database transaction unit (DTU) based tier to a serverless tier by using a simple Microsoft Azure Resource Manager template and the auto-pause capability. The configuration change reduced costs by 97 percent.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAs we continue our journey, we\u2019re focusing on refining our efforts and identifying new opportunities for further cost optimization in Microsoft Azure.\n\nOur Microsoft Digital Azure footprint will continue to grow in the years ahead, and our cost-optimization and efficiency efforts will grow to ensure that we\u2019re making the most of our Azure investment. \u2014Heather Pfluger, general manager, Infrastructure and Engineering Services, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we can do here,\u201d Pfluger says. \u201cWe\u2019re building and increasing monitoring measures that help us ensure we\u2019re using the optimal Azure services for our solutions. We\u2019re infusing automated scalability into every element of our Azure environment and reducing our investment in the IaaS components that currently support some of our legacy technologies.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Azure optimization is always ongoing.\n\n\u201cOur Microsoft Digital Azure footprint will continue to grow in the years ahead, and our cost-optimization and efficiency efforts will grow to ensure that we\u2019re making the most of our Azure investment,\u201d Pfluger says.\n\nEmbrace modern engineering practices. Adopting modern engineering practices that support reliability, security, operational excellence, and performance efficiency will help to enable better cost optimization in Microsoft Azure. Staying aware of new Azure services and changes to existing functionality will also help you recognize cost-optimization opportunities as soon as possible.\n\nAdopting modern engineering practices that support reliability, security, operational excellence, and performance efficiency will help to enable better cost optimization in Microsoft Azure.

            "content": "Photo by J. David Ake/Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft is a major provider of cloud services and artificial intelligence for the Israeli military, according to internal documents related to the contracts between the Israeli Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Microsoft Israel obtained by Drop Site News. The leaked documents show that Israel\u2019s usage spiked dramatically in the months following October 7, 2023 when Israel was using AI and other technology to wage its brutal war on Gaza.\n\nThe trove of documents reveals that Microsoft\u2019s ties to the Israeli military are deeper and more lucrative than previously known, exposing the tech giant\u2019s role in supplying advanced cloud and AI services during the war that multiple international bodies, including the International Court of Justice, ruled may plausibly constitute a genocide. Drop Site shared the documents with independent Israeli-Palestinian investigative magazine +972, which previously exposed Israel\u2019s use of AI in its bombing campaign, Local Call, and The Guardian, which also published stories Thursday.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s dealings with the Israeli military are part of a pattern among American technology giants rushing to supply it with cloud and AI technologies to secure a share of Israel\u2019s ever-growing war chest since October 2023. According to the documents, Microsoft drastically expanded its relationship with the Israeli military since the war on Gaza began and became a major provider of cloud services to various Israeli military units.\n\nIn total, the costs just for engineering support and consultancy with the Israeli military have amounted to approximately $10 million since the start of the October 2023 Gaza offensive, with additional support projects worth another $30 million under consideration in 2024. The total size of Israeli MoD\u2019s contract with Microsoft, including the usage of the Azure platform, is much larger, but the exact figure could not be ascertained from the documents.\n\nThe Israeli military has been leveraging a range of Microsoft cloud services to support their ongoing operations, according to the documents. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a suite of applications and services to its enterprise customers. Its most important components have historically been compute and storage, which allow Microsoft customers to process and store massive amounts of data in cloud servers hosted globally. More recently, due to Microsoft\u2019s investment of billions of dollars in OpenAI, the same company that runs ChatGPT, Microsoft has added OpenAI\u2019s Large Language Models to its Azure suite of offerings.\n\nBundled together, these services are what form the core of the services the Israeli military has purchased from Microsoft. Among their most used services are translation and the Azure OpenAl service, an enterprise service based on the same technology as ChatGPT, together accounting for almost 75 percent of the total usage. Speech and voice services make up the rest.\n\nLeaked data show a dramatic spike in Microsoft cloud storage used by the Israeli military, jumping more than 155 percent between June 2023 and April 2024, and peaking just before the Rafah offensive in May 2024. Storage use is an important indicator showing the extent of AI usage, since storage usually grows along with the usage of other cloud products.\n\nArtificial intelligence took on a new role in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, with the Israeli military using a program called Lavender to identify targets, according to reporting from +972\u2014though it is not known exactly which companies fueled this particular program and the military ramped down that program in subsequent months. Their report in August also revealed that Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS were competing for lucrative Israeli military contracts.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza spurred a \"gold rush\" among tech companies seeking to provide services to the Israeli military. In the weeks following the October 7th attack, Google escalated its efforts to provide Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry with increased access to its AI technology. This urgency was driven by a concern that the military would turn to Google's competitor, Amazon, which also has a contract with the Israeli government. The new set of documents show that Microsoft was similarly enthusiastic about Israeli contracts and gave major discounts for the opportunity.\n\nSince the beginning of the war on Gaza, Israel has emerged as one of Microsoft\u2019s top 500 global customers, with the Israeli MoD serving as an umbrella customer of Microsoft, overseeing the Israeli military\u2019s overall relationship with the company. But unlike a traditional centralized procurement model, where a single organization makes purchasing decisions on behalf of the entire entity, the Israeli military\u2019s structure is more decentralized. What sets the Israeli military apart from other umbrella accounts is that various departments and entities within the Israeli military operate with a significant degree of autonomy and can independently sign contracts based on their internal budgets.\n\nThe documents also reveal the breadth of Microsoft\u2019s dealings with the Israeli military; several units within the Israeli military independently contracted Microsoft services, including Unit 8200, an elite intelligence unit specializing in signal intelligence, cyberwarfare, code decryption, and military surveillance; Matzov, the Center of Encryption and Information Security; Mamram, the central computing system unit; Tikshuv, the Computer and IT Directorate overseeing communications and cybersecurity; and Lotem, the unit for Telecommunications and Information Technology. The Israeli Air Force and Navy also made significant deals with Microsoft immediately after the start of the October 2023 Gaza offensive.\n\nThe Microsoft data centers providing services to the Israeli military were not limited to Israel, with many being hosted in European countries that recognize the International Court of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction as compulsory. If the court ultimately rules the war a genocide, hosting Microsoft\u2019s data servers utilized by the Israeli military may constitute a breach of international law and could cause legal issues related to Microsoft\u2019s operations in those jurisdictions.\n\nInternally, Microsoft employees had already been petitioning their employer to scrutinize their policies relating to Israel. Drop Site had reported in September last year that Microsoft was criticized for its sponsorship of the \"I Love Mamram\" conference celebrating the 65th anniversary of Mamram, the Israeli military's Center of Computing and Information Systems unit, where Microsoft Israel\u2019s CEO was slated to speak. The documents now reveal that Mamram was a Microsoft customer. The company has also faced criticism for matching employee donations to organizations that support the Israeli military, while not matching donations to organizations that support Palestinians, and even delisting organizations like UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.\n\nLeave a comment",

            "content": "Microsoft has (very quietly) announced that it will be changing the way account sign-ins work in February \u2013 and the new system could pose a significant security risk for some users.\n\nSquirreled away in the Microsoft Account Help page of the Support section on Microsoft\u2019s website, the change essentially states that users will remain logged in by default any time they sign in via a browser or app on any device \u2013 meaning that if you sign into your Microsoft account to check your emails in Outlook or access your OneDrive on a public computer (or, say, a friend or colleague\u2019s device) you'll no longer be automatically signed out afterwards, even if you close the browser entirely.\n\nIn other words, your emails, cloud files, and even your search and browsing history will remain accessible to anyone who uses that device, potentially leaving your personal data vulnerable. According to Microsoft, users will be able to circumvent the new sign-in setting by accessing their account while using the private browsing feature on their browser of choice.\n\nAn odd change from Microsoft\n\nThe real question here is simply: why? Automatically signing out in-browser users is a common staple of many software accounts, especially those that might be accessed from multiple devices \u2013 I personally have to log into a minimum of three different accounts in Chrome just to start working every morning. It seems to me that this should be an opt-in feature instead of the new default.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Microsoft hasn\u2019t exactly been public about this change, especially given the potential security risks it poses \u2013 although I shouldn\u2019t be too harsh straight off the bat, since the change hasn\u2019t been implemented yet (I assume it will be active from February 1) and Microsoft could introduce a new pop-up or warning message informing users that they won\u2019t be logged out automatically when they close the window unless they\u2019re using private browsing.\n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say that this move is for the convenience of frequent users; although dedicated desktop apps for software like Outlook and OneDrive exist, there\u2019s no doubt that a large cohort of Microsoft account holders who like to keep things old-school and access their emails and cloud storage via a browser instead. I get it; Gmail doesn\u2019t have a standalone desktop app for Windows, but I\u2019d probably still just open it in a browser tab anyway even if it did.\n\nIt's worth noting that Microsoft's upcoming change effectively mirrors the way that Google accounts already work \u2013 and before you ask, yes, this is a bit of a black mark against Google, since the same potential security issues apply here. If you don't have two-factor authentication active and leave your Google account logged in on a device, you'll remain signed in indefinitely unless you log out or use private browsing.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Nonetheless, I\u2019m a little concerned by the change, so I hope that Microsoft takes appropriate steps to make it as idiot-proof as possible.",

It is based in part on documents obtained by Drop Site News, which has published its own story.\n\nThe investigation, which also draws on interviews with sources from across Israel\u2019s defence and intelligence establishment, sheds new light on how the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) turned to major US tech companies to meet the technological demands of war.\n\nAfter launching its offensive in Gaza in October 2023, the IDF faced a sudden rush in demand for storage and computing power, leading it to swiftly expand its computing infrastructure and embrace what one commander described as \u201cthe wonderful world of cloud providers\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians walk through the destruction caused by the Israeli air and ground offensive in Rafah, Gaza Strip early in 2025. Photograph: Mohammad Abu Samra/AP\n\nAs a result, multiple Israeli defence sources said, the IDF has become increasingly dependent on the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Google to store and analyse greater volumes of data and intelligence information for longer period.\n\nThe leaked documents, which include commercial records from Israel\u2019s defence ministry and files from Microsoft\u2019s Israeli subsidiary, suggest Microsoft\u2019s products and services, chiefly its Azure cloud computing platform, were used by units across Israel\u2019s air, ground and naval forces, as well as its intelligence directorate.\n\nWhile the IDF has used some Microsoft services for administrative purposes, such as email and file management systems, documents and interviews suggest Azure has been used to support combat and intelligence activities.\n\nAs a trusted partner of Israel\u2019s defence ministry, Microsoft was frequently tasked with working on sensitive and highly classified projects. Its staff also worked closely with the IDF\u2019s intelligence directorate, including its elite surveillance division, Unit 8200.\n\nIn recent years, documents show, Microsoft has also provided the Israeli military with large-scale access to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model \u2013 the engine behind ChatGPT \u2013 thanks to a partnership with the developer of the AI tools which recently changed its policies against working with military and intelligence clients.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the findings of the investigation or answer questions about its work for the IDF. An IDF spokesperson said: \u201cWe won\u2019t comment on the subject.\u201d \u200bI\u200bsrael\u2019s defence ministry also declined to comment.\n\nThe disclosures about Microsoft\u2019s deep ties to the IDF and the integration of its systems in the war effort illustrate the growth of private-sector involvement in hi-tech warfare and the increasingly blurred distinctions between civilian and military digital infrastructure.\n\nView image in fullscreen Israeli soldiers prepare to release military drones at an undisclosed location near the southern part of the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip in January 2024. Photograph: Atef Safadi/EPA\n\nIn the US, commercial ties between Israel\u2019s military and big tech groups are coming under increasing scrutiny and have sparked protests among tech workers who fear products they build and maintain have enabled a war in Gaza in which Israel stands accused of grave violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nHowever, in a war that has become known for the IDF\u2019s application of novel systems on the battlefield \u2013 including AI-driven target recommendation tools such as The Gospel and Lavender \u2013 the role played by major US-headquartered tech companies to support Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza has, until now, largely remained out of sight.\n\nA deepening partnership\n\nIn 2021, after Microsoft failed to secure a $1.2bn deal to overhaul Israel\u2019s public sector\u2019s cloud computing infrastructure, its executives looked with envy at Amazon and Google, which had joined forces to win the sprawling contract, known as \u201cProject Nimbus\u201d.\n\nAlthough undoubtedly a blow to Microsoft\u2019s business in Israel and its place as the IDF\u2019s premier cloud provider, documents suggest the company took comfort from indications from Israeli defence officials that it would continue to enjoy a strong partnership with the military.\n\nExecutives were hopeful the relationship would continue to grow, thanks in part to the integration of the company\u2019s technology and services in the most complex and secretive parts of the IDF\u2019s operations.\n\nThe leaked documents illustrate how the US tech behemoth supported a range of sensitive activities, including:\n\nAzure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform, was used by multiple military intelligence units, including Unit 8200 and Unit 81, which develops cutting-edge spy technology for Israel\u2019s intelligence community.\n\nA system Israeli security forces use to manage the population registry and movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, known as \u201cRolling Stone\u201d, was maintained using Microsoft\u2019s technology.\n\nDuring the Gaza offensive, Microsoft\u2019s suite of communications and messaging systems were used by Ofek, an air force unit responsible for managing large databases of potential targets for lethal strikes known as \u201ctarget banks\u201d.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s staff and contractors have also worked closely with military personnel across the IDF, providing advice and technical support both remotely and on military bases.\n\nDuring the Gaza offensive, Microsoft engineers provided support to IDF intelligence units such as Unit 8200 and another secretive spy unit, Unit 9900 \u2013 which collects and analyses visual intelligence \u2013 to support their use of cloud infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the files, between the start of the war in October 2023 and the end of June 2024, Israel\u2019s defence ministry agreed to buy 19,000 hours of engineering support and consultancy services from Microsoft to assist a wide range of IDF units. The deals appear to have generated about $10m in fees for Microsoft.\n\n\u2018A paradigm shift\u2019\n\nIn a 2021 book the Guardian revealed he had authored, the head of Unit 8200 at the time forecast the IDF\u2019s demand for cloud computing would lead it to partner with the likes of Microsoft and Amazon \u201cin ways similar to their current relationships\u201d with major weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin.\n\nTwo years later, as Israel embarked on a ground invasion and aerial campaign in Gaza, unprecedented in its speed and intensity, the IDF\u2019s insatiable demand for bombs was matched by its need for greater access to cloud computing services.\n\nThis created an opportunity for Microsoft to deepen its relationship with the IDF. In November 2023, files suggest, Israel\u2019s defence ministry turned to the company to provide rapid support to the military\u2019s central computing unit, known as Mamram.\n\nResponsible for the military\u2019s tech infrastructure, Mamram has been at the forefront of the IDF\u2019s pivot to greater reliance on commercial cloud companies. The unit\u2019s commander told a defence industry conference in Tel Aviv last year how at the start of Israel\u2019s ground invasion IDF systems were overwhelmed, leading the unit to purchase computing power from \u201cthe civilian world\u201d.\n\nIn remarks revealed by +972 and Local Call, Col Racheli Dembinsky explained that the most significant advantage the cloud companies provided was their \u201ccrazy wealth of services\u201d, including their advanced AI capabilities. Working with these companies, she said, provided the IDF with \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza.\n\nAlthough Dembinsky did not mention the names of the cloud providers the IDF is now relying on, the Azure logo along with the logos of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud featured in her lecture slides.\n\nView image in fullscreen An Israeli fighter jet releases flares, while a drone is seen from Rafah in May 2024. Photograph: Abdel Kreem Hana/AP\n\nAccording to analysis of the leaked documents, the Israeli military\u2019s average monthly consumption of Microsoft Azure\u2019s cloud storage facilities in the first six months of the war was 60% higher than in the four months leading up to the war.\n\nThe documents suggest the military\u2019s consumption of Microsoft\u2019s AI-based products also jumped in a similar period. By the end of March 2024, the military\u2019s monthly consumption of Azure\u2019s suite of machine learning tools was 64 times higher than in September 2023.\n\nPrecisely how the IDF used Azure\u2019s AI-based products was not specified, but documents suggest it drew on a range of AI-powered translation and speech-to-text conversion tools.\n\nThe files also indicate that a significant proportion of the AI-based services paid for by the defence ministry were used by the military on so-called \u201cair-gapped\u201d systems disconnected from the internet and public networks, raising the possibility they may have been used for more sensitive tasks.\n\nThe IDF also appears to have drawn on the AI-based services from Microsoft\u2019s rivals. On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Google\u2019s cloud division provided the IDF with access to its AI-based services.\n\nThe military\u2019s use of OpenAI\u2019s products such as its GPT-4 engine \u2013 a powerful AI model designed for natural language understanding and generation \u2013 also rose sharply in the first six months of the war, files suggest. Its access to the models was made via the Azure platform rather than directly through OpenAI.\n\nAt one stage in 2024, OpenAI\u2019s tools accounted for a quarter of the military\u2019s consumption of machine learning tools provided by Microsoft. The company has in recent years reportedly invested $13bn in OpenAI.\n\nIn January 2024, OpenAI quietly deleted its own restrictions against the use of its services for \u201cmilitary and warfare\u201d activities as part of a comprehensive rewrite of its policies. At around this time, files suggest, the Israeli military\u2019s consumption of the Azure OpenAI suite of products began to spike.\n\nIt was not clear how the military used OpenAI\u2019s models or whether they played any role in supporting combat or intelligence activities.\n\nApproached for comment, OpenAI did not respond to questions about its knowledge of how the Israeli military uses its products. A spokesperson for OpenAI said: \u201cOpenAI does not have a partnership with the IDF.\u201d They referred to OpenAI\u2019s updated usage policy, which forbade its products being used to \u201cdevelop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property\u201d.\n\nIn May 2024, however, Microsoft began to publicise the ways in which the integration of OpenAI\u2019s tools on its Azure platform presented a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d for defence and intelligence organisations, offering to \u201caugment human capabilities\u201d and achieve \u201cgreater speed, accuracy, and efficiency\u201d.",

You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often-reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance that consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom-line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.",

It integrates advanced AI services like natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to help organizations across industries create AI-powered solutions that accelerate innovation and differentiate them in the market.\n\nGreat music builds memories that span generations\n\nMy first concert with my son was a Coldplay show in Vancouver a couple of years ago. I was completely captivated by the show, the music, the immersive experience, and the focus on sustainability\u2014but mostly by watching my youngest experience a concert for the first time. It was truly magical. The band has always been at the forefront of innovation and generating magic with their fans.\n\nTo coincide with their latest project, A Film For The Future, the band collaborated with Microsoft to produce an AI-powered experience that lets fans interact with their new album MOON MUSiC in a unique and personal way.\n\nAfter some initial skepticism when generative AI emerged, we\u2019re now seeing creators and artists begin to experiment with AI as a creative booster\u2014bringing fresh ways to interact with and enhance their work, come up with new ideas, and even get things done faster.\n\nA Film For The Future is a highly collaborative project, bringing together a diverse group of filmmakers and animators to create unique segments for the 44-minute film, which provides a visual accompaniment to the new album. Each creator was given a broad set of themes and creative license to come up with visuals each felt best represented Coldplay\u2019s music. That collaborative theme now extends to the fan experience, which transcends traditional passive viewing and enables you to create your own 15-second clip of the film using Microsoft Copilot and Azure AI. Your clip, or remix, is then added to the community playback here.\n\nBy going to the Community Remix section on the film\u2019s website, you can see clips created by others accompanied by the \u201ciAAM\u201d track (\u201cI Am A Mountain\u201d) from \u201cMOON MUSiC\u201d and can create your own clip.\n\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s a very emotive experience as you create your own personal remix. Mine is trust in summoning lightning, which is obviously awesome. You can fine-tune your own remix by adjusting the intensity of seven different attributes, such as passion, growth, and peace, that are represented as moons against a rainbow (trust me, you have to see it). Once you\u2019re done, your remix is added to the community and you can download a video and image of your remix if you\u2019d like. You can also create another remix.\n\nAzure AI How innovators are creating the future.\n\nThe memories of that Vancouver concert came flooding back while I was in the app, giving me a wonderful moment to plunge into a cherished memory. It was unexpected and kind of amazing. Not every app can evoke such a response. Coldplay certainly brings some emotional chemistry to the mix, but this creative use of AI opens new ground for fans.\n\nMicrosoft collaborated with Seattle-based Pixel Lab to build this fan remix experience. The platform AI analyzes the emotional context of each video clip and dynamically assembles them to create a unique and immersive experience for every fan. This means that no two remixes are the same, and each fan gets a personalized journey through Coldplay\u2019s music, making the experience deeply engaging and memorable.\n\nFrom the Community Remix experience, you can chat with Microsoft Copilot about Coldplay, the new album, A Film For The Future, or whatever you want to chat about using simple prompts.\n\nThe fusion of generative AI and human creativity is opening new vistas for artists and businesses alike. The fan remix experience is more than a showcase of cutting-edge technology. Fans can now become co-creators, using Microsoft AI to craft their own unique interpretations of Coldplay\u2019s music. It highlights one of the many strategic values of integrating AI into creative processes to unlock new opportunities for innovation and differentiation.\n\nMade with Azure AI Foundry\n\nThis fan remix experience was built with a collection of Azure AI services available in Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft\u2019s unified AI platform announced a few months ago at Microsoft Ignite. It integrates advanced AI services like natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to help organizations across industries create AI-powered solutions that accelerate innovation and differentiate them in the market. Azure AI Foundry enables everyone\u2014from developers to data scientists, to business and IT leaders\u2014to collaborate seamlessly design, customize, and manage innovative solutions that transform ideas into reality.\n\nEnhancing human creativity with AI\n\nAt the heart of the Coldplay project is the belief that AI can enhance human creativity rather than replace it. Technology has been an important part of creative expression for a long, long time. Artists are often among the first to test the creative potential of technical innovation. Generative AI expands the role of technology in artistic expression, bringing audiences into the creative process, and in this case, elevating fans to co-creators with the artist. It\u2019s a glimpse into how AI is changing expectations for how we engage with our favorite artists.\n\nA Film For The Future Try the remix experience to create your own Learn more >\n\nAbout Jessica\n\nJessica leads Azure data, AI, and digital application product marketing at Microsoft.

To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\"\n\nIt said that Microsoft continues to have rights to OpenAI IP (inclusive of model and infrastructure) for use within its products like Copilot.\n\nCritically, it added: \"The OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure, and is also available through the Azure OpenAI Service.

The project is kicking off with a $100 billion investment from Softbank, Oracle, and OpenAI and could scale to an investment of up to $500 billion over the next four years.\n\nMicrosoft stock climbs after Trump's Stargate AI announcement\n\nAt the White House yesterday, President Trump announced the launch of the Stargate initiative -- a project that's bringing together Oracle, Softbank, and OpenAI to invest in U.S. data centers for AI. Microsoft is a leading player in the AI infrastructure services market through its Azure cloud computing platform, and it's also a key partner for OpenAI.\n\nAs part of the new Stargate partnership, Microsoft has noted that the two companies have modified technology exclusivity agreements. Microsoft has also been named as a key partner in the Stargate project.\n\nIs Trump's Stargate initiative bullish for Microsoft?\n\nWhile Microsoft stock is posting gains in today's trading, there is some debate whether the Stargate project will actually wind up being a positive for the tech giant. Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI hinges on the tech giant providing the ChatGPT creator with cloud computing resources. With OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank investing to create new AI data centers in the U.S., it's possible that the smaller software specialist's reliance on Microsoft could be lessened.\n\nOn the heels of the news, Morgan Stanley actually lowered its one-year price target on Microsoft from $548 per share to $540 per share. While the firm maintained an overweight rating on the stock, it sees concerns related to gross margins, the company's relationship with OpenAI, and other factors. So even though Microsoft remains one of the strongest overall players in the AI space, it's possible that shifting dynamics in the space will spur volatility for the stock in the near term.",

As part of OpenAI\u2019s plans to team up with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate, Microsoft is no longer the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don\u2019t think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future. They\u2019ll have their own frontier models,\u201d Benioff predicted, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s why they hired Mustafa Suleyman. And Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.\u201d\n\nBenioff said their dislike was visible at the year-ago Davos show, \u201cwhere Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along.\u201d\n\nThe end of Microsoft exclusively hosting OpenAI was destined to happen. Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 \u2014 years before OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Now, OpenAI appears bound for its own tech giant status, perhaps one day to rival Microsoft. OpenAI has also blamed a lack of available compute for product delays, indicating it needs more data center capacity than Microsoft can (or perhaps wants to) provide. And OpenAI\u2019s exclusive agreement with Microsoft was to end whenever OpenAI achieved what they both agreed was AGI.\n\nSome reports indicate tension between the two companies has been building since at least mid-2023, after OpenAI released its own, competing enterprise product. After Altman was fired and reinstated as OpenAI CEO in late 2023, employees from both companies told Business Insider they really don\u2019t like working together. OpenAI\u2019s folks tended to look down on those at Microsoft, some employees said.\n\nJust a few months later, in early 2024, Nadella thumbed his nose back by hiring DeepMind and Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to lead Microsoft AI. (Microsoft has not yet responded to our request for comment.)\n\nWhile Benioff may hope that Microsoft will fully abandon OpenAI in the future, that could be wishful thinking, although Microsoft is reportedly working on its own LLM called MAI-1. Still, when Microsoft announced earlier this month a new AI group led by Jay Parikh that will build AI agents and apps, the post didn\u2019t even mention OpenAI.\n\nThis latest fissure in the partnership is good news for Benioff. Salesforce also uses OpenAI\u2019s enterprise models, and is an investor in OpenAI rival Anthropic.\n\nEven so, Benioff\u2019s observations about Suleyman aren\u2019t completely off. Suleyman has been known to dismiss Altman\u2019s vision especially around AGI, and admitted last month in an interview with The Verge that the OpenAI partnership has \u201clittle tensions here and there.\u201d\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

On Wednesday, Mr. Starbuck said on social media that D.E.I. was \u201ccornered and in a position to die but we must be punishing and relentless in finishing this ideology off.\u201d\n\nShareholder proposals have become a popular way for corporate activists to contest and support diversity efforts, climate commitments and other social issues. But compared with social media attacks, they have so far yielded few results. Companies including Lowe\u2019s, Molson Coors and Toyota announced changes to their policies after Mr. Starbuck targeted them on social media (\u201cWe\u2019ll eventually get to Costco,\u201d Mr. Starbuck wrote on X, but they \u201cwere not a company we had down to work on in early 2025.\u201d). But most companies routinely reject shareholder proposals, preferring to maintain control over their policies \u2014 even if they are already considering similar changes internally.\n\nIn 2024, the National Center for Public Policy Research filed proposals to contest environmental, social and governance policies at 61 companies.

            "content": "Russian cybercriminals are adopting a scam in which they pose as tech support on Microsoft Teams to convince victims they have an IT issue before tricking employees into allowing them to install ransomware on the targets\u2019 computer networks.\n\nBritish cybersecurity company Sophos reported on Thursday to have seen more than 15 incidents in which two separate groups used Microsoft Office 365\u2019s default service settings to socially engineer their way onto a victim\u2019s system.\n\nThe company\u2019s report finds an overlap between one of these attackers and a group tracked under the name Storm-1811, previously identified by Microsoft as conducting these kinds of scams. The other group, which appears to be copying the Storm-1811 playbook, has possible connections to a cybercrime group tracked as FIN7.\n\nSean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos X-Ops, told Recorded Future News that the new campaigns were uncovered after the team was \u201cresearching some BeaverTail cases, some actual nation-state stuff going on, with North Korea.\u201d\n\nBeaverTail is a type of malware that has been used by hackers linked to North Korea, where the threat actors pretend to be recruiters on job search platforms before getting victims to download malware, often to drain any cryptocurrency wallets associated with their devices.\n\n\u201cFrom the first second I looked at the report, I said \u2018No, this is something totally different,\u2019\u201d said Gallagher, noting that there were a range of details that didn\u2019t match the North Korean modus operandi, including the victimology and the type of malware deployed.\n\n\u201cA customer had two employees that had received a very large volume of email in a very short period of time. [One of them] was working from home, it was U.S. election day, and they suddenly got all these emails, and then they received a Teams call from someone claiming to be their help desk manager. And that was how it started,\u201d said Gallagher.\n\n\u201cBoth threat actors operated their own Microsoft Office 365 service tenants as part of their attacks and took advantage of a default Microsoft Teams configuration that permits users on external domains to initiate chats or meetings with internal users,\u201d explained the Sophos report.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t pay attention\u2019\n\nIn a couple of cases the Teams communication was a voice call, \u201cin others it\u2019s been a video call,\u201d said Gallagher, but the victims themselves weren\u2019t paying particular attention to who was calling or where from, mostly believing that the calls were from a legitimate outsourced support provider.\n\n\u201cYou know, when you\u2019re in the middle of receiving 3,000 emails in half an hour, and especially with organizations that have outsourced their IT support, they don\u2019t pay attention to who they\u2019re talking to, they think \u2018Oh, this makes sense, it\u2019s my outsourced IT,\u2019 right? So we didn\u2019t get any artists\u2019 sketches!\u201d\n\nAlongside these social engineering approaches, the fake support staff were also sending text messages on the Teams chat function, often including links to things that the adversary would use one they tricked the victim into providing them with remote control \u2014 often using Microsoft\u2019s own tools, either QuickAssist (for the Storm-1811 crew) or directly through Teams screen share (for the group with links to FIN7).\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t pick up a lot of details about the threat actor from our Microsoft Office 365 integration,\u201d said Gallagher. \u201cWe got the account name and we got the remote IP address. The remote IP address was in Russia.\u201d\n\nOf the more than 15 incidents, Gallagher said Sophos was able to protect the majority of them: \u201cThere was one that was not one of our managed detection responses customers, who was just a Sophos endpoint customer, who had data exfiltration but ransomware did not execute.\u201d\n\nDuring the case on U.S. Election Day, after the fake support staff had instructed the employee to allow a remote screen control session, the attacker used it to open a command shell,drop files and execute malware, with the files including a Java archive (JAR) and a .zip archive containing Python code copying obfuscation methods previously seen being used by FIN7.\n\nSophos cautions however that the obfuscation method itself is based on publicly available code, and that FIN7 is known to have sold tools to other cybercriminals.\n\nIn another group of actions, the hackers operated differently during the fake support chat and once they had access to the victim\u2019s device \u2014 relying \u201cmuch more on \u2018hands-on- keyboard\u2019 actions and scripted commands\u201d that were being launched directly by the hackers, something that more directly overlapped with what Microsoft had described when reporting on Storm-1811.\n\nSophos states that \u201cunless absolutely necessary, organizations should ensure that their Office 365 service provisions restrict Teams calls from outside organizations or restrict that capability to trusted business partners,\u201d as well as restricting remote access applications by policy.",

            "content": "Sophos X-Ops\u2019 Managed Detection and Response (MDR) is actively responding to incidents tied to two separate groups of threat actors, each of which have used the functionality of Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 platform to gain access to targeted organizations with the likely goal of stealing data and deploying ransomware.\n\nSophos MDR began investigating these two separate clusters of activity in response to customer incidents in November and December 2024. Sophos is tracking these threats as STAC5143 and STAC5777. Both threat actors operated their own Microsoft Office 365 service tenants as part of their attacks and took advantage of a default Microsoft Teams configuration that permits users on external domains to initiate chats or meetings with internal users.\n\nSTAC5777 overlaps with a threat group previously identified by Microsoft as Storm-1811. STAC5143 is a previously unreported threat cluster copying the Storm-1811 playbook, with possible connections to the threat actor known variously as FIN7, Sangria Tempest, or Carbon Spider.\n\nWe are publishing this in-depth report on both threat clusters to aid defenders in detecting and blocking these continuing threats, and to raise awareness of the spread of these tactics among organizations using the Office 365 platform. Sophos MDR has observed more than 15 incidents involving these tactics in the past three months, with half of them in the past two weeks.\n\nCommon tactics include:\n\nEmail-bombing\u2014 targeted high volumes of spam email messages (as many as 3,000 in less than an hour) to overwhelm the Outlook mailboxes of a few individuals within the organization and create a sense of urgency\n\nSending Teams messages and making Teams voice and video calls from an adversary-controlled Office 365 instance to targeted employees, posing as tech support for their organization\n\nUsing Microsoft remote control tools\u2014either Quick Assist or directly through Teams screen sharing\u2014to take control of the targeted individual\u2019s computer and install malware\n\nSTAC5143:\n\nTeams built-in remote control\n\nA Java Archive (JAR) and Java runtime that automate the exploitation of the victim\u2019s computer\n\nJAR extracts Python-based backdoors from a .zip file downloaded from a remote SharePoint link.\n\nUses techniques and tools connected to FIN7\n\nSTAC5777:\n\nMicrosoft Quick Assist\n\nHands-on-keyboard configuration changes and malware deployment\n\nDeployment of a legitimate Microsoft updater with a malicious side-loading DLL that provides persistence, steals credentials, and allows for discovery of network resources\n\nUses RDP and Windows Remote Management to access other computers on the targeted network\n\nIn one case, deployed Black Basta Ransomware\n\nTechniques, tools, and procedures overlap with Microsoft-identified threat actor Storm-1811\n\nHighly active\n\nThis report details the tactics of the two threat clusters, which both follow versions of the same attack pattern: email bombing and fake tech support social engineering with the delivery of malware, the exploitation of legitimate services through Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 platform, and efforts to deploy command and control and data exfiltration tools.\n\nWe believe with high confidence that both sets of adversarial activity are parts of ransomware and data theft extortion efforts.\n\nSTAC5143\n\nWhile some of the malware seen from this threat cluster in the two attacks Sophos observed were similar to attacks by FIN7 observed by eSentire and Sekoia , there were several things that diverged from the usual FIN7-type attack. FIN7 has been known to primarily target victims through phishing and (more recently) malicious sponsored Google Ads to deliver malware. This attack chain was different, and targeted organizations smaller and in different business sectors than FIN7\u2019s usual victims.\n\nAttack chain\n\nInitial access\n\nIn early November, an employee at a Sophos MDR customer organization reported to her internal IT contact that they had received an exceptionally large volume of spam messages\u2014over 3,000 in a 45-minute period. Shortly after that, they received a Teams call from outside their organization, from an account named \u201cHelp Desk Manager.\u201d As the organization used a managed service provider for IT services, this did not set off red flags with the employee who accepted the video call.\n\nDuring the call, the threat actor instructed the employee to allow a remote screen control session through Teams. Through this remote-control session that the attacker was able to open a command shell and drop files and execute malware, deploying them from an external SharePoint file store. The files included Java archive (JAR) files and a .zip archive containing Python code and other components.\n\nFirst Stage Execution\n\nThe threat actor executed the JAR file from a command shell opened during the remote session with a copy of the legitimate javaw.exe, a Java \u201cheadless\u201d runtime that interprets and executes Java code with no console output.\n\nProcess Command Line RESULT / MITRE ATT&CK TTP cmd.exe \u201cC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\u201d \u25ba javaw.exe C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\MailQueue-Handler\\jdk-23.0.1\\bin\\javaw.exe -jar C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\MailQueue-Handler\\MailQueue-Handler.jar TA0011: Command and Control \u2013 T1090: Proxy\n\nVia the Java-based proxy in MailQueue-Handler.jar, the attacker identified the process ID for javaw.exe using the Windows Management Instrumentation command line utility (WMIC.exe). The attacker then changed the code page for the active console window to \u201c65001\u201d to allow UTF-8 encoding for multilingual input and output support.

The Python scripts launched were a set of backdoors.\n\nProcess Command Line RESULT/ MITRE ATT&CK TTP \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba\u25ba debug.exe \u201cC:\\ProgramData\\winter\\debug.exe\u201d C:\\ProgramData\\winter\\45_237_80.py TA0002: Execution \u2013 sT1059.001: PowerShell\n\nTA0011: Command and Control \u2013 T1071.001: Web Protocols\n\nTA0011: Command and Control \u2013 T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer\n\nMalware analysis\n\nThe Python code in the winter.zip payload used a lambda function (a short, anonymous throwaway function used in line with code) to obfuscate the rest of its script. That obfuscating lambda function matched those previously seen in FIN7-related Python malware loaders.\n\nTwo of the Python components (166_65.py and 45_237_80.py ) were copies of a publicly-available reverse SOCKS proxy called RPivot. Designed as a legitimate too for use by penetration testers, RPivot Each of these Python scripts used different IP addresses for their remote . These backdoors received commands from the remote connection over port 80. Another script (37_44.py) was an RPivot script used to connect to a Tor relay.\n\nAttribution\n\nSophos assesses with medium confidence that the Python malware used in this attack is connected to the threat actors behind FIN7/Sangria Tempest. The obfuscation method is identical to previous and FIN7 has been known to use the RPivot tool in attacks. However, we note that the obfuscation methods used are based on publicly available code, RPivot is also publicly available, and FIN7 has previously sold its tools to other cybercriminals.\n\nSTAC5777\n\nAs with STAC5143, a few individuals at targeted organizations have been bombarded with a massive amount of spam emails, followed by an inbound Microsoft Teams message from someone claiming to be with their internal IT team.\n\nThe Teams message\u2014from the adversaries responsible for the spam messages\u2014 requested a Teams call to resolve the spam issues. But unlike the STAC5143 incidents we\u2019ve observed, STAC5777 activity relied much more on \u201chands-on-keyboard\u201d actions and scripted commands launched by the threat actors directly than STAC5143.\n\nInitial access\n\nIn each of the incidents Sophos MDR documented, the adversary walked the user through the process of installing Microsoft Quick Assist over the Teams call. This was used to establish a remote session that gave the threat actor control over the targeted individual\u2019s device.\n\nOne of the customer estates had Sophos Office 365 integration configured, which allowed MDR to confirm the actor used an Office365 account \u2018helpdesk@llladminhlpll.onmicrosoft.com\u2019 from the IP address 78.46.67[.]201 to initiate these messages.\n\nThe threat actor walked the user through installing and executing the Microsoft remote access tool Quick Assist. The user was told to search for the application on the web, download it from the legitimate Microsoft website, and then launch it. They were then guided through granting the threat actor access to control the device remotely.\n\nFigure 3: Microsoft Teams activity initiated by threat actor controlling an external M365 tenant\n\nOnce in control of the device the actor leveraged a web browser to download the malicious payload. In one case, the payload was downloaded directly from the threat actor-controlled host. In the others, it was split into two payloads: kb641812-filter-pack-2024-1.dat and kb641812-filter-pack-2024-2.dat, subdomains of blob.core.windows[.]net (hosts associated with Microsoft Azure file storage services). They then combined the two .dat files into a named pack.zip and then decompressed that archive using the tar.exe archive utility.\n\nThis resulted in the creation of another archive file in the users\u2019 AppData directory at OneDriveUpdate\\upd2836a.bkt The threat actor then decompressed that file with writing files into the same \\OneDriveUpdate folder:\n\nThe legitimate, Microsoft-signed executable OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe\n\nUnsigned DLLs from the OpenSSL Toolkit (libcrypto-3-x64.dll and libssl-3-x64.dll), loaded by the OneDriveStandaloneUpdater executable\n\nA legitimate, signed copy of vcruntime140.dll, a Microsoft library required by OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe\n\nAn unknown DLL, winhttp.dll\n\nA file named settingsbackup.dat\n\nSophosLabs analyzed winhttp.dll and confirmed to be malicious. It had fake version metadata from a legitimate ESET file and had been renamed so it would be side-loaded into memory by the legitimate executable due to DLL search order hijacking. The DLL was capable of collecting:\n\nSystem and operating system details\n\nConfiguration information\n\nUser credentials\n\nKeystroke the Windows API functions GetKeyboardState, GetKeyState, and get_KeySize.\n\nSophosLabs could not determine the exact nature of the file settingsbackup.dat,\u2019 but we believe it be an encrypted payload read by the process running the side-loaded DLL and used as a 2nd stage loader.\n\nOnce the files had been placed onto the impacted host, Sophos MDR observed the threat actor opening a command prompt and making the following Windows registry change with the reg.exe utility:\n\nreg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\TitanPlus\" /v 1 /t REG_SZ /d \"185.190.251.16:443;207.90.238.52:443;89.185.80.86:443\" /f\n\nThe registry key entries provided the IP addresses used for the command-and-control connections made by the malicious winhttp.dll code.\n\nPersistence\n\nAfter making other configuration changes manually via a command shell over the Quick Assist connection and the initial execution of the legitimate \u2018OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe\u2019 binary, the attacker then executed a PowerShell command to create a service to automatically run the exploited executable. The PowerShell command also created a .lnk file for the executable in the devices\u2019 startup items folder to maintain persistence through reboot.\n\nExecution\n\nWhen executed, onedrivestandaloneupdate.exe side-loaded winhttp.dll, a loader carrying a backdoor. The loader read configuration information that had been entered by the attacker, including a file named settingsbackup.dat, and reached out to multiple IP addresses that had been added to the system\u2019s configuration manually by the threat actor.\n\nInitial Quick Access activity\n\nParent process Command line C:\\Windows\\System32\\RuntimeBroker.exe-Embedding C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\u201d -single-argument microsoft-edge:?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DQuick%2BAssist%26filte C:\\windows|system32\\svchost.exe-k netsvcs-p-s Appinfo C.\\Program Files|WindowsApps\\MicrosoftCorporationll.QuickAssist_2.0.32.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\Microsoft.RemoteAssistance.QuickAssist\\QuickAssist.exe C: \\windows\\Explorer.EXE C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe tar xf pack.zip -C \u201cC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OneDriveUpdate C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OneDriveUpdate\\OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe -Embedding\n\nCommand and Control\n\nUsing the unsigned OpenSSL toolkit drivers, the OneDriveStandaloneUpdate process made encrypted command-and-control connections to a set of remote hosts. The IP addresses of the hosts included a virtual private server operated by a hosting company used in the past by Russia-based threat actors.\n\nInitial execution of OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe connecting to C2 IP addresses\n\nProcess Action object cmd.exe start C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OneDriveUpdate\\OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe Binary file read C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OneDriveUpdate\\winhttp.dll loads image into memory C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OneDriveUpdate\\winhttp.dll File read C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData \\Local\\OneDriveUpdate\\settingsbackup.dat IP connects to 74.178.90[.]36:443 Ip connects to 195.123.241[.]24:443\n\nDiscovery\n\nOnce the C2 channel was established , the Sophos MDR team observed the OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe process conducting scanning with the SMB protocol to map online hosts within the customers\u2019 environment. The threat actor also scanned for Remote Desktop Protocol and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) hosts that the targeted user\u2019s credentials could be used to connect to within the network.\n\nLateral Movement\n\nUsing the targeted user\u2019s credentials, the threat actor made efforts to expand access beyond the initially compromised system, looking for domain access that could be elevated to move to other hosts. At one organization, they used a targeted individual\u2019s domain credentials to connect to the organization\u2019s VPN from outside the network and then to log into RDP hosts within the network. At another organization , they used Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to perform lateral movement.\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nIn one incident, Sophos MDR observed the threat actor using the backdoor to uninstall local multifactor authentication integration on the target device. In another, the threat actor unsuccessfully attempted to uninstall the Sophos Endpoint Agent\u2014an action blocked by Sophos\u2019 tamper protection.\n\nCredential gathering and data exfiltration\n\nPrior to containment, Sophos MDR also observed the actor accessing files locally via notepad.exe and Word that contained the word \u2018password\u2019 in the name of the document.\n\nIn one case, the threat actors used the utility mstsc.exe to access two Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) files to view and edit their configuration data, looking for potential credential storage.\n\nSophos MDR also observed the threat actors accessing a network diagram for one targeted organization drawn in Visio, most likely to plan further lateral movement and impact phases of the attack.\n\nImpact\n\nIn one case found in a threat hunt across all Sophos MDR customers, the threat actors attempted to execute Black Basta ransomware. This was blocked by Sophos endpoint protection.\n\nConclusions\n\nSophos has deployed detections for the malware used in these campaigns including:\n\nSTAC5143: ATK/RPivot-B, Python/Kryptic.IV, heuristic detection of Python malicious use of operating system libraries\n\nSTAC5777: Troj/Loader-DV for STAC5777\u2019s winhttp.dll\n\nHowever, organizations should take further steps to prevent attacks based on these tactics. First, unless absolutely necessary, organizations should ensure that their O365 service provisions restrict Teams calls from outside organizations or restrict that capability to trusted business partners. Additionally, remote access applications such as Quick Assist should be restricted by policy unless they are specifically used by the organization\u2019s technical support team. Sophos can block unwanted execution of Quick Assist through application control settings in endpoint protection.\n\nSophos strongly recommends use of Microsoft Office 365 integration with the security environment for monitoring of sources of potentially malicious inbound Teams or Outlook traffic.\n\nOrganizations should also raise employee awareness of these types of tactics\u2014these aren\u2019t the types of things that are usually covered in anti-phishing training. Employees should be aware of who their actual technical support team is and be mindful of tactics intended to create a sense of urgency that these sorts of social-engineering driven attacks depend upon.\n\nA list of indicators of compromise for these campaigns is available on the Sophos GitHub repository.",

            "content": "BRIAN KENNY: If you\u2019re a regular listener, you know that we\u2019ve tackled the topic of AI multiple times over the past year. And for good reason, it\u2019s a topic that is changing how we live and work in ways large and small. So, it won\u2019t surprise you to know that we aren\u2019t the only ones at Harvard Business School who are thinking about this. With that in mind, we\u2019d like to reshare an episode of Harvard Business School\u2019s Managing the Future of Work podcast, a show hosted by Professors Bill Kerr and Joe Fuller, that is all about the forces reshaping the nature of work. In this episode from February 2024, Bill Kerr talks to Jared Spataro of Microsoft, about how the tech giant is experimenting its way from AI assistants to autonomous agents as well as responsible AI, and upskilling. We thought this would be a great discussion to get you thinking about what AI has in store for us all in 2025. And if you have some thoughts on that, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Email us at: coldcall@hbs.edu.\n\nJARED SPATARO: It might sound counterintuitive, but one aspect of the propagation of AI innovation is absolutely the human element. People have to learn it. They have to learn not to be afraid of it. They have to learn that it can be beneficial for them as individuals and as, in the case of being a leader or manager, in those circumstances. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s emerged for me is, I would just say, \u201cHey, get after it. Get after it with alacrity, but don\u2019t try and jump over and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to transform our entire firm from the ground up by reinventing everything.\u2019\u201d That, I feel like, is unnecessary tumult.\n\nBILL KERR: It\u2019s early 2024, and generative AI is fast becoming pervasive. Its impact will be both earth-shattering and mundane. While many organizations are experimenting with it, few are yet making wholesale changes to take advantage of it. What\u2019s clear, though, is that AI will reshape the global economy and the world of work. The International Monetary Fund [IMF] estimates that 40 percent of jobs globally\u2014and 60 percent in advanced economies\u2014are exposed to elimination or change as a result of AI. The IMF also warns that the technology has the potential to increase inequality. And while AI is sparking innovation across the spectrum, dominant technology players have a distinct advantage in terms of their resources and market share. What can we expect from these leading suppliers of productivity tools as AI works its way through the enterprise and into our smart devices?\n\nWelcome to the Managing the Future of Work podcast from Harvard Business School. I\u2019m your host, Bill Kerr. My guest today is Jared Spataro, Corporate Vice President of Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft. We\u2019ll talk about how Microsoft internally and through its investments in OpenAI is AI-enabling its ubiquitous products\u2014from office apps to Teams collaboration software. We\u2019ll consider use cases and, crucially, how Microsoft sees organizations adapting business processes, jobs, and tasks, and managing the risks of the powerful technology. We\u2019ll talk about how the company is gearing up and skilling itself internally to carry out its AI strategy. And we\u2019ll look at the bigger picture of ethical and regulatory considerations. Jared, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJARED SPATARO: Great to be here. Thanks for having me, Bill.\n\nBILL KERR: Jared, why don\u2019t we start with a bit of your personal background and how you came to lead Modern Work and Business Applications at Microsoft?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Well, sure. I\u2019ve been here for a long time, 18 years at this point. And throughout my history at Microsoft, I\u2019ve always worked on what we\u2019ve called essentially our \u201cproductivity\u201d businesses\u2014so started with applications like Office and then over time has expanded into these areas like CRM [customer relationship management] and ERP [enterprise resource planning], kind of large areas where businesses are investing in technology. So it\u2019s given me a really nice rounded view of how businesses use technology to run their operations.\n\nBILL KERR: And with the pace of change being so fast right now, what\u2019s your personal strategy for keeping up to date with what AI is doing and how it might influence Microsoft\u2019s products?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Interestingly enough, I use AI to keep up to date, and that I think is going to become one of the themes that you\u2019ll hear from me in our conversation today. The pace of innovation, the pace of change, has picked up so much over the last few years that there\u2019s no way that humans can keep up with it on their own. The old pattern simply of scanning the news is far from adequate. So these days I use AI-based agents to help me keep up with AI-based agents. I think it\u2019s the only way to go.\n\nBILL KERR: Sound advice. And so maybe we\u2019ll ask you to continue and tell us, what are those agents saying are the biggest trends right now? And also, what might be around the horizon for us?\n\nJARED SPATARO: I tend to think of us being in an era that is characterized by AI as an assistant\u2014an assistant to individuals, an assistant to groups. You see it as a standalone assistant in products like ChatGPT and like Microsoft Copilot. You see it as an embedded assistant into many different applications. We see just about every software vendor on the planet building these assistants into their interfaces. But, increasingly, I think you\u2019ll see, with the explosion of these assistants, people scratching their head and saying, \u201cMan, I don\u2019t know which assistant to go to for what at this point. It\u2019s too much.\u201d And so I also anticipate that, in the coming months and years, we\u2019ll see some consolidation.\n\nBILL KERR: So, it\u2019s almost like a meta layer that\u2019s going to help crossing the chasm from the earliest users to the general mainstream and beyond.\n\nJARED SPATARO: That\u2019s right. I think the context is important. Almost 60 percent, based on our telemetry, of the average information worker\u2019s time is actually spent in communication and coordination just to do the rest of their job. So, for instance, it\u2019s in meetings or in chats, or it\u2019s used in email. And that percentage is growing month by month, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s flattening out. So what people actually tell us in the qualitative work that we\u2019ve done is that they say, \u201cMan, I hardly have time to do the job I was hired for.\u201d And that backdrop, that context, I think, is important, because the assistant era of AI is arriving just in time.\n\nBILL KERR: Yeah. Neither of us are going to be able to see the listeners, but I\u2019m sure a number of heads were nodding when you talked about the overload that some of these communication tasks have had for us. Is there any early data on the impact for individual productivity that comes with AI, generative AI tools?\n\nJARED SPATARO: I think that there are two data points that really stick out to me there. We\u2019ve asked users, for instance, \u201cAfter you have used, in particular, a product from Microsoft called Copilot, do you want to go back to working without it?\u201d And 77 percent of the people who had early access to Copilot as a product said, \u201cI never want to go back to working without it.\u201d The other one that has been particularly interesting in terms of sentiment is that the best users of Copilot are estimating that they save north of\u2014more than\u201410 hours per month. That said, anyone who\u2019s in business for a while knows that people lie, and they, in particular, really lie when they answer these types of surveys. So we\u2019ve done some work to just go in and actually run experiments, where we have groups that use the tool, Copilot, and then control groups that don\u2019t, and we give them a series of tasks working across a corpus of information. On average, users saved 29 percent of their time to get the work done, so they were 29 percent faster without any real degradation in quality. So that gives me hope. If you say, \u201cI can give you 30 percent of your time back,\u201d once you figure out how to use the tool across this broad swath of information-worker tasks, that\u2019s pretty attractive\u2014certainly attractive for individuals if they can harness the excess, the surplus, that\u2019s generated; very attractive for organizations as well.\n\nBILL KERR: Yeah. One of the things that a couple of academic experiments have also found is not only that productivity gain, but that it really accrues to the youngest workers or the newest to the job, that it really can flatten out parts of the experience curve. Is that something you\u2019ve also found?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Absolutely. We\u2019re very excited about that, because it does level the playing field. It helps people essentially close the gap that experience ends up giving. But we would like to get that same productivity boost even for experienced workers. So that\u2019s some of what we\u2019re digging into right now.\n\nBILL KERR: That\u2019s great. So tell us a little bit about how Microsoft is viewing AI. What\u2019s the strategy or the approach that it\u2019s taking toward it? How are you staging building AI into the many products and services of Microsoft?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Well, let\u2019s take a step back for a moment. For a large part of 2023, there was this sense that, \u201cOkay, I get it. You basically have a technology that can do things like summarize and answer basic questions.\u201d But what we have found during that last year was not only can it do some of those key skills, but we really believe that what we have here is a general-purpose reasoning engine. And I always pause for effect when I\u2019m talking with my customers about that, because we\u2019ve just never had that before. We have computers that essentially reason over math-based formulations of problems, because they\u2019re driven based on math, essentially. This is the first time that we have something that is a language-driven reasoning engine, and that\u2019s really important. As we look at the basic implications of that, it means that it can become an incredible natural language user interface that makes a lot of sense. You can speak to computing resources going forward. But even more important than that, what we have found is that there\u2019s a pattern that has emerged that many of our listeners will have heard of that\u2019s called \u201cRAG\u201d\u2014retrieval-augmented generation\u2014and it essentially says this: \u201cIf you ask me a question, and you give me essentially a \u201cscoop\u201d\u2014a bucket full of data\u2014to reference as I answer that question, I can take the reference data and reason across that reference data to get you the right answer,\u201d as long as the right answer is in that bucket full of data, we call that a \u201ccontext window,\u201d and that pattern is retrieval-augmented generation. It\u2019s become, from my perspective, the single biggest advance for business that we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months. It\u2019s very, very significant, and it means that you can take these large language models as they continue to get better and better at reasoning and really have them reason over your data, your finance data, your HR data, any type of data to help you make decisions. And that\u2019s a very exciting area of innovation right now in business with generative AI.\n\nBILL KERR: Wow, and that seems very transformative. You talked about saving time, getting those 10 hours back for yourself, which I\u2019m sure everyone wants. But the capacity to have that superpower come toward your actual meaningful work, the things that you\u2019re doing to learn from the data, seems significant. Do you also anticipate that level of improvement in the productivity of the work itself?\n\nJARED SPATARO: We do. I noted earlier that we\u2019re in this assistant generation, where we\u2019re all about helping people\u2014I would call it, almost incrementally improves their performance, their productivity. But the next generation moves us out of just individuals, and even small groups, into process-oriented\u2014maybe you could even call it \u201cfunction-oriented\u201d\u2014productivity. Many of the processes that are so common and so core to the way a firm operates today can be automated. So closing the books at quarter\u2019s end totally can be automated. Reviewing sales pipeline, that can be automated. Answering customer questions, even finding the next best thing to do with customers, even unearthing the right people to target for new customers, all that can be automated. And much of that work\u2014because it requires a logical progression, a reasoning over data\u2014is done by people today. So that second generation, we believe, really moves us into process automation, where we do start to get some pretty important gains\u2014not at the individual level, but at the functional level, in terms of how work is getting done. So, again, we start to see this technology used in an increasingly sophisticated way to drive returns.\n\nBILL KERR: Another area that I know you\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is collaboration. So tell us about how you\u2019re seeing AI\u2019s next generation toward collaborative work, recognizing the process functions that you were just describing have some element of collaboration, but there\u2019s many things that would be cross-functional that would also be collaborative.\n\nJARED SPATARO: Interestingly enough, what we\u2019ve seen these digital tools do over the course of, let\u2019s call it, the last two decades, is that, at the individual level, they have driven quite a bit of productivity. A spreadsheet is a great example. It helps me do things that I otherwise would\u2019ve taken days to do in sometimes minutes, sometimes seconds. But the downside to them speaking as a purveyor of these tools is that they\u2019ve made it incredibly easy, frictionless even, has been our claim\u2014and it\u2019s really true\u2014to communicate with other people. And although that sounds like nirvana, we are over-communicating. We are communicating, and in some ways coordinating, too much. If a person has a question, instead of going to yet another person to ask the question, they could go to a bank of answers or an AI agent that would understand what\u2019s happening across the firm, it actually would significantly improve what the efficiency of the overall processes would be. So one aspect of what we\u2019re trying to do is actually get people out of the business of just having to service other people in very mundane ways. Think of how much time we spend servicing our inbox. One of the things we could do for collaboration, interestingly enough, is reduce how much we have to go to each other for some of the mundane aspects of work where we could be much more efficient.\n\nBILL KERR: Well, let\u2019s just continue on the other use cases for meetings. What are some of the pieces you\u2019re envisioning for the future workplace and office?\n\nJARED SPATARO: There are two aspects to meetings that have caught our attention over the last couple of years. The first is that the in-meeting experience can be much more efficient than it is. What we find with experiments and research is that, when meetings are facilitated by skilled humans who really know how to run a meeting, they are much, much more effective. They\u2019re much better at reaching, for instance, decisions or pursuing outcomes. But the problem is, not everybody\u2019s a skilled meeting facilitator, even though that\u2019s a core part of what many information workers do every day. So one of the most exciting use cases that I\u2019ve been involved in is building, essentially, a copilot for a meeting that actually helps the meeting to be more effective than it otherwise could be, playing the role again of that skilled human facilitator. And the fact is, we just don\u2019t have enough of those folks. We don\u2019t hire them. It\u2019s not a job that we do. But it is a job that AI can do very well. Then, over the course of the pandemic, we saw meetings explode. So the time in meetings actually doubled for the average Teams user, the user of Microsoft Teams. And we saw large meetings start to balloon. More and more people are joining meetings\u2014sometimes as a fly on the wall, sometimes to hear that five minutes of an hour-long meeting that is pertinent to their job. So the after-meeting experience\u2014making it easier for people to not attend a meeting, but instead get the value that they would need out of the interactions\u2014that\u2019s incredibly important. You ask Copilot, \u201cWhat decisions were made? What did David say? What did David and Sally talk about when it comes to this topic?\u201d It can extract all of that out and summarize that. So those two things. I think meeting-goers should rejoice as they think about what AI is going to be able to do for them, but they\u2019ll have to learn how to use the tech.\n\nBILL KERR: Yeah, Jared. I agree that there\u2019s far too many meetings at my employer and I\u2019m sure at many other employers. There\u2019s also a function or a role of meetings that\u2019s not just about coordinating on a solution. It\u2019s about all coming to terms that this is the way that we\u2019re going to go forward and soliciting buy-in, and there\u2019s these extra things. And as you think about a future that\u2019s going to have more of this AI collaborative role in organizing stuff, do you anticipate that there is going to be resistance from people that will look at the outcome and say, \u201cWait a minute, that\u2019s not what I would\u2019ve agreed to or bought in\u201d? Will we also learn to lean in more on these types of prompts and directions for seeing the path forward?\n\nJARED SPATARO: I think what these tools will do is that they will shine more of a spotlight onto the why of a meeting\u2014\u201cWhy are we having this meeting, why have we invited the people that we\u2019ve invited?\u201d And it will take some time. That has been one of my biggest observations is, as the technology makes us in some ways much more proficient, maybe much more able to dig into the details of our work, then it does push us to, not gloss over those details any longer, but really ensure that we\u2019re surfacing them. So to be very specific, I think there are meetings where it\u2019s about building consensus and support around a particular direction. But we often don\u2019t say that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re meeting. And I think we\u2019re going to start to want to state that, \u201cHey, this is a build-energy meeting,\u201d or, \u201cThis is a build\u2013buy-in meeting.\u201d \u201cWe want you to come, and that\u2019s the reason we want you to come.\u201d I haven\u2019t seen too many meeting invites that start that way.\n\nBILL KERR: Yeah. Jared, there\u2019s another layer of this, which is in-person meetings versus virtual Teams-based meetings. I mean, clearly AI could play a role in both of those. Is that just an extra dimension to this, or would the technology almost prefer us to be in one format or another?\n\nJARED SPATARO: What\u2019s very interesting to me is the technology can help us bridge that gap. So as an example, some of the things we\u2019ve been experimenting with is watching, when it looks as though people who are online and not in person want to actually participate in the conversation but are having a hard time, a simple prompt that says, \u201cHey, John\u2019s had his hand up now for five minutes, and nobody\u2019s paying attention to him,\u201d can help get the attention of people who are in a room who are quite engaged, understandably with each other, because there\u2019s all sorts of very rich cues and clues going on there in person, physically. I think we\u2019ll start to see these intelligent meeting moderators pop up as a real best practice.\n\nBILL KERR: One of the areas that you\u2019ve talked about is the difference between technical and adaptive business problems. Can you unpack that distinction for us and tell us about the role of AI and managers in addressing them?\n\nJARED SPATARO: You bet. Adaptive leadership, in times of change, identifies that there are basically two types of business problems that employees face. One is what has been labeled \u201ctechnical\u201d business problems, and these are problems that have been solved before, where essentially there is a state of the art. A lot of operational problems tend to be technical, even in things like healthcare. Things that become routine surgeries over time become technical. There\u2019s a whole host of technical problems out there. Then you turn over into what has been labeled through the research \u201cadaptive\u201d problems. This is in many ways where employers are stepping into a new domain or a domain where there\u2019s a lot of innovation or change. It\u2019s not as well charted. You can\u2019t just find an expert. And here, there\u2019s a different set of skills that are required. It\u2019s a bit more test and learn. It might seem a little bit tentative, but the tentativeness, actually, has changed into a faster cycle time, because you take a step forward and evaluate, take another step forward and evaluate. It\u2019s a good way of describing what we\u2019re experiencing right now with AI. Some customers are approaching this era of AI as if it were a technical problem. But the truth is, I think that approach is going to fail. It\u2019s too incremental. I like to think of it as, essentially, the industrial revolution for information work. I think it\u2019ll be that impactful. That\u2019s the definition of what we just talked about as an adaptive challenge or problem.\n\nBILL KERR: Yeah. It\u2019s a great segue into thinking about the span of organizations that will be the pre-AI firm. Then there\u2019s going to be AI assisted. Then there\u2019s going to be semi-autonomous agents. And then you can go to some of the more integrated functional AI that you described a little bit earlier. And obviously Microsoft as a company has long served companies all across the technology spectrum\u2014from very limited technology to some of the most advanced. What\u2019s the vision you\u2019re having or the landscape that you\u2019re anticipating in terms of organizations across the spectrum? If you\u2019re with one of the companies that\u2019s new to this game, early stages, what do you typically suggest is the next experiment that the company should run\u2014how they should test reconfiguring jobs? How do they get started moving further down the path?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Right now, I\u2019m seeing three generations. Generation One is about these assistants for individuals and groups. It requires a reworking of what you might call \u201cmuscle memory\u201d in terms of how core tasks are done. It drives pretty substantial incremental productivity. Gen Two for me ends up being process automation and, in particular, as we talked about process automation focused on functions\u2014so in the finance function, in the marketing function, in the sales function. We\u2019re starting to see innovation there. These things really matter in the efficiency of the firm. And then Gen Three, we haven\u2019t quite gotten there yet, but as you indicated, this is the place where you start to get semi-autonomous agents that are running at what I call the \u201cfirm level.\u201d I think of it as enterprise transformation. You have semi-autonomous agents that are working across functions that are now starting to interact directly with your customers on your behalf, that come back to humans when they reach, essentially, a place that they\u2019ve been told, \u201cHey, it\u2019s material enough. I want you to get human input.\u201d And this is an interesting place to be. It\u2019s a future that\u2019s not too far off, not nearly as far off as people might think it would be, and it really is, from my perspective, a reconfiguring of the firm. If I were to then hit your second question, \u201cGosh, if people are just getting started, what should they do?\u201d I would say be careful not to try and jump the generations. It is important to gain experience, to gain skill, to gain a sense of how these things are impacting your industry, your business, and that might sound a little strange coming from a technology vendor who seems to want to sell everything to everyone all at once. But this stepwise evolution of understanding how AI can help your business, I\u2019m finding as I observe different businesses and different industries operate, is actually really important.\n\nBILL KERR: I suppose this wouldn\u2019t be too different from other technologies, but I\u2019m struck by, with generative AI, both how simple and user-friendly it can be, in the sense of someone that barely knows anything about computers and technology can understand the prompt, ask questions, and particularly have some kind of input into their workplace\u2014over to some of the most complicated frontier-type conversations that one can also hear related to the technology. Do you have a sense of how much is going to come and try to meet individual workers where they are, versus the workers are going to have to significantly revise their skill set in order to participate in what lies ahead?\n\nJARED SPATARO: I think it\u2019s an \u201cand.\u201d I think we\u2019ll see both. But if I talk about our company strategy for a moment, we have really picked some of the mundane cases that are remarkably or surprisingly interesting for users. So having an assistant within your Outlook email client, as an example, that helps you go through your email, that\u2019s very mundane, but it\u2019s incredibly delightful: \u201cHere\u2019s a summary of this long thread and what I\u2019d recommend you do next.\u201d The first time I read that, I thought, \u201cOh my goodness, gosh, I\u2019m not going to do email without this.\u201d The same can be said as you move into something like Excel or Word, where you are analyzing numbers or trying to start with a blank sheet and write things. An assistant there that can help you get started or help you dive deep into the numbers is incredibly useful. We\u2019re also trying to innovate in experiences that allow you to pull with that pattern of RAG\u2014retrieval-augmented generation\u2014across a whole set of data so you can have really sophisticated, very deep conversations about a domain. But what\u2019s interesting here is, I have to teach people as I\u2019m working with them, I have to teach them, \u201cBoy, you have to think of this almost as if it were a human on the other side and talk about the domain as if it were a human,\u201d recognize it\u2019s not a one-shot pattern like we often see in search\u2014you put in a keyword and hope it works\u2014but instead, you ask a question, something comes back, you redirect it a little bit. The multi-turn, multi-step nature of the process is part of what\u2019s required to get sophisticated answers and to really get value. So we see it all, but we\u2019re not at all shy about starting with the mundane, because we think there will be real benefits by starting there.\n\nBILL KERR: And Jared, just continuing on that\u2014and we\u2019ll use the email curation as a great example\u2014you can imagine that there are individuals within the workplace who have preferences, and they can adjust various things about their Outlook structure and how they approach the email. There might also be corporate-level requests, especially if it starts to get into the collaboration elements or the things that go beyond individual productivity. Is there a way that you calibrate that to environments and to the work that a firm is doing? Or what\u2019s the approach to handling those different perspectives on how we might best curate the email in an employee\u2019s inbox?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Well, after people start to use the tool with email\u2014if I just get really specific for a moment\u2014they typically will have two reactions. And this is coming up over and over. Number one, they start to really get curious about how powerful it is. So they\u2019ll start to say, \u201cWell, wait a second. I sequentially go through email every day, and people shove stuff in my inbox. What if I change my pattern, and every hour I just ask AI, \u2018What are the three most important things that have landed in email, and what do you think I should do about them?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s a totally different mindset. It typically changes people\u2019s way of interacting with their inbox. Copilot is very good at it. It knows who your manager is. It can flag those things. It understands who a customer is, so, \u201cHey, a customer just wrote to you,\u201d it\u2019s good at actually giving you its perspective on what\u2019s important that has landed in your inbox. Then it gets even more exciting when it can give its perspective on how you should answer: \u201cHey, your boss just wrote you. He asked if you\u2019re on Project XYZ, and I see that you\u2019ve had several meetings. Do you want me to summarize what\u2019s going on real quick and give you a draft of how you could respond to him?\u201d That starts to get very exciting for people. So that is one pattern that I see happening. Then the second thing that I\u2019m seeing is that you actually change the use of your tool. A lot of email traffic that we see particularly within a firm is just questions. \u201cHey, Susie. Can you send that over to me?\u201d \u201cHey, Brian. I remember that you mentioned something two days ago in a meeting. Can you remind me where you found that?\u201d And today we\u2019re finding that Copilot can help you cut through that. You don\u2019t have to go to the person any longer, so it actually can have the effect of reducing email. So those are the types of things that we\u2019re seeing. People are just starting to use it to adapt to their own workflow, but they\u2019re also changing that flow of work as they learn what the technology is capable of.\n\nBILL KERR: With such significant change, can you tell us how Microsoft is internally approaching the restructuring and the reskilling that it needs to do in order to have an effective AI strategy and to compete for customers in a very AI-influenced economy? What\u2019s happening inside the organization?\n\nJARED SPATARO: There basically are two prongs to it. Number one, we have aggressively rolled out our own AI assistant called Copilot to every function, every employee, and we\u2019re just asking them, \u201cHey, get proficient.\u201d We\u2019re providing a lot of coaching in that content, but we\u2019re also creating small groups, because we find that the viral nature of learning how to use the tool is really important. So we start with this very horizontal use case. You might be in finance, you might be in sales. \u201cHey, here\u2019s a tool. Here are some immediate ways you can use it in your job. Please get started, and tell us what you\u2019re learning.\u201d That\u2019s step one. Step two is that then we have worked within the functions to just identify specific business problems, where we can say, \u201cGosh, it feels like AI should be able to help us out here. Why don\u2019t we run a pilot and actually see\u2014again, with control groups that aren\u2019t using the technology and groups that learn to use it in different ways\u2014and see if there are places that we can gain efficiencies.\u201d We\u2019ve seen some of our best results, particularly in customer service here, because that\u2019s so essentially information intensive and answering and solving people\u2019s questions. And we\u2019ve started to see some good results in sales, as well. Again, there\u2019s this matching the customer and their needs to what we have to sell them, and we\u2019re doing more and more. Each function is learning how to become AI practitioners, is the way we think about it. But that one-two punch of horizontal and then functionally based pilots focused on specific problems, that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it. And what\u2019s interesting is, it\u2019s very natural skilling. Rather than \u201ctime out, the coach blows the whistle. We\u2019re all going to take a day and take a YouTube-based AI training course,\u201d people are learning based on their real jobs, the content of their jobs, and they\u2019re being rewarded for being innovative and demonstrating that AI is making a difference in those jobs.\n\nBILL KERR: It sounds like your prescription to organizations a little bit earlier\u2014that they not leapfrog or attempt to leapfrog various waves of this, but instead go through the waves, because that\u2019s going to be the most natural way for employees to learn how to handle the new technology.\n\nJARED SPATARO: That\u2019s right. It might sound counterintuitive, but one aspect of the propagation of AI innovation is absolutely the human element. People have to learn it. They have to learn not to be afraid of it. They have to learn that it can be beneficial for them as individuals and as, in the case of being a leader or manager, in those circumstances. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s emerged for me is, I would just say, \u201cHey, get after it. Get after it with alacrity, but don\u2019t try and jump over and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to transform our entire firm from the ground up by reinventing everything.\u201d That, I feel like, is unnecessary tumult.\n\nBILL KERR: In addition to your internal work, you also have a significant investment in and collaboration with OpenAI. Can you tell us a bit about how the organizations connect on their technology and strategy?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Our relationship with OpenAI is one of the most significant relationships that we have had for many years. It has allowed us to create a partnership that I think has pushed the envelope of AI in ways that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be possible. They had amazing ideas. They turned those ideas into amazing technology. But the reality of it is, they needed real computing resources to see if their ideas and technology could be scaled in a way that would change the world. And that\u2019s where I think Microsoft and OpenAI have been such a good combination. Building on top of what we think of as the world\u2019s supercomputer with Azure, they\u2019ve been able to scale their ideas in a way that have demonstrated, first with the introduction of ChatGPT\u2014\u201cWow, there\u2019s something here. This is not the AI that we\u2019ve seen incrementally progress over the last couple of decades. This feels like a discontinuity, like something new has happened.\u201d And we\u2019re particularly proud of what we see from OpenAI as they continue to push the limits of innovation. We saw in 2022, as an example, that they realized that people wanted to now start to use ChatGPT in particular domains, and so they created the idea of GPTs, which was in some ways the app equivalent to the iPhone moment. It was this idea of, if you have a platform, how do you start to build on that platform for very specific scenarios and use cases? So as I work with them, as I see us using their technology and them using what we have to provide through infrastructure, it just feels like a really natural, complementary relationship. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working to make sure that it continues to be for us.\n\nBILL KERR: Jared, we spent a lot of time on the productivity advantages and the amazing use cases that will be in the future. Of course, there\u2019s also risks, and there\u2019s ethical considerations and so forth. So I know that\u2019s an enormous set of topics, but can you share a little bit about how you team is approaching these questions toward the office workplace? And what\u2019s the role of Microsoft, versus industry-wide and government in the future here?\n\nJARED SPATARO: AI is incredibly powerful, but we tend to think of it as a neutral technology, meaning it can be used for good, and it can be used for bad. And so we are trying to take steps in the form of what we call our \u201cresponsible AI initiatives\u201d to ensure that we are really doing everything we can to have it be used for good. So a couple of areas that are important to us: In responsible AI, for instance, we have provided a number of tools that allow us to be much more transparent about the training and about essentially the substance of the foundational models. So you can take a look. People are often worried about bias in those foundational models. They\u2019re trained on particular sources of information, a particular body of information, and we want them to feel good about what\u2019s there. And so we do a lot of work broadly with different aspects of society to do that. We also take special precautions within, for us, our instantiations of these AI assistants\u2014so, in particular, with Copilot. You can think of Copilot as being an orchestrator of powerful, large-language foundational models, and then the inputs that we\u2019re getting from the business. And in that orchestration layer, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work to make sure that we\u2019re catching, trapping for things that we just don\u2019t think are appropriate. So as an example, in a meeting, Copilot can answer questions about, \u201cWhat did Sally say in this meeting? What were her key points?\u201d But you can certainly ask Copilot questions like, \u201cDo you think Sally\u2019s smart? Do you think Sally knows what she\u2019s doing? Should I listen to Sally?\u201d And we trap for those types of value-oriented questions so that we\u2019re making sure we just catch them and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m an AI assistant. You\u2019re going to have to make that determination on yourself. Here are some of the facts coming from the interaction that I can give you as you think about them.\u201d So that orchestration layer for us is very important. We try to do work both at the LLM [large language model] layer and at that orchestration layer, and we\u2019re trying to engage with every facet of society. We\u2019ve done some work with organized labor that\u2019s just kicking off. We certainly are very engaged with governments all around the world, and we understand it\u2019s very important to allow every facet of society to have their input with this very powerful technology.\n\nBILL KERR: I\u2019m sure some of our listeners would love to hear just a couple more sentences about the link to or pilots with organized labor. Tell us about that.\n\nJARED SPATARO: Well, organized labor, of course, is in this place where they\u2019re always interested in the evolution of the tools that affect the labor pool, the workforce, and I think what we have seen over the years is sometimes innovation ignores the fact that humans have certain skills, that they do real jobs today. Innovation tends to say, \u201cHey, over the long run, it all works out for us.\u201d And at Microsoft, we\u2019re really trying to take an approach and say, \u201cYeah, over the long run, for sure, but what about in the short run?\u201d There certainly will be displacement, there will be the need for skilling. And instead of trying to treat that as something that we do after the fact, we\u2019ve actually proactively gone to work with the AFL-CIO, as an example, and put in place agreements that say, \u201cHere are the types of things we\u2019d like to work with you on.\u201d So some of the initiatives include, for instance, making sure that we take time from our product groups to get input from them, show them the technology, and get input, and also take time to work on skilling with them, as well. Ultimately, if we do this right, we definitely think of this as very accretive to society. Even in the short term with displacement, there is so much goodness, so much work that can be done. But we think the best approach, the best model for us, is engagement. Let\u2019s engage, particularly with labor, in the case of your question, so that we can work on it together.\n\nBILL KERR: Microsoft already has, of course, a number of certifications around its products that it offers, and as we think about all the technology change ahead, do you anticipate that those types of microcredentials will become more in play, something that a number of vendors are going to be trying to use as ways of helping workers make the next jump?\n\nJARED SPATARO: Absolutely. I think there\u2019s a bigger conversation around what\u2019s happening to education all across the world. Snackable content in business settings has definitely become the norm. And while that\u2019s become the norm in the economic context, we still see education largely as these big set piece courses and semesters and schools. So there\u2019s definitely room, I think, for disruption here. If we just zoom in for a moment on AI, it will be imperative from my perspective to make sure that materials are just in time, that they\u2019re delivered in a way that\u2019s very consumable. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been given this assistant, this Copilot. What do I do with it? What\u2019s the first thing I do with it?\u201d And the good news is, our consumer lives have shaped our expectations about how we consume content. And so, rather than fight that, our perspective, our approach, is that we\u2019re going to go right with that. We\u2019re going to adapt to those models and patterns. In addition to that, one of the really important things that we found is the product, itself, needs to be able to help users learn how to use it. And so, creating ways for the product to say, \u201cHey, it looks like you asked this question. But did you know, if you did this, you\u2019d get a better outcome?\u201d That may seem simple, but you can teach people how to use it. And one very simple example of that is some work that we\u2019re doing with almost a \u201cMad Libs\u201d style of prompt engineering. Prompt engineering and telling people they need to write sophisticated prompts or queries for an AI assistant is one thing, but we\u2019re finding that everybody knows how to do Mad Libs, so we essentially can put a three- to five-sentence prompt there with blanks to fill in and allow people to fill in those blanks and then see it work across the own data. You only have to do that one or two times before you realize, \u201cOkay, I got this. I can figure out how to do this.\u201d So it\u2019s a very simple example of how we take simplicity, weave it into the experience, and then we think we can drive the right outcome.\n\nBILL KERR: That\u2019s amazing. I want to maybe end this with one thought or projection of yours going toward the future. You\u2019ve been at Microsoft almost 20 years, which would\u2019ve had you land there right about a year or two before the iPhone and all the smartphone revolution was going to take off. As you think about all the changes happened over the last roughly 20 years, versus what\u2019s going to happen toward the future, do you think what we\u2019re looking at ahead is the same as the last 20? Is it more? How do you envision the next 20 years unfolding?\n\nJARED SPATARO: I think it\u2019s much more significant. In fact, I\u2019d say this, if you go look at what economists have been studying is almost a little bit of an enigma related to productivity. They have wondered, \u201cGosh, we put so much information technology into firms, into the macroeconomic environment. Why don\u2019t we see productivity just through the roof? Why hasn\u2019t it changed things?\u201d That\u2019s been one of the really big questions for economists over the last couple of decades. My answer would be, because we are getting ready for this moment right now, a lot of the information technology we put in place has been about getting our data state in order. It\u2019s been about starting to work in digital ways. Even during the pandemic, we saw an incredible increase in human interactions essentially being what we call \u201cdigitally mediated.\u201d It\u2019s a fancy way of saying, \u201cWe now meet online.\u201d All of that matters, though, because it lays the foundation for AI to work to reason across that data. So in so many ways, when I\u2019m meeting with leaders of all types across the world, I say, \u201cMan, everything we\u2019ve done over the course of the last 50 years in information technology is working up to this moment.\u201d And this moment is literally the industrial revolution for information work. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll see. We will reconfigure firms, we will, with this technology, reconfigure the way organizations work, and because of that, we\u2019ll reconfigure entire economies.

That means that, going forward, Microsoft gets first choice over whether to host OpenAI\u2019s AI workloads in the cloud \u2014 but if Microsoft can\u2019t meet its needs, OpenAI can go to a rival cloud provider.\n\n\u201cOpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post. \u201cTo further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has blamed a lack of available compute for delaying its products, and compute capacity has reportedly become a source of tension between the AI company and Microsoft, its close collaborator and major investor. In June, Microsoft, under shareholder pressure, permitted OpenAI to ink a deal with Oracle for additional capacity.\n\nIn the blog post, Microsoft reiterated that \u201ckey elements\u201d of its long-standing partnership with OpenAI remain in place through 2030, including its access to OpenAI\u2019s IP, revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusivity on OpenAI\u2019s APIs.\n\nThat assumes, of course, that OpenAI doesn\u2019t achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) under the two companies\u2019 agreed-upon definition before then. When OpenAI develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits, Microsoft will lose access to the company\u2019s technology, according to a reported agreement between the firms.\n\nOpenAI is said to be considering nullifying the agreement in a possible bid to secure more Microsoft funding.\n\n\u201cThe OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure and is also available through the Azure OpenAI Service,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cThis agreement means customers benefit from having access to leading models on Microsoft platforms and direct from OpenAI.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI and Microsoft for more information and will update this post if we hear back.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "content": "At Microsoft, our developers, HR professionals, marketers, sellers, and many other employees are the company\u2019s Customer Zero. As such, they use our products and services first and more fully than most other customers. Their feedback is sent to our product groups, who use it to make our products better for customers.\n\n\u201cOne of the best parts of leading Microsoft Digital is getting to be Customer Zero for our latest products,\u201d says Nathalie D\u2019Hers, corporate vice president for Microsoft Digital, the company\u2019s IT organization. \u201cIt\u2019s always gratifying to see our insights and ideas reflected in the final products, and I\u2019m especially proud of the work we\u2019ve done with Viva Amplify, which will bring a new level of innovation and efficiency to communicators.\u201d\n\nTo get our virtuous Customer Zero cycle right, we must communicate well with our employees\u2014this is why our internal IT Communications team has been rethinking everything they do.\n\n\u201cYour employees won\u2019t get behind you if you don\u2019t bring them in at the right time with the right info,\u201d D\u2019Hers says. \u201cWe\u2019re reinventing the way we do internal IT communications, and it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nGetting communications right is critical. It fosters collaboration, empowers individuals, and drives business growth. At Microsoft, we recognize that getting communications right is not just a necessary skill, but a strategic advantage. It enables us to align our teams, engage our customers, and ultimately, deliver innovative solutions that transform people\u2019s lives. \u2014Nathalie D\u2019Hers, corporate vice president, Microsoft Digital\n\nOur IT Communications team and all communicators at the company are preparing to use Microsoft Viva Amplify to get their messages to our employees. Viva Amplify is our new communications platform that we\u2019re starting to roll out in September 2023.\n\n[Learn more about our role as Microsoft\u2019s Customer Zero. Find out how we\u2019re evolving our culture with Microsoft Viva. See how we\u2019re using Minecraft to teach our employees healthy hybrid meeting habits.]\n\nInform and inspire\n\nThe core job of our IT Communications team is to disseminate product updates and productivity guidance to our employees while gathering valuable feedback from them. The team\u2019s goal is to drive product adoption, improve employee engagement, productivity, and to foster increased customer empathy in product development groups.\n\n\u201cGetting communications right is critical,\u201d D\u2019Hers says. \u201cIt fosters collaboration, empowers individuals, and drives business growth. At Microsoft, we recognize that getting communications right is not just a necessary skill, but a strategic advantage. It enables us to align our teams, engage our customers, and ultimately, deliver innovative solutions that transform people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nHaving a well-crafted strategy is essential for achieving effective communication. The IT Communications team lives by the guiding communication pillars of informing and inspiring employees and encouraging innovation.\n\n\u201cInform\u201d calls on Microsoft communicators to not only educate employees about new product features and capabilities, but to discuss the importance of what\u2019s changing and trying new products out.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure people at Microsoft know about, embrace, and influence technology changes at Microsoft. To do that, we provide critical information about technologies developed within Microsoft to employees,\u201d says Diana McCarty, a principal group content program manager and the leader of Microsoft\u2019s IT Communications team. \u201cFrom the start, we\u2019ve tried to be methodical in our planning and creative and flexible in our communication approaches to mitigate internal audience burnout.\u201d\n\nAvoiding burnout is a vital part of \u201cinform,\u201d as employees can feel fatigued by the amount of messaging directed at them at work. To do so, the IT Communications team employs user-centric messaging, which focuses on using different channels to reach people where they are in ways that are clear and concise. The other key element in user-centric messaging is providing an answer to the crucial question of \u201cwhy\u201d that comes up during transitions.\n\nWe feel that Microsoft employees are consumers\u2014they are our Customer Zero. And, like external consumers, they want content that is inspiring. \u2014Susanne Smith, principal content PM manager, IT Communications team, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cSo often in IT communications, you\u2019re told to update or to move to a new system,\u201d says Susanne Smith, a principal content PM manager on the IT Communications team in Microsoft Digital. \u201cBut at times you don\u2019t get great context as to why that\u2019s important so the change can feel arbitrary. Often, the \u201cwhy\u201d is that we are Customer Zero and test our products internally before we release them externally. But we also focus on what\u2019s in it for our employees and their productivity.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft views employees as its first customers, and this is where the \u201cinspire\u201d communication pillar comes to life.\n\n\u201cWe feel that Microsoft employees are consumers\u2014they are our Customer Zero,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAnd, like external consumers, they want content that is inspiring.\u201d\n\nThe IT Communications team looks for ways to give employees a reason to smile, and to provide moments that make employees feel valued and connected. \u201cThat\u2019s something that our team has really been focused on in the last couple of years\u2014to create delightful marketing,\u201d Smith says.\n\nChange, particularly technology change, can be intimidating. Communications that are quirky, clever, and fun\u2014when appropriate\u2014invite employees to embrace the moment, get involved, and maybe see themselves working in a new way.\n\nBeing innovative within those pillars is also important. This involves incorporating feedback, and the two-way communication function that the IT Communications team carries out between internal customers and product teams.\n\n\u201cThe innovation aspect is vital,\u201d McCarty says. \u201cWe work with product and deployment teams to roll out new technologies. As we receive feedback from our internal customers, we send this back to the product teams\u2014and often, features are added or altered using the feedback to create better end-user experiences.\u201d\n\nInnovation also happens within the IT Communications team. A top priority for the team is to keep finding new ways to get the word out about changes in technology, to try different approaches, and incorporate new communication tools and channels, like AI and Microsoft Viva Amplify.\n\nDriving product adoption and engagement\n\nIf you make adopting new products interesting to employees, they\u2019ll work with you.\n\n\u201cWe are guardians of employee experience within new products,\u201d says Eva Etchells, a program manager on the IT Communications team. \u201cWe advocate for the employee experience to ensure that products properly serve the intended audience. We also drive product adoption by making new technologies interesting and relevant to employees.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that products serve the intended target market, Etchells and other members of the IT Communications team test new products themselves and share them with employees who want to be the first to try out new products.\n\nThe team has also carved out a role as an \u201cask desk\u201d within the company on Microsoft Viva Engage. Answering questions, helping their peers work through issues with new technology, and connecting them with the Helpdesk when necessary allows them to nurture relationships and build rapport with employees who are willing to try out the very earliest builds of new products.\n\nEmployees are busy, and there are always a lot of messages coming at them in their daily work. Capturing attention is a key focus for us as communicators trying to drive adoption. \u2014Eva Etchells, program manager, IT Communications team, Microsoft Digital\n\nThe IT Communications team also stays in close contact with product development teams, testers, and others charged with gathering product feedback so they know what\u2019s coming next and can adapt messaging to reflect or influence employee sentiment.\n\nThis isn\u2019t easy. Cultivating interest in testing new products presents difficulties\u2014this is where the team emphasizes how impactful being an early adopter is.\n\n\u201cEmployees are busy, and there are always a lot of messages coming at them in their daily work,\u201d Etchells says. \u201cCapturing attention is a key focus for us as communicators trying to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nReinventing how we communicate with employees\n\nTo get Microsoft employees interested in new products, the team starts with meeting employees where they are in their day-to-day activities. Using Microsoft Viva Engage for announcements and news provides a seamless, social media-like experience integrated into employees\u2019 daily routines, eliminating the sense of it being an additional task.\n\nMicrosoft Viva Engage is an employee experience tool that\u2019s part of the larger Microsoft Viva platform\u2014with some aspects available within Microsoft 365\u2014that enables organizations to foster employee engagement and collaboration through a centralized digital space for communication, announcements, and social interactions. When it comes to convincing employees to make the jump and test out new products, the team reaches back to their \u201cinspire\u201d communication pillar. Often, this translates to finding the right marketing angle.\n\n\u201cTo encourage employees to incorporate something new into their schedule, we prioritize making our content engaging and demonstrating empathy towards employee interests,\u201d says Sarah Lundy, a senior program manager on the IT Communications team. \u201cViva Engage is one of the most powerful tools we use to do this.\u201d\n\nThe Microsoft Viva employee experience platform, for example, was set up as a tool that can help employees increase their internal visibility across the company, which in turn can help them advance their careers within the company. In the supporting content, the team highlighted how Microsoft Viva tools make employee lives easier and their job performance better.\n\nThe team also found new and creative ways to reach people beyond sending emails. For example, the IT Communications team used Microsoft Viva Engage hashtags to mix up how they got their messages out.\n\nOne fun way the team connected with employees was to create a Minecraft game to change their behavior in meetings to better accommodate our new hybrid work world.\n\n\u201cYou never truly know what\u2019s going to excite people,\u201d Etchells says. \u201cRecently, we helped our colleagues name their work semesters after elements in the periodic table for fun, and let people participate in polls to choose which ones we used. It was surprising how engaged and excited folks were\u2014and the key to success here seemed to be focusing on user participation.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, driving adoption and engaging employees often relies on the willingness of the team to try new ideas and adapt.\n\nIt helps us drive adoption for new products when executives engage with the content we create. Leader sponsorship can make a huge difference. \u2014Sarah Lundy, senior program manager, IT Communications team, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cAs communicators, we have to be willing to try new things that might or might not work, and to pivot quickly when things don\u2019t work,\u201d Etchells says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an aspect of behavioral science to communications,\u201d Lundy says. \u201cEmployees may respond well to a type of communication once, and then later respond poorly to that same style of communication.\u201d\n\nBoost your message with executive voices\n\nIt helps when executives show support for the work that communicators do.\n\n\u201cIt helps us drive adoption for new products when executives engage with the content we create,\u201d Lundy says. \u201cLeader sponsorship can make a huge difference.\u201d\n\nA campaign that the team ran, called \u201c#2022Reflections,\u201d featured Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.\n\nNadella shared his reflections in a video on his storyline in Microsoft Viva Engage and urged people to participate with their own reflections using the hashtag #2022Reflections. When they used the hashtag, participants\u2019 posts were aggregated in an official campaign in Viva Engage, generating conversations and interactions. The IT Communications team sent an email to employees highlighting ways Viva could support them as they wrapped up the year and encouraging reflections in the campaign.\n\nUltimately, the campaign successfully drove awareness of the Microsoft Viva Engage features and encouraged meaningful interactions within the product.\n\nBecoming Customer Zero with Microsoft Viva Amplify\n\nIn a meta moment, the IT Communications team recently got to be their very own Customer Zero for a new communications tool, Microsoft Viva Amplify.\n\nThey helped us understand the challenges they face as communicators, from designing communications campaigns to tracking employee engagement metrics. This informed our development of Viva Amplify and helped us build a better user experience very early on in development. \u2014Judith Yaaqoubi, principal product manager, Microsoft Viva Amplify product group\n\nMicrosoft Viva Amplify is part of the Microsoft Viva employee experience platform that empowers internal communication teams and leaders to elevate their message and energize their audiences. Specifically, Viva Amplify provides a single platform for communicators and leaders to plan, create, and send their communications to employees. In one motion, they can use Viva Amplify to build a communication once and have it automatically formatted for and published to multiple endpoints\u2014email, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Viva Connections, and internal SharePoint sites. Microsoft Viva Engage is being added as an endpoint soon, as well as other communications channels.\n\nMicrosoft Viva Amplify makes sure that company messaging meets employees where they already are throughout Microsoft 365, making it an intuitive part of their daily activities. Viva Amplify is available to customers as part of the Viva suite and as part of a new communications offering.\n\n\u201cTo create Microsoft Viva Amplify, we did a lot of deep research with external companies, but also with the IT Communications team,\u201d says Judith Yaaqoubi, a principal product manager on the Microsoft Viva Amplify product group. \u201cThey helped us understand the challenges they face as communicators, from designing communications campaigns to tracking employee engagement metrics. This informed our development of Viva Amplify and helped us build a better user experience very early on in development.\u201d\n\nParticularly, the IT Communications team allowed the Microsoft Viva Amplify development team to study their work habits during communication campaigns over a long period of time, which wasn\u2019t possible during the research conducted with customers. This allowed the development team to better discern how campaigns are created, and to comprehend the usage of tools within the campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe IT Communications team also hosted workshops with other teams and individuals within Microsoft to test Microsoft Viva Amplify and identify challenges experienced in the product as we developed it,\u201d Yaaqoubi says. \u201cThis close partnership not only helped drive internal adoption of the product but has allowed to us to create a product that better serves the needs of communicators.\u201d\n\nIn Microsoft Viva Amplify, the results from internal testing with the IT Communications team are clear. The features for planning and sending communications across the company are intuitive and simple.\n\nViva Amplify has the following features for executives and communications professionals:\n\nCampaign orchestration tools, including the creation of a campaign brief that drives alignment on objectives and key messages between campaign collaborators\n\nThe ability to create content once and publish it simultaneously across Microsoft 365 tools such as Microsoft Outlook, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Viva Engage is coming soon)\n\nPublication preview modes to test how content will look on each platform before pushing it live\n\nDetailed performance metrics within Microsoft Viva Amplify to check campaign reach and engagement with target audiences\n\nCampaign cards that allow you to visualize and manage all campaigns in one place, with \u201cLive\u201d statuses for active campaigns\n\nThe \u201cCampaign Brief\u201d tab, in particular, shows the influence from the IT Communications team\u2019s testing. Upon selecting the tab there are multiple sections, the first being \u201cCampaign Objectives,\u201d where goals and messages that apply to the entire campaign can be listed.\n\n\u201cWe learned by working with the IT Communications team that often, there are many people with different roles and perspectives working on the same communication campaigns.

            "content": "By default, Microsoft 365 saves files in the environment where you opened them and reopens them in the environment where you last saved them. This can quickly lead to confusion \u2014 like finding yourself in Word for the web when you thought you were working in the desktop app. If you prefer using desktop apps, even when accessing files through your online Office account or Edge\u2019s new Office 365 dashboard, you can adjust a simple setting to make it happen.\n\nSEE: Windows, Linux, and Mac Commands Everyone Needs to Know\n\nIn this tutorial, I\u2019ll show you how to determine your environment at any given time. Then, I\u2019ll present a quick way to force Office 365 to always open a file in the desktop environment, regardless of where you open or save it.\n\nI\u2019m using Office 365 on a Windows 10 64-bit system. I\u2019m using Word, but this behavior also applies to Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.\n\nHow to determine which environment you\u2019re in with Microsoft 365\n\nIf you open a file while working online, you might find it difficult to tell whether you work online or in a desktop app. Fortunately, it\u2019s quite easy to discover which environment is active. To do so, click the File tab and then click Info. The document shown below is open in Word for the web. Word will switch to the desktop version if you click Open in Desktop App.\n\nHow to manually choose an environment in Microsoft 365\n\nThe online apps are convenient. You can open a file quickly, make changes, and save those changes in SharePoint or OneDrive automatically. Despite the convenience, if you need to use the desktop app, you can choose that environment from the online environment as follows.\n\nSign into your Office account as you normally would. Select the file you want to open in Word, but don\u2019t double-click it to open it. With the file selected, choose one of the options shown in the Open dropdown.\n\nYou must be working with a system that has Microsoft 365 installed to choose that option. Use this option when you\u2019re unsure of the file\u2019s default environment setting.\n\nHow can I set Microsoft 365 to always open files in desktop apps by default?\n\nMicrosoft 365 apps for the web are incredibly convenient despite their limited functionality. Those limitations are why most users prefer to work in the full-featured desktop environment. Thanks to the easy-to-use Office online and Microsoft 365 dashboard in Edge, many of us are now working in one of those environments. That means it\u2019s easy to open a file in the web app without realizing it until you try to perform a task the web app doesn\u2019t support. It\u2019s not a huge deal, but it is frustrating and unnecessary.\n\nSEE: How to Download and Install Microsoft 365 Apps on Mac, iPad or iPhone\n\nWhen you know you want to use a desktop app when working most of the time, you can force the issue with a simple setting. If you open the file online, Microsoft 365 will open it on the desktop by default, so you can skip the manual process without worry.\n\nTo set this default setting, follow these steps.\n\nOpen the file on the Word desktop. Click the File menu. Choose Options from the left pane. Choose Advanced from the left pane. Scroll down to the Link Handling section. Check the Open Supported Hyperlinks to Office Files in Office Desktop Apps option. Click OK to return to the Word document.\n\nRegardless of where you created or saved the file, once you enable this setting, Word will always open the file in the desktop environment if available.\n\nTo my knowledge, Microsoft 365 doesn\u2019t offer a setting for always defaulting to Word for the web. However, if you create the file online and never save it to the desktop app, Microsoft 365 will always open the file in Word for the web.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make this setting stick, talk to your administrator. If the feature is available to your organization, an administrator can make it available.\n\nWhy are my Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files not opening in their desktop applications?\n\nIf your files aren\u2019t opening in their dedicated desktop applications, it\u2019s likely for one of three reasons:\n\nYour default program settings are incorrect. You are opening the files from a web browser in online mode. There is an issue with file associations on your system.\n\nEven if your computer did open Office files in desktop apps at one point, an update to the program or your operating system can change the default settings. You can fix this by right-clicking on an Office file, selecting Open with \u2192 Choose default program, then choosing the desired Office application and checking the \u201cAlways use this app to open .docx\u201d (or relevant file extension) box.\n\nYou can make a similar change within an Office application. When it\u2019s open, go to File \u2192 Options \u2192 Advanced, then, under File Open Preference, select Desktop from the dropdown menu.\n\nA corrupted file or partially installed Office suite can also lead to opening issues. To perform a Quick Repair, open your computer\u2019s Control Panel and choose Programs \u2192 Programs and Features. Then, select the Office product you desire, and click Change \u2192 Quick Repair \u2192 Repair.\n\nFurthermore, to open Office files in desktop apps, your license must be up-to-date and activated, the files must be compatible with the version of Office on your device, and your account must have sufficient permissions to access the files.\n\nGot a question about Microsoft 365?

Eligible devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, versions 23H2 and 22H2 will be gradually updated to version 24H2,\u201d Microsoft says, as noted by Bleeping Computer. \u201cThis automatic update targets only devices that are not managed by IT departments.\u201d\n\nget windows 11 pro for cheap Windows 11 Pro\n\nEarly adopters have had the chance to opt in to receive new updates almost as soon as they\u2019re out, but this new stage has moved on to mainstream users. You still will be able to schedule the updates for outside of your working hours. If you do, simply make sure that your documents are saved and you\u2019re not in the middle of an online process (such as shopping or possibly a license renewal at the DMV) that will be interrupted by the upgrade.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have the option to postpone the update altogether, but only for a short time. (On my system, only a one-week delay is available.)\n\nAs noted in a link above, there are some fairly fundamental changes coming to Windows as part of Windows 11 24H2, \u2014 including support for USB4\u2019s 80Gbps option, Bluetooth LE Audio for hearing aids, Energy Saver controls, and more \u2014 with some optional changes dropping this spring.\n\nThose are the benefits, however.

I really haven\u2019t noticed many major changes or bugs inside Windows 11 24H2, but it certainly pays to wait while Microsoft fixes them. That time is over and you should schedule an hour or two for Microsoft\u2019s latest major feature update.",

E-commerce behemoth Amazon similarly announced it had retired diversity programs and dialed down its DEI rhetoric as part of a review of hundreds of initiatives.\n\nCorporate efforts to recruit and retain more women and minorities have come under intense scrutiny recently as conservative activists and politicians have tried to reframe DEI as discrimination against White male workers.\n\nMeta\u2019s announcement came after meetings CEO Mark Zuckerberg had with members of President Donald Trump\u2019s incoming Republican administration, according to news reports. Trump advisers are reportedly considering plans to ax diversity offices across the federal government. And Trump\u2019s vice president, JD Vance, has been an outspoken critic of DEI, even authoring a bill during his time as Ohio\u2019s junior senator that would sway companies to disband their DEI initiatives.\n\nWhether tech companies affirm or ax their DEI policies is important to their business, according to Lindsey Stewart, director of stewardship research and policy for Morningstar Sustainalytics. That\u2019s because the industry is in the business of disseminating and publicizing information to a diverse global audience, Stewart said.\n\nAny tech company that doesn\u2019t consider the risks of failing to recruit and retain a diverse workforce could be in for a rude awakening from its consumers and prospective employees, Stewart said.\n\n\u201cIf there are companies that are genuinely scaling back,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cit is possible they could find out the hard way that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nPublic Affirmations\n\nMicrosoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre wrote in a Dec. 20 blog posted on LinkedIn that \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s diversity and inclusion work is more important than ever.\u201d\n\nThe post followed the company\u2019s October diversity and inclusion report spelling out and reaffirming its commitments to DEI.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe it\u2019s the business of Microsoft to be diverse and inclusive so we can build products, services, and a workforce that empowers the world,\u201d McIntyre wrote.\n\nThe October diversity and inclusion report, as well as McIntyre\u2019s sentiments, remain unchanged, the company confirmed.\n\nApple\u2019s comments on diversity came within its latest proxy statement, a document where publicly traded companies discuss issues going up for a vote at their next annual shareholder meeting.\n\nOne of the items on the ballot for Apple\u2019s Feb. 25 meeting is a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research urging the company to cease its DEI efforts because they pose \u201clitigation, reputation and financial risks.\u201d\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative shareholder activist group, referred to a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court that curbed affirmative action in college admissions. The 2023 decision calls the legality of corporate DEI efforts into question, the center\u2019s proposal said.\n\nApple\u2019s board recommended investors vote against the proposal to shutter the company\u2019s DEI programs because its anti-discrimination policies are robust and leadership already takes legal concerns into account.\n\n\u201cWe strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\u201d Apple added in the disclosure.\n\nApple didn\u2019t respond to a request for further comment.\n\nTech Needs Talent\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet Inc. , the parent company of Google, hasn\u2019t publicly indicated any change in the status of its DEI programs. As of Jan. 17, the Google\u2019s DEI website still affirmed its pledges to disability inclusion, gender equity, LGBTQ+ inclusion, racial equity, and veteran inclusion, among other headline programs.\n\nA spokesperson for Alphabet didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nTech companies in particular have struggled with worker diversity.\n\nThe high tech sector was less racially and ethnically diverse than the US workforce at large in 2022\u2014the most recent year with data available\u2014according to a US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission study released last year. Black workers accounted for 7.4% of the high tech workforce and 5.7% of high tech managers, despite making up 11.6% of the total US workforce, the report said.\n\nYounger generations from which tech companies will need to recruit are far more diverse in race, ethnicity, gender, and a host of other categories, said Michelle Hebl, chair of Rice University\u2019s psychology department, and a scholar on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. To draw talent from that workforce requires an understanding and prioritization of DEI initiatives, she said.\n\n\u201cOur world is different,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when we are serving people who are not White, we want our workforces to be reflective of populations, because the technology that we\u2019re making is servicing individuals who are also not White.\u201d",

The company has an ever-lengthening list of known issues, many of which remain unmitigated or unresolved since the operating system was launched in the second half of 2024.\n\nRecently resolved issues include problems with Ubisoft games, and USB devices that support the eSCL scanner protocol \u2013 although the latter might not have been entirely fixed, according to disgruntled users in hardware support forums.\n\nMicrosoft has form when it comes to forcing new versions of its operating system onto user hardware. Almost a year ago, Windows 11 23H2 was rolled out in the same way \u2013 the company's support lifecycle means Home and Pro users must be kept up to date, whether those users like it or not, in order to receive support.\n\nForcing Windows 11 24H2 onto users won't affect machines subject to a safeguard hold where Microsoft has decided to block the installation (likely due to one of the documented known issues.) Nor does it affect users sticking with Windows 10 \u2013 devices that don't meet Microsoft's hardware requirements for its flagship operating system won't suddenly be able to pass muster for Windows 11 24H2. There is also little in Windows 11 24H2 to attract users who have chosen to skip previous versions.\n\nInstead, IT professionals around the world should gird their loins for the inevitable friends and family support calls when Windows 11 24H2 makes a surprise appearance, and uncle Fester is surprised that things have suddenly started working a little differently. \u00ae",

            "content": "A big success story for software giant Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) over the past decade has been Office 365, now called Microsoft 365. Facing competition from Alphabet's Google Docs, Microsoft launched subscription versions of its iconic Office applications. The old model of selling pricey one-off licenses was under threat, and Microsoft successfully convinced tens of millions of consumers and businesses to pay annual fees to access its software.\n\nAt the end of Microsoft's most recent quarter, the number of consumer Microsoft 365 subscribers grew to 80.4 million. While Microsoft doesn't disclose revenue directly, based on the old pricing, this subscriber base is likely generating somewhere between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue annually.\n\nA massive price increase\n\nI say \"old pricing\" because Microsoft has just enacted an enormous price increase on its consumer Microsoft 365 plans. The Personal and Family plans will see a $3 bump in monthly pricing and a $30 bump in annual pricing. The annual Personal plan will now be about 42% more expensive, while the annual Family plan will be 30% costlier. This is the first price increase for either plan in more than a decade.\n\nWhy the sudden spike in pricing? You can blame Microsoft's massive investment in artificial intelligence (AI). After rolling out a $20 per month Copilot Pro subscription plan in early 2024, which brought AI into the company's Office applications, the company is now bundling Copilot with Microsoft 365 and making consumers pick up the tab whether they use it or not. While Microsoft highlighted other improvements made to its Office applications over the past decade, the cost of running AI models in the cloud is almost certainly the primary driver behind this price increase.\n\nThe AI features that are now part of Microsoft 365 aren't unlimited. Subscribers will get a certain amount of AI credits each month, which are consumed when AI features are used. Microsoft is keeping Copilot Pro as an option for consumers with high usage needs, allowing Microsoft 365 subscribers to upgrade and pay the additional $20 per month.\n\nAn extra $30 per year from each consumer Microsoft 365 subscriber would add up to nearly $2.5 billion in extra annual revenue. Of course, there are costs associated with providing AI services, and this number assumes no subscribers will cancel due to the higher pricing. Still, that's a meaningful amount, even for a company the size of Microsoft.\n\nThis move could backfire\n\nMicrosoft is betting that its Office applications are important enough to its subscribers that a big price increase won't deter them from renewing their subscriptions. For subscribers who use these new AI features, the price increase may very well be worth it. But there will likely be many subscribers who want nothing to do with Microsoft's AI, and they'll be paying far more and getting nothing in return.\n\nThe risk for Microsoft is not losing power users who are invested in its ecosystem but instead losing users who pay for Microsoft 365 because they have a slight preference for it over the alternatives. If you're a heavy user of Excel, for example, it would be a pain to move your spreadsheets over to Google Sheets. In contrast, if you mostly just use Word and dabble with everything else, switching costs are relatively low.\n\nEven if a meaningful number of subscribers drops Microsoft 365, Microsoft will likely still boost its revenue due to the sheer size of the price increase. However, it's hard not to view this price increase as a customer-unfriendly move aimed at recouping AI investments, and that could drive customers to alternatives in the long run.\n\nThe trend of tech giants jamming AI features into existing products and then raising prices is likely here to stay as companies pour mountains of cash into AI investments. Whether consumers will be willing to pay for these AI features remains an open question.",

Users will need a modern version of Microsoft Office/Word on an x86 computer system, and eschew security warnings, to enable the VBA macro in the document to run.\n\nNetherlands-based Wojciech Graj is the brains behind this project. On social media, Graj explains that he was inspired to port Doom to a Word document after seeing DoomPDF, which was in turn inspired by Pdftris. The video above shows that this version of Doom looks far more faithful to what a retro-gamer would expect than the PDF efforts. The graphics look similar to the original experience here, and it runs at a fair pace.\n\nHowever, Word-based Doom is far from Graj's first oddball Doom porting exercise. He also has published projects like Doom-ascii, Doom in Stardew Valley, and Doom in Minecraft.\n\nReturning our attention to WordDoom, or DoomWord (Graj doesn't seem to have a preference), the software engineer explains that this feat is achieved through the document containing the doomgeneric_docm.dll library and doom1.wad game data encoded in base 64. Upon opening the document, a VBA macro is set up to extract the b64 data and load it.\n\nIn the video, the game seems to run quite smoothly. However, in the background, \"Every game tick, doomgeneric.dll creates a bmp image containing the current frame and uses GetAsyncKeyState to read the keyboard state,\" notes Graj. Perhaps this is why the viewport is quite small (original 320 x 200 pixels?) \u2014 to keep the game responsive.\n\nWordDoom gamers can use their arrow keys for movement, Control key for fire, Space key for use, and number keys 1-7 for weapon selection. Graj highlights that there is no sound in this game release.\n\nWe opened the downloaded doom.docm file to a spare computer, but the Word 2007 version installed on the machine must have been missing something, even though we accepted the security warning concerning macros.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

            "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are pioneers in artificial intelligence (AI) as both companies have played central roles in bringing this technology mainstream.\n\nWhile Microsoft-backed OpenAI kicked off the AI craze when it launched the highly popular ChatGPT in November 2022, the chatbot may not have seen the light of the day without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which were used for training the large language model (LLM) powering ChatGPT. As other major tech giants joined the AI race, the demand for Nvidia's chips went through the roof, and sent its revenue and bottom line soaring.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of AI on Microsoft's business has been gradual. The company is spending billions to build its AI data center infrastructure -- benefiting Nvidia in the process -- and believes its AI-focused investments will \"support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.\" This explains why Nvidia stock has outperformed Microsoft's by a massive margin in the past couple of years.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\n\nBut will Nvidia continue to outperform Microsoft in 2025? Let's find out.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-driven growth should gain momentum, while Nvidia faces challenges\n\nAs already mentioned, Microsoft is benefiting gradually from AI. The company's revenue in fiscal year 2024 (that ended June 30) was up 16% from the previous year to $245 billion. Its adjusted earnings increased 20% year over year to $11.80 per share. The company's estimated revenue growth rate of 14% for fiscal 2025 to $278.6 billion isn't all that great, while its earnings are expected to increase by 10.5% to $13.04 per share.\n\nThe forecasts for fiscal 2026, which will begin in July 2025, don't point toward a major improvement either. Consensus estimates are projecting a 14% increase in Microsoft's revenue in the next fiscal year, along with a 15% jump in earnings.\n\nMSFT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is expected to finish the current fiscal year (ending January 2025) with outstanding revenue growth of 112% to $129 billion, followed by a 52% increase in the next fiscal year to $196 billion. Nvidia's bottom line is also expected to jump an impressive 128% in the ongoing fiscal year followed by a 50% jump in the next one.\n\nAll this indicates that Nvidia could continue to grow at a much faster pace than Microsoft over the course of the next year. What's more, the 12-month median price targets of both companies suggest that Nvidia stock could rise 33% while Microsoft is expected to deliver 20% gains. So, the odds seem in favor of Nvidia outperforming Microsoft in 2025, and that's not surprising considering that the chipmaker continues to witness outstanding demand for its AI data center GPUs.\n\nHowever, investors would do well to note that a few concerns could weigh on Nvidia stock. From potential restrictions that could be imposed on sales of its AI chips to foreign countries to an expensive valuation to the efforts being undertaken by major Nvidia customers to reduce their reliance on its chips, there are multiple reasons why Nvidia shares may remain under pressure.\n\nMoreover, the company's growth rate -- though still impressive -- is gradually slowing down. These are the reasons why Nvidia stock may lose its shine in 2025. Microsoft, on the other hand, is slowly but steadily stepping up its game in key AI-focused niches that could set it up for outstanding growth in the long run.\n\nThe tech giant is already gaining share in the cloud computing market thanks to AI. Microsoft's Azure cloud and other services revenue increased by 33% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with AI contributing 12 percentage points of that growth. More importantly, AI is helping Microsoft build a solid revenue pipeline by driving an increase in the number of big contracts that the company is signing for its Azure cloud solutions.\n\nThis is evident from the 22% increase in Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) in fiscal Q1 2025 to $259 billion. The faster growth in RPO as compared to the revenue bodes well for Microsoft, as this metric refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts. Microsoft expects to recognize 40% of its RPO as revenue in the next 12 months, which would be an increase of 17% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAs a result, the possibility of Microsoft growing at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations in the coming year cannot be ruled out. A similar story could unfold at Nvidia, and the company could overcome the adversity that it is facing right now.\n\nThough the outgoing administration's potential curbs on Nvidia chip exports could post a threat to its remarkable revenue growth -- 56% of its revenue is from customers outside the U.S. -- investors should note the rules will be enforced 120 days from now, giving the incoming administration time to weigh in on the new rules.\n\nLooking at the positive side of things, Nvidia's focus on significantly enhancing the production capacity of its latest Blackwell AI processors to meet the red-hot demand from its customers, along with the massive increase in AI infrastructure spend by its U.S. customers, could be enough to help the company grow at an impressive pace once again in 2025. As such, the possibility of Nvidia stock retaining its mojo despite the potential challenges it faces cannot be ruled out.\n\nWhat should investors do?\n\nThe uncertainties surrounding Nvidia may tempt investors to put their money into Microsoft stock to capitalize on the AI boom, especially considering the latter's valuation. After all, Microsoft is trading at a much cheaper 34 times earnings as compared to Nvidia's earnings multiple of 52.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 31 is in line with Microsoft's, and that's not surprising considering the outstanding growth that the company is expected to deliver. This makes Nvidia an attractive AI stock to buy right now, and investors can consider using the negative press surrounding it as a buying opportunity considering that its huge addressable market could be enough to help it overcome any potential regulatory challenges.\n\nBut at the same time, even Microsoft looks like a top AI stock to buy for the long run considering the massive opportunities in cloud computing and workplace collaboration that could supercharge its growth.\n\nSo, investors can consider buying any one of these two AI stocks right now depending on their risk appetite, and there is a good chance that they may not go wrong in 2025, as well as in the long run, as both Microsoft and Nvidia are sitting on lucrative end markets thanks to AI.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nA profound dining transformation is happening at Microsoft as the company\u2019s employees return to an office that\u2019s evolved into a hybrid workplace.\n\nThe pandemic has changed the way we work\u2014and with it, the way we eat. Consumer expectations are evolving as people, including employees at Microsoft, get used to seamless, on-demand ordering through mobile applications and direct-to-you deliveries.\n\nWith Microsoft employees returning to the office after two years of working mostly remote, the Dining at Microsoft Operations team for the Puget Sound campus knew they needed to help them feel comfortable, fuel up, and be productive at work. They wanted to integrate new programs and ordering capabilities that would respect changing expectations and incorporate the intuitive nature of the mobile apps employees use at home.\n\nBetween Dining Operations and their partners on the Microsoft Digital team, plans were already in place to streamline the mobile ordering experience. The imminent return to work and the transition to a flexible, hybrid environment confirmed the urgency of the transformation. What began as an initiative to provide premium value for employees has become a necessary service consideration.\n\n[See how Microsoft employees navigate their campuses with IoT tech and indoor mapping. Learn about the ways that Microsoft is modernizing the support experience with ServiceNow. Find out about reinventing the employee experience at Microsoft.]\n\nA campus-scale challenge\n\nWith more than 70 dining locations on the Puget Sound campus and thousands of frequently changing menu items, Dining Operations\u2019 challenge was to provide an experience that would feel intuitive for users and meet the needs of tens of thousands of diners each day. It would need to provide seamless food ordering and reflect the unfolding reality of hybrid work.\n\nWe recognize that from an employee experience standpoint, Dining at Microsoft needs to reflect our cultural principles, whether that\u2019s around sustainability, accessibility, diversity and inclusion, or digital transformation. We have a job to do, and that\u2019s to make sure we create a great dining experience for our employees every day and have our food and programming reflect who we are as an organization. \u2014Jodi Westwater, senior services manager of Dining Operations for the Puget Sound Campus\n\nWhile online ordering was already available to employees through a browser-based point-of-sale (POS) platform, Dining Operations wanted a modern, intuitive, mobile-first experience to streamline how people browse menus and purchase items. They also wanted to integrate it into the digital environment employees use every day.\n\nIt was imperative that any solution should embody Microsoft\u2019s priorities and culture.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that from an employee experience standpoint, Dining at Microsoft needs to reflect our cultural principles, whether that\u2019s around sustainability, accessibility, diversity and inclusion, or digital transformation,\u201d says Jodi Westwater, senior services manager of Dining Operations for the Puget Sound Campus. \u201cWe have a job to do, and that\u2019s to make sure we create a great dining experience for our employees every day and have our food and programming reflect who we are as an organization.\u201d\n\nDining transformation, tailored to employees\n\nThe teams incorporated a mobile menu and ordering interface into an internal app that employee use to access transportation, explore their benefits, and manage other elements of their day-to-day roles. Incorporating dining into the app would mean that employees could order food in the mobile-friendly, full-service environment they already use.\n\nTo make the integration work, the team needed to bridge the gap between the internal mobile app and Dining Operations\u2019 existing POS and menu tool. Since the POS system was originally intended as a standalone touch-screen service, the team used Microsoft Azure API to create the connective tissue between the platforms.\n\n\u201cOne of the key focuses early on for building this integration was not only that the information be accurate for Microsoft end users,\u201d says Thomas Po, a product manager on the Microsoft Digital team. \u201cIt also had to be relatively easy to use on the back end to minimize room for error and stay in sync with the operations side.\u201d\n\nPOS integration was only part of the challenge. To meet Microsoft\u2019s commitment to accessibility, the team worked closely with internal stakeholders to review and implement the Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS). They conducted user-group testing with employee resource groups, individuals, and Microsoft Digital\u2019s internal accessibility experts. As a result, the app features inclusive elements like high-visibility contrast settings and read-along technology.\n\nSince the app would be handling financial transactions in conjunction with third-party tools, it needed to be highly secure. So Microsoft Digital worked closely with the Finance Security team to ensure that the app met the strict data-capture and retention requirements built into all Microsoft technology.\n\nThroughout the process, they leveraged tools throughout the Azure stack, including Azure API for integration with the dining POS system and Cosmos DB as a data repository, as well as other third-party tools hosted on Microsoft Azure.\n\nThe new ordering experience rolled out as a pilot in April of 2021 for use by essential employees working onsite, and it\u2019s now in place across the entire Puget Sound Campus. The app allows employees to browse menus that feature images of the food at any dining location. They can order their food, pay digitally, and pick it up at the caf\u00e9, food hall, or espresso location of their choice.\n\nFrom an experience standpoint, everything we do, design, and ideate must be user-centric, which for us means employee-led. What do employees need? What do we anticipate their habits to be? How will preferences change in a hybrid workplace? And how do we meet and exceed those ever-changing expectations? \u2014Jodi Westwater, senior services manager of Dining Operations for the Puget Sound Campus\n\nThe app automatically finds the nearest dining location based on an employee\u2019s current whereabouts. In addition, iOS users can complete their transactions through Apple Pay, adding an extra layer of seamlessness to the mobile experience.\n\nEmployees can even browse the week\u2019s menu ahead of time. With an increasing emphasis on hybrid workplaces and flexible in-person attendance, they might decide to make the trip to the office when their favorite food is available!\n\nThe mobile app integration doesn\u2019t just reflect the intuitive experience of mobile food ordering that employees have embraced during the pandemic. It provides a way for workers who are understandably anxious about public eating spaces with the opportunity to retrieve their food quickly and eat on their own terms. It\u2019s also a quick and easy solution for employees who have back-to-back meetings and may only have a few moments to grab food.\n\n\u201cFrom an experience standpoint, everything we do, design, and ideate must be customer-centric, which for us means employee-led,\u201d Westwater says. \u201cWhat do employees need? What do we anticipate their habits to be? How will preferences change in a hybrid workplace? And how do we meet and exceed those ever-changing expectations?\u201d\n\nThe future of fueling up at work\n\nOnline ordering has more than tripled since before the pandemic. Previously, employees placed less than two percent of orders at the Puget Sound campus online. Now, approximately ten to twelve percent are placed digitally\u2014at least a quarter of those via the mobile app. To make the feature even more accessible, the team will make dining order-ahead capabilities available on Microsoft Viva Connections, which will enable employees to order food on their mobile or desktop, using the same Microsoft Teams interface that they use throughout their day.\n\nFor diners who prefer the in-person experience or who might be anxious about crowding as more people return to work, Dining Operations is exploring a system that provides employees with more information about which caf\u00e9s are busiest and when. The tool will use a mix of colors and graphics to indicate dining location traffic and occupancy so people can decide where they\u2019d like to eat. This new functionality will also give staff valuable insights into usage patterns so they can use data to accommodate the ebb and flow of diners throughout the day and reduce food waste by ordering stock to reflect usage patterns accurately.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is designed to create the most convenient and intuitive experience for Microsoft employees, visitors, and guests,\u201d Westwater says. \u201cWe\u2019re not just making sure we offer great food onsite, but that the ordering and dining process is accessible, that it makes sense, and that it\u2019s easy to access.\u201d",

Now open sourced with plans to donate the project to the CNCF, the Hyperlight project relies on small, embedded functions using hypervisor-based protection for each function call at scale. Each function request also has its own hypervisor for protection.\n\nVirtual machines have long been the cornerstone of cloud native infrastructure, widely trusted to securely separate host and guest environments, Rita Zhang, a principal engineer on Microsoft Azure, said during a keynote at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon in November. \u201cHowever, for event-driven scenarios like serverless computing, traditional VMs are simply too slow to spin up,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cSo, how can we reduce this latency while still running our applications securely?\u201d\n\nWhat Is Hyperlight?\n\nHyperlight is a Rust library built to allow developers to leverage kernel-based virtual machines or Hyper-V \u2014 a Microsoft-native hypervisor \u2014 to run untrusted code in a microVM without loading a full operating system. These microVMs can be created in microseconds, Zhang said.\n\nDuring a demo, Zhang showed how an app makes sequential calls from the VM to the host and then returns values from the host back to the guest. Hyperlight creates a new microVM for each call, averaging just 900 microseconds per request, Zhang showed. \u201cThat\u2019s microseconds \u2014 less than one millisecond,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nBig Ideas\n\nThe idea has been around for a while: the use of Wasm modules to serve as lightweight and sandboxed security. Called different things depending on the cloud vendor, micro VMs will allow for on-premise or cloud sources to distribute massive amounts of data traffic coming from on-premises systems through the cloud. Google Cloud should offer similar offerings as the standard is worked out in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe can now process network traffic as it enters the system using these lightweight sandboxes,\u201d said Mark Russinovich, CTO and technical fellow of Microsoft Azure, speaking at the Microsoft Ignite user\u2019s conference. \u201cThis opens up incredible possibilities for real-time, efficient network processing.\u201d\n\nAdobe and Google are among the tech leaders developing the WebAssembly standard. Additionally, companies using it to stream video include Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney and others.\n\nMicrosoft is typically not very verbose about much of its previous work in WebAssembly (Microsoft could not comment for a previous article when queried), but it has been confirmed the company has already begun to use WebAssembly to support its operations mostly while continuing to actively contribute to the development of Wasm for the community. In Microsoft\u2019s case, its work with WebAssembly dates back years. Microsoft Flight Simulator, for some years now, has used WebAssembly for mod protection, for example, when it was shown to improve both security and portability for add-ons distributed as WebAssembly modules. Excel Online uses WebAssembly for calculating Lambda functions.\n\nMost of Microsoft\u2019s work now consists of investing in the upcoming component model and WASI. For example, Microsoft is expanding the Azure Kubernetes Service WASI NodePool preview and giving its services additional hypervisor protection per request on top of the Wasm sandbox with the Hyperlight project. Outside of the edge browser, Microsoft is investing mainly in server-based Wasm and the Wasm component ecosystem surrounding the Bytecode Alliance, as well as in infrastructure and language tooling to enable productive use and WASI, of course. Microsoft is also developing the Containerd project Runwasi, which is part of the SpinKube project.\n\n\u201cHyperlight was the missing piece we needed to truly isolate fine-grained, lightweight pieces of code. You might think, \u2018Isn\u2019t that what containers are for?\u2019 But containers actually have a sizable footprint,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Yosh Wuyts, senior developer advocate, and Ralph Squillace, principal product manager for Microsoft Azure Core Upstream, wrote in a blog post. \u201cFor scenarios like user-defined functions inside a storage service or processing network traffic on edge, as it comes into your system, you need something much more lightweight. It also needs to be hostile and multitenant safe, meaning customers can be placed side by side in these environments without compromising security. This led us to create what we call micro sandboxes or micro virtual machines.\u201d\n\nAn \u201caha\u201d moment came when a colleague at Azure \u201ccame to me one day and said, \u2018Hey, I can use the Hyper-V APIs to create a VM with no code except for a tiny piece I load into it. It can launch in microseconds and shut down just as quickly,\u201d Squillace wrote. \u201cAnd just like that, we had Hyperlight, a hypervisor-isolated micro VM.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft introduced Hyperlight virtual machine-based security and, as mentioned above, has open sourced it. It now works not only with Hyper-V but also with KVM. Additionally, Microsoft is contributing Hyperlight to the CNCF, \u201caiming to raise all boats and provide micro virtual machine technology to everyone,\u201d Wuyts and Squillace wrote. \u201cHyperlight is our way of delivering this capability through a secure sandbox.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES",

            "content": "The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock ). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The following are the key factors that make this company a top choice for investors. Firstly, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, Microsoft delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up 16% year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24%. Additionally, Microsoft cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as first-party silicon, Azure Maia. Also, the company, in collaboration with Azure AI, is providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers\u2019 unique cost, latency, and design considerations.\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Compatible systems will be automatically updated to the latest release. Launched in October, Windows 11 24H2 has been plagued by a handful of jarring problems, including game-breaking bugs, persistent caches, and broken HDR. Recent patches have addressed most of these issues, and Microsoft is now confident enough to initiate automatic 24H2 updates for mainstream consumers. Note that this does not apply to managed systems.\n\nThe initial rollout began for Copilot+ PCs in June of last year. If you don't own an \"AI PC,\" 24H2 launched as early as October but was marred by bugs and glitches, most of which have been fixed per Microsoft's blog. So, if your PC wasn't on the latest release, it will automatically be updated to 24H2. Note that this only applies to eligible devices running Windows 11 Pro/Home on the 23H2/22H2 builds, which no organization can manage.\n\nAfter checking Microsoft's bug log, we found that many problems had been resolved. However, the potential for newer bugs still exists. Users can defer the update by up to five weeks using the \"Pause Updates\" feature in the \"Windows Update\" tab in \"Settings.\" If you're eager to update, select the \"Check for updates\" option in the same tab to see if the update is available for your device.\n\nMicrosoft is aware of issues that have not been resolved, such as the Failure to install 24H2 on specific Asus devices, the camera's unresponsiveness on a handful of systems, unexpected behavior with wallpaper applications, etc. Note that affected devices will be put on a \"safeguard hold\" until these issues have been resolved.\n\nCopilot PCs will get the most out of this update with the infamous Recall feature and other AI goodies. Sadly, these features will continue rolling out in phases for select devices under the Windows Insider Program. The good news is that Windows 11 24H2 promises faster update times and better performance for AMD's Ryzen CPUs. Intel mandates the installation of specific Windows 11 24H2 patches for optimal performance with Arrow Lake processors, even though our testing shows little to no improvements.",

            "content": "Hello Windows Insiders, today we are releasing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26120.2992 (KB5050083) to the Dev Channel. With this update, we are previewing improved Windows Search with Windows Insiders with Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs.\n\nNew Copilot+ PC experiences\n\nImproved Windows Search\n\nWe are making finding your documents, photos, and settings across Windows 11 easier on Copilot+ PCs by introducing semantic indexing along with traditional indexing. Whether it\u2019s searching in File Explorer, in the Windows search box on your taskbar, or in Settings \u2013 just type what\u2019s on your mind to find it on your Copilot+ PC. You no longer need to remember file names, exact words in file content, or settings names. For example, you can use your own words to find images by typing \u201cbridge at sunset\u201d, documents by describing what they are about like \u201cEurope trip budget\u201d, or settings like \u201cchange my theme\u201d. Thanks to the power of the 40+ TOPS NPU onboard Copilot+ PCs, these search improvements work even when you\u2019re not connected to the internet.\n\nToday, searching for files on your Copilot+ PC with improved Windows Search will only work for files saved locally in indexed locations on your PC. You can go to Settings > Privacy & security > Searching Windows to adjust which locations are indexed on your PC or turn on \u201cEnhanced\u201d to index your entire PC. In a future flight, we will support searching for documents and photos stored in cloud storage providers such as OneDrive.\n\nSearching for settings like \u201cchange my theme\u201d will work within the Settings app for now. In a future flight, you will be able to do this within the Windows search box on the taskbar.\n\nThese improved Windows Search experiences will gradually roll out to Windows Insiders on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs, with support for AMD and Intel-powered Copilot+ PCs coming soon. These experiences are supported in select languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish) and document formats. Supported file formats include .txt, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .rtf, .pptx, .ppt, .xls, .xlsx for documents and .jpg/.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .ico for images. See here for more details.\n\nYou can learn more about semantic search on Copilot + PCs here.\n\nFEEDBACK for File Explorer Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Files Folders and Online Storage > File Explorer Search.\n\nFEEDBACK for Windows Taskbar Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Desktop Environment > Search.\n\nFEEDBACK for Settings Search: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F) under Settings > Search Settings.\n\nNew text action for Click to Do (Preview)\n\nYou\u2019ll see a new text action for Click to Do available on Copilot+ PCs called Refine. To try this out, press Win + Click directly on a block of text or press Win + Q and then navigate to the text you\u2019d like to proofread and refine.

            "content": "AI is already helping many of us with things we do every day. It\u2019s also fueling breakthroughs in research that hold promise of reshaping things on a global scale, like the discovery of new materials and improving medical care.\n\nTwo new research papers published this week in scientific journals, one in Nature and one in Nature Machine Intelligence, show how generative AI foundation models can exponentially speed up scientific discovery of new materials and help doctors access and analyze radiology results faster.\n\nThe research and its potential are the result of extensive collaborations among Microsoft, academia and the private sector. Working with its partners around the globe, Microsoft Research has developed generative AI foundation models \u2014 large-scale models that leverage advances in AI \u2014 focused on materials discovery and radiology. The models were built from the ground up on Microsoft Azure and are being shared publicly to speed up development and potential uses.\n\n\u201cScience may be the most important application of AI. At Microsoft, we believe that the ability of generative AI to learn the language of humans is equally matched by its ability to learn the language of nature \u2014 including molecules, crystals, genomes and proteins,\u201d says Chris Bishop, director of Microsoft Research AI for Science. \u201cIt will allow us to harness AI for tackling humanity\u2019s most pressing challenges, from sustainability to drug discovery.\u201d\n\nMatterGen: A key to discovering better materials \u2014 and solutions \u2014 faster\n\nThe development of new materials has been an unsung hero of human advancement. Think of how steel girders are the backbone of modern cities and silicon chips power smartphones. It is a painstaking and expensive process, akin to finding a needle in a haystack, and it can cost millions or billions of dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s because developing new materials traditionally requires screening potentially millions of possibilities, a process that can take years with no guarantee of success. The latest research ushers in a new approach represented by MatterGen, a generative AI model that operates similarly to text-to-image and text-to-video AI models. Instead of screening a universe of possible materials, researchers propose specific properties and MatterGen generates new materials based on those properties.\n\nExperiments have begun validating the concept. When a material generated by MatterGen was synthesized, its properties were within 20% of the targeted material\u2019s properties.\n\nSimilar to generative AI\u2019s impact on drug discovery, MatterGen will have a profound impact on how, and how quickly, a wide range of materials are designed in fields including electronics, energy storage and biomedical engineering.\n\nDeveloping new efficient battery material, for example, could unlock more sustainable energy storage, while advances in superconductors could lead to groundbreaking improvements in medical imaging or quantum computing.\n\n\u201cFrom an industrial perspective, the potential here is enormous,\u201d says Tian Xie, principal research manager at AI for Science Cambridge in the United Kingdom. \u201cHuman civilization has always depended on material innovations. If we can use generative AI to make materials design more efficient, it could accelerate progress in industries like energy, healthcare and beyond.\u201d\n\nRAD-DINO: Faster data for doctors, better care for patients\n\nThe second research breakthrough will help doctors get better and more comprehensive medical data faster, potentially speeding up diagnoses and improving patient care.\n\nMayo Clinic and Microsoft Research are collaborating to develop multimodal foundation models that integrate text and images for radiology applications. Initially, the teams are exploring the use of Microsoft Research\u2019s AI technology with Mayo Clinic\u2019s X-ray data. Part of that work involves research published this week referred to as RAD-DINO, named for its focus on radiology and a specific learning method. This new approach to improving imaging can help personalize patient care and improve diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe technology identifies anatomical matches between chest X-rays of different subjects, indicating similarities through the proportional brightness of the heatmap.\n\nThe goal is to give clinicians quicker access to information they need to treat patients, with initial efforts aimed at developing a model that automatically generates reports, evaluates how tubes and lines have been placed through chest X-rays and detects changes from prior images. This could improve how clinicians work and care for patients by providing more efficient and comprehensive analyses of X-rays.\n\n\u201cI am excited to share our collaboration with Mayo Clinic, one of the world\u2019s leading hospitals, to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare: delivering faster and more precise medicine,\u201d says Javier Alvarez Valle, senior director of Multimodal AI, Microsoft Health Futures UK. \u201cA key hurdle lies in safely integrating generative AI into clinical workflows, and our work brings together the best experts from AI and medicine to make it happen.\u201d\n\nTop photo: A researcher works on a MatterGen generated material synthesized in lab.

The program will also include commitments to develop \u201cenhanced governmentwide support and education capabilities.\u201d\n\nLaura Stanton, assistant commissioner in the GSA Office of Information Technology Category, said in a statement that \u201cthe GMAS program exemplifies how collaboration with industry can drive innovation and deliver significant value to government and taxpayers alike.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Microsoft has been the target of multiple cybersecurity threats, including a breach that affected the federal government. The company also has been the subject of a Cyber Safety Review Board investigation into an online exchange incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a March report following that incident, the CSRB found that Microsoft\u2019s operational and strategic decisions pointed to a \u201ccorporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.\u201d\n\nThe board also said in its report that \u201cMicrosoft had not sufficiently prioritized rearchitecting its legacy infrastructure to address the current threat landscape.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft will now work with GSA to offer workshops across agencies to help ensure that they are strengthening their security posture, achieving optimal value from investments, managing cloud services and more, according to the GSA.\n\nThe GMAS initiative looks to bring together the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies to have conversations about cost reduction strategies and standard terms that are possible in government transactions for both software and services.\n\nThe agency stated in its release that \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s commitment to this effort ensures a unified approach offering consistent benefits to agencies regardless of size or purchasing method.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGSA\u2019s IT Vendor Management Office is set to provide resources for agencies to maximize benefits from this agreement and hands-on support for agencies through contract review service to support \u201cindividual requests for acquisition implementation strategies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s participation underscores the importance of a strategic agreement between the federal government and one of its largest technology providers,\u201d the release states. \u201cThis alignment is a critical step toward greater efficiency and security.\u201d",

Today, Microsoft is following suit, raising prices for its Microsoft 365 packages by $3 per month and bundling in some Copilot AI tools to justify the bump.\n\nIn the announcement post, Microsoft says that the price of Microsoft 365 will be rising from $7 to $10 per month for Personal subscribers and $10 to $13 per month for the Family bundle. Per-year prices will be rising from $70 to $100 (Personal) and $100 to $130 (Family).\n\nWhat do you get for that 42 percent jump in price at the lowest tier? Access to Copilot-powered text generation, formatting, and queries in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote, plus AI-generated images and editing in OneNote.\n\nYou won\u2019t have unlimited use of these tools, by the way. You get 60 \u201cAI credits\u201d per month, and they can\u2019t be banked or rolled over. Copilot Pro, which costs an additional $20 per month on top of existing 365 plans, is currently the only way to get \u201cextensive usage.\u201d (Presumably that means unlimited credits since it isn\u2019t enumerated.)\n\nExisting users won\u2019t see the price increase until the next billing cycle, but new users get it right away. If you\u2019re an existing subscriber and don\u2019t want the new features, you can switch to \u201cClassic\u201d versions of these plans ($7 per month for 365 Personal and $10 per month for 365 Family) by jumping through several hoops. The option to manually switch to a Classic plan will only be available \u201cfor a limited time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to interpret this don\u2019t-call-it-a-price-increase upsell as anything other than a forced integration of AI, just like Google\u2019s recent move. The market has shown that people aren\u2019t buying new PCs to get AI, and it would seem that they aren\u2019t interested in expensive add-on packages like Copilot. So both companies are resorting to inserting their AI infrastructures into existing products and charging more.\n\nI can\u2019t see it as a popular solution for anyone except shareholders\u2026 and maybe not even them, if these companies can\u2019t show that removing consumers\u2019 choices results in increased profits.",

Microsoft announced the price hike for the Office 365 apps in a blog post explaining the changes.\n\nYes, AI development is expensive, and I absolutely agree that we, as end users, have to pay for access. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a ChatGPT Plus subscriber and won\u2019t ditch that $20/month subscription anytime soon. If anything, I\u2019m ready to pay for additional AI products that might improve aspects of my life. Take Apple Intelligence; I\u2019ll keep buying expensive iPhones, iPads, and Macs, which will pay for Apple\u2019s AI.\n\nHowever, as a Microsoft 365 subscriber who has no interest in Copilot AI at this point, I\u2019m not too thrilled about potentially having to shell out an extra $3 per month for my Family subscription. AI should be optional rather than mandatory in all apps. So, is there a way to keep your current subscription price if you\u2019re like me and you don\u2019t want Copilot AI? Well, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nMicrosoft is forcing Copilot AI on millions of users\n\nMicrosoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers will get Copilot AI and a new Designer AI image generation app in most markets. This will lead to a price hike of $3 per month in the US, Microsoft\u2019s first price hike for the productivity bundle subscription in 12 years. You\u2019ll have to check your local Microsoft 365 portal to see the price increase in your local market.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMicrosoft says that most of its 84 million consumer subscribers will have access to Copilot in Office apps whether they want it or not.\n\nThe new Copilot AI integration is separate from the Microsoft Copilot Pro subscription, which costs $20 per month. Copilot will be available in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and the new Designer app.\n\nTo use the latter, Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers will use AI credits that come with their subscription. The monthly allotment of AI credits applies to all Office apps and should be \u201cenough for most subscribers.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s appreciate the good things\n\nMicrosoft knows that Copilot shouldn\u2019t always be active in Office apps, so it\u2019s giving users the ability to turn it off. That\u2019s good news for students who rely on Office apps for taking notes during class.\n\nAlso important here is Microsoft\u2019s commitment to privacy. I might not like the price hike because I don\u2019t plan to use Copilot AI in Office apps anytime soon, but I appreciate the fact that Microsoft will not use any Office app AI data to train its models:\n\nTo protect your privacy, we do not use your prompts, responses, or file content (such as Word documents or Excel spreadsheets) when you use Copilot in the Microsoft 365 apps to train our foundation models.\n\nYou can opt out, for now\n\nMicrosoft is aware that not all Office app users will want access to Copilot AI, so there are ways to opt out and keep your current subscription price. That\u2019s another thing I can appreciate. But there are big caveats here.\n\nFirst, you have to be an existing Microsoft 365 subscriber to opt out of the Copilot AI price hike. Second, you must enable recurring billing to avoid the price increase. Those who don\u2019t have it enabled, such as myself, won\u2019t be able to stick with the non-AI versions of the apps.\n\nUsers with recurring billing can switch to a Basic plan, or they can keep their current plan as it exists today by switching to the new Personal Classic or Family Classic plans \u201cfor a limited time.\u201d Once these plan options disappear, you\u2019ll only have access to Copilot AI plans.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019ll still be forced to pay for AI you might not want if you miss the opportunity to grab one of these limited-time plans.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s another big issue with the non-AI plans here. Microsoft says it will maintain the Basic and Classic plans \u201cas they exist today,\u201d but you risk not getting new features. For \u201ccertain new innovations and features you\u2019ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription,\u201d Microsoft says. Therefore, you\u2019ll need to pay that extra $3 per month, or whatever it converts to in your local currency.\n\nShould you cancel Microsoft 365?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think access to Copilot AI is a bad thing. It\u2019s certainly a great tool and much more useful than, say, AI chatbots ruining WhatsApp. As you can see in the examples above, Copilot can be quite helpful in all sorts of instances using Office apps.\n\nHowever, it should be up to the customer to choose to use AI. There\u2019s no reason for Microsoft not to continue supporting non-AI Office apps in the future other than greed. That\u2019s what it looks like, at least.\n\nAlso, since I\u2019ve defended Netflix price hikes in the past, I\u2019d do the same with Microsoft 365 prices if they were to go up.\n\nMy first reaction wasn\u2019t to cancel my subscription or opt for the non-Copilot Office experience. I wanted to ask family members in the group if they wanted any built-in AI access. But I can\u2019t even do that, considering that Copilot AI will only be available to me, the subscription owner.",

            "content": "Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kit that's capable of Microsoft 365 accounts with an aim to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes since at least October 2024.\n\nThe nascent phishing kit has been dubbed Sneaky 2FA by French cybersecurity company Sekoia, which detected it in the wild in December. Nearly 100 domains hosting Sneaky 2FA phishing pages have been identified as of this month, suggesting moderate adoption by threat actors.\n\n\"This kit is being sold as phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) by the cybercrime service 'Sneaky Log,' which operates through a fully-featured bot on Telegram,\" the company said in an analysis. \"Customers reportedly receive access to a licensed obfuscated version of the source code and deploy it independently.\"\n\nPhishing campaigns have been observed sending payment receipt-related emails to entice recipients into opening bogus PDF documents containing QR code that, upon scanning, redirects them to Sneaky 2FA pages.\n\nSekoia said the phishing pages are hosted on compromised infrastructure, mostly involving WordPress websites and other domains controlled by the attacker. The fake authentication pages are designed to automatically populate the victim's email address to elevate their legitimacy.\n\nThe kit also boasts of several anti-bot and anti-analysis measures, employing techniques like traffic filtering and Cloudflare Turnstile challenges to ensure that only victims who meet certain criteria are directed to the credential harvesting pages. It further runs a series of checks to detect and resist analysis attempts using web browser developer tools.\n\nA notable aspect of the PhaaS is that site visitors whose IP address originates from a data center, cloud provider, bot, proxy, or VPN are directed to a Microsoft-related Wikipedia page using the href[.]li redirection service. This behavior has led TRAC Labs to give it the name WikiKit.\n\n\"The Sneaky 2FA phishing kit employs several blurred images as the background for its fake Microsoft authentication pages,\" Sekoia explained. \"By using screenshots of legitimate Microsoft interfaces, this tactic is intended to deceive users into authenticating themselves to gain access to the blurred content.\"\n\nFurther investigation has revealed that the phishing kit relies on a check with a central server, likely the operator, that makes sure that the subscription is active. This indicates that only customers with a valid license key can use Sneaky 2FA to conduct phishing campaigns. The kit is advertised for $200 per month.\n\nThat's not all. Source code references have also been unearthed pointing to a phishing syndicate named W3LL Store, which was previously exposed by Group-IB in September 2023 as behind a phishing kit called W3LL Panel and various tools for conducting business email compromise (BEC) attacks.\n\nThis, along with similarities in the AitM relay implementation, has also raised the possibility that Sneaky 2FA may be based on the W3LL Panel. The latter also operates under a similar licensing model that requires periodic checks with a central server.\n\nSekoia researcher Gr\u00e9goire Clermont told The Hacker News that despite these overlaps, Sneaky 2FA cannot be considered a successor to W3LL Panel, as the threat actors behind the latter are still actively developing and selling their own phishing kit.\n\n\"Sneaky 2FA is a new kit that reused a few bits of code from W3LL OV6,\" Clermont said. \"That source code is not very difficult to obtain as customers of the service receive an archive of obfuscated code to host on their own servers. Several desobfuscated/cracked versions of W3LL have been circulated in the past years.\"\n\nIn an interesting twist, some of the Sneaky 2FA domains were previously associated with known AitM phishing kits, such as Evilginx2 and Greatness \u2013 an indication that at least a few cyber criminals have migrated to the new service.\n\n\"The phishing kit uses different hardcoded User-Agent strings for the HTTP requests depending on the step of the authentication flow,\" Sekoia researchers said. \"This behavior is rare in legitimate user authentication, as a user would have to perform successive steps of the authentication from different web browsers.\"\n\n\"While User-Agent transitions occasionally happen in legitimate situations (e.g., authentication initiated in desktop applications that launch a web browser or WebView to handle MFA), the specific sequence of User-Agents used by Sneaky 2FA does not correspond to a realistic scenario, and offers a high-fidelity detection of the kit.\"\n\n(The story was updated after publication to include additional responses from Sekoia.)",

These include advanced security with Microsoft Defender, creative tools like Microsoft Clipchamp, and countless enhancements to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook.\n\nWe\u2019re building on those 12 years of innovation by bringing Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Designer to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers in most markets worldwide.1 These changes bring the transformative power of AI to the personal productivity tools that millions of people use every day. Note: these changes only apply to our consumer subscription plans.\n\nThe next big step in our Copilot journey\n\nOur plan has always been to make Copilot in the Microsoft 365 apps more accessible to a wider audience at a great price. We planned several steps in our Copilot journey to listen, learn, and improve usability and performance. In January 2024, we started that journey by launching Microsoft Copilot Pro to our consumer early adopters, learning that access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 apps is a top reason for subscribing. And in October 2024, we launched a pilot of the changes we\u2019re announcing today in a small set of markets. We\u2019re officially taking the next big step by making Copilot part of our Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions. Most of our 84 million consumer subscribers will now have access to Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and the newly renamed Microsoft 365 Copilot app. We\u2019re delighted to empower millions of our customers with an AI assistant that supercharges the productivity apps they already know and love. We\u2019ll continue offering Copilot Pro for consumers with extensive usage needs, along with Microsoft 365 Copilot, our commercial offering, for organizations of all sizes.\n\nGet more out of Microsoft 365 apps with Copilot\n\nProductivity and creativity are at the heart of Microsoft 365, and with Copilot integration across our apps you\u2019re now equipped with an AI assistant that makes your life easier (and fun). Here are five scenarios to try with Copilot:\n\nNeed help with meal preparation for the week? With Copilot in Word, just enter your dietary preferences and servings, and Copilot will create a polished recipe ready for your kitchen.\n\nLooking to update your household budget for the new year? Ask Copilot in Excel to analyze your current budget spreadsheet, offer ideas, and set you off to a great start in 2025.\n\nTrying to string together a slideshow of your winter vacation to share with your family and friends? Give Copilot in PowerPoint some details about your vacation and watch it generate the narrative flow, slides, and design, then just add your favorite photos.\n\nFacing an email backlog from over the holidays? Don\u2019t sweat it. Copilot in Outlook can summarize lengthy email threads so you can get on with your day.\n\nHave a free-form \u201cbrain dump\u201d of all the things you want to get done in the new year? Copilot in OneNote can get them organized by summarizing, rewriting, or creating a task list for you.\n\nCreate and edit images with Microsoft Designer\n\nFurthermore, we\u2019re making our newest app, Microsoft Designer, part of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family by providing subscribers with the opportunity to do more image creation and editing than our free users. In addition to accessing Designer within apps like Word and PowerPoint, you can also use the standalone Designer app on the web and mobile. Use Designer to create eye-catching images by simply describing what you\u2019re looking for or choosing from pre-populated ideas. Plus, expertly edit your photos with AI by erasing unwanted objects with ease. Here are two scenarios to try with Designer:\n\nDid you capture some holiday memories along with a few holiday distractions? Simply open Designer and upload your photo to edit with AI. You can easily select unwanted objects and watch Designer use AI to remove them from the photo.\n\nCapturing your favorite recipes in a recipe book and need to bring them to life? Describe your dish and Copilot in Word will use Designer to create a unique image that complements your recipe.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers will receive a monthly allotment of AI credits to use Copilot in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. The credits can also be used for AI image generation and editing in Designer and in other AI-powered apps like Paint, Photos, and Notepad on a device running Windows. The monthly allotment should be enough for most subscribers. For Microsoft 365 Family subscribers, Copilot will be available to the subscription owner and cannot be shared with others. Those who frequently use Copilot can upgrade to Copilot Pro, without worrying about usage limits. Learn more about AI credits.\n\nWe\u2019re also committed to giving our customers control over their experience and know there are times when AI assistance isn\u2019t desired (like in some academic scenarios), so we\u2019re adding settings in apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allow you to disable or enable Copilot as needed.\n\nTo reflect the extensive subscription benefits that we\u2019ve added over the past 12 years and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come, we\u2019re increasing the prices of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family in the US for the first time since its release by $3 USD per month (visit our store to see local pricing). Existing subscribers won\u2019t experience the price increase until their next renewal.\n\nFinally, we understand that our customers have a variety of needs and budgets, so we\u2019re committed to providing options. Existing subscribers with recurring billing enabled with Microsoft can switch to plans without Copilot or AI credits like our Basic plan, or, for a limited time, to new Personal Classic or Family Classic plans. These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you\u2019ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription.\n\nCommitted to AI privacy\n\nWe recognize that our customers have questions about AI privacy, including how we train our AI models. Transparency is one of our six responsible AI principles, so we\u2019re sharing more details here. To protect your privacy, we do not use your prompts, responses, or file content (such as Word documents or Excel spreadsheets) when you use Copilot in the Microsoft 365 apps to train our foundation models.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Personal and Family Leverage Copilot within your favorite Microsoft 365 apps. Get started today\n\nAccessing Copilot in Microsoft 365 Personal and Family\n\nExisting Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers in most markets will automatically get access to Copilot in their apps once they update to the latest version.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, sign up directly from Microsoft or via your favorite retailer.\n\n1 App availability varies by device/language. Features vary by platform. Minimum age limits may apply to use of AI features. AI features only available to subscription owner and cannot be shared. Copilot features in Outlook apply to accounts with @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com email addresses and are available in Outlook.com, Outlook built into Windows, Outlook on Mac, and iOS and Android apps. Usage limits apply. Learn more.",

This attack vector is a significant change in the group\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as it has normally relied on email in the past.\n\nThe group, via phishing campaigns, typically targets individuals and organizations relevant to government, diplomacy, defense policy, and international relations research, particularly when these activities involve Russia. Historically, they have also targeted civil society organizations \u2014 including journalists, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations \u2014 aiming to exfiltrate sensitive information and disrupt operations.\n\nIn a campaign observed in mid-November 2024, Star Blizzard\u2019s initial approach involved sending emails purportedly from a U.S. government official, containing a QR code said to direct recipients to information on supporting Ukrainian NGOs. The QR code, however, was intentionally broken, prompting targets to respond for an alternative link. The follow-up communication included a malicious shortened link, designed to deceive targets into believing they were joining a WhatsApp group. In reality, the link led to a phishing website using WhatsApp\u2019s account-linking QR code feature. This maneuver enables the threat actor to gain unauthorized access to victims\u2019 WhatsApp messages via its web messaging platform, potentially compromising the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive communications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis operation by Star Blizzard, which is believed to be an operational unit within Russia FSB\u2019s Center 18, follows Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s collaborative efforts in October to shut down over 180 websites tied to the group\u2019s previous campaigns. While these actions temporarily hindered Star Blizzard\u2019s phishing operations, the threat actor quickly transitioned to new domains, underscoring their resilience and adaptability in the face of law enforcement\u2019s actions.\n\nMicrosoft assesses that the group\u2019s targeting of WhatsApp accounts is likely a response to the exposure of its previous TTPs, aiming to evade detection by cybersecurity agencies. The company says there is a silver lining: this particular campaign stopped at the end of November. Microsoft did not provide any evidence to support why the operation suddenly stopped.\n\nWhether it\u2019s email or WhatsApp, Microsoft warns those who may be targeted to be vigilant about messages that link to external networks. The company says people in the following roles should be especially careful:\n\nGovernment or diplomacy (incumbent and former position holders)\n\nResearch into defense policy or international relations when related to Russia\n\nAssistance to Ukraine related to the ongoing conflict with Russia\n\n\u201cWhen in doubt, contact the person you think is sending the email using a known and previously used email address to verify that the email was indeed sent by them,\u201d the company states in its blog.",

According to Statcounter, 63 percent still run Windows 10, while only 34 percent have upgraded to Windows 11. The low adoption rate is largely due to Windows 11 system requirements like a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) that PC users are unable or unwilling to comply with.\n\nNonetheless, Microsoft has made it clear that upgrading is the only option.

            "content": "In mid-November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the Russian threat actor we track as Star Blizzard sending their typical targets spear-phishing messages, this time offering the supposed opportunity to join a WhatsApp group. This is the first time we have identified a shift in Star Blizzard\u2019s longstanding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to leverage a new access vector. Star Blizzard\u2019s targets are most commonly related to government or diplomacy (both incumbent and former position holders), defense policy or international relations researchers whose work touches on Russia, and sources of assistance to Ukraine related to the war with Russia.\n\nIn our last blog post about Star Blizzard, we discussed how the threat actor targeted dozens of civil society organizations\u2014journalists, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\u2014between January 2023 and August 2024 by deploying spear-phishing campaigns to exfiltrate sensitive information and interfere in their activities. Since October 3, 2024, Microsoft and the US Department of Justice have seized or taken down more than 180 websites related to that activity. While this coordinated action had a short-term impact on Star Blizzard\u2019s phishing operations, we noted at the time that after this threat actor\u2019s active infrastructure was exposed, they swiftly transitioned to new domains to continue their operations, indicating that the threat actor is highly resilient to operational disruptions.\n\nWe assess the threat actor\u2019s shift to compromising WhatsApp accounts is likely in response to the exposure of their TTPs by Microsoft Threat Intelligence and other organizations, including national cybersecurity agencies. While this campaign appears to have wound down at the end of November, we are highlighting the new shift as a sign that the threat actor could be seeking to change its TTPs in order to evade detection.\n\nAs part of our continuous monitoring, analysis, and reporting on the threat landscape, we are sharing our information on Star Blizzard\u2019s latest activity to raise awareness of this threat actor\u2019s shift in tradecraft and to educate organizations on how to harden their attack surfaces against this and similar activity. We also directly notify customers who have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to help secure their environments.\n\nTargeting WhatsApp account data\n\nStar Blizzard\u2019s new spear-phishing campaign, while novel in that it uses and targets WhatsApp for the first time, exhibits familiar spear-phishing TTPs for Star Blizzard, with the threat actor initiating email contact with their targets, to engage them, before sending them a second message containing a malicious link. The sender address used by the threat actor in this campaign impersonates a US government official, continuing Star Blizzard\u2019s practice of impersonating known political/diplomatic figures, to further ensure target engagement. The initial email sent to targets contains a quick response (QR) code purporting to direct users to join a WhatsApp group on \u201cthe latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine NGOs.\u201d This code, however, is intentionally broken and will not direct the user towards any valid domain; this is an effort to coax the target recipient into responding.\n\nFigure 1. Star Blizzard initial spear-phishing email with broken QR code\n\nWhen the recipient responds, Star Blizzard sends a second email containing a Safe Links-wrapped t[.]ly shortened link as the alternative link to join the WhatsApp group.\n\nFigure 2. Star Blizzard follow-on spear-phishing email with URL link\n\nWhen this link is followed, the target is redirected to a webpage asking them to scan a QR code to join the group. However, this QR code is actually used by WhatsApp to connect an account to a linked device and/or the WhatsApp Web portal. This means that if the target follows the instructions on this page, the threat actor can gain access to the messages in their WhatsApp account and have the capability to exfiltrate this data using existing browser plugins, which are designed for exporting WhatsApp messages from an account accessed via WhatsApp Web.\n\nFigure 3. Malicious Star Blizzard phish attempt using WhatsApp linking QR code\n\nWhile this campaign was limited and appeared to have terminated at the end of November, it nevertheless marked a break in long-standing Star Blizzard TTPs and highlighted the threat actor\u2019s tenacity in continuing spear-phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information even in the face of repeated degradations of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence recommends that all email users belonging to sectors that Star Blizzard typically targets always remain vigilant when dealing with email, especially emails containing links to external resources. These targets are most commonly related to:\n\nGovernment or diplomacy (incumbent and former position holders)\n\nResearch into defense policy or international relations when related to Russia\n\nAssistance to Ukraine related to the ongoing conflict with Russia\n\nWhen in doubt, contact the person you think is sending the email using a known and previously used email address to verify that the email was indeed sent by them.\n\nMitigations\n\nTo harden networks against the Star Blizzard activity listed above, defenders can implement the following:\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nThe following alerts might indicate threat activity associated with this threat. These alerts, however, can be triggered by unrelated threat activity and are not monitored in the status cards provided with this report.\n\nStar Blizzard activity group\n\nHunting queries\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR\n\nSurface events that may have communicated with the Star Blizzard C2s.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with \u2018TI map\u2019) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.\n\nWhile the below queries are not linked to any specific threat actor, they are effective in detecting potential phishing attempts. Implementing these queries can help you stay vigilant and safeguard your organization from phishing attacks\n\nMicrosoft Security Copilot\n\nSecurity Copilot customers can use the standalone experience to create their own prompts or run the following pre-built promptbooks to automate incident response or investigation tasks related to this threat:\n\nIncident investigation\n\nMicrosoft User analysis\n\nThreat actor profile\n\nThreat Intelligence 360 report based on MDTI article\n\nNote that some promptbooks require access to plugins for Microsoft products such as Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nThreat intelligence reports\n\nMicrosoft customers can use the following reports in Microsoft products to get the most up-to-date information about the threat actor, malicious activity, and techniques discussed in this blog. These reports provide the intelligence, protection information, and recommended actions to prevent, mitigate, or respond to associated threats found in customer environments.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Threat Intelligence\n\nMicrosoft Security Copilot customers can also use the Microsoft Security Copilot integration in Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, either in the Security Copilot standalone portal or in the embedded experience in the Microsoft Defender portal to get more information about this threat actor.\n\nIndicators of compromise\n\nIndicator Type Last seen civilstructgeo[.]org Domain October 2024 aerofluidthermo[.]org Domain October 2024\n\nReferences\n\nLearn more\n\nFor further information on the threats detailed in this blog post, refer to these additional Microsoft blogs:\n\nFor the latest security research from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community, check out the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Blog: https://aka.ms/threatintelblog.\n\nTo get notified about new publications and to join discussions on social media, follow us on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-threat-intelligence, and on X (formerly Twitter) at https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel.\n\nTo hear stories and insights from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence community about the ever-evolving threat landscape, listen to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence podcast: https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/microsoft-threat-intelligence.",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nEmployee expectations and priorities have shifted in the new hybrid workplace. In Microsoft\u2019s September 2022 Work Trend Index Pulse Report\u2014a study of 20,000 people in 11 countries\u201448 percent of those surveyed reported that they feel burned out at work. Prior data from Microsoft\u2019s March 2022 Work Trend Index\u2014a study of 31,000 people in 31 countries\u2014revealed that 53 percent of the participants prioritize health and wellbeing over work more than they did 3 years ago.\n\nA positive culture along with personal wellbeing and mental health are among the top aspects of work that employees view as \u201cvery important\u201d for an employer to provide. Many elements of hybrid workplace culture contribute to the success of an organization, including:\n\nPromoting employee wellbeing\n\nFostering connection and fulfillment\n\nImproving meeting effectiveness\n\nDeveloping inclusive and adaptable hybrid work plans\n\nAt Microsoft, we\u2019re evolving the employee experience to meet the needs of today\u2019s digitally connected, distributed workforce. We\u2019re using Microsoft Viva Insights and Glint as one way to assess and address the critical needs of the hybrid workplace and increase engagement, collaboration, and productivity for all our employees and for our managers and leaders.\n\n[Visit our Microsoft Viva content suite to learn how we\u2019re deploying Viva internally at Microsoft.]\n\nInsights for individuals\n\nWe use the Personal insights feature in Microsoft Viva Insights to help our employees individually prioritize wellbeing and improve personal productivity in the flow of work. The statistics and insights that are generated from your data are for your eyes only. They give you recommendations and opportunities throughout your day that you can choose to act on. For example:\n\nThe Microsoft Viva Insights Outlook add-in recommends that an employee book dedicated preparation time for upcoming meetings on their calendar. It provides a similar reminder after responding to a meeting invitation.\n\nAn employee can wrap up tasks during a virtual commute and log off for the day, silencing mobile notifications from Outlook and Teams during their off-work hours.\n\nOur employees\u2019 personal data is always kept private. We want every employee to know that personal reflections, dashboards, and insights about their own work habits are always available only to them.\n\nInsights for managers and leaders\n\nLeaders and managers use Microsoft Viva Insights to leverage data in making informed decisions that promote employee wellbeing and business success. With Viva Insights managers and leaders gain a more profound understanding of how work impacts their teams and individuals, enabling them to evaluate their leadership practices and pinpoint opportunities for development. They can then take corrective measures, like developing shared focus plans to create positive changes in their teams.\n\nWhether it\u2019s for our managers and leaders, or for our employees, we\u2019re very serious about privacy.\n\nPrivacy by design\n\nMicrosoft Viva Insights protects our users\u2019 privacy by design. It analyzes data from everyday work in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Graph to surface objective metrics that describe how work gets done. Viva Insights uses de-identification, aggregation, and differential privacy to offer a balance between providing useful information and protecting individual privacy.\n\nDifferential privacy is an open platform for data differential privacy, developed in collaboration between Microsoft and Harvard\u2019s Institute for Social Science. Differential privacy uses sophisticated methods for data variation and randomization to ensure that no individual activity or metric is visible to a manager or organization leader.\n\nMicrosoft Viva Insights also adheres to local regulations for data privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nEngaging employees and encouraging wellbeing\n\nWe want our employees to thrive. We\u2019re focusing on wellbeing and productivity for all employees. We\u2019re using the capabilities of Microsoft Viva Insights to provide our employees with actionable recommendations that help employees work smarter, build better habits, and achieve balance in the workplace.\n\nCreating deeper engagement with Customer Zero\n\nMicrosoft is the first and best customer of its own products. We are \u201cCustomer Zero.\u201d As a large enterprise customer and employer, many of the issues Microsoft faces when deploying its own products are not unique. They are shared by other large multinational enterprises, and even by small-and-midsized customers.\n\nWe collaborate closely with the Microsoft Viva Insights product development team to share employee feedback that improves the experience. As part of the Customer Zero partnership, our implementation teams get early access to new features and a chance to provide input into the product roadmap. This enables our own internal experts at Microsoft to provide industry-relevant context and feedback into the Viva Insights development process.\n\nAs Customer Zero for Microsoft Viva Insights, we have a unique opportunity to inform product development by aligning closely with the Viva Insights product team and internal business groups such as Engineering, HR, and Finance. These internal business groups identify the challenges they are facing that Viva Insights could help to solve. This partnership grants us the ability to address these challenges through early and extensive feedback to the product team. For example, our implementation teams recognized early in our adoption process that we needed more granular admin controls to balance speed of deployment with the need to review new experiences in many EU countries. We continued to partner with the Viva Insights engineering team to develop these, and other controls, that we believe will enable even greater adoption and engagement by our customers globally.\n\nPartnering for successful change\n\nThe journey to increased employee wellbeing and productivity with Microsoft Viva Insights involves our entire organization and the vision for a better understanding of our organization requires intentional strategies for change management, communication, and adoption.\n\nActivating change in a large organization requires the correct stakeholders and partnerships across the organization. Executive sponsors, program managers, communications, IT specialists, early adopters and others were all critical to the successful deployment and adoption of Viva Insights within Microsoft.\n\nSo much of the core focus of Viva Insights is influenced by HR, by organization culture. Our focus is on wellbeing and productivity, but that can look different from organization to organization. Our HR teams were instrumental in helping define the specifics of what makes our organization work, from how we define the term manager to how employees might work across multiple teams and internal organizations. \u2014Steve Reay, principal product manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nTogether, we established clear agreement on critical aspects of the employee experience, aligning expectations, language, and focus for the implementation of Viva Insights. Some of these aspects included:\n\nHow does the employee experience align with our purpose, brand, and culture?\n\nHow do we support coaching, development, and optimization of the employee experience?\n\nDo employees feel empowered to set boundaries on work and home life?\n\nThe answers to these questions helped our teams align with existing cultural initiatives and the broader work culture fostered by Microsoft Human Resources, a key partner. Microsoft HR played an important part in communications and strategy for Viva Insights, and how Viva Insights integrated with our culture. Steve Reay is a principal product manager for Microsoft Digital.\n\n\u201cSo much of the core focus of Viva Insights is influenced by HR, by organization culture,\u201d Reay says. He emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all with Viva Insights. \u201cOur focus is on wellbeing and productivity, but that can look different from organization to organization,\u201d he says. \u201cOur HR teams were instrumental in helping define the specifics of what makes our organization work, from how we define the term manager to how employees might work across multiple teams and internal organizations.\u201d\n\nWe used a hybrid change management approach by using centralized communications alongside activities driven by local adoption teams. This hybrid approach helped simplify and unify overarching communications while allowing the local adoption teams to reinforce the messaging while aligning with local initiatives and work culture. Local change management was instrumental to creating the most effective, productive, and enjoyable employee experience with Microsoft Viva Insights while also ensuring local regulations data and privacy regulations were met.\n\nEnsuring privacy and compliance with partnership\n\nOur end-to-end collaboration with our workers\u2019 councils is boosting Microsoft product and service rollouts in our European Union regions. For example, including employee representatives in the rollout process was critical in helping Microsoft Viva Insights accurately measure the pulse of our organization. Workers\u2019 councils in our European regions played a significant part in our Customer Zero process and in our larger change management strategy for Viva Insights.\n\nDeploying any new tool at Microsoft requires a thorough vetting of the technology to ensure that employees\u2019 privacy is protected. Data privacy compliance regulations vary from region to region. In some EU countries and regions, our employees have formed workers\u2019 councils\u2014representative bodies elected by our employees and with whom we actively partner to ensure the appropriate review and implementation of workplace technologies, like Viva Insights.\n\nMicrosoft Viva Insights supports productivity and wellbeing by supplying behavioral data and intelligent recommendations directly to employees themselves. Private information doesn\u2019t go beyond their own inboxes. Still, we needed our workers\u2019 councils to sign off, both when we initially deployed Microsoft Viva Insights, and going forward, when we update it.\n\nIn this case, two related points help us partner well with our workers\u2019 councils. First, the agile, modular design of Microsoft Viva Insights allows our product team to deploy new features without waiting for major product updates.\n\nSecond, because we work closely with them, we\u2019re able to get our workers\u2019 council representatives to quickly review new features and updates, and as long as they are aligned to core privacy and labor principles we\u2019ve established in partnership with the works councils, we\u2019re able to deploy them more rapidly than we could in the past. This is saving Microsoft employees hundreds of hours per year in EU regions and is speeding up overall deployment of new features.\n\nIf our workers\u2019 council representatives raise concerns we cannot quickly address, we can use the assignment of the manager role to remove those experiences in the given country or remove the Microsoft Viva Insights Service Plan for those employees.\n\nPutting Viva Insights to work\n\nMicrosoft Viva Insights has impacted internal business group team culture across the organization by enabling our teams to establish work patterns and expectations for the entire team. For example, one of our internal business groups teams set their work calendar from 9am to 3pm, Pacific Standard Time. They made a conscious choice to allow the team members to have breakfast and dinner with their families without worrying about work communications creating an interruption. They didn\u2019t have to guess at time zones, and they didn\u2019t have to make assumptions about when it was OK to send an email.\n\nHaving the preparation details for an upcoming meeting delivered directly to me not only improves my productivity, but it makes me more confident. It directly increased my wellbeing. \u2014Microsoft Viva Insights power user, Microsoft Human Resources\n\nWith Microsoft Viva Insights, the team has established a twice weekly focus time block of two hours for each team member. This choice and pattern make it easier for the team members to schedule focus time and know that they have the leadership backing to protect that focus time and establish the wellbeing rhythms that make them productive, the team also dedicates each Friday as a meeting-free day so the team members can focus on items that they might have outstanding before the week is over.\n\nAn internal power user within HR has been using Viva Insights in this context for the past 15 months. \u201cHaving the preparation details for an upcoming meeting delivered directly to me not only improves my productivity, but it makes me more confident. It directly increased my wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe team has also been using Viva Insights to set objectives for habits that they want to build as individuals. One of the most common goals has been recognizing colleagues by sending Praise through Viva Insights. Each time a team member is in the Viva Insights interface, they are reminded to encourage and send praise to their team members. This builds sense of value, contribution, recognition, and value across the team.\n\nOur adoption of Microsoft Viva Insights at Microsoft has been both based on integration with existing HR programs and building the product into the flow of work rather than driving it as a new tool or experience. Viva Insights supports and affirms behavior that improves wellbeing and productivity. In putting Viva Insights to work, we learned valuable lessons, including:\n\nImplementation and adoption are long term processes. Communication, education, and feedback mechanisms should be in place throughout the lifetime of Viva Insights to foster understanding and engagement.\n\nIntegrating Microsoft Viva Insights with existing people, priorities, and practices that your organization is working toward is very helpful. Viva Insights meets employees where they work, enabling them to use commonly used tools like Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams.\n\nUse a hybrid approach to change management with centralized and localized communication and encouragement. Support early adopters and share success stories and best practices.\n\nMoving forward\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to use Microsoft Viva Insights to guide individuals and teams toward better work habits and norms to improve productivity and wellbeing. Personalized insights provided to our employees help them to improve their wellbeing and productivity within the flow of work. Our organization is using broader insights to champion beneficial organization practices, bring our hybrid workforce together and address complex challenges our business is facing. However, we\u2019re not done. Viva Insights is a catalyst for positive change at Microsoft, and we\u2019ll continue working with the product group as Customer Zero to ensure that opportunities to assess and improve wellbeing and productivity increase for every Viva Insights customer.\n\n\n\nWhen introducing Viva Insights to an organization some of the key takeaways would be:",

            "content": "GSA secures landmark agreement with Microsoft to enhance federal IT acquisition\n\nWashington \u2014 The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced today that Microsoft and IT Vendor Management Office (ITVMO) have finalized an Agreement in Principle under the Governmentwide Microsoft Acquisition Strategy (GMAS). This agreement represents a significant milestone in the federal government\u2019s effort to streamline IT acquisition processes and strengthen cybersecurity standards across federal government agencies.\n\nThe GMAS initiative, spearheaded by the GSA\u2019s ITVMO, brings together the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies to discuss standard terms and conditions and cost reduction strategies available in government transactions for software or services. Microsoft\u2019s commitment to this effort ensures a unified approach offering consistent benefits to agencies regardless of size or purchasing method.\n\n\u201cThis agreement sets the foundation for an efficient, secure, and cost-effective federal IT ecosystem,\u201d said Laura Stanton, Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Information Technology Category at GSA. \u201cThe GMAS program exemplifies how collaboration with industry can drive innovation and deliver significant value to government and taxpayers alike.\u201d\n\nKey elements of the GMAS initiative include:\n\nEstablish, improve, and better understand standardized terms and conditions through governmentwide engagement to best align with the government\u2019s mission.\n\nEnhanced cybersecurity measures addressing critical risks in government IT systems.\n\nCommitments to develop enhanced governmentwide support and education capabilities.\n\nTo ensure that U.S. Government agencies achieve optimal value from their investments and can manage cloud services and associated costs more efficiently, Microsoft, in partnership with the ITVMO, is offering a series of government-wide workshops. These workshops will focus on cost management, governance, cross-tenant access, and conditional access controls, empowering agencies to enhance multi-agency collaboration capabilities while strengthening their security posture.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is proud to partner with GSA to identify key areas of efficiency in contracting and technology procurement to ensure federal agencies and taxpayers alike are getting maximum value from their industry partners,\u201d said Candice Ling, Senior Vice President for Microsoft\u2019s Federal business. \u201cMicrosoft has been a key technology partner to the U.S. government for more than 40 years and this landmark agreement is a testament to the relationship and trust our two organizations have established in that time.\u201d\n\nAs part of the rollout, the ITVMO will provide additional resources to help agencies maximize the benefits of this agreement. In addition to upcoming guides and training sessions to ensure contracting officers and IT acquisition professionals are fully equipped to implement the new terms effectively, the ITVMO will offer hands-on support to Agencies through the Contract Review Service to support individual requests for acquisition implementation strategies.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s participation underscores the importance of a strategic partnership between the federal government and one of its largest technology providers. This alignment is a critical step toward greater efficiency and security.\n\nGeneral questions related to GMAS may be directed to ITVMO@gsa.gov.\n\n###\n\nAbout GSA: GSA provides centralized procurement and shared services for the federal government, managing a nationwide real estate portfolio of nearly 360 million rentable square feet, overseeing more than $110 billion in products and services via federal contracts, and delivering technology services that serve millions of people across dozens of federal agencies.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft plans to launch a pay-as-you-go Copilot plan for organizations looking to try out AI agents, according to a Wednesday announcement.\n\nThe offering, dubbed Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat , is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o and enables users to automate repetitive tasks. Customers can create agents in Copilot Studio that act independently, leveraging third party data, web data or shared data.\n\nMicrosoft said the flexible plan can serve as an \u201con-ramp\u201d for users to easily access and engage with AI agents as part of Copilot\u2019s capabilities. The pay-as-you-go plan does not include access to Copilot in Teams, Outlook, Word, Excel or PowerPoint. Image generation and file upload limits apply.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s newest AI offering comes as businesses are underlining the need for guardrails on tech spend. Analysts and industry experts sounded the alarm last year on cost creep related to AI usage.\n\nNearly 4 in 5 U.S.-based organizations experienced higher software costs in 2024, according to a Forrester report published in July. The majority of tech leaders blamed new features, like AI, for the increase.\n\nAdding the technology to workflows is a challenge, too. Nearly three-quarters of IT leaders agree that Copilot users find it difficult to integrate the tool into their daily routine, according to a Gartner pulse survey of 123 IT leaders. More than one-third recognized Copilot\u2019s benefits but thought the tool was unlikely to live up to its promises.\n\nSurging costs have dampened some of generative AI\u2019s hype, especially as businesses grappled with ROI, adding pressure for CIOs to demonstrate the value of the costly initiatives.\n\nThe majority of corporate executives plan to invest between $50 million and $250 million in generative AI in the next year, according to a KPMG survey. More than 80% of organizations are exploring or piloting AI agents.\n\nMicrosoft expanded its agent portfolio in November during the company\u2019s Ignite 2024 conference, adding capabilities to ease development and strengthen security controls. Toyota Motor Corporation was one of the technology\u2019s early adopters and rolled out nine agents to facilitate knowledge sharing.\n\nWhile enterprise interest in agents exists, most CIOs say they have work to do before jumping in. Nearly 9 in 10 organizations admit to needing tech stack upgrades, according to a Tray.ai survey.\n\nVendors are likely to step in and try to bridge gaps to boost adoption in 2025.",

And in many cases, upgrading to Windows 11 will require upgrading your machine too.\n\nThat\u2019s because Windows 11 has some pretty hefty hardware requirements that millions of older machines can\u2019t meet, and Microsoft has already confirmed it has no intention of budging those prerequisites.\n\nIt\u2019s so confident in the move that Yusef Mehdi, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer declared 2025 the \u201cyear of the Windows 11 PC refresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether the current PC needs a refresh, or it has security vulnerabilities that require the latest hardware-backed protection, now is the time to move forward with a new Windows 11 PC,\u201d he wrote in another blog post, earlier this month.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that some of the machines that won\u2019t reach those minimum hardware requirements could be approaching 10 years old, and could probably do with an upgrade anyway. But it\u2019s also true that the sheer number of Windows 10 machines out there\u2014data published by Statcounter in December 2024 suggests there are almost double the number of PCs running Windows 10 than Windows 11\u2014means getting them all switched over before support ends is unlikely.\n\nThere is some good news for any Windows 10 users hoping to cling on and still use their Office apps. Just like the operating system itself, Microsoft 365 won\u2019t fall off a cliff and stop working come October 14. Microsoft has confirmed that Office apps \u201cwill continue to function as before,\u201d but that there could be \u201cperformance and reliability issues over time\u201d as security and feature updates stop coming through.\n\nIf this is your tactic, it might be worth considering Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates, which are being offered to consumers for the first time. Users can pay $30 to keep their PC secure with updates for a year, while businesses can protect their machines for up to three. It won't stop your apps from falling out of date, of course, but will at least help to keep the nasties out while you plot your next move.",

This will happen when Microsoft ends Windows 10 support, which seems slated to cause unprecedented levels of completely unnecessary e-waste, because apparently (at least according to Microsoft!) every PC made before TPM 2.0 modules belongs in the trash.\n\n\n\nNow, is it fair to expect Microsoft to support Windows 10 forever? No. However, dropping support for Windows 11 simply means that the company will no longer continue to deliver security updates and bug fixes \u2014 not that your PC will become a brick after Oct. 14. But Microsoft 365 is partially web-based, so Microsoft can cut off support \u2014 and will, according to the blog post, which states that \"To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11.\"\n\n\n\nYou can download the Office apps to your PC, but you need to connect to the internet once every 31 days or the apps go into reduced functionality mode, so, presumably, you'll have 31 days from Oct. 14. This won't, of course, apply to the fully web-based browser versions of the apps.\n\n\n\nBut dropping support for a suite of applications that currently work perfectly fine on Windows 10 for paying subscribers when the support for the OS ends is certainly not a very consumer-friendly move. Microsoft's blog post pushes users toward a free Windows 11 upgrade, but the fact of the matter is that if you're currently running Windows 10 and you want to be running Windows 11 \u2014 there's probably a reason. If you haven't upgraded to Windows 11, you either don't want to or you don't have hardware with TPM 2.0 support. You can, of course, bypass Windows 11's TPM 2.0 requirement, but it's not the easy upgrade Microsoft suggest it is.\n\n\n\nIt's good that third parties like 0Patch are willing to keep supporting the security of Windows 10 users, but that clearly won't be enough to keep the full functionality of Windows 10 present for its current users. Even Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program won't save you from the company dropping Microsoft 365 access.\n\n\n\nIf you rely on Microsoft 365, I recommend moving as much of your workflow to either Google Drive or open-source office software such as LibreOffice as soon as possible. Business customers should be pretty well-served by Google Apps, regardless of their OS, for quite some time.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Putting the reins in Obsidian\u2019s hands to make a fantasy RPG sounds like a dream come true. But if you search on any official Xbox social media page, there\u2019s hardly even a mention of it. Does this mean that it\u2019s going to be a bad product? Absolutely not, it\u2019s not indicative of anything besides being far too lax when they should be much more aggressively pushing their products. We\u2019ve all heard that everything is an Xbox loud and clear. But, we need to know when we can play the upcoming big games on our Smart Fridges, Microsoft.\n\nChecking on their official X page, there\u2019s plenty of talk about the original Diablo coming to PC Game Pass, an advertisement for Tomb Raider Remastered, and even some talk about PGA Tour 2K25. But nary a mention about Avowed or anything beyond the Xbox Developer Direct.\n\nScreenshot: Microsoft\n\n2025 Is Looking Like a Great Year To Be an Xbox Fan, but Their Advertising Strategy Needs a Makeover\n\nThere\u2019s been several leaks from reputable sources that claim 2025 is going to be the year of Xbox. A possible Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster looks more realistic by the day. Games like South of Midnight and Fable will bring in plenty of new players. As long as people know when these games are coming out, that is. It\u2019s time to shift from confirming which Smart Home accessories can play Game Pass games to letting us know when we can play the games themselves.\n\nSure, the Xbox Home Screen contains advertisements for anything from Old Spice to the latest Game Pass trends. But even looking there currently, I have nothing showing me that Avowed is on the way. It\u2019s a shame because that game seems like it\u2019s going to be fantastic. But watching social media users constantly saying they\u2019re not even sure when the game is coming out? It\u2019s looking like another recipe for disaster.\n\nI happily use my Xbox on a near-daily basis. It\u2019s a great console; powerful, fancy, and quick to heat up my office when the furnace isn\u2019t working correctly. But if someone who has access to Press Releases and other forms of information doesn\u2019t remember when the next big Xbox game is coming out, what makes Microsoft think other folks will?

Adobe, as an example, as dropped updates for Photoshop, Substance3D Stager, Illustrator for iPad, Animate and Adobe Substance3D Designer.\n\n\u201cPatching vulnerabilities should not be a solo endeavour in the enterprise and, if it is, it may be time to talk to your leadership about staffing and tooling changes.\u201d\n\nZero-days Among the bumper crop of vulnerabilities are no less than eight zero-days, three that are known to have been exploited in the wild, and 11 critical flaws. This month\u2019s zero-days are as follows: CVE-2025-21333, an elevation of privilege (EoP) vuln in Windows Hyper-V NT Kernel VSP;\n\nCVE-2025-21334, a second EoP vulnerability in the same service;\n\nCVE-2025-21335, a third EoP vulnerability in the same service. These flaws in Windows Hyper-V NT Kernel VSP are known to have been exploited in the wild, but these exploits have not yet been made public, while for the remaining five, the opposite is true. These are: CVE-2025-21186, a remote code execution (RCE) flaw in Microsoft Access;\n\nCVE-2025-21275, an EoP flaw in Windows App Package Installer;\n\nCVE-2025-21308, a spoofing flaw in Windows Themes;\n\nCVE-2025-21366, a second RCE flaw in Microsoft Access;\n\nCVE-2025-21395, a third RCE flaw in Microsoft Access. Saaed Abbasi, vulnerability manager at the Qualys Threat Research Unit, said timely patching of the Hyper-V issues was critical since they are under active attack. \u201cThey allow an authenticated user to elevate privileges to SYSTEM and let them take complete control of the affected environment,\u201d said Abbasi. \u201cUsually, moving from guest to host/hypervisor indicates a CVSS [Common Vulnerability Scoring System] scope change, but Microsoft\u2019s current disclosure has not explicitly confirmed this, suggesting further details are needed; this could jeopardise the entire host infrastructure, not just the individual VM [virtual machine].\u201d A threat actor able to achieve SYSTEM-level privileges is a grave concern to defenders, because it opens the door to other actions \u2013 such as disabling on-board security tooling, or credential dumping to pivot across domains within the target environment.

Microsoft Teams now boast over 300 million users.\n\nSource: https://www.communicationsquare.com/news/microsoft-teams-vs-slack/\n\nWith the ever-growing utilization of Teams and its seamless integration with various applications, organizations are faced with the challenge of effectively navigating the complexities of record management.\n\n\n\nDuring our recent webinar, \"Get Ahead of the Game: Managing MS Teams Records for Compliance and Legal Purposes,\" Peter Callaghan, CRO of Pagefreezer, and Richard Jeffrey Cook, Head of Records Management and Consultancy of In-Form Consult, delved into the intricacies of managing Microsoft Teams records to meet compliance and legal requirements.\n\nKeep reading to discover the highlights from their discussion or click the button below to watch the webinar in full.\n\nWatch the webinar\n\nDrivers for MS Teams Information Governance\n\nThe main drivers when it comes to managing the data on Microsoft Teams are legislation and regulation, governance, and efficiency.\n\nLegislation and Regulation: Compliance and legal requirements differ based on the country, industry regulations, and data protection rules. In the English public sector, the Freedom of Information Act, Data Protection Act, and the Public Records Act in Scotland, to name but a few, all outline requirements for the storage of information or the disposal of information that contain personal data when no longer required.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the specific requirements and whether the information is captured or generated within Microsoft Teams, the ultimate goal is to ensure that records are consistently stored in a way that maintains their authenticity and allows for easy retrieval, even years later. Internal Governance: Organizations themselves may also impose internal policies to ensure staff are managing information in the proper manner. Efficiency in the storage, search, and disposal of records: Efficiency plays a significant role in managing Teams effectively. Cook highlighted the common challenge of information being recreated because finding existing information is considered too difficult. Recreated information is often of poor quality compared to the original data.\n\n\"Finding existing information is considered too difficult... typically, when information is recreated, it's actually of poorer quality than the original information that the organization already holds.\"\n\n\u2014 Richard Jeffrey Cook\n\nCook also stressed the importance of being able to find critical information within hundreds and thousands of records quickly. It's easy to find something that was created yesterday, but much more challenging to locate something that a colleague created 13 months ago. Efficiently locating and utilizing accurate and up-to-date information saves time and reduces errors.\n\n\"Efficiency is first of all, knowing that information exists... being able to find the correct information quickly and accurately is a valuable requirement.\"\n\n\u2014 Richard Jeffrey Cook\n\nFinally, efficiently identifying and disposing of records that no longer need to be retained is also important. For example, Cook referred to a case where the tobacco industry was facing compensation claims due to retaining documents they could have legally disposed of.\n\nWhy the Information Governance of Microsoft Teams Records is Challenging\n\nAs organizations hastily integrated MS Teams into their communication technology suite during the pandemic, there was a lack of clarity and urgency surrounding data ownership and governance\u2014not to mention an in-depth understanding of the complex nature of data residing within MS Teams and the Microsoft ecosystem.\n\nHere are the biggest information governance challenges with Microsoft Teams:\n\nLack of Clarity and Governance: When Teams was introduced as a communication tool in many organizations, there was a lack of understanding about how the solution would be used, what data would be stored, and who would be responsible for it. Various groups, including information managers, IT personnel, digital services, legal, and human resources had differing opinions on how the data in teams should be managed. This lack of clear guidance or established governance rules led to confusion and a fragmented approach to data management. Diverse Range of Content: MS Teams conversations encompass a mix of content types, including group chats, direct messages, files, meeting recordings, and calls. This diversity poses a challenge for organizations as they need to identify and manage these different types of data appropriately. Some files and documents may be exclusively stored within Teams, which requires specific attention to ensure their proper management, whilst other files are actually stored elsewhere in the Microsoft ecosystem. Complex Storage Locations: Microsoft Teams presents challenges in determining where the information is stored. As seen in the image below, the storage location of a record varies depending on the type of data and its context. For instance, group chats may be stored in a different location than private one-to-one chats. Understanding the storage locations is crucial for configuring appropriate rules and effectively managing the data across different areas. Real-Time Activity: When it comes to electronic records management, enterprise collaboration platforms are unique in the speed at which things happen. Thousands of comments, likes, and shares can occur each hour, and with each new interaction, a new record is generated. With the average user generating 1000 messages on MS Teams each month, it is not difficult to imagine the volume of data residing within the platform.\n\nTips for Managing Microsoft Teams Records Effectively\n\nA major challenge in information management is that it is often neglected until a crisis arises. This reactive approach forces organizations to scramble, highlighting the importance of proactive thinking and policy establishment to effectively address information challenges.\n\n\n\nWith the challenges outlined above in mind, Peter Callaghan and Richard Jeffrey Cook highlighted the following best practices for managing Microsoft Teams records:\n\nKnow the MS Teams Data Landscape The complex Microsoft ecosystem makes it challenging for legal and compliance teams to locate specific information as data can be spread across multiple locations. A single conversation in Teams can generate data in chat messages, shared files, and call records, with data location changing based on user settings and collaboration tools. To effectively manage legal and compliance risks, organizations must have a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape, including storage locations, access methods, and permissions. This enables easier data location and preservation in response to legal requests, reducing the risk of fines, legal action, or damage to reputation. Know the Capabilities and Limits of Microsoft eDiscovery Many organizations mistakenly believe that because Teams comes with Purview, the dedicated Microsoft eDiscovery solution, they have a sufficient solution for providing legal and compliance stakeholders with Microsoft Teams records. However, this assumption is not entirely accurate. Access to the robust eDiscovery Premium solution requires a top-tier E5 Microsoft 365 license, while companies on the more common E3 license only have access to the more limited eDiscovery Standard. Additionally, even eDiscovery Premium has its limitations, such as the inability to export Teams conversations in the popular and user-friendly PDF format. Set Clear Policies To create an environment that minimizes legal and compliance risks while fostering trust and privacy among employees, it is crucial to establish clear policies. These formal policies should regulate the use of an enterprise collaboration platform, including a communication policy that defines acceptable behavior and a security policy that outlines measures for data monitoring and protection. The policies should not only explain how the platform is managed but also provide the rationale behind certain actions. Maintaining transparency is key, such as clearly stating whether conversations are monitored or if managers have access to private messages and channels.\n\n\"It's essential to set clear policies and formal policy should be established to regulate the use of an enterprise collaboration platform like Microsoft Teams.\"\n\n\u2014 Peter Callaghan\n\nProvide MS Teams Training One of the most effective ways to combat improper use of a team collaboration tool is to provide mandatory training for employees. This training should go beyond expecting them to read and sign policies on their own, but instead, outline acceptable behavior and company policies in detail. By incorporating this training as a regular part of onboarding, organizations can foster a sense of trust while minimizing legal and compliance risks. While it may require some time and effort, this step is essential for creating a secure and productive environment for employees. Manage Users, Groups, and Roles\n\nTo maintain control over the creation of private or public channels, it is vital to carefully manage users' permissions. As an organization grows, it becomes wise to restrict channel creation to designated personnel who are charged with maintaining order and avoiding wide-reaching channels that overwhelms and cause confusion. Additionally, when executives require access to private channels and conversations, it is important to limit it to essential stakeholders and communicate the reasoning to employees. Find Shadow IT\n\nShadow IT, which refers to unauthorized IT-related software or hardware, can pose a serious risk to data security. Employees often resort to these tools to maintain the privacy of their conversations or to workaround the perceived limitations of the official systems. In fact, a survey conducted in 2019 found that a staggering 67% of teams in large companies introduced their own collaboration tool without involving other departments. To mitigate the threats associated with shadow IT, it is imperative for compliance teams and IT departments to proactively identify and manage all collaboration tools being used within the organization. Monitor Intelligently Modern monitoring and data loss prevention tools now empower businesses to protect against data loss without compromising employee privacy. These intelligent tools streamline the process by automatically detecting suspicious activity, eliminating the need for invasive surveillance. Through the use of extensive keyword libraries, they monitor conversations in real-time, flagging inappropriate language and sensitive information, such as credit card numbers. Administrators are immediately notified when any of these keywords appear, ensuring prompt action and maintaining a secure environment. Collect and Preserve Data To maintain compliance as well as facilitate effective eDiscovery collections, organizations must securely preserve all relevant data, including edited and deleted content, in a format that is admissible by law. An optimal approach is to leverage an eDiscovery solution that streamlines the entire process, empowering legal and compliance teams to seamlessly access, search, and export evidence without relying on IT intervention.\n\n\"It's important to have an archive of this data separate from the system of origin.\"\n\n\u2014 Peter Callaghan",

Morgan Healthcare Conference, the projects focus on developing and testing foundation models customized for various applications, leveraging the power of multimodal radiology images and data (including CT scans and MRIs) with Microsoft Research and genomic sequencing data with Cerebras. The innovations have the potential to transform how clinicians approach diagnosis and treatment, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\n\nFoundation AI models are large, pre-trained models capable of adapting to and carrying out many tasks with minimal extra training. They learn from massive datasets, acquiring general knowledge that can be used across diverse applications. This adaptability makes them efficient and versatile building blocks for numerous AI systems.\n\nMayo Clinic and Microsoft Research advance AI for chest X-rays\n\nMayo Clinic and Microsoft Research are collaboratively developing foundation models that integrate text and images. For this use case, Mayo and Microsoft Research are working together to explore the use of generative AI in radiology using Microsoft Research\u2019s AI technology and Mayo Clinic\u2019s X-ray data.\n\n\"Multimodal foundation models hold immense promise in tackling significant roadblocks across the radiology ecosystem. The innovations we\u2019re creating with Microsoft Research will help unlock valuable insights for the future of medical imaging to improve how radiologists work and how patients are cared for,\" says Matthew Callstrom, M.D. Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic Radiology in the Midwest and medical director for Generative AI and Strategy. \"Focusing on chest X-ray reports, Mayo's clinical teams and Microsoft researchers will collaborate to advance the state-of-the-art in multimodal AI radiology, helping bring innovation to real-world application faster and at scale, which is key to making exemplary healthcare more accessible.\"\n\nEmpowering clinicians with instant access to the information they need is at the heart of this research project. Mayo Clinic aims to develop a model that can automatically generate reports, evaluate tube and line placement in chest X-rays, and detect changes from prior images. This proof-of-concept model seeks to improve clinician workflow and patient care by providing a more efficient and comprehensive analysis of radiographic images.\n\n\"This collaboration is a crucial step towards our mutual goal of developing generative AI that improves patient outcomes and the clinician experience,\" says Jonathan Carlson, Ph.D., managing director, Health Futures at Microsoft Research. \"The fusion of Microsoft's recognized research innovations in biomedical AI and Mayo Clinic's radiology excellence will empower clinicians with the tools they need to deliver more precise and accessible care and furthers Microsoft\u2019s commitment to bringing the power of emerging AI to clinical researchers worldwide.\"\n\nMayo Clinic and Cerebras create a world-leading genomic foundation model\n\nMayo Clinic and Cerebras have created a genomic foundation model that combines publicly available human reference genome data that represents an ideal version of the human genome, with Mayo's comprehensive patient exome data and the power of its Mayo Clinic Platform. Exome data focuses on the protein-coding region of the genome where several disease-causing mutations take place. Cerebras's high-powered computing and generative AI capabilities make it possible to train and develop the model at scale, positioning it to be further refined for more specific uses.\n\n\"The genomic foundation model represents a significant advancement in personalized medicine,\" says Dr. Callstrom. \"Its ability to analyze genomic data and compare them in almost real-time with patients with similar traits allows for more precise prediction of disease and treatment response, leading to faster diagnoses and the selection of targeted therapies for patients.\"\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease, and the standard treatment approach often requires trials of different therapies to achieve disease remission. It can take several months to know if a therapy is working. A new genomic model developed by Mayo Clinic and Cerebras offers a potential solution to shorten the time to identify effective treatment and avoid long-term morbidity associated with the untreated disease. Early findings demonstrate high performance against benchmarks and show early promise in identifying patient response to therapy. As more patient data is added, the model's predictive power is expected to increase, leading to faster, more effective personalized treatment for RA patients.\n\n\"Mayo\u2019s genomic foundation model sets a new bar for genomic models, excelling not only in standard tasks like predicting functional and regulatory properties of DNA but also enabling discoveries of complex correlations between genetic variants and medical conditions,\" says Natalia Vassilieva, Field CTO at Cerebras Systems. \"Unlike current approaches focused on single-variant associations, this model enables the discovery of connections where collections of variants contribute to a particular condition.\"\n\n###\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to innovation in clinical practice, education and research, and providing compassion, expertise and answers to everyone who needs healing.

            "content": "In its latest security update, Microsoft has addressed a total of 159 vulnerabilities, covering a broad spectrum of the tech giant\u2019s products, including .NET, Visual Studio, Microsoft Excel, Windows components, and Azure services.\n\nThe update covers several critical and high-severity flaws across various systems, impacting Windows Telephony Services, Active Directory Domain Services, Microsoft Excel and other key Microsoft services.\n\nThere were three vulnerabilities that scored a 9.8/10 on the CVSS scale, the highest scores of vulnerabilities released this month. One flaw impacted Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) which allows users to create complex documents, like a RTF file, that contain multimedia content from different applications. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-21298, allows for remote code execution. While Microsoft has not seen this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, the company believes that malicious actors could take advantage of the flaw by sending a specially made email to victims using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Outlook, even if Outlook just shows a preview of a weaponized message. This might let the hacker run remote code on the victim\u2019s computer.\n\nAnother remote code execution flaw, cataloged as CVE-2025-21307, affects Windows Reliable Multicast Transport Driver (RMCAST), networking technology that supports reliable data transmission over multicast networks. This vulnerability can only be exploited if there is an application actively listening on a port for Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), which is a protocol that is used to ensure efficient delivery of data packets from a sender to multiple receivers on a particular network. An unauthenticated attacker could potentially send specially crafted packets to an open PGM socket on a Windows server, which does not require any user interaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the company says further conditions may make it harder for actors to exploit the flaw: If PGM is installed or enabled but no applications are using it to listen, the vulnerability cannot be exploited. Since PGM does not authenticate requests, it\u2019s advisable to protect any open PGM ports using network-level security measures, such as a firewall.\n\nThis vulnerability affects a wide range of Microsoft products, including Windows 10 versions starting from 1507 to 22H2, Windows 11 versions 22H2 to 24H2, and various Windows Server editions from 2008 up to 2025.\n\nThe third vulnerability scoring 9.8, CVE-2025-21311, is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows NT LAN Manager, a suite of Microsoft security protocols intended to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users, particularly with regard to passwords. The critical nature of this vulnerability stems from its ability to be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to access compromised machines over the internet. Additionally, this exploitation requires minimal technical expertise, enabling attackers to repeatedly use the same attack method across any vulnerable system with ease.\n\nAside from the patch, Microsoft also recommends a mitigation strategy, setting the LAN Manager\u2019s LmCompatabilityLvl to its maximum value (5) for all machines. This will prevent the usage of the older NTLMv1 protocol, while still allowing NTLMv2.\n\nAmong other vulnerabilities, there are three within Microsoft Excel that could lead to easy exploitation. Catalogued as CVE-2025-21354, CVE-2025-21362, and CVE-2025-21364, Microsoft categorized the flaws as \u201cmore likely\u201d to be exploited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCVE-2025-21362 involves remote code execution due to a use-after-free issue, which is when a program incorrectly handles memory while processing certain parts of a file. This flaw can let attackers run harmful code on a computer by creating a dangerous Excel file with specific features that activate the vulnerability. Even just previewing this file is enough to trigger the problem, since Excel reads part of the file to show its contents. When the memory is mishandled, the attacker can exploit it to run any code they want within Excel. Although the vulnerability seems to be described as local, meaning the issue happens on the victim\u2019s computer, attackers can send the dangerous file remotely via methods like email or unsafe websites.\n\nCVE-2025-21354 is caused by a problem known as \u201cUntrusted Pointer Dereference,\u201d which can lead to remote code execution. This issue happens when Excel does not properly check and handle pointer references (a memory issue in the programming language) while working with certain parts of a file. An attacker can create a harmful Excel file with specific \u201cpointers\u201d to control memory access when Excel reads the file. This can allow the attacker to run any code they want within the Excel process. One of the critical aspects of this vulnerability is that it can be triggered even if the file is only viewed in the Preview Pane because, like the vulnerability described in the previous paragraph, Excel processes part of the file to generate a preview, activating the vulnerability without fully opening the file.\n\n\u201cThe worry for these vulnerabilities in Excel is that they are more likely to be exploited in the wild, meaning Microsoft likely suspects they can be weaponized by attackers,\u201d Ben McCarthy, lead cybersecurity engineer with Immersive Labs, told CyberScoop via email. \u201cWith social engineering still being one the main ways for attackers to gain initial access, any vulnerabilities in Excel need to be taken seriously by any company that uses it and patch it immediately.\u201d\n\nYou can see the full list of vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s Security Response Center.",

Redmond\u2019s inaugural Patch Tuesday of 2025 bundles more fixes than the company has shipped in one go since 2017.\n\nRapid7\u2018s Adam Barnett says January marks the fourth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication. Today also saw the publication of nine critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Microsoft flaws already seeing active attacks include CVE-2025-21333, CVE-2025-21334 and, you guessed it\u2013 CVE-2025-21335. These are sequential because all reside in Windows Hyper-V, a component that is heavily embedded in modern Windows 11 operating systems and used for security features including device guard and credential guard.\n\nTenable\u2019s Satnam Narang says little is known about the in-the-wild exploitation of these flaws, apart from the fact that they are all \u201cprivilege escalation\u201d vulnerabilities. Narang said we tend to see a lot of elevation of privilege bugs exploited in the wild as zero-days in Patch Tuesday because it\u2019s not always initial access to a system that\u2019s a challenge for attackers as they have various avenues in their pursuit.\n\n\u201cAs elevation of privilege bugs, they\u2019re being used as part of post-compromise activity, where an attacker has already accessed a target system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like if an attacker is able to enter a secure building, they\u2019re unable to access more secure parts of the facility because they have to prove that they have clearance. In this case, they\u2019re able to trick the system into believing they should have clearance.\u201d\n\nSeveral bugs addressed today earned CVSS (threat rating) scores of 9.8 out of a possible 10, including CVE-2025-21298, a weakness in Windows that could allow attackers to run arbitrary code by getting a target to open a malicious .rtf file, documents typically opened on Office applications like Microsoft Word. Microsoft has rated this flaw \u201cexploitation more likely.\u201d\n\nBen Hopkins at Immersive Labs called attention to the CVE-2025-21311, a 9.8 \u201ccritical\u201d bug in Windows NTLMv1 (NT LAN Manager version 1), an older Microsoft authentication protocol that is still used by many organizations.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this vulnerability so impactful is the fact that it is remotely exploitable, so attackers can reach the compromised machine(s) over the internet, and the attacker does not need significant knowledge or skills to achieve repeatable success with the same payload across any vulnerable component,\u201d Hopkins wrote.\n\nKev Breen at Immersive points to an interesting flaw (CVE-2025-21210) that Microsoft fixed in its full disk encryption suite Bitlocker that the software giant has dubbed \u201cexploitation more likely.\u201d Specifically, this bug holds out the possibility that in some situations the hibernation image created when one closes the laptop lid on an open Windows session may not be fully encrypted and could be recovered in plain text.\n\n\u201cHibernation images are used when a laptop goes to sleep and contains the contents that were stored in RAM at the moment the device powered down,\u201d Breen noted. \u201cThis presents a significant potential impact as RAM can contain sensitive data (such as passwords, credentials and PII) that may have been in open documents or browser sessions and can all be recovered with free tools from hibernation files.\u201d\n\nTenable\u2019s Narang also highlighted a trio of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Access fixed this month and credited to Unpatched.ai, a security research effort that is aided by artificial intelligence looking for vulnerabilities in code. Tracked as CVE-2025-21186, CVE-2025-21366, and CVE-2025-21395, these are remote code execution bugs that are exploitable if an attacker convinces a target to download and run a malicious file through social engineering. Unpatched.ai was also credited with discovering a flaw in the December 2024 Patch Tuesday release (CVE-2024-49142).\n\n\u201cAutomated vulnerability detection using AI has garnered a lot of attention recently, so it\u2019s noteworthy to see this service being credited with finding bugs in Microsoft products,\u201d Narang observed. \u201cIt may be the first of many in 2025.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a Windows user who has automatic updates turned off and haven\u2019t updated in a while, it\u2019s probably time to play catch up. Please consider backing up important files and/or the entire hard drive before updating.

            "content": "Insider Brief\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Quantum Ready program aims to prepare businesses for the transformative potential of quantum computing by offering tools, training, and strategies for a secure and scalable quantum future.\n\nThe program emphasizes four key areas: hybrid applications integrating quantum and classical computing, workforce skilling to address the quantum expertise gap, quantum-safe security to future-proof cryptography, and aligning investments with industry-specific quantum needs.\n\nBy fostering collaboration and providing insights through workshops, forums, and industry reports, Microsoft seeks to accelerate quantum adoption and help businesses identify high-value use cases for this emerging technology.\n\nMicrosoft has introduced its Quantum Ready program to help businesses prepare for the next wave of quantum computing, an era expected to revolutionize industries with powerful problem-solving capabilities, according to a company blog post. As quantum computing inches closer to solving practical problems, Microsoft aims to equip companies with the tools, insights, and skills needed to navigate this transformative technology.\n\nQuantum computing has moved from a theoretical concept to a reliable technology, with 2025 designated as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology by the United Nations. Investments in the field are surging, with global companies and governments pouring billions of dollars into quantum research and development. Yet, only 12% of business leaders feel ready to assess the opportunities quantum technology offers, according to a study cited by Microsoft in their blog.\n\n\u201cThose organizations that are in the throes of planning a comprehensive quantum-ready strategy are creating durable, competitive differentiation for their organizations and positioning themselves to harness the full power of quantum as it scales,\u201d Mitra Azizirad, President and Chief Operating Officer of Strategic Missions and Technologies, Microsoft writes in the post. \u201cClearly, without strategic readiness, it\u2019s a challenging proposition for leaders to assess the risks and returns, or to design effective and responsible quantum strategies that are necessary to create a full-on quantum roadmap for their organization.\u201d\n\nThe Quantum Ready program seeks to close this gap, helping leaders across industries position their organizations for success in a quantum-enabled world.\n\nFour Pillars of Quantum Readiness\n\nThe program focuses on four key areas:\n\nHybrid Applications: Microsoft encourages organizations to develop hybrid applications that combine quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and traditional computing. These applications can address current business needs while preparing for future scalability. Strategic Skilling: The program emphasizes workforce training to address the growing quantum skills gap. According to Microsoft, 76% of leaders say a lack of quantum expertise is slowing innovation. Quantum-Safe Security: As quantum computers advance, they pose risks to existing cryptographic systems. Microsoft\u2019s Quantum Safe Program offers guidance on adopting cryptographic standards to ensure long-term security. Future-Proof Investments: The program provides a roadmap for businesses to align their quantum strategies with industry-specific needs, ensuring investments remain relevant as the technology evolves.\n\nThrough workshops and forums, Microsoft aims to help leaders identify high-value use cases and create custom strategies for their industries. Insights from these sessions will be shared in industry outlook reports to benefit the broader ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Quantum in Business and Security\n\nQuantum computing\u2019s potential to transform industries is vast. From drug discovery to supply chain optimization, the technology could unlock solutions that are currently unattainable with classical computers. However, the transition requires careful planning, especially in cybersecurity.\n\nPreparing for a quantum-safe future goes beyond addressing an immediate threat but also aims at ensuring a smooth transition to new cryptographic standards, the Microsoft team suggest. The company\u2019s emphasis on security aligns with its broader goal of fostering trust in quantum technologies.\n\nSkilling for the Quantum Era\n\nWorkforce readiness is a cornerstone of the Quantum Ready program. By providing access to training resources and a unified hybrid computing platform, Microsoft aims to cultivate a culture of innovation. This platform integrates quantum computing with classical supercomputing and AI, reflecting the company\u2019s belief that these technologies are complementary rather than competitive.\n\n\u201c\u2026the organizations that can harness the power of these complementary technologies \u2013 and who understand their use is not a matter of either/or, but when and how \u2013 are in a distinct position to stay ahead.\u201d Azizirad writes.\n\nPartnering for Success\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s initiative also emphasizes the importance of collaboration. The program connects businesses with partners experienced in deploying hybrid tools and mitigating quantum-related risks. By fostering an open ecosystem, Microsoft hopes to future-proof investments and accelerate quantum adoption.\n\nAs part of the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, Microsoft will partner with the American Physical Society and other institutions to raise awareness about quantum innovation and its impact on industries worldwide, according to the post.\n\nYou can learn more about Microsoft\u2019s Quantum Ready videos here \u2014 or navigate here to join.",

            "content": "Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, shared the below communication with Microsoft employees this morning.\n\nAs we begin the new year, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re entering the next innings of this AI platform shift. 2025 will be about model-forward applications that reshape all application categories. More so than any previous platform shift, every layer of the application stack will be impacted. It\u2019s akin to GUI, internet servers, and cloud-native databases all being introduced into the app stack simultaneously. Thirty years of change is being compressed into three years!\n\nWe will build agentic applications with memory, entitlements, and action space that will inherit powerful model capabilities. And we will adapt these capabilities for enhanced performance and safety across roles, business processes, and industry domains. Further, how we build, deploy, and maintain code for these AI applications is also fundamentally changing and becoming agentic.\n\nThis is leading to a new AI-first app stack \u2014 one with new UI/UX patterns, runtimes to build with agents, orchestrate multiple agents, and a reimagined management and observability layer. In this world, Azure must become the infrastructure for AI, while we build our AI platform and developer tools \u2014 spanning Azure AI Foundry, GitHub, and VS Code \u2014 on top of it. In other words, our AI platform and tools will come together to create agents, and these agents will come together to change every SaaS application category, and building custom applications will be driven by software (i.e. \u201cservice as software\u201d).\n\nThe good news is that we have been working at this for more than two years and have learned a lot in terms of the systems, app platform, and tools required for the AI era. To more rapidly and boldly advance our roadmap across each of these layers, we are creating a new engineering organization: CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools.\n\nThis new division will bring together Dev Div, AI Platform, and some key teams from the Office of the CTO (AI Supercomputer, AI Agentic Runtimes, and Engineering Thrive), with the mission to build the end-to-end Copilot & AI stack for both our first-party and third-party customers to build and run AI apps and agents. This group will also build out GitHub Copilot, thus having a tight feedback loop between the leading AI-first product and the AI platform to motivate the stack and its roadmap.\n\nJay Parikh will lead this group as EVP of CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools, with Eric Boyd, Jason Taylor, Julia Liuson, Tim Bozarth, and their respective teams reporting to Jay.\n\nJay will work closely with Scott, Rajesh, Charlie, Mustafa, and Kevin to optimize our entire tech stack for both performance and efficiency. Additionally, Jay and team will lead our progress and work around developer productivity and Engineering Thrive across the company.\n\nAs our cloud infrastructure business continues to grow and scale to become Microsoft\u2019s largest business, Scott will continue to lead Cloud + AI to ensure we\u2019re delivering the quality, security, and innovation that our customers and partners count on for their most mission-critical applications, databases, and AI workloads.\n\nUltimately, we must remember that our internal organizational boundaries are meaningless to both our customers and to our competitors. When we talk about operating as One Microsoft, we are effectively talking about how we are continually increasing our customer focus, raising the bar on our innovation, and driving accountability, so we can truly live up to our mission.\n\nOur success in this next phase will be determined by having the best AI platform, tools, and infrastructure. We have a lot of work to do and a tremendous opportunity ahead, and together, I\u2019m looking forward to building what comes next.\n\nSatya",

            "content": "[Editor\u2019s note: This content was written to highlight a particular event or moment in time. Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nMoving MSW, Microsoft\u2019s internal news and information portal, to the latest version of SharePoint in Microsoft 365 is aiding the company as it provides COVID-19 guidance to its employees.\n\n\u201cWe pretty dramatically rearranged our home page in a matter of hours to better be able to represent to employees our response to COVID-19,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cThis would have been impossible in the old SharePoint environment. It\u2019s pretty amazing to have a tool flexible enough to allow us to make this kind of change this quickly.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft finished moving MSW to SharePoint in Microsoft 365 in January, opening a number of new doors to the people who manage a website that is Microsoft\u2019s front door for its employees.\n\n\u201cMSW is an out-of-the-box SharePoint home site for the entire organization,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cOur vision is that it\u2019s tailored to all of our employees based on where they work and who they work with, and is accessible on any device, anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe changeover of the Microsoft home page to the most current version of SharePoint is a pivotal milestone on the company\u2019s journey to migrate nearly 400,000 sites and portals to the web-based collaborative platform, moving from the classic publishing version of SharePoint to the latest \u201cintelligent intranet\u201d functionality.\n\nThat new functionality is enabling MSW to use SharePoint home-site technology to give employees a dynamic, personalized, and mobile experience\u2014one that can change easily when the need arises.\n\nOn Monday, March 24th, Jaffe\u2019s team decided that MSW\u2019s home page needed to be reorganized to better show the content that Microsoft has available to employees on COVID-19 and on working remotely. In just hours, his team had redesigned the entire home page, providing employees with key COVID-19 resources, internal updates, and top news.\n\nThe move from then to now\n\nMicrosoft has moved 86 percent of its SharePoint team sites (332,446 sites and counting) and 76 percent of its SharePoint publishing portals (about 15,000 so far), but it has been slower to migrate its handful of larger-scale internal portals like MSW (short for Microsoft Web).\n\nThe company has reached a tipping point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well on our way to finishing a migration that will allow us to significantly improve the end-to-end experience we offer our employees,\u201d says Sam Crewdson, a senior program manager in Microsoft Digital.\n\nThis means that MSW is now accessible and mobile responsive by default. It also means that the number of customizations needed to manage the home page has been reduced from 13 to only 3.\n\n\u201cThe fact that 86 percent of our sites are on the most current version of SharePoint in Microsoft 365 reflects a leap forward,\u201d Crewdson says.\n\nThe Microsoft Employee Communications Team delayed moving the MSW home page to the new experience so that it could take advantage of search improvements, audience selectivity, and recently added SharePoint home-site capabilities. The vast majority of MSW\u2019s pages\u2014more than 99 percent\u2014were moved to the most updated version of SharePoint one year ago.\n\n\u201cThe fact that MSW has now made the move clears the path for legal, human resources, and other major portals to follow,\u201d says Crewdson, whose team partnered with the Employee Communications Team to move the portal to the updated design. \u201cSome of our big portals have already migrated.\u201d\n\n[Learn how Microsoft Digital supports the company\u2019s use of SharePoint.]\n\nFor a transcript, please view the video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GgmKP84cOE, select the \u201cMore actions\u201d button (three dots icon) below the video, and then select \u201cShow transcript.\u201d\n\nHaving 100% of Microsoft\u2019s intranet portals moved to SharePoint in Microsoft 365 has contributed to our seamless transition to a work-from-home environment.\n\nMaking MSW feel more like home\n\nThe new site, which 200,000 Microsoft employees, vendors, and partners call home, offers a more personalized experience while giving Jaffe and the Employee Communications Team a new set of tools to better communicate with employees and to assert their preferred branding look and feel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about helping employees find information that\u2019s relevant to them, to help them complete the tasks they want to complete,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cHopefully, that allows them to become more engaged and to spend less time searching.\u201d\n\nIn the past, MSW tended to publish content that was Redmond-centric, meaning it was focused on the stories coming out of company headquarters.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t fit the profile of working in Redmond, you didn\u2019t really feel like you were part of the company that was showing up on the pages of MSW,\u201d Jaffe says.\n\nThat prompted company divisions and regional offices across the globe to create their own smaller portals that they used to share their local news and information with their people.\n\n\u201cWe will use the updated MSW to unravel that trend,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cWe want teams from India, Australia, Silicon Valley, and everywhere else to localize the content that shows up on MSW for the people who work in their regions. We think of it as taking a One Microsoft approach to the intranet.\u201d\n\nGetting Microsoft\u2019s large portals onto the latest feature set of SharePoint is a win for the product group, says DC Padur, a principal product manager in SharePoint.\n\n\u201cHaving Microsoft launch this is a big deal, because it\u2019s one of the biggest users of SharePoint in the world,\u201d says Padur, who points out that his team learns a lot from how the company uses the product. \u201cCustomers ask, \u2018How are you using it?\u2019 They say, \u2018Understanding how you use it will help me to understand how it would work for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPadur says being a SharePoint showcase works only if MSW is using the most current version of the product, which is now the case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly adapting SharePoint,\u201d he says. \u201cNow our own IT team can adapt to new experiences as they come out and give us feedback that we can use for fine tuning to scale what works out to the entire world.\u201d\n\nNew features pivotal in making MSW home page for all\n\nWhen MSW debuted as the company\u2019s home page in 1996, it was the definitive place where employees went to find information and do what they needed to do. Since then, employees get additional information that is specific to them, whether it be news, how to sign up for benefits in their home country, or the menu at their local caf\u00e9\u2014all from numerous sources and accessible across various applications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a home page with really limited audience customization,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cWe wanted to move to the point where we felt like we had a personalized home page built just for you. To do that, we needed to move from limited targeting to much finer-grained targeting.\u201d\n\nThis means that customized content is aggregated for the user on a more central location based on their activities with content and other people throughout the company. Therefore, communication managers from particular parts of the company can now program content on MSW that will be seen by only the employees in their divisions. For example, the company\u2019s sales team is now using MSW\u2019s audience targeting feature to share guidance with sellers on how to support their customers and partners as they deal with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur new SharePoint home site allows that kind of customization,\u201d Crewdson says. \u201cAudience targeting has been democratized. Anyone can do it\u2014it\u2019s very easy.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe MSW content team can push out content that\u2019s relevant to everyone, but local content managers can change and adjust the content that shows up in their region or to employees in their particular division (what Xbox employees see will be different from that viewed by employees in the Office group). When it launches fully, local teams will be able to feed their local content into their version of MSW, eliminating the need for them to operate their own, separate portal.\n\nSome news will be required reading for everyone, like announcements from senior leadership or broader company meetings; items like those will automatically be programmed to be seen by all. Also, by default, information like caf\u00e9 menus and bus schedules will show only what\u2019s available in an individual employee\u2019s city or office\u2014if you\u2019re an employee in New York City, you won\u2019t see shuttle options for Redmond.\n\nEmpowering the company to deliver relevant information to its employees is only half of it. The SharePoint news feature offers a personalized news feed in places like the SharePoint start page and the SharePoint mobile app. When a user follows a site, for example, news from that site is shown in their feed.\n\n\u201cIn this way SharePoint can act as a news aggregator, centralizing the news from across all the sites that are important to you,\u201d Crewdson says. \u201cWe believe, as the news features continue to be adopted, we\u2019re going to have more informed users. People are more productive when they\u2019re engaged.\u201d\n\nA communications manager in Microsoft Australia or the company\u2019s regional office in Los Angeles would sign in to MSW, take a look at the feed coming in from headquarters in Redmond and add any local, role-related, or organizational content that they want to distribute for the employees who they\u2019re trying to reach. On their end, it\u2019s as easy as adding a headline, image, and description and then adding a group tag for each news item.\n\nSharePoint value out-of-the-box\n\nSharePoint offers much more than targeting content, Crewdson says.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s dramatically cheaper and easier for us to build and manage on SharePoint now than in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cThe product is really good out of the box. We don\u2019t need to focus as much time and budget to design elements, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility. It hardly needs any customization, and that\u2019s really exciting from an IT and life-cycle management perspective.\u201d\n\nFor example, the previous version of MSW had 13 custom elements built and managed by an internal development team. This required that the team build individual parts for sections of MSW like the home page layout and for sections of the site like the news and events tabs. The new version, by comparison, was built almost entirely using out-of-box functionality, requiring only three customizations.\n\n\u201cNow those customizations all come built in, they\u2019re high quality, fast to use, and are free,\u201d Crewdson says. \u201cThey definitely come with some sizzle.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Employee Communications Team doesn\u2019t need to budget for as much customization to build and operate MSW.\n\n\u201cThe new SharePoint Framework is based on open standards and is very friendly,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can develop on any JavaScript framework that you want. You can choose the language you want to use. You can write in a way that makes sense for you. It\u2019s all about developing in SharePoint in a way that makes sense to you.\u201d\n\nIt used to be that you needed a specialized SharePoint developer just to make your site look nice. And too often, time and budget restrictions curbed efforts to then make the portal responsive and accessible on mobile devices.\n\n\u201cA lot of teams that tried SharePoint 8 to 10 years ago found it was ugly by default,\u201d Crewdson says. \u201cIt required developer interaction to make it pretty, and when you had to hire that developer, it was kind of hard to find that person\u2014you had to go and find someone who was knowledgeable about doing it the SharePoint way.\u201d\n\nIn addition to allowing site owners to create beautiful pages, SharePoint now is much more accessible.\n\n\u201cEngaging all Microsoft employees is part of our core mission. The new version is accessible by default,\u201d Crewdson says. \u201cIn the old days, we had to build accessibility in. Now we get that out of the box. In fact, each engineering feature goes through both experience and accessibility reviews before anything moves into production.\u201d\n\nLearn how Microsoft Digital supports the company\u2019s use of SharePoint.\n\nTo learn more about SharePoint, check out the SharePoint Admin documentation and SharePoint end-user documentation.

            "content": "AI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks.\n\nMoving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization.\n\nGartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.\n\nCloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other cloud computing stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFuture developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to. Next, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 10th January. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) AI Strategy: Cramer Weighs In on Brad Smith's Vision for the New Industrial Revolution\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 279\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 19.3%\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is involved in the cloud computing business through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure. It provides a wide range of cloud services, which include infrastructure-as-a-service (laaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). While Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) faced capacity constraints that impacted Azure's growth potential, it remains optimistic about future prospects. The integration of Al capabilities into Azure cloud services should contribute to Azure's growth rates. In Q1 2025, Azure's revenue saw an increase of 33%, thanks to the Al services.\n\nAzure growth included ~12 points from Al services, similar to last quarter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) highlighted that demand continues to be higher than its available capacity. Even non-Al growth trends were also in line with expectations with customers continuing to migrate and modernize on its Azure platform. Mark Moerdler from Bernstein remains optimistic about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s growth prospects. The expected acceleration in Azure's revenue growth, anticipated to reach 35% - 40% YoY in H1 2025, was the critical driver behind optimism.\n\nTalking about the capacity constraints, the expansion of the global data center network should help Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) address these challenges. As per the company's Vice Chair and President Brad Smith, the company expects to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on the construction of data centers capable of handling Al workloads. Notably, more than half of the anticipated Al infrastructure spending is expected to take place in the US.\n\nRiverPark Advisors, an investment advisory firm and sponsor of the RiverPark family of mutual funds, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company\u2019s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online.\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 5th on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company has announced that the new Outlook for Windows will be forcibly installed on the aging operating system.\n\nSomewhat unusually, the app will be pushed out as part of February\u2019s security updates. This is likely to lead to mixed reactions; some people will be unhappy at having software installed against their will, while others will be pleased to get something new and more secure.\n\nSee also:\n\nMicrosoft has not made a great fuss about the forced installation -- as you might well expect. The news came through an announcement in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Microsoft also says that eager users can jump the queue and grab the app earlier by installing the January preview update.\n\nThe company says:\n\nNew Outlook exists as an installed app on the device. For instance, it can be found in the Apps section of the Start Menu. It does not replace existing (classic) Outlook or change any configurations / user defaults. Both (classic) Outlook and New Outlook for Windows can run side by side.\n\nIn a separate support document, Microsoft not only reiterates the planned forced installations, but points out that for Windows 10 users -- unlike Windows 11 -- there is no way to block it:\n\nThe new Outlook for Windows will be automatically installed on Windows 10 devices as part of the optional Windows 10 release on January 28, 2025, and more broadly released as part of the monthly security update release for Windows 10 on February 11, 2025. Currently, there isn't a way to block the new Outlook from being installed -- if you prefer not to have new Outlook show up on your organization's devices, you can remove it after it's installed as part of the update.\n\nThe good news for those who are particularly opposed to having the new Outlook for Windows on their hardware is that it can be uninstalled.

He was the only son in the family, with a sister named Kristianne who is one year older, and another sister, Libby, who is nine years younger.\n\nGates' childhood fostered his love of technology. He largely eschewed sports and more typical childhood activities, instead taking an early interest in technology. He wrote his first lines of code while still a young teen; it was a software program that allowed a human to face off against a computer playing tic-tac-toe.\n\nBill Gates was a computer whiz from an early age, and later dropped out of Harvard and went on to found Microsoft. Associated Press\n\nBy the time Bill Gates was in high school at Lakeside Prep School, he was writing code for the school itself and was soon working with the Computer Center Corporation, a local business in Seattle that offered users time on their computers, personal computers still being a thing of the future. (Gates was briefly banned from the CCC for sneaking in lines of code that granted him extended free time using the machines.)\n\nBill Gates would go on to matriculate at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, but he would not finish his college degree.\n\nThe foundation and growth of Microsoft\n\nIn January of 1975, Gates and fellow software genius and childhood friend Paul Allen moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to work for the company Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, Inc. (MITS), a company that was just beginning to create PCs (personal computers). Gates managed to convince the executives he and Allen could create software for their new hardware.\n\nThat role did not last long. Later that same year, Gates and Allen founded their own company, named for \"microcomputer\" and \"software,\" known today as Microsoft.\n\nGates and his longtime friend Paul Allen founded Microsoft together and launched the massively successful Windows operating system just a few years later. Doug Wilson/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nMicrosoft relocated to Bellevue, Washington, in 1979, and in 1980, the company made a deal with tech juggernaut IBM to develop an operating system for the company's first consumer-ready PC. The MS-DOS 1.0 OS was released in the summer of the following year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThen, just four years later, in 1985, Microsoft released the first version of its now vaunted Windows OS. New versions of Windows would come out every few years from that point on, and it has grown so dominant that nearly three-quarters of the world's computers run Windows.\n\nAllen departed from Microsoft for medical reasons in 1983 (though he would live another quarter of a century), while Gates would remain the CEO until the summer of 2008, when he voluntarily stepped down from the leading role of the company he had grown into a company that would enjoy revenues of more than $60 billion that same year.\n\nGates' post-Microsoft career and philanthropy\n\nWhen Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft, he stepped up as the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the charitable organization he and his then wife Melinda Gates had founded in the year 2000. (The foundation was a revamp of the organization Gates had established in 1994 under the name the William H. Gates Foundation.)\n\nThe BMFG is a nonprofit with global reach that happens to make a tidy profit, thanks in no small part to its massive holdings of Microsoft stock. The foundation has offices around the world and is, in words from its own site: \"Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.\"\n\nThe BMGF funds research into the fight against malnutrition, malaria, gender inequality, to name a few, and in support of causes such as agricultural development, clean water programs, and much more.\n\nThe foundation has an endowment of more than $75 billion and planned to spend a staggering $8.6 billion on philanthropic work in the year 2024. Bill Gates has donated an estimated $36 billion-plus of his own fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nGates' relationships and friendships\n\nBill and Melinda Gates were married for 27 years. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nBill Gates married Melinda French Gates, whose maiden name was Melinda Ann French, on New Year's Day in 1994 on the Hawaiian island of Lanai. The couple met at work, Melinda being a Microsoft employee, though she departed the company in 1996 to focus on family and, soon, on charitable work.\n\nThe Gates have three children together and would remain married until their divorce on August 2, 2021, after a span of 27 years. The reasons for the divorce were several, one reportedly being that Gates spent one weekend each year vacationing with (and possibly physically involved with, though this was always denied) an ex-girlfriend, Ann Winblad. This was an arrangement Melinda Gates tacitly approved, though with displeasure.\n\nAnother issue for Melinda Gates was Bill Gates' regular association with Jeffrey Epstein the financier, convicted sex offender, and accused trafficker who died by suicide in his New York City jail cell in 2019.\n\nGates is currently in a relationship with Paula Hurd, who was born in 1962 and is seven years his junior. Hurd, formerly married to the late Co-CEO of Oracle Corporation Mark Hurd, has two adult daughters and works primarily coordinating and planning large-scale philanthropic events.\n\nGates and Hurd had been known to be in a relationship since early 2023, but were not to appear together at a major public event until April of the following year, when they accompanied one another to a major red carpet event.\n\nMelinda French Gates, for her part, was reportedly briefly in a relationship with a Fox News correspondent named Jon Du Pre, but the pair are no longer together.\n\nAnother contentious relationship \u2014 one that likewise soured after many years \u2014 is Gates' friendship with billionaire Warren Buffett. The two men were on close terms for decades, with their relationship going beyond mere affinity. Gates joined the board of Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in 2004 and would remain on it until 2020.\n\nGates and Buffett were once close friends. Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nBuffett, for his party, was a trustee on the board of the BMGF from 2006 until 2021. He stepped away and also went cold on Gates for reasons rather in line with his divorce: Buffett was deeply troubled by the association of Gates with Epstein. He had also come to dislike the growing bureaucracy of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and was off-put by how rude Gates could often be to others.\n\nThere are also some wild conspiracy theories about Bill Gates, such as that he was behind a scheme to place microchips into COVID-19 vaccines, that Gates wanted to do away with the American cattle industry and instead compel people to eat insects, and that a fund backed by Gates that was developing a new way to produce baby formula has led to a nationwide baby formula shortage. There is, of course, no evidence to support any of these plots and plenty of common sense to debunk them, but these wild theories and others abound nonetheless\n\nBill Gates' net worth and land\n\nGates owns a number of properties throughout the US and some 275,000 acres of farmland. Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nBill Gates' net worth can change by the millions in any given day as markets rise and fall, but it is usually near $160 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That places him in the bottom half of the top 10 richest people in the world. As noted, he achieved the top title in 1995 and maintained it most years up until 2017.\n\nGates has less wealth today largely because he has given so much of it away in the name of philanthropy.\n\nToday, Bill Gates' primary property is a 66,000 square foot mansion in Medina, Washington, which is just east of Seattle, across Lake Washington. Construction took seven years and involved a team of 300 workers. There are six kitchens and 24 bathrooms.\n\nGates also owns vast swathes of farmland, totaling approximately 275,000 acres. For comparison, all five boroughs of New York City cover just 193,700 acres. During a Reddit Q&A session (called an \"AMA\" for \"ask me anything\"), Gates explained the massive holdings, saying: \"I own less than 1/4000 of the farmland in the US. I have invested in these farms to make them more productive and create more jobs. There isn't some grand scheme involved - in fact all these decisions are made by a professional investment team.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nGates' lifestyle, hobbies, and beliefs\n\nGates, who has a 2,500-square-foot gym in his mansion, is a firm believer in the benefits of exercise. He reportedly works out for at least an hour every day, whether running, swimming, playing tennis, or doing strength training. He is also reportedly a fan of pickleball.\n\nWhile he grew up attending a Protestant Reformed church, Gates seemed drawn to the Catholic church in the 2010s, largely because of Melinda. These days, he seems to skew agnostic, with religion not playing much of a role in his life.\n\nBooks, however, play a huge role. Gates has claimed he reads up to 50 books a year. And he also collects rare books, such as a manuscript created by Leonardo da Vinci for which he paid well over $30 million.\n\nLike many other billionaires and tech moguls, Gates collects cars, and has a 23-car garage at his Washington home. His collection is filled with high-end sports cars and luxury vehicles alike. And, apparently, a blue Ford Focus.",

Musk heads the AI firm xAI.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson pointed Reuters to the argument the company has made before: that Musk\u2019s suit is without evidence and is essentially harassment.\n\nMarc Toberoff, Musk\u2019s attorney, said, \u201cthe participation of the DOJ and FTC is a sign of how seriously regulators take OpenAI and Microsoft\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe FTC has been examining AI partnerships, including the one between OpenAI and Microsoft, while also probing anticompetitive conduct by Microsoft and investigating whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws.\n\nMusk alleges OpenAI breached antitrust law by forcing investors to agree not to invest in rival AI companies, and by sharing board members with Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI contends the board member claims are moot, as Microsoft board member Reid Hoffman, who was on OpenAI\u2019s board, and Microsoft executive Deannah Templeton, who had an observer seat, are no longer connected with it.\n\nAll the same, those directors could still have sensitive competitive information, the FTC and DOJ argued in the recent court filing, saying that board members who only have observer status are not exempt from the law.\n\nAnother of Musk\u2019s claims is that OpenAI fomented a group investor boycott against its rivals. These claims hold water even when the organizer of the boycott is not a member, the FTC and DOJ argued.\n\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS took a closer look at the sector last week in the wake of Anthropic\u2019s targeted $60 billion valuation.\n\n\u201cFrom automating routine tasks to enhancing decision-making through predictive analytics, the demand for enterprise AI solutions is skyrocketing,\u201d that report said.\n\n\u201cHowever, corporate buyers are discerning, prioritizing factors such as integration capabilities, data security, and the ability to customize models to fit their unique needs. These priorities are shaping the AI market.\u201d\n\nAt a time when tech stacks are becoming more complex, seamless integration is a key priority for enterprise buyers, that report added. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has shown that 75% of CFOs plan to increase their AI investment.",

            "content": "Microsoft is advancing its DirectX API to support neural rendering, signaling a transformative shift in graphics rendering by incorporating AI and machine learning. This development, highlighted in a recent blog post, is designed to enhance visual quality and efficiency in gaming and other graphics-intensive applications.\n\nNeural rendering makes use of machine learning models to generate or enhance visual elements such as textures, lighting, and image upscaling. By offloading complex rendering tasks to AI, this approach improves both performance and visual fidelity while reducing the computational burden on traditional rendering pipelines. Technologies like Nvidia\u2019s DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR have already demonstrated the potential of AI-enhanced rendering. Microsoft\u2019s initiative seeks to provide a standardized, open framework for such capabilities within the widely used DirectX API.\n\nA key feature of the forthcoming DirectX update is Cooperative Vector Support. This feature will enhance AI workloads for real-time rendering by optimizing matrix-vector operations crucial for AI tasks like training, fine-tuning, and inferencing. This feature allows AI tasks to run in different shader stages, enabling efficient execution of neural networks, such as in a pixel shader, without monopolizing the GPU. By integrating neural graphics into DirectX applications, it provides access to AI-accelerator hardware across platforms, empowering developers to create more immersive experiences.\n\nMicrosoft has confirmed that Cooperative vectors will leverage Tensor Cores in Nvidia's new RTX 50-series GPUs to enable neural shaders, enhancing game asset visualization, optimizing geometry for improved path tracing, and supporting tools for creating photorealistic game characters.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s High-Level Shading Language (HLSL) team is said to be working closely with major GPU manufacturers, including AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, to ensure these new capabilities are optimized for a wide range of hardware architectures.\n\nBy embedding neural rendering capabilities into DirectX, Microsoft could broaden the adoption of AI-driven graphics across multiple platforms. Potential applications range from enhanced real-time ray tracing to adaptive resolution scaling for high-definition displays. While proprietary AI rendering technologies have been limited to specific ecosystems, Microsoft\u2019s open approach could democratize access, fostering greater innovation and competition.\n\nThough the updates are still in development and lack a definitive release date, they highlight the increasing role of AI in shaping the future of graphics technology.",

            "content": "This company is spending as much as anyone on AI infrastructure, and it's paying off already.\n\nMany analysts on Wall Street expect to see the first $4 trillion company sometime in 2025.\n\nNvidia (NVDA 5.27%) has seen its value soar amid rampant artificial intelligence (AI) spending as big tech companies race to build out bigger data centers and train more advanced AI models. With big tech planning to spend even more in 2025, its strong results should continue. Its market cap climbed from $416 billion the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to $3.43 trillion as of this writing.\n\nThe only company Nvidia trails in size is Apple (AAPL 1.82%), which has long sat at or near the top of the world's most valuable companies. Apple's massive iPhone user base has supported a growing services business over the past decade, and AI could propel that services business in 2025 as it integrates more advanced capabilities into its iOS and macOS operating systems. Its market cap sits at $3.67 trillion as of this writing.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) is leading in AI on two fronts. An early investment in OpenAI gave it the integrations it needed to sell developers on its Azure cloud computing platform. Azure sales have accelerated as a result, and management expects that trend to continue in 2025. Meanwhile, Microsoft's leading position in enterprise productivity software and PC operating systems gives it a huge market for its Copilot AI agents, which help improve accuracy and worker productivity. It has a market cap of $3.16 trillion as of this writing.\n\nAny of the above could become the first $4 trillion company in 2025. But one company could leapfrog them on the path to $5 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nOne of the biggest AI investors in the world\n\nThe big reason for all of the excitement around AI is its ability to transform multiple industries. And one company has its hand in several of those industries: Amazon (AMZN 2.09%). That's why it could be the first company to reach a $5 trillion valuation.\n\nAmazon is one of the biggest investors in AI. Management said during its third-quarter earnings call in September that it expected to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2024. The majority of that spending will go toward its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and other technology infrastructure. Some will go toward the continued build-out of its logistics network.\n\nAmazon's spending is absolutely massive, but it's proven to be well worth the price. Even while investing more than any other big tech company, it's generating record amounts of free cash flow. Free cash flow climbed to $47.7 billion over the trailing 12 months in Q3, more than doubling year over year.\n\nThe factors driving Amazon's incredible growth\n\nThose strong financial results are driven by Amazon's diverse operations. AWS has been a strong driving force. AWS sales accelerated in 2024, increasing 19% year over year in Q3. Moreover, AWS now has substantial scale, which shows up in operating income growth of 49% in Q3.\n\nAWS growth is powered by Amazon's support for advanced AI development across multiple foundation models. It continues to work on more efficient, custom-built AI accelerators for training and inference, which give its customers lower-cost options compared to Nvidia's chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the core of Amazon has always been its e-commerce business. Amazon continues to grow its share of e-commerce year after year despite strong competition from big-box retailers improving their online operations and ultra-cheap alternatives like Temu and Shein. The main reason Amazon has proved so successful at defending and expanding its lead is its Prime membership.\n\nPrime subscriptions give customers free one-day shipping on millions of items on Amazon's marketplace along with various other benefits, including Prime Video. The growth of Prime is a virtuous cycle whereby more members attract more merchants offering a wider variety of goods, in turn attracting more Prime members. Amazon's subscription services revenue continues to climb at a double-digit pace despite its high penetration rate among consumers.\n\nAmazon isn't just standing by and letting the flywheel spin. It's actively pushing. It overhauled its logistics operations in 2023 to focus on multiple regions throughout the United States. It uses advanced algorithms that predict demand and monitor in-stock levels to ensure items remain in stock across each region. The new regionalized network forms the foundation of a burgeoning logistics services business as well.\n\nFinally, Amazon's strong position in e-commerce has helped it build a massive digital advertising business. Ad sales totaled $53.6 billion over the trailing 12 months. Amazon should be able to sustain that pace as it expands video advertising (all Prime memberships include ad-supported streaming by default). Generative AI has the potential to supercharge ad sales on Amazon, especially considering Amazon's scale and data, which can fuel iterative testing for ad campaigns, ensuring better conversions for merchants.\n\nThe path to $5 trillion for Amazon\n\nAmazon's business is operated with one key metric in mind: long-term, free-cash-flow generation. To that end, it's been a wild success. As mentioned, free cash flow totaled $47.7 billion over the last 12 months. That's up from about $1 billion 10 years ago.\n\nOver the next five years, free cash flow could climb even higher. AWS, fueled by the growth of AI, is showing strong improvements in operating income. Despite the massive spending to build out new data centers, develop its own chips, and attract new customers with improvements to the platform, growth is outpacing the increased spending.\n\nMoreover, Amazon is currently undergoing a massive investment cycle. The $75 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures is a new record for the company. It's likely to increase further in 2025. But eventually, that spending will plateau. At that point, Amazon will reap what it's sown across AWS, its logistics network, and its e-commerce business (which fuels its advertising business). That cycle has played out multiple times for Amazon over the last 30 years.\n\nHistorically, Amazon has traded around 50 times free cash flow. At that multiple, it would be worth $5 trillion once it produces $100 billion in free cash flow. That may happen sooner than investors expect given the strong growth in free cash flow looks poised to continue soaring through the end of the decade.",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nOur Microsoft Digital team is implementing a modern engineering vision that creates a culture, tools, and practices focused on developing high-quality, secure, and feature-rich services to enable digital transformation across the company. Our Modern Engineering initiative has helped us be customer-obsessed, accelerated the delivery of new capabilities, and improved our engineering productivity.\n\nOur journey\n\nOur move to the cloud enabled us to increase the overall agility of the development process and accelerate value delivery for approximately 600 services comprised of about 1,400 components to new cloud technologies which provide quicker access to additional infrastructure. This enables spinning up environments and resources on demand, which allows an engineer to respond more quickly to evolving business needs.\n\nHowever, we still needed to address several structural issues, including inconsistency between teams in basic engineering fundamentals like coding standards, automated testing, security scans, compliance, release methodology, gated builds, and releases.\n\nWe lacked a centralized common engineering system and related practices. Recognizing that we could not continue to evolve our engineering system in a federated way, we invested in a central team. The team was chartered to develop a common engineering system based on Microsoft Azure DevOps, while driving consistency across the organization regarding how they design, code, instrument, test, build, and deploy services. We brought a product engineering mindset to our services by defining a vision for each service area and establishing priorities based on objectives and key results (OKRs) which we define, track, and report using Viva Goals. These scope what we want to achieve each planning period and then execute on them via a defined cadence of sprints. The resulting engineering processes have promoted business alignment, developer efficiency, and cross-team mobility.\n\nWe incorporated industry-leading development practices for accessibility, security, and compliance. Achieving compliance has been very challenging, forcing us to change from legacy processes and tooling and requiring us to actively respond to our technical debt in these areas. We also lacked a consistent level of telemetry and monitoring that allowed us to obtain key insights about service health, features, customer experience, and usage patterns. We have moved towards a Live Site culture so that we can comprehensively drive sustained improvements in service quality. Telemetry capabilities have been improved through the ability to do synthetic monitoring and the ingestion of data from a wide variety of data sources and using services such as Azure Monitor.\n\nOur vision for modern engineering\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s digital transformation requires us to deliver high-quality capabilities and solutions at a faster pace and with reliability and security. To achieve this, we\u2019re modernizing how we build, deploy, and manage our services to get new functionality in our users\u2019 hands as rapidly as possible. We\u2019re re-examining every part of our engineering process and instituting modern engineering practices. Satya Nadella, our Chief Executive Officer, summarized this well.\n\n\u201cIn order to deliver the experiences our customers need for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, we will modernize our engineering processes to be customer-obsessed, data-driven, speed-oriented and quality focused.\u201d\n\nOur ongoing investments in modern engineering practices and technology build on the foundation that we\u2019ve already established, and they reflect our vision and support our cultural changes. We have three key pillars on which we\u2019re basing these investments along with a commitment to infuse AI into each pillar wherever appropriate.\n\nCustomer obsession\n\nEngineering productivity\n\nRapid delivery\n\nCustomer obsession\n\nWe want to ensure our engineers keep customers front and center in their thoughts, so we\u2019re capturing feedback to provide our engineers with a deep understanding of the customer experience. Our service monitoring has enabled us to be alerted to problems and fix them before our customers are even aware of them.\n\nWe are the first customers of Microsoft\u2019s commercial offerings, which enables us to identify and address the engineering needs of the enterprise operating in a cloud-centric architecture. We constantly work with our product engineering groups across the company, creating a virtuous cycle that makes our products such as Azure DevOps and Azure services even more enterprise ready.\n\nUsing customer feedback to drive development\n\nWe\u2019re keeping the customer experience at the center of the engineering process via feedback loop mechanisms. Feedback loops serve as a foundation for hypothesis-driven product improvements based on actual sentiment and usage data. We\u2019re making feedback submission as easy as possible with the same tool that the Microsoft Office product suite uses. The Send a Smile feature automatically and consistently gathers feedback across multiple channels and key user touchpoints. We use this tool as a centralized data system for storing, triaging, and analyzing feedback, then aggregating it into actionable insights.\n\nWe encourage adoption of feedback loops and experimentation methods, such as feature flighting and ring deployment, to help measure the impact of product changes. With these foundational components in place, we\u2019re now correlating feedback data with related telemetry so that we can better understand product usability issues and the impact of service issues on customers. Our use of controlled rollouts eliminates the need for UAT environments, which accelerates overall delivery.\n\nTelemetry\n\nWe unified the telemetry from disparate systems by building on Azure Monitor to help us implement continuous improvements in the quality of our services. This platform integrates with heterogeneous data sources such as Kusto, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Application Insights, and Log Analytics to collect, process, and publish data from applications, infrastructure, and business processes. This helps us obtain end-to-end views and generate more actionable insights about our service management.\n\nWe\u2019re working toward delivering highly connected insights that aggregate the health of component services, customer experience, and business processes. This produces contextual data that not only identifies events but also identifies root causes and recommended next actions. We\u2019re using business process monitoring (BPM) to monitor true availability and performance by tracking successful transactions and customer impact across multiple services and business groups.\n\nTo achieve a sustained level of quality, we\u2019re leveraging synthetic monitoring for all critical services, especially those with a relatively low volume of business transactions. Data-enhanced incident tickets provide a business impact prioritized view of issues, supplemented with potential causes including those identified through Machine Learning. These data-enhanced tickets allow teams to focus on the most important tickets and reduce mitigation time.\n\nWe are investing in AI technologies to proactively detect anomalies and automatically remediate them wherever possible. Being able to intelligently respond to incidents reduces support costs and improves service reliability and the overall user experience.\n\nService health\n\nWe have focused on increasing our effectiveness in service and live site incident management. We rolled out a standard incident management process and measured continual improvements against key incident management metrics. We monitor service health metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) across the organization to understand customer sentiment and ensure services are reliable, compliant, and performing well. We\u2019re using consistent standards, which helps ensure that we can aggregate data at any level in the service hierarchy and compare it across different team groups. We built a more integrated experience on top of Azure Monitor, enriched with contextual data from the unified telemetry platform, and created a set of defined service health measures and an analyzer to track events that can affect service reliability, such as upcoming planned maintenance or compliance related changes. This enables us to detect and resolve issues proactively and quickly. Defined service health measures make it easier to enable service health reporting across various services.\n\nWe knew that we must connect service health to business process health, and how we prioritize issues, so that engineers could address them in a way that reduces the negative business impact. The experience we\u2019re building enables visualization of end-to-end business process health and the health of the underlying services by analyzing their telemetry.\n\nWe also simplified the flow of service health and engineering fundamentals data to the engineer and reduced the number of dashboards and tools they use. An internal tool is now the key repository for all service owners to view service health and other relevant KPIs. The tool\u2019s integrated notification workflow informs service owners when a service reaches a defined threshold, making it more convenient to prioritize any needed remediation into their backlogs.\n\nEmbracing a Live Site culture\n\nIncreasing scale and agility in our services and processes required us to focus on making customers\u2019 experiences better. We\u2019re establishing a Live Site culture and pursuing excellence via customer-obsessed, data-driven, multidisciplinary teams. These teams embrace potential failure with honest observation, continuous learning, and measurable improvement targets.\n\nWe host an organization-wide, live site review that includes postmortem reviews on incidents, examining long-term remediation plans, and guiding service teams through modern engineering standards that will help them perform robust reviews at a local level. We base these reviews on standard and actionable reports that contain leading indicators for outages or failures based on the analysis of telemetry, synthetic monitoring, and other data.\n\nEngineering productivity\n\nWe\u2019re providing our engineers with best-in-class unified standards and practices in a common engineering system, based on the latest Azure tools, such as Azure DevOps. A consistent development environment allows our engineers to transition smoothly between projects and teams. Improved automation, consistency, and centralized engineering systems enable engineers to better focus on the core role of developing. This also reduces onboarding time and allows our engineers to be more flexible across projects.\n\nIntegrating developer tooling\n\nWe made organizationally mandated code analysis and compliance tools accessible directly within the development environment, thereby helping our shift-left goal. We built self-service capabilities to manage access, set policies, and make changes to Azure DevOps artifacts such as area paths, work items, and repositories. This has made it easy for engineers to create, update, or retire services, components, and subscriptions, minimizing the time spent managing such resources. We want to extend our shift left goal to also examine optimization of our Azure service design and surface recommendations for configuration optimization so that these occur early in the deployment cycle and allow us to rightsize our configurations and avoid unnecessary Azure costs.\n\nEnabling code reuse\n\nWhile at a low volume, we\u2019re still supporting a few applications (fewer than five percent) that use on-premises servers and domain-joined Azure virtual machines. This results in ongoing effort to patch servers, upgrade software, and perform basic infrastructure maintenance tasks. It also impedes our ability to scale apps to accommodate growth. We\u2019ve transformed these applications to Microsoft Azure platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) based solutions, thereby leveraging the scale and availability of Azure. We enabled this by providing architectural guidance and tools to migrate data, refactoring existing functionality as APIs, and building lightweight applications by reusing APIs that others have already published.\n\nPromoting data and code reuse to build solutions more rapidly and align with a service-oriented architecture requires that developers have the ability to publish and discover APIs easily. We built an API economy by creating a common set of guidelines for developing coherent APIs, and a central catalog and search experience for discovery. We integrated validation against API guidelines and enabled our teams to integrate API publishing into their Azure DevOps pipelines. We created a set of common API health analytics. We also enabled the growth of inner source in which sharing code outside of APIs is achieved.\n\nWorkforce strategies\n\nTo address our previous high level of dependency on suppliers, we implemented a new workforce strategy, hiring more full-time employees and bringing more work in-house. This allowed us to transform and modernize how we deliver services. Furthermore, this workforce strategy makes it imperative that there is full-time employee oversight of any supplier deliveries, ensuring they adhere to processes, standards, and regulatory requirements, including security, accessibility, and privacy. We implemented a common bar for hiring across all teams and a common onboarding program to ensure all new hires receive a consistent level of training on all key tools and technologies. As we ramp up our use of AI technologies to further transform our engineering, we are investing in re-skilling and training initiatives to expand the engineering capacity available to work on AI-related projects.\n\nUniversal design system\n\nWe leveraged Microsoft\u2019s product design system to engineer solutions that look and behave like other Microsoft products. Every product should meet the quality expectations of today\u2019s consumers, meaning that every piece of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) should be engineered with accessibility, responsiveness, and familiar behaviors, states, motion, and visual styling. On complex but common components like headers, navigation menus, and data grids this can mean weeks of engineering time multiplied across every Microsoft Digital team that requires the same components. This is considerably reduced by adopting a universal design system.\n\nRapid delivery\n\nTo be customer-obsessed, we\u2019re acquiring and protecting customer trust in every aspect of our relationship. We are tracking delivery metrics so that we can shorten lead times from ingestion of customer requirements to the time the solution is in the customer\u2019s hands and then on to measuring customer usability and feedback, while still ensuring service reliability. We\u2019re helping engineers achieve this objective by checking for issues earlier in the pipeline and providing a way to rapidly experiment and mitigate risk. We are building feedback-loop mechanisms to ensure that we can understand the user experience as new functionality gets deployed, and we perform automated rollbacks if customer reaction or service-health signals are less favorable than we anticipated.\n\nIntegrating security, accessibility, and fundamentals\n\nDelivering secure, compliant, accessible, dependable, and high-quality services is critical to building trust with our customers. Our engineers are checking for issues earlier in the pipeline, and we\u2019re enabling them to experiment rapidly while limiting potential negative effect on the release process.\n\nWe moved to a shift left process, in which work happens as early in the development process as possible. This enabled us to avoid carrying debt from sprint to sprint. We also implemented gates in the developer workflow that help build security in a streamlined way and auto-onboarding services to ensure continuous compliance.\n\nWe scan code for security issues and log bugs in Azure DevOps that we discover during the scanning process, so developers can fix them directly in the same engineering system they use for other functional bugs rather than having to triage separately from security tools.\n\nWe assess accessibility within our applications, but this happens late in the development process. To move this further upstream, we adopted accessibility insights tooling during development and now expose accessibility-related bugs as part of the pipeline workflow.\n\nWe are adopting AI technologies for providing accessibility guidance and conducting accessibility assessments to ensure that our applications conform to accessibility requirements.\n\nAdditionally, we enabled engineering teams to utilize the guardrails we\u2019re implementing by integrating policy fundamentals into the pipeline, and we\u2019re implementing continuous integration practices. This ensures that all production releases, including hot fixes, come from builds of the main branch of source code and all have appropriate compliance steps applied consistently. Each pull request must have a successful build to ensure that the main branch is golden and always production ready. Maintaining high-quality code in the main branch minimizes build failures that ultimately slow our time to production.\n\nDeploying safely to customers\n\nWe created an environment where teams test ideas and prototypes before building them. The goal is to drive customer outcomes in a way that encourages risk-taking with a fail-fast, fail-safe mentality. Central to increasing the velocity of service updates to customers is a consistent, simple, and streamlined way to implement safe deployments. Progressive exposure and feature flags are key in deploying new capabilities to users via controlled rollouts, so we can quickly start receiving customer feedback.\n\nWe implemented checks and balances in the process by leveraging service indicators such as latency and faults within the pipeline, thereby catching regressions and allowing initiation of automated rollbacks when predefined thresholds are exceeded. Implementing safe deployment practices, combined with a streamlined and well-managed pipeline, are two of the key elements for achieving a continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD) model.\n\nReliability and efficiency\n\nWe are enhancing our DevOps engineering pipeline across services by identifying and removing bottlenecks and improving our services\u2019 reliability. We\u2019ll use DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics to measure our execution and monitor our progress against industry benchmarks.\n\nWe\u2019re focusing on deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and mean time to recover in order to gain a comprehensive view of our software or service delivery capabilities. Based on this data, we\u2019ll increase productivity, speed up time-to-market, and enhance user satisfaction.",

Back in the day, my CTO just wanted 3 tiers: entry level, top IC, manager. That was it. 3 pay bands, and they were very tight. Equity varied a lot more, but I know it was important to my CTO that everyone on his team felt like equal stakeholders, relative to experience.\n\nI do think this is true at most start-ups, today too. They want fairly consistent comp across engineering, and fear if nothing else, lots of issue if favorites are played, the new \u201cguy\u201d gets a better deal, etc.\n\nBut AI is challenging this.\n\nNo start-up can compete with OpenAI\u201ds massive comp and annual tender offers to provide partial liquidity. But it has created a two-tiered comp system for engineers. The \u201cAI Team\u201d often makes a lot more.\n\nI don\u2019t have any answers here but I found the above Business Insider article with a leaked Microsoft memo helpful:\n\nThey pay AI engineers 48% more\n\nThey have special spot retention bonuses for AI engineers to keep them\n\nNetflix has crossed $1m comp for AI leads:\n\nNetflix is paying up to $1M cash for someone to a lead a team making foundation models. pic.twitter.com/zPCnpnPrM9 \u2014 Deedy (@deedydas) February 4, 2025\n\nThis is roughly what I see, too, though often not quite at this scale. The \u201cAI Team\u201d at many SaaS startups makes 30%-40% more. It creates issues and drama.\n\nBut probably not paying their premium will create just as many issues and drama as well.\n\nWhat I often see is many SaaS companies aren\u2019t truly AI-native and often just have 1 or 2 true AI magicians on the team. The ones that really make the AI magic happen. And you often can\u2019t afford to lose them. Are they worth 48% more? Fairness aside \u2014 of course they are.",

            "content": "Microsoft has revealed that it's pursuing legal action against a \"foreign-based threat\u2013actor group\" for operating a hacking-as-a-service infrastructure to intentionally get around the safety controls of its generative artificial intelligence (AI) services and produce offensive and harmful content.\n\nThe tech giant's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) said it has observed the threat actors \"develop sophisticated software that exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public websites,\" and \"sought to identify and unlawfully access accounts with certain generative AI services and purposely alter the capabilities of those services.\"\n\nThe adversaries then used these services, such as Azure OpenAI Service, and monetized the access by selling them to other malicious actors, providing them with detailed instructions as to how to use these custom tools to generate harmful content. Microsoft said it discovered the activity in July 2024.\n\nThe Windows maker said it has since revoked the threat-actor group's access, implemented new countermeasures, and fortified its safeguards to prevent such activity from occurring in the future. It also said it obtained a court order to seize a website (\"aitism[.]net\") that was central to the group's criminal operation.\n\nThe popularity of AI tools like OpenAI ChatGPT has also had the consequence of threat actors abusing them for malicious intents, ranging from producing prohibited content to malware development. Microsoft and OpenAI have repeatedly disclosed that nation-state groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are using their services for reconnaissance, translation, and disinformation campaigns.\n\nCourt documents show that at least three unknown individuals are behind the operation, leveraging stolen Azure API keys and customer Entra ID authentication information to breach Microsoft systems and create harmful images using DALL-E in violation of its acceptable use policy. Seven other parties are believed to have used the services and tools provided by them for similar purposes.\n\nThe manner in which the API keys are harvested is currently not known, but Microsoft said the defendants engaged in \"systematic API key theft\" from multiple customers, including several U.S. companies, some of which are located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\n\"Using stolen Microsoft API Keys that belonged to U.S.-based Microsoft customers, defendants created a hacking-as-a-service scheme \u2013 accessible via infrastructure like the 'rentry.org/de3u' and 'aitism.net' domains \u2013 specifically designed to abuse Microsoft's Azure infrastructure and software,\" the company said in a filing.\n\nAccording to a now removed GitHub repository, de3u has been described as a \"DALL-E 3 frontend with reverse proxy support.\" The GitHub account in question was created on November 8, 2023.\n\nIt's said the threat actors took steps to \"cover their tracks, including by attempting to delete certain Rentry.org pages, the GitHub repository for the de3u tool, and portions of the reverse proxy infrastructure\" following the seizure of \"aitism[.]net.\"\n\nMicrosoft noted that the threat actors used de3u and a bespoke reverse proxy service, called the oai reverse proxy, to make Azure OpenAl Service API calls using the stolen API keys in order to unlawfully generate thousands of harmful images using text prompts. It's unclear what type of offensive imagery was created.\n\nThe oai reverse proxy service running on a server is designed to funnel communications from de3u user computers through a Cloudflare tunnel into the Azure OpenAI Service, and transmit the responses back to the user device.\n\n\"The de3u software allows users to issue Microsoft API calls to generate images using the DALL-E model through a simple user interface that leverages the Azure APIs to access the Azure OpenAI Service,\" Redmond explained.\n\n\"Defendants' de3u application communicates with Azure computers using undocumented Microsoft network APIs to send requests designed to mimic legitimate Azure OpenAPI Service API requests. These requests are authenticated using stolen API keys and other authenticating information.\"\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the use of proxy services to illegally access LLM services was highlighted by Sysdig in May 2024 in connection with an LLMjacking attack campaign targeting AI offerings from Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure, Mistral, and OpenAI using stolen cloud credentials and selling the access to other actors.\n\n\"Defendants have conducted the affairs of the Azure Abuse Enterprise through a coordinated and continuous pattern of illegal activity in order to achieve their common unlawful purposes,\" Microsoft said.\n\n\"Defendants' pattern of illegal activity is not limited to attacks on Microsoft. Evidence Microsoft has uncovered to date indicates that the Azure Abuse Enterprise has been targeting and victimizing other AI service providers.\"",

            "content": "Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) made headlines late last week when it announced it would spend $80 billion this year building data centers that would train artificial intelligence (AI) models and handle AI and cloud-based applications around the world. More than half of the investment will be in the U.S.\n\nTo put the amount Microsoft is spending on AI infrastructure in perspective, that is more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of many countries, including Croatia and Lithuania (to name just two).\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud has been a big AI winner, with the unit growing its revenue by 33% year over year last quarter and Azure OpenAI use doubling in the last six months. However, the company has said growth could be even greater if it were not for capacity constraints, as demand for its AI services has outstripped capacity.\n\nThere were certainly clues that the company was about to go on a big building spree in data centers; it had $108.7 billion in finance leases for data centers whose construction had not yet commenced. These leases were set to go into effect between fiscal 2025 and 2030 with lease terms from one to 20 years.\n\nNvidia will be the big winner\n\nI think Microsoft will benefit from its increased data center spending given the strong demand its cloud business is seeing. And I believe Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) will be the ultimate winner from this spending. Not all of that $80 billion will go toward graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI accelerator chips (Nvidia specialties), but a significant portion will.\n\nFor perspective, for its fiscal 2024, ended in June, Microsoft had $44.5 billion in capital expenditures (capex), most of which went toward data centers and cloud computing. The company has said that about half of its capex goes toward assets with long practical lives, while the other half goes toward central processing unit (CPU) and GPU servers.\n\nMicrosoft was Nvidia's largest customer in 2024, buying a reported 485,000 of its GPUs, more than twice the amount of its second-largest customer, Meta Platforms. Taken all together, it looks like Nvidia's largest customer is about to spend significantly more on GPUs in 2025 than it did in 2024 -- a huge win for the company.\n\nEven more so, Microsoft's finance leases that have not yet commenced still indicate that it does not plan on stopping its data center spending this year. If $40 billion of its capex is going toward long-life assets like leases, that means less than half of those leases will commence this year.\n\nIn addition, the announcement of the huge spending spree could very well spur more AI infrastructure spending from other Nvidia customers. Large tech companies such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms have both stressed the importance of AI and how the biggest risk is underspending, not overspending. Meanwhile, I think it is safe to say there are some pretty big egos in the tech world, and many execs want to win the AI race. As such, I wouldn't be surprised to see other large hyperscalers (companies with huge data center operations) also ramp up spending.\n\nNvidia remains the king of GPUs, holding about a 90% market share in the space. Its CUDA software platform, which lets developers program its chips for different tasks, has proved to be a big differentiator and created a wide moat for the company. With competitor Advanced Micro Devices still trailing behind with its software, Nvidia looks poised to continue to be the biggest AI infrastructure winner.\n\nThe company's toughest competition may come from custom AI chips that companies like Broadcom and Marvell Technology help clients develop. These chips are designed to perform very specific tasks and thus can perform them better than GPUs, which have more flexibility.\n\nBut these chips are also customer-specific. And for mass deployment at scale, Nvidia and its GPUs are still the quickest and easiest ways to build out large AI infrastructure projects, and as such will continue to hold a large market share.\n\nIs Nvidia's stock a buy?\n\nNvidia still has a large opportunity with companies continuing to pour money into AI infrastructure. The fact that its largest customer is greatly ramping up its investment in this area is a great sign that the chipmaker will continue to see outsize growth in 2025.\n\nNvidia's stock continues to trade at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of only about 31.4 based on 2025 analyst estimates, and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.98. A PEG below 1 is generally view as undervalued, and growth stocks will often command PEGs well above 1.\n\nWith the company looking to be the biggest beneficiary of Microsoft's $80 billion data center build-out, and its stock still attractively priced, Nvidia remains a solid option for investors.",

            "content": "When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up an impressive 151% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 1.0%.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Earnings Per Share Growth January 11th 2025\n\nWe know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Microsoft the TSR over the last 5 years was 162%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMicrosoft provided a TSR of 8.7% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 21% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that Microsoft is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...",

In a complaint unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia, we are pursuing an action to disrupt cybercriminals who intentionally develop tools specifically designed to bypass the safety guardrails of generative AI services, including Microsoft\u2019s, to create offensive and harmful content. Microsoft continues to go to great lengths to enhance the resilience of our products and services against abuse; however, cybercriminals remain persistent and relentlessly innovate their tools and techniques to bypass even the most robust security measures. With this action, we are sending a clear message: the weaponization of our AI technology by online actors will not be tolerated.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI services deploy strong safety measures, including built-in safety mitigations at the AI model, platform, and application levels. As alleged in our court filings unsealed today, Microsoft has observed a foreign-based threat\u2013actor group develop sophisticated software that exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public websites. In doing so, they sought to identify and unlawfully access accounts with certain generative AI services and purposely alter the capabilities of those services. Cybercriminals then used these services and resold access to other malicious actors with detailed instructions on how to use these custom tools to generate harmful and illicit content. Upon discovery, Microsoft revoked cybercriminal access, put in place countermeasures, and enhanced its safeguards to further block such malicious activity in the future.\n\nThis activity directly violates U.S. law and the Acceptable Use Policy and Code of Conduct for our services. Today\u2019s unsealed court filings are part of an ongoing investigation into the creators of these illicit tools and services. Specifically, the court order has enabled us to seize a website instrumental to the criminal operation that will allow us to gather crucial evidence about the individuals behind these operations, to decipher how these services are monetized, and to disrupt additional technical infrastructure we find. At the same time, we have added additional safety mitigations targeting the activity we have observed and will continue to strengthen our guardrails based on the findings of our investigation.\n\nEvery day, individuals leverage generative AI tools to enhance their creative expression and productivity. Unfortunately, and as we have seen with the emergence of other technologies, the benefits of these tools attract bad actors who seek to exploit and abuse technology and innovation for malicious purposes. Microsoft recognizes the role we play in protecting against the abuse and misuse of our tools as we and others across the sector introduce new capabilities. Last year, we committed to continuing to innovate on new ways to keep users safe and outlined a comprehensive approach to combat abusive AI-generated content and protect people and communities. This most recent legal action builds on that promise.\n\nBeyond legal actions and the perpetual strengthening of our safety guardrails, Microsoft continues to pursue additional proactive measures and partnerships with others to tackle online harms while advocating for new laws that provide government authorities with necessary tools to effectively combat the abuse of AI, particularly to harm others. Microsoft recently released an extensive report, \u201cProtecting the Public from Abusive AI-Generated Content,\u201d which sets forth recommendations for industry and government to better protect the public, and specifically women and children, from actors with malign motives.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Microsoft\u2019s DCU has worked to disrupt and deter cybercriminals who seek to weaponize the everyday tools consumers and businesses have come to rely on. Today, the DCU builds on this approach and is applying key learnings from past cybersecurity actions to prevent the abuse of generative AI. Microsoft will continue to do its part by looking for creative ways to protect people online, transparently reporting on our findings, taking legal action against those who attempt to weaponize AI technology, and working with others across public and private sectors globally to help all AI platforms remain secure against harmful abuse.\n\nTags: AI, cybercrime, cybercriminals, cybersecurity, DCU, Digital Crimes Unit, generative ai, Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit",

The activity was first discovered in July 2024 through August 2024, and Microsoft said some of the stolen API keys belonged to U.S. companies located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the defendants used a software tool that allowed them to gain insight into Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s filtering system, allowing them to identify specific phrases that were flagged as safety violations and reverse engineer language that would circumvent those restrictions. The software also allowed users to strip metadata from created media that is used to digitally watermark and identify AI-generated content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a blog describing the action, Steven Masada, assistant general counsel for Microsoft\u2019s digital crimes unit wrote that the court order and seizure \u201cwill allow us to gather crucial evidence about the individuals behind these operations, decipher how these services are monetized, and disrupt additional technical infrastructure we find.\u201d\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CyberScoop that the company has obtained a temporary restraining order that allows for the seizure of the domain listed in the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe seizure of this domain enables [Microsoft] to redirect communications occurring on the malicious domain to our [Digital Crimes Unit] sinkhole, making it available for the investigative team\u2019s analysis, the spokesperson said. \u201cIn addition to the initial seizure, we also secured expedited discovery to further our investigation as well as preserve evidence at the locations we identified as hosting part of the \u2018infrastructure\u2019 used by the defendants.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft uses OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E image generator, and both OpenAI and Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI Service implement protocols and guardrails to prevent the creation of violent or hateful images, or photorealistic depictions of real faces or public figures. Neither the blog nor the complaint mentioned what the produced images depicted.\n\nMicrosoft does not know the identities of the ten individuals, instead identifying them through specific websites, stolen Azure API keys and GitHub tools used in the scheme. The complaint claims that at least three are the providers of these services and live outside of the United States, while the others appear to be end users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe individuals are accused of setting up a hacking-as-a-service scheme, systematically stealing API keys from customers with access to Microsoft generative AI systems and selling that access to interested parties over the internet.\n\nGenerative AI systems like those offered by Microsoft and OpenAI are at the forefront of a battle between companies providing sophisticated text and image generation capabilities and malicious actors looking to exploit them.\n\nCybercriminals, scammers and foreign intelligence services have all sought to use generative AI tools to enhance or compliment hacking campaigns and generate false media for disinformation campaigns.\n\nAI companies have sought to allay concerns around potential abuse of their technologies by implementing numerous technical guardrails and joining international agreements. Still, outside researchers have identified numerous methods capable of bypassing many of these restrictions, including simple prompting techniques.\n\nHowever, there are some signs that the protections put in place by commercial U.S. companies may be more effective at keeping foreign actors from fully leveraging the technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that foreign countries like Russia, China and Iran all used generative AI tools to create fake media designed to influence the 2024 U.S. elections. But the effectiveness of those campaigns was hindered in part due to struggles by those countries \u201cto overcome restrictions built into many AI tools and remain undetected,\u201d according to a senior ODNI official.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft expects to spend roughly $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers to train large language models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications during its current fiscal year, the company\u2019s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a Friday blog post.\n\nMore than half of the investments will be in the U.S., according to Smith. The tech giant\u2019s current fiscal year 2025 runs through June 30.\n\nAI workloads triggered cloud capacity constraints last year, ratcheting up an ongoing data center building boom. Microsoft responded by nearly doubling capital investments to $20 billion in the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, CFO Amy Hood said during an October earnings call. \u201cWe expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand signals,\u201d she added.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCloud infrastructure, AI compute capacity and domestic politics coalesced in Smith\u2019s post, which laid out a three-pronged plan for U.S. economic success centered around data centers, upskilling and technology exports.\n\n\u201cThe incoming administration can strengthen these foundational elements, building on the work from President Trump\u2019s first term,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the 2019 American AI Initiative. \u201cPresident Trump and Congress should expand on these efforts to support advancing America\u2019s AI leadership.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has been growing its Azure public cloud empire at home and abroad.\n\nIn addition to breaking ground on a $3.3 billion Wisconsin facility last year, Microsoft launched its first data center region in Mexico and further expanded its cloud footprint in France, Germany and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe intend to invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build trusted and secure AI and cloud data center infrastructure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is part of a global infrastructure that now reaches 40 countries.\u201d\n\nIn September, the company partnered with investment firms Blackrock, MGX and Global Infrastructure Partners to amass $100 billion for data centers and supporting power infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t operating in a vacuum. AWS and Google Cloud, the two other global cloud giants, are also pouring billions into AI infrastructure, driving massive growth in the data center market.\n\nBig tech companies spent $180 billion on data center expansions and related infrastructure last year, according to Dell\u2019Oro Group research. The firm told CIO Dive it expects some cooling in the coming months as cloud providers consolidate expansion plans.\n\nBut hunger for AI-optimized compute has only intensified.\n\nHyperscalers were on pace to deploy over 5 million AI accelerators in 2024, Dell\u2019Oro Group found in its analysis of third quarter financials.\n\n\u201cDemand for accelerators has been growing at a breakneck pace as the hyperscalers race to deploy infrastructure for the training and inference of large language models,\u201d Baron Fung, senior research director at Dell\u2019Oro Group, said in the report.\n\nMicrosoft sees its success as dependent on a competitive technology ecosystem, Smith said in the blog post. \u201cThis includes our longstanding competitors, chip suppliers, applications companies, systems integrators, service providers, and the millions of software developers who use our products to create customized solutions,\u201d he said.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nOverview of rStar-Math. Credit: arXiv (2025). DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2501.04519\n\nA team of math and AI researchers at Microsoft Asia has designed and developed a small language model (SLM) that can be used to solve math problems. The group has posted a paper on the arXiv preprint server outlining the technology and math behind the new tool and how well it has performed on standard benchmarks.\n\nOver the past several years, multiple tech giants have been working hard to steadily improve their LLMs, resulting in AI products that have in a very short time become mainstream. Unfortunately, such tools require massive amounts of computer power, which means they consume a lot of electricity, making them expensive to maintain.\n\nBecause of that, some in the field have been turning to SLMs, which as their name implies, are smaller and thus far less resource intensive. Some are small enough to run on a local device. One of the main ways AI researchers make the best use of SLMs is by narrowing their focus\u2014instead of trying to answer any question about anything, they are designed to answer questions about something much more specific\u2014like math. In this new effort, Microsoft has focused its efforts on not just solving math problems, but also in teaching an SLM how to reason its way through a problem.\n\nIn developing its model, Microsoft made it in a way that allows for its use by other, larger models. An overall strategy that could be the wave of the future. New LLMs could soon be nothing more than an amalgam of many SLMs. Notably, the announcement by Microsoft came not long after the debut of its Phi-4 SLM, which also serves to solve math problems.\n\nrStar-Math does its work differently than Phi-4, the researchers note, by making use of Monte Carlo Tree Search\u2014a reasoning method developed to mimic the way humans attack problems in a step-by-by process. They note that by using such an approach, their new SLM can break down a problem into its smaller parts as a way to figure out how to solve a particular problem. They also note that rStar-Math shows its work by outputting its thought process in both Python code and natural language.\n\nThe team also noted that rStar-Math has already scored well on several benchmarks. And according to a post on Hugging Face, the team plans to make the code and data publicly available on GitHub.\n\nMore information: Xinyu Guan et al, rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking, arXiv (2025).

Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon recently observed that generative AI\u2019s comparatively short cycle times are helping his company learn and innovate faster to better anticipate customer needs.1 I\u2019m energized to see the positive impact that the pace of AI innovation is bringing to the retail world.\n\nThis time last year, I was having conversations with retailers around the world who couldn\u2019t wait to tap the seemingly unlimited potential of AI. For many of them, though, translating that promise into bottom-line impact took time. While many retailers were already deploying AI tools to drive increased revenue and reimagine cumbersome business processes, most were still figuring out where to begin and how specifically AI could help them gain an edge in the market. Today, the conversations I have are more sharply focused on identifying AI use cases that can help retailers grow revenue and increase profitability across the value chain. To achieve these goals, retailers are beginning to develop a rich agentic world marked by a vivid tapestry of AI agents. In addition to agents for app development, compliance, information security, and other broad, cross-organizational business process needs, retailers are already deploying custom agentic solutions to improve core retail scenarios, like shopping and store operations. A new era of AI is here.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud for Retail Connect your customers, your people, and your data Get started today\n\nThis year at NRF 2025, we\u2019re excited and proud to demonstrate how our data solutions, Copilots, and customizable retail agents are helping to lead this shift across every retail segment. We\u2019re just as eager to showcase how easy we\u2019ve made it for retailers to maximize the success of their AI investments on the Microsoft Copilot and AI stack\u2014the most advanced platform for creating AI solutions that drive retail growth and profitability. Used by over 100,000 organizations worldwide, Microsoft Copilot Studio offers over 1,400 prebuilt plugins and connectors to integrate all of your data, APIs, and other third-party services. And with the unveiling of Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, organizations can simplify and scale their AI workloads with confidence. The same AI platform that we build our Microsoft Copilots on is now available to retailers. With the most versatile stack of AI development tools, we are committed to helping our customers push the frontiers of what\u2019s possible with agentic retail and be ready for whatever the future may hold.\n\nIn short, our mission is to help our customers become Retail Ready.\n\nWhat does it mean to be Retail Ready?\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving retail landscape, being \u201cRetail Ready\u201d means more than just keeping up with trends. It\u2019s about being forward-thinking and making smart technology investments with the power to grow the topline while improving the bottom line. Together with our partners, Microsoft Cloud for Retail provides AI that is built for the future, ready now. With our deep customer relationships and comprehensive partner network, we are uniquely positioned to help retailers across all segments find new value with AI. Our solutions enable retailers to transform the shopper journey, empower the retail workforce of the future, create agile, sustainable supply chains, and unlock the potential of their data.\n\nPersonalized Shopping Agent improves the shopping experience for consumers with a context-aware conversational assistant to help them find the perfect products for their needs. Store Operations Agent puts safe, company-governed generative AI in the hands of store associates so they can spend less time searching for product information or answers to store policies and procedures and more time helping customers. And retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric give retailers the power to unify and enrich a wide range of retail data sources, enabling real-time, actionable insights.\n\nTo learn more about how Microsoft\u2019s retail agents and AI solutions are helping customer become Retail Ready, read AI-powered retail: Elevating customer experience and operational efficiency.\n\nTransform the shopper journey\n\nIn today\u2019s highly competitive retail landscape, personalization has become the standard. Bain Consulting Group estimates that retailers can increase revenue by 5% to 10% through AI personalization tools.3 But the stakes can be high. As the technology becomes more common, customers are beginning to expect tailored experiences and reacting more strongly to ineffective personalization. To deliver the optimal customer journey, retailers are increasingly turning to generative AI-powered solutions that help them answer shopper inquiries, manage virtual shopping carts, tailor marketing and product recommendations, deliver enhanced search capabilities, elevate customer service interactions, and more. By engaging with customers early in their shopping journey, conversational commerce agents and other AI personalization tools are boosting customer satisfaction and driving top-line growth.\n\nA prime example of the success of gen AI-powered conversational commerce is Walmart\u2019s integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 into its voice order and Text to Shop features. This innovation allows customers to search for items, place orders, and schedule pickups or deliveries with human-like, interactive responses throughout the entire buying journey.\n\nRecognizing that up to 80% of tire purchases start with a visit to a retailer\u2019s website, Canadian Tire Corporation built a conversational commerce app using OpenAI Service and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. Named CeeTee, the app helps customers identify the right tires for their needs early in the shopping journey, increasing opportunities for conversion and boosting brand loyalty.\n\nRetailers like Natuzzi and Gardens Alive are leveraging Dynamics 365 Contact Center and Dynamics 365 Customer Service to transform customer service with generative AI. These solutions enable personalized customer journeys by answering inquiries, tailoring recommendations, and streamlining operations, creating seamless self- and assisted-service experiences that win customer loyalty.\n\nThe Dynamics 365 platform is enabling gourmet chocolatier Venchi to deliver a personalized omnichannel shopping experience to customers and improve clienteling at the point of sale.\n\nJoin Kathleen Mitford, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Global Industry Marketing on Monday, January 13, 2025 on the Big Ideas stage at NRF 2025 for Transform the shopper journey to learn more from Thilina Gunasinghe, Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Bath and Body Works, Fabio Tormen, Chief Information Officer at Venchi, and Kathie Johnson, Chief Marketing Officer at Sitecore.\n\nEmpower the retail workforce of the future\n\nAt Microsoft, we\u2019re dedicated to developing AI tools that enrich the employee experience with the access and insights they need to deliver exceptional customer interactions. Whether through the use of our Store Operations Agent or through a custom partner-developed implementation, retailers now have the power to elevate their retail workforce, making them more agile and responsive to customer needs, and employees are ready for AI. The 2024 Work Trends Index found that 84% say AI helps them be more creative and focus on the most important work.2\n\nI\u2019m really excited about the unique and innovative ways our customers are deploying AI to empower their retail workforces. Here are a few notable examples:\n\nSwedish retailer Lindex custom designed its Lindex Copilot to understand store associate roles and responsibilities and provide tailored guidance that helps employees deliver contextually relevant and personalized support.\n\nWith their custom ChatCTC employee digital assistant, Canadian Tire Corporation is saving its 3,000+ corporate employees 30 to 60 minutes a day, freeing them from mundane tasks to focus on higher-value customer experiences.\n\nUsing Store Operations Agent, employees at leading Nordic retailer Kappahl can now use generative AI to securely surface product information and store policies and procedures in seconds, increasing store associate productivity and upleveling the shopping experience for customers.\n\nMediaMarktSaturn\u2019s MyBuddy voice-navigated in-ear AI agent\u2014developed in partnership with Accenture/Avanade and leveraging Personalized Shopping Agent\u2014enables store associates to \u201cshop\u201d the store catalog for the best products for the customers. This solution boosts customer confidence and enhances employees\u2019 product knowledge to make the most of conversion opportunities at the point of sale.\n\nJoin me on Sunday, January 12, 2025 on the Big Ideas stage at NRF 2025 for Retail ready: AI built for the future, ready now, to hear from Walmart and Aaron Berg, Vice President, Digital Transformation at Walmart, and Cari Covent, Head of AI and Emerging Technology at Canadian Tire about the opportunities and challenges for organizations bringing generative AI to their workforces.\n\nCreate an agile, sustainable supply chain\n\nReducing out-of-stocks isn\u2019t the only way retailers can get ahead. Many retailers are discovering the benefits of a more sustainable supply chain, from increased customer satisfaction to growing supply chain resilience. Not surprisingly, IDC Retail Insights found that supply network optimization was the second-fastest growing digital transformation use case among retailers in the Americas, with a compound annual spending growth rate of 21.6%.4\n\nLet\u2019s look at a couple of the top supply chain focused retailers using AI.\n\nThe Netherlands\u2019 largest grocer, Albert Heijn, set out to reduce food waste by (among other things) improving the efficiency and precision of its supply chain. Using generative AI tools that help food arrive to the point of sale at maximum freshness and dynamically discounting prices to encourage shoppers to buy before that food is no longer fresh, Albert Heijn is helping save more than 250,000 kilos of food from going to waste.\n\nSPAR ICS, the independent IT unit of SPAR Austria Group, created an award-winning, AI-enabled demand forecasting system. With the new system, SPAR Austria Group is optimizing its supply chain and achieving 90 percent inventory prediction accuracy.\n\nLeading Australian retailer Coles has launched a five-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to expand Coles\u2019 world-leading edge computing platform, Intelligent Edge Backbone (IEB). Coles and Microsoft will co-innovate to explore how the IEB can connect and manage IoT devices across Coles\u2019 supply chain and into stores to advance Coles\u2019 sustainability goals, improve customer experiences, reduce stock loss, and boost team member productivity and safety.\n\nJoin Gina Claxton, Microsoft CVP, US Retail and Consumer Goods, Avanade, and 1-800-Flowers.com on Monday, January 13th on the Big Ideas stage for Selling roses: Avanade presents \u2013 the 1-800-Flowers story to learn how the business has flourished by staying agile and innovative, moving early to thrive in the .com era, and now doing the same in the AI age with the help of Microsoft and Avanade.\n\nUnlock the potential of your data\n\nFor retailers seeking to understand their customers, it\u2019s hard to overstate the value of a data platform that enables them to leverage all of their data while minimizing risk through robust security and governance. In their 2024 Global Retail Survey, IDC Retail Insights saw data emerge as \u201cthe main internal concern for retail organizations as leveraging data for operational efficiency and customer experience personalization becomes key to competitiveness.\u201d5 Conversely, the AI opportunities are seemingly limitless for the retailers who are able to unify and secure their retail data and turn it into customer value.\n\nHere\u2019s how some of our customers are using Microsoft\u2019s data platform and AI solutions to unlock the potential of their data:\n\nThe ASOS team is using Azure AI Foundry to develop custom AI solutions that pull and embed knowledge of trends as they surface, enabling them to curate and share items with shoppers based on a deep knowledge of the latest trends.\n\nSaucony optimized customer acquisition during Black Friday and Cyber Monday via a custom AI model developed in partnership with Yobi, leading to a strong surge in new customers in just weeks.\n\nWith the help of the Microsoft Fabric data platform, Chanel is deploying generative AI securely for critical tasks like content creation, personalization, quality monitoring, supply chain management, real-time translations, and sales aftercare.\n\nMicrosoft Azure\u2019s suite of tools helped Brazilian retail chain Fast Shop prepare their data estate for AI transformation via improved data reliability, faster data delivery, enhanced data governance, security, and self-service access for its lines of business.\n\nJoin Keith Mercier, Microsoft Vice President, WW Retail and CG Industry on Tuesday, January 14, 2025 on the Big Ideas stage at NRF 2025 for The future of AI in retail to hear how Microsoft, Lenovo, and Intel are equipping customers and partners with the solutions they need to implement AI at the edge.\n\nEager to learn how you can become Retail Ready?

            "content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nMicrosoft is doubling down on the potential of small language models (SLMs) with the unveiling of rStar-Math, a new reasoning technique that can be applied to small models to boost their performance on math problems \u2014 achieving comparable or better results than OpenAI\u2019s o1-preview model.\n\nWhile still in a research phase \u2014 as outlined in a paper published on pre-review site arXiv.org and credited to eight authors at Microsoft, Peking University and Tsinghua University in China \u2014 the technique was applied to several different smaller open-source models including Microsoft\u2019s own Phi-3 mini, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen-1.5B (a 1.5-billion-parameter model), and Qwen-7B (a 7-billion-parameter model). It showed improved performance on all of them, even exceeding OpenAI\u2019s previously most advanced model at the MATH (word problem solving) third-party benchmark of 12,500 questions covering various branches such as geometry and algebra, and all levels of difficulty.\n\nUltimately, according to a post on Hugging Face, the researchers plan to make their code and data available on Github at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar, though one of the paper\u2019s authors, Li Lyna Zhang, wrote in the comments on the Hugging Face post that the team is \u201cstill undergoing the internal review process for open-source release.\u201d As such, \u201cthe repository remains private for now. Please stay tuned!\u201d\n\nCommunity members expressed enthusiasm, calling the innovations \u201cimpressive\u201d and praising the blend of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with step-by-step reasoning. One commenter highlighted the simplicity and utility of using Q-values for step scoring, while others speculated on future applications in geometric proofs and symbolic reasoning.\n\nThis news follows closely on the heels of the open-sourcing of Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 model, a smaller 14-billion-parameter AI system now available on Hugging Face under the permissive MIT license.\n\nWhile the Phi-4 release has expanded access to high-performance small models, rStar-Math showcases a specialized approach: using smaller AI systems to achieve state-of-the-art results in mathematical reasoning.\n\nrStar-Math works by using several different models and components to help a target small model \u2018self-evolve\u2019\n\nThe key to rStar-Math is that it leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a method that mimics human \u201cdeep thinking\u201d by iteratively refining step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems.\n\nThe researchers used MCTS because it \u201cbreaks down complex math problems into simpler single-step generation tasks, reducing the difficulty\u201d for smaller models.\n\nHowever, they didn\u2019t just apply MCTS as other researchers have done. Instead, in a stroke of brilliance, they also ask the model they trained to always output its \u201cchain-of-thought\u201d reasoning steps as both natural language descriptions and Python code.\n\nThey mandated the model would include the natural language responses as Python code comments, and only those outputs using Python would be used to train the model.\n\nThe researchers also trained a \u201cpolicy model\u201d to generate math reasoning steps and a process preference model (PPM) to select the most promising steps to solving the problems, and improved them both over four rounds of \u201cself-evolution,\u201d with each model improving the other.\n\nFor their starting data, the researchers said they used \u201c747,000 math word problems from publicly available sources,\u201d along with their solutions, but generated new steps for solving them with the two models described above.\n\nRecord-breaking results\n\nAfter four rounds of self-evolution, rStar-Math achieved significant milestones:\n\n\u2022 On the MATH benchmark, the accuracy of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model jumped from 58.8% to 90.0%, outperforming OpenAI o1-preview.\n\n\u2022 On the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), it solved 53.3% of problems, placing among the top 20% of high school competitors.\n\nThese results highlight the power of SLMs in handling complex mathematical reasoning, traditionally dominated by larger systems.\n\nSmaller is better?\n\nIn recent years, AI innovation has largely been driven by scaling up language models, with increasing parameters seen as a way to improve performance. Yet, the high costs associated with these massive models, from computational resources to energy consumption, have raised questions about scalability.\n\nMicrosoft is offering an alternative path, focusing on efficiency. The release of rStar-Math further underscores this commitment by demonstrating how SLMs can rival \u2014 and in some cases exceed \u2014 the capabilities of their larger counterparts.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s dual releases of Phi-4 and the rStar-Math paper suggest that compact, specialized models can provide powerful alternatives to the industry\u2019s largest systems.\n\nMoreover, by outperforming larger competitors in key benchmarks, these models challenge the notion that bigger is always better. They open doors for mid-sized organizations and academic researchers to access cutting-edge capabilities without the financial or environmental burden of massive models.",

            "content": "Apple (AAPL 1.82%) and Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) are two of the biggest rivals in tech. And today, they're both spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) as their rivalry evolves into yet another chapter.\n\nThey are among the most highly valued stocks in the world with market caps in excess of $3 trillion. Apple is ahead today, but which stock ends up more valuable in the next five or 10 years could ultimately depend on which business has the better AI strategy.\n\nIn 2024, Apple's stock rose by 30% as it outperformed Microsoft, which increased by just 12% in value. But which AI stock is likely to be the better buy in 2025 and beyond: Apple or Microsoft?\n\nThe case for Microsoft\n\nThere are 1.6 billion devices running Windows in the world. It's a staggering number of machines and it's the big reason why Microsoft can be a big winner in AI. It has many customers already using its software in the corporate world. If the company can develop Copilot into the next big subscription service, that has the potential to be a massive growth catalyst for the business in the long run.\n\nCopilot is still in its early innings but it has an advantage over ChatGPT and other AI offerings because it is added within products like Word and Excel. Users can easily access the AI right within their daily workflows without going to a separate site or launching a new application. It can help with forecasting sales and profit numbers for accountants in Excel, or creating presentations and ads in PowerPoint. The potential for synergies and efficiencies due to Copilot is why investors shouldn't overlook the massive opportunity this is for Microsoft.\n\nIt may take some time for Microsoft to develop Copilot into what it needs to be for organizations to justify having all their users subscribed to it, but if it happens, it could add billions in revenue for Microsoft and unlock a big growth opportunity for years to come.\n\nThe case for Apple\n\nThere are 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world that the company could offer its AI services. Apple has been slower in rolling out its AI strategy, which is why it may still have more of an untapped opportunity than Microsoft. Apple hasn't wowed users at this stage, nor has it really disappointed them. Many Apple Intelligence features are still set to come in 2025, including new Siri features that will help users find messages and send files and photos more easily.\n\nAs the company offers more AI-powered services on its devices, that could serve as a significant catalyst, propelling more users to upgrade their phones and tablets to ensure they're not missing out on the latest features and capabilities.\n\nPlus, there's the opportunity for Apple to offer AI-related subscription services, which could unlock even more revenue-generating opportunities. Some analysts have estimated that the company could charge as much as $20 per month for advanced AI features. With Apple targeting a more affluent customer base, there may also be less resistance from its users in paying for greater functionality.\n\nWhich stock should AI users invest in?\n\nApple was the better stock to own in 2024 and I think the story will play out the same this year and over the long term. The company is taking a slower, more cautious approach with AI. That can be a better strategy as Apple can better evaluate which features its users want, and which ones it may not want to spend time and money developing.\n\nAnd while Microsoft may have a lot of potential business customers to tap into thanks to the wide reach of Windows, that may involve a bigger hurdle. Companies would need to justify spending $30 a month per user whereas Apple could get a boost from simply convincing users to upgrade their devices.\n\nBoth of these companies could benefit significantly from AI-related revenue, but Apple may have a clearer and easier path to that growth than Microsoft, which is why it looks to be the better AI stock to own today.",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella and his leadership team wanted to bring Microsoft together after asking company employees to work from home in response to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to bring everyone together virtually in a way that would allow our leaders to share their thoughts with employees, but also to address many of the hard questions that we knew employees were asking,\u201d says John Cirone, director of employee communications at Microsoft. \u201cWe wanted to share a moment where we could talk about how we were mobilizing our response to COVID-19 across our employees, customers, and our communities.\u201d\n\nNormally company leaders meet with employees once a month for an Employee Town Hall and Q&A. They typically gather in a caf\u00e9 somewhere on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Washington. Though several hundred employees gather in the room, the meetings are primarily virtual. Microsoft Production Studios uses live events in Microsoft 365 to broadcast the town halls to the company\u2019s 151,000 employees. People attend the event in Yammer, where they can engage and ask leaders the questions that drive the Q&A. After the event, people can catch up with the event recording and search for specific moments in the automatically generated transcript and table of contents in Stream.\n\n\u201cWe use these meetings to have a reoccurring dialogue with our employees that centers around the company\u2019s mission, its aspire-to culture, and its strategy,\u201d Cirone says. \u201cOur employees can watch from anywhere in the world live or on-demand. The CEO and the leadership team share their top-of-mind thoughts, give their insights on recent company news, and answer questions that employees have. We hold these events every month, regardless of key company-news moments, as the goal is to engage in a continuous dialogue\u2014that\u2019s really the key, it\u2019s about ongoing leader and employee engagement in a way that allows our leaders to be personal at scale.\u201d\n\n[Learn more about how leaders across Microsoft are using live events in Microsoft 365 to connect with their teams. Read this case study on how Microsoft uses live events in Microsoft 365.]\n\nTurning to live events in Microsoft 365\n\nWhen it came to the March employee Q&A, stay-at-home-measures meant that company leaders would not be able to gather in one space for the event. And while the live-events platform would allow the CEO to virtually broadcast to employees, additional steps would be needed to support the Senior Leadership Team\u2019s goal of joining virtually for the broadcast.\n\nThat created a challenge that the team needed to overcome.\n\n\u201cOne of the event principles is that both the CEO and his leadership team gather together to talk directly with employees during these events.,\u201d Cirone says. \u201cThey are always there in the room or on-camera, responding together to the questions that come up.\u201d\n\nOnce it became clear how important it was to have the full leadership team come together virtually, the Microsoft Employee Communications and Microsoft Production Studios teams partnered with the Microsoft 365 product group to find a solution.\n\nHow did they solve the remote working challenge?\n\n\u201cWhat we came up with is having them all join a Microsoft Teams meeting and broadcasting that meeting to the entire company as a live event,\u201d says John Schoonover, manager of Facility and Production Solutions at Microsoft Production Studios. \u201cThat way they could talk with each other and answer questions from employees very naturally\u2014they meet on Microsoft Teams all the time. And on the audience side, employees could see them interacting with each other and could ask them questions on Yammer.\u201d\n\nHow did it go?\n\n\u201cThe technology worked great,\u201d says Schoonover, who says his desire to be in control of the show flow was tested. \u201cWe had a few production challenges that we had to work out.\u201d\n\nThose challenges had to do with managing a meeting with 17 participants reporting in from locations that he didn\u2019t control.\n\n\u201cThe cameras, the microphones, the lighting, their bandwidth\u2014everything was in their homes and out of our reach,\u201d Schoonover says. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling any time you don\u2019t have full control over a production. We had some nervousness over having the best possible experience for our participants and for the audience.\u201d\n\nGuidelines were shared. Advice was given. The leadership team was asked to join the meeting a few minutes early, giving Schoonover and his team a chance to quickly review each person\u2019s setup. How did they sound? Was the lighting adequate? Were they the right distance from their camera? Would they please remember to go on and off mute at the right time?\n\n\u201cIt absolutely went smoothly,\u201d Schoonover says. \u201cThere were a couple of times when someone\u2019s bandwidth became an issue and their image froze up\u2014we had a still image of them ready to go and we were able to switch over to it when that occurred.\u201d\n\nThe other major challenge Schoonover\u2019s team faced was managing the event flow\u2014who would speak when and whose face should appear on the Teams interface that the audience was seeing. They were helped greatly by a new feature in Teams (soon to be released publicly) that allows more than four people to be shown on the meeting interface at once.\n\nThey needed the added flexibility because they didn\u2019t know which of the 17 leaders was going to speak next.\n\n\u201cThe Teams meeting was technically in control,\u201d he says. \u201cIt did all the camera switching that we would normally do in a production-room environment\u2014Teams essentially switched to whoever was speaking and whoever had their mic open.\u201d\n\nThat automatic switching was a good thing because it made the conversation feel more natural, Schoonover says. It did, however, make it hard for the team to show alternative views, like going full-screen on someone who was talking.\n\nThe solution for that was to use the pinning feature in Teams\u2014when someone started speaking in-depth on a topic, the production team would pin their camera feed across the whole screen on a different PC and would use their production-room controller to switch to that view while they spoke. When the speaker was wrapping up, the production team would switch back to the main PC showing the CEO and several other leaders listening.\n\n\u201cThat allowed us to switch back and forth between different views like we would during a normal broadcast,\u201d Schoonover says. \u201cIt also allowed Satya to control the flow of the meeting\u2014a moderator would read questions coming in from employees on Yammer, he would give his input, and, when needed, he would call on a leader to provide more detail.\u201d\n\nThe team used a dedicated PC to pin the event\u2019s sign-language interpreter on-screen for the duration of the Q&A, which allowed them to continuously pipe her into the broadcast no matter which view they switched to.\n\n\u201cI was pleased with how smoothly things went and with how authentic it was,\u201d says Schoonover, who called out Teams\u2019 automatic camera switching as a highlight. \u201cIt felt very organic, very natural.\u201d\n\nCirone agreed, adding that another highlight was that employees got to peek into the homes of the company\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cThere was something that was very authentic and real about that,\u201d he says. There was some teasing about the libraries and other backgrounds that the leaders were showing\u2014a few were showing alternative backgrounds, a new feature in Teams.\n\nIt was all about bringing everyone together. \u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling and unifying about how this is happening to all of us, that we\u2018re all going through this together,\u201d Cirone says.\n\nDelivering the Q&A to employees\n\nOnce Schoonover\u2019s team wove the elements of the production together, his team handed it off to the second half of the Microsoft Production Studios, the part of the house responsible for patching the live feed into Yammer. There, employees watched, asked questions, and interacted with each other before, during, and after the event.\n\n\u201cFor us, having this be a remote Microsoft Teams meeting didn\u2019t change anything,\u201d says Jeff Tyler, a digital media experience lead for Microsoft Production Studios. \u201cAt the end of the day, what came out of our production switching room was the same as always\u2014the only difference was where people were presenting from.\u201d\n\nThe team did all of things it normally does, including adding real-time captioning, watching for video lagging, and getting ready to make the session ready for on-demand viewing once the event was complete, says Kristyona Rosin, a webcast and transmission team lead for RUN Studios, the vendor company that supports Microsoft Production Studios.\n\n\u201cWe were very prepared for a larger-than-normal audience,\u201d Rosin says. \u201cWe normally have about 10,000 employees online during a Q&A, and this time we had more than 22,000, which was a record. Another 13,000 employees watched a video-only live stream.\u201d The event recording was then available to watch on-demand for employees who missed the live show\u2014more than 15,000 employees watched on demand.\n\nCirone says employees reacted positively to the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe had more engagement than we\u2019ve ever had on Yammer,\u201d he says. \u201cEmployees asked lots of good questions about the company, about how we\u2019re all working from home, about our role in the crisis, and asking what they could do to help. They were having a lot of interesting and supportive conversations with each other.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Microsoft\u2019s leadership team will continue to use the live events platform to meet and engage with employees for as long as working from home is needed, Cirone says. And Microsoft is continuing to build in new features and experiences to help remote-working employees and customers everywhere connect through live events.\n\nHere are some resources to get started with live events in Microsoft 365 at your company:\n\nHere are additional resources to learn more about how Microsoft uses live events internally:",

What if Microsoft had never been born? What legal tests would have been available to deal with monopolization? How might the current cases against Google, Meta, Apple, and Amazon have been framed if all that the government plaintiffs had to rely on were decisions like Grinnell, Aspen Skiing, and Trinko? On the other hand, might the courts have avoided Microsoft\u2019s act-by-act balancing approach in favor of a more systemic and holistic analysis of monopoly power and conduct? Has Microsoft set the courts down the wrong path\u2014or the right one?\n\n\n\nRebecca Haw ALLENSWORTH | Associate Dean for Research, David Daniels Allen Distinguished Chair of Law, Vanderbilt University Law School\n\nJonathan BAKER | Professor Emeritus, American University Washington College of Law\n\nDaniel FRANCIS | Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law\n\nJohn NEWMAN | Professor, University of Miami School of Law\n\nModerator: Andrew GAVIL | Professor, Howard University School of Law\n\n11:15am \u2013 11:45am\n\nCoffee Break\n\n\n\n11:45am \u2013 1:00pm\n\nPanel 2 \u2013 The Economics of Platforms and Innovation\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s economic infrastructure included a focused analysis of the significance of entry barriers, network effects, switching costs, and cost-raising strategies, all in the context of platform software. Microsoft\u2019s economics set it apart from previous monopolization cases, but the case was decided before economists had fully developed theories to explain how platforms behave and compete, and at a time when the term \u201cecosystem,\u201d borrowed from biology, was just coming into use. In what ways did Microsoft lay the economic groundwork for today\u2019s concerns about digital markets? Have developments in economic theory since Microsoft given us a better understanding of how antitrust law should deal with digital platforms? Have we paid sufficient attention to the link between monopoly power and conduct, and the incentives for innovation?\n\n\n\nMichal GAL | Professor and Director of the Center for Law and Technology, Faculty of Law, University of Haifa with Raz AGRANAT | JSD Candidate, University of Chicago\n\nErik HOVENKAMP | Professor of Law, Cornell Law School\n\nDaniel RUBINFELD |Robert L.

In the end, however, the remedies that were implemented were largely the result of a settlement. Some, including the Justice Department, have argued that the settlement was effective, but many were critical, and the subsequent impact of the decree has been the subject of much debate. What remedial principles and lessons can the government plaintiffs, the defendants, and the courts in the current cases take from the remedy experience in Microsoft? Are the government plaintiffs once again in danger of \u201closing the cause\u201d? Will the constraints on remedies in law enforcement actions lead to greater interest in regulatory solutions in the U.S. for tech platforms, such as those that are being implemented in the EU and UK?\n\n\n\nAlexandre DE STREEL | Academic Director, CERRE; Professor of European Law, University of Namur with Pierre LAROUCHE | Professeur de droit et innovation, University of Montreal Law\n\nWilliam KOVACIC | Global Competition Professor of Law and Policy; Professor of Law; Director, Competition Law Center, George Washington University Law School\n\nRandal PICKER | James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law, The University of Chicago Law School\n\nFiona M.

This arguably failed prediction reminds us of the challenges of directing competition policy and enforcement with an eye toward future developments. Will the current wave of monopolization litigation meet that challenge? To what areas should antitrust enforcers and policymakers pay attention in anticipating future market and technological developments? How should it seek to resolve the already evident need to account for AI, content moderation, and privacy? What other issues might confront an antitrust policy that seeks to promote both competition and innovation?\n\n\n\nErika DOUGLAS | Associate Professor of Law, Temple University Beasley School of Law\n\nEleanor FOX | Walter J.

There are two qualifying periods to enter: the Fall Qualifier and the Spring Qualifier. At the end of each qualifying round, invitations are issued to the students with the top scores in their exam category, for a total of six students from each state possible in each period.\n\nThis means that Valerie (PowerPoint 365), Noah (PowerPoint 2019) and Leilani (Word 365) make up half of the qualifiers from the entire state of Texas for the fall. All three students scored a perfect score on their exam.\n\nThese three students, and their teacher Sarah Zeballos, will travel to Dallas this summer where they will compete in a live event with a chance to earn a national championship, much like their classmate Preston Nnadi did last year.\n\nIt is possible that additional students from Steele could join them after results from the Spring Qualifier period are announced.\n\n",

A payment request was then initiated via PayPal, with the distribution list used as the recipient address.\n\nHow the Attack Works\n\nWhen the request was sent, Microsoft\u2019s Sender Rewrite Scheme (SRS) modified the sender address to bypass email authentication checks, making it appear valid. In addition, the email, URL and sender address passed PayPal\u2019s security checks, deceiving users into believing it was legitimate.\n\nIf the recipient panicked and logged into their PayPal account through the provided link, the scammer gained access to their account.\n\nRead more on email security: Critical Infrastructure at Risk From Email Security Breaches\n\n\u201cStandard phishing methods typically require threat actors to craft and deliver emails to a wide audience,\u201d commented Elad Luz, head of research at Oasis Security.\n\n\u201cIn this case, however, the threat actors exploit a vendor feature to deliver their messages. The emails are sent from a verified source and follow an identical template to legitimate messages, such as a standard PayPal payment request. This makes [it] difficult for mailbox providers to distinguish [them] from genuine communications, leaving PayPal as potentially the only entity capable of mitigating the issue.\u201d\n\nDefending Against Phishing Threats\n\nTo defend against such threats, Fortinet emphasized the importance of a well-trained \u201chuman firewall.\u201d Employees should be educated to scrutinize all unexpected payment requests, even when they appear legitimate.\n\nAdditionally, the company recommended using data loss prevention (DLP) rules to detect such attacks. A DLP rule can be configured to flag emails involving multiple recipients from a distribution list, helping identify and block these phishing attempts.\n\n\u201cUsing neural networks to analyze social graph patterns and other advanced AI techniques in more modern security tools helps spot these hidden interactions by analyzing user behaviors more deeply than static filters,\u201d added Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext.\n\n\u201cThat kind of proactive detection engine recognizes unusual group messaging patterns or requests that slip through basic checks.

Microsoft is promoting Windows 11 as the most secure version of Windows, with new AI capabilities and modern security benefits, as it is the only Windows that will receive all the latest updates by the end of this year.\n\nLast year, the company also introduced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, which they claim are the fastest, most intelligent, and most secure Windows PCs ever built.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft has at least some reason to make this claim.

            "content": "Several years into the era of hybrid work, most of us are used to appearing in a Brady Bunch-style gallery. We select an emoji to ask a question or applaud an achievement and still have to remember \u201cunmute\u201d when it\u2019s our turn to talk.\n\nHalf of workers have gone back to the office, but much of our collaboration with others is still being done in online meetings. Clearly, the hybrid workplace isn\u2019t going anywhere. Many organizations have tried hard to figure out a structure to accommodate their employees from wherever they dial in\u2014whether it is executive boardroom or their back porch. But it\u2019s a big jump from diagnosing the challenges to devising solutions that enable people to connect more deeply in online meetings.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re a hybrid company here at Microsoft. Our colleagues are more distributed and diverse than ever before. This is why we built Microsoft Mesh, a 3D immersive space built into Microsoft Teams. Teammates show up as avatars and interact with one another in real time in the same virtual space.\n\n\n\nIntroducing Microsoft Mesh Microsoft Mesh is a platform that powers shared immersive experiences, connecting people in a more natural way. Here\u2019s how it can help you:\n\nFoster copresence: In a world of flexible work, Mesh enables copresence, allowing people to feel connected even when physically apart.\n\nIn a world of flexible work, Mesh enables copresence, allowing people to feel connected even when physically apart.

Security and familiar devices: Enjoy comprehensive security while using familiar devices.\n\nWe wanted to get immersive spaces right for ourselves here at Microsoft and for thousands of organizations that need flexible hybrid solutions. And in effort to solve complex challenges with nuanced technical solutions, we have had to learn along the way.\n\nOne way we do this is by receiving and incorporating feedback from our own employees before we release products to the public, a concept we call Customer Zero. Immersive spaces benefited greatly from this cycle of refinement.\n\n[Discover what we learned about avatar etiquette. Get the story on our role as the company\u2019s Customer Zero.]\n\nCollaborating beyond the grid\n\n\u201cThe future of distributed collaboration is more than the video grid,\u201d says Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 Collaborative Apps and Platforms, who shared his view in a LinkedIn post announcing the public preview of Mesh.\n\n\u201c(Mesh) is a step forward for us all to learn together,\u201d Teper says.\n\nImmersive spaces allows participants to connect more naturally. You can bond with coworkers as you toss bean bags, sit by the firepit, or gather on couches in a lake house\u2014all within Teams accessible via PC or VR headset.\n\nHybrid work is now the norm, with people from the same team working remote from many different locations. We\u2019re no longer having those authentic moments during or in-between working sessions to socialize and create personal connection at work.\u201d \u2014Alexandre Godin, principal product manager, Microsoft Mesh product team\n\nMixed reality products had been brewing for years with products like HoloLens, but the pandemic massively accelerated this work.\n\n\u201cHybrid work is now the norm, with people from the same team working remote from many different locations,\u201d says Alexandre Godin, a principal product manager who helped build Microsoft Mesh from its inception. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer having those authentic moments during or in-between working sessions to socialize and create personal connection at work.\u201d\n\nThe geo-diversity of our teams has made finding connection on our Teams calls as important as it\u2019s ever been. Immersive spaces fills that void and enables teammates to easily and more naturally interact with each other virtually.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I don\u2019t need to wait for my turn to have a conversation,\u201d Godin says. \u201cYou get to interact in a much more natural way with a sense of physical togetherness in this 3D space.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, it\u2019s really easy to use and is accessible to everyone in Teams. I\u2019m not here and you\u2019re there; we are all here together in virtual reality. \u2014Sara Bush, principal product manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nIt\u2019s creating a new way to communicate.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, it\u2019s really easy to use and is accessible to everyone in Teams,\u201d says Sara Bush, a principal product manager for the team in Microsoft Digital, the company\u2019s IT organization. \u201cI\u2019m not here and you\u2019re there; we are all here together in virtual reality.\u201d\n\nImpressive spatial audio\n\nEveryone who has tried immersive spaces agrees that this virtual world\u2019s coolest feature and biggest brain-bender is spatial audio.\n\n\u201cAs you could in reality, you can move away from the cluster of folks you\u2019re talking to, or the main meeting environment, and the audio will reflect that,\u201d says Bush, an 11-year Microsoft veteran who helped deploy Teams across Microsoft in 2018.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a visual notification on your screen, and you will notice the audio fade out and you can no longer hear those people that you were standing with,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now you can hear this other group that you\u2019ve walked over to. This experience is more akin to being together physically.\u201d\n\nParticipants can also have side conversations and communicate effectively in subgroups without talking over each other.\n\n\u201cSpatial audio is amazing,\u201d Godin says. \u201cIt really does feel like you\u2019re in the room by mimicking real audio behavior, and it helps capture nuances and non-verbal cues that don\u2019t always come through in standard online meetings but are so important for the group dynamic.\u201d\n\nFlexible, inclusive, effective\n\nWork in the hybrid era is about flexibility and accommodation for productivity.\n\n\u201cWe each have our own work style,\u201d Bush says. \u201cSometimes you want to come into the office to collaborate and to have face-to-face engagement. Sometimes you want to focus in a way that you can\u2019t in the office but can at home. This gives us the best of both worlds.\u201d\n\nIt also allows for different types of meetings for different kinds of people, boosting communication and coordination. For example, an introvert who thrives on one-on-one conversations can find a cozy nook, have a side conversation, then rejoin the group. It also helps capture nuances that might not come through in a video call only.\n\n\u201cIt really makes a huge difference in how people interact and participate in a session,\u201d Godin says. \u201cIt helps them connect with co-workers in a more natural and deeper way that resembles what would happen if everyone was physically together.\u201d\n\nImmersive spaces lets people show up the way they want, which makes them feel included, engaged, and connected. It works regardless of each participants\u2019 location, title, and learning type, making for a more equitable and inclusive working environment.\n\nIt\u2019s a technological solution to physical space realities and limitations. \u2014Sara Bush, principal product manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nImmersive spaces can be used to encourage and enhance social interactions during employee orientations, training, professional development, and networking events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a technological solution to physical space realities and limitations,\u201d Bush says.\n\nInternal feedback shapes product design\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s robust program for internal testing, known as Customer Zero, has played an essential role in helping to shape immersive spaces. Employee testing and feedback helped refine and improve the product before it was released to the public.\n\nIn fact, feedback from our colleagues testing and using pre-release features or products is fundamental to the company\u2019s mission and momentum. Microsoft employees can try out, pressure test, and identify bugs in the software while it\u2019s still in beta, raising early flags about a product\u2019s user experience. Each group that evaluated immersive spaces passed along critical feedback and information about their experiences.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re looking at things from the customer\u2019s point of view, which is why we have a great system where our internal early adopters can test and evaluate products and report any issues,\u201d says Rachel Castillote, a senior product manager leading the Teams Early Experience service in Microsoft Digital. \u201cThis critical feedback is necessary to ensure these experiences are diverse and inclusive across many different learning types, geographies, and user journeys. That turns into diverse experiences and products that are going to delight our customers.\u201d\n\nThe Customer Zero framework was particularly helpful when developing immersive spaces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new experience, so it was really cool to witness our internal early adopters evaluating and validating it for the first time,\u201d Castillote says. \u201cIt was great to be able to see people in avatar form in this virtual environment that mimics many of the aspects of real life and just exploring the space, moving around in the space. We got to experience the awe, the wow factor of the participants, which was very validating.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more casual. More intimate. And that opens us up to more collaboration and connection. \u2014Laura Oxford, senior content program manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nOne beta tester of immersive spaces was skeptical at first.\n\n\u201cOf course, it was a little unusual at first, because you\u2019re in a meeting room with people, but we\u2019re not actually in a meeting room,\u201d says Laura Oxford, a senior content program manager in Microsoft Digital. \u201cBut it really did feel like we were in a space together.\u201d\n\nThe fact that it was done without virtual reality headsets or equipment is a big plus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all just on Teams on the computer, yet it gives you that sense of social connection,\u201d Oxford says. \u201cIt\u2019s more casual. More intimate. And that opens us up to more collaboration and connection, and that engagement enhances any kind of remote or hybrid team experience.\u201d\n\nWe are continuously gathering details and feedback that help us validate our products. Our products go through an agile and iterative process, so we\u2019re constantly iterating based on the feedback that we get from our participants. \u2014Rachel Castillote, senior product manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nNext steps for next-level engagement\n\nThe immersive spaces team has applied lessons learned from all the mixed-reality products that came before it.\n\n\u201cFeeling co-present is key. Being in the same place and having shared experiences, whether it\u2019s fun or work focused, or both, is really important,\u201d Godin says. \u201cThere is a ton of value in asynchronous communication or video calls, but sometimes you really need to get together in a room to create that deeper engagement and connection that will make a difference for the team to achieve their goals together.\u201d\n\nMesh immersive spaces really offers something kind of magical and special as we\u2019re all feeling we\u2019re there together. \u2014Alexandre Godin, principal product manager, Microsoft Mesh product team\n\nContinuing the virtuous circle of feedback from early adopters won\u2019t stop anytime soon, according to Castillote.\n\n\u201cWe are continuously gathering details and feedback that help us validate our products,\u201d Castillote says. \u201cOur products go through an agile and iterative process, so we\u2019re constantly iterating based on the feedback that we get from our participants.\u201d\n\n\u2018Magical and special\u2019\n\nMost early participants in immersive spaces say there\u2019s an ineffable quality that has to be experienced, particularly the spatial audio component.\n\nCastillote is excited about the possibilities still to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole other realm that we\u2019re headed to, and a whole new option for how you want to show up in the hybrid workplace,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want to show up in person? Do you want to show up in avatar form? Do you want to show up in avatar form in the immersive space? Like, where are we having our meeting today?\u201d\n\nAnd oh yeah, it\u2019s good for networking as well.\n\n\u201cI know from experience building that social connection from teams takes a lot of work, even when everybody\u2019s in the office together,\u201d Oxford says. \u201cSocial connections are important for having more effective meetings and relationships.\n\nHer advice?\n\n\u201cBe open to it,\u201d Oxford says. \u201cHave fun with it\u2014that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s for.\u201d\n\nIn other words, meet you by the firepit to roast marshmallows.\n\nTo get started with immersive spaces in Microsoft Teams, follow these steps:\n\nFind the version for you\n\nEnsure you have the right licensing for immersive spaces. Supported paths include:\n\nSmaller Businesses: Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium.\n\nLarger Enterprises: Microsoft 365 E3/E5 and Office 365 E1/E3/E5.\n\nYour computer has a 4 core CPU and at least 8 GB RAM.\n\nYour admin has enabled Mesh in the Teams admin center.\n\nAccess immersive spaces\n\nSign in to Teams on your desktop.\n\nGo to your Calendar on the left side of Teams.\n\nLocate the meeting you want to join and select Join .\n\n. From the meeting menu at the top, choose View > Immersive space (3D).\n\nMicrosoft Mesh will begin loading, and you\u2019ll enter the immersive space pre-join screen.\n\nExplore and socialize\n\nWithin the three-dimensional environment, you can:\n\nSocialize and connect: Have multiple simultaneous conversations and communicate effectively in subgroups without talking over each other.\n\nCollaborate: Even if some participants join from outside the immersive space, they can see, hear, and interact with others within it.\n\nScreen sharing: If anyone shares their screen, the content is visible to all meeting attendees.\n\nCustomize your avatar\n\nSelect + or the pencil icon to create or customize your avatar.\n\nAdjust audio settings: Fine-tune your audio device from the pre-join screen.\n\nImmersive spaces work well for various types of meetings, including:\n\nWeekly scrums or standups with your team.\n\nBrainstorming sessions with multiple breakout groups.\n\nThis feature is currently available on the Microsoft Teams desktop app for Windows and on Mac up to R3.

Their first suggestion was to remove the user from all Teams and re-add them. After doing this, I also added the user to a test team. The user was able to receive notifications from the test team channel, but not able to receive notifications from our main communications channel. Both the test channel and main channel have the same notification settings. Interestingly, the user was able to receive notifications from a different channel contained in the same Team as the main channel.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMicrosoft expects to spend roughly $80 billion on AI-enabled data centers to train large language models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications during its current fiscal year, the company\u2019s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a Friday blog post.\n\nMore than half of the investments will be in the U.S., according to Smith. The tech giant\u2019s current fiscal year 2025 runs through June 30.\n\nAI workloads triggered cloud capacity constraints last year, ratcheting up an ongoing data center building boom. Microsoft responded by nearly doubling capital investments to $20 billion in the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, CFO Amy Hood said during an October earnings call. \u201cWe expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand signals,\u201d she added.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCloud infrastructure, AI compute capacity and domestic politics coalesced in Smith\u2019s post, which laid out a three-pronged plan for U.S. economic success centered around data centers, upskilling and technology exports.\n\n\u201cThe incoming administration can strengthen these foundational elements, building on the work from President Trump\u2019s first term,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the 2019 American AI Initiative. \u201cPresident Trump and Congress should expand on these efforts to support advancing America\u2019s AI leadership.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has been growing its Azure public cloud empire at home and abroad.\n\nIn addition to breaking ground on a $3.3 billion Wisconsin facility last year, Microsoft launched its first data center region in Mexico and further expanded its cloud footprint in France, Germany and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe intend to invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build trusted and secure AI and cloud data center infrastructure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is part of a global infrastructure that now reaches 40 countries.\u201d\n\nIn September, the company partnered with investment firms Blackrock, MGX and Global Infrastructure Partners to amass $100 billion for data centers and supporting power infrastructure.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Generative AI - Where Are We Now?, from the editorial team at CIO Dive.

            "content": "For any large enterprise like Microsoft, monitoring threats to infrastructure and applications developing and maintaining an always-on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution like Microsoft Sentinel that\u2019s equipped to ward off threats isn\u2019t only a weighty task but also a truly challenging undertaking.\n\nThe threat landscape is constantly evolving, and data breaches\u2014originating from outside or within organizations\u2014are commonplace. Organizations now acknowledge that securing their digital perimeter is an insufficient and inherently reactive approach. That\u2019s because modern security solutions, to be robust, must protect the entire enterprise environment, including core business processes, the sensitive data that those processes might expose, and the systems that support those processes. This recognition prompted Microsoft to seek a more complete, continuous, and dynamic solution to better protect its SAP assets\u2014Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM platform that uses built-in AI to quickly help analyze large volumes of data across an enterprise. Microsoft\u2019s SAP assets include applications that support Microsoft\u2019s core business processes and combined, comprise an impressive 24 terabytes (TB) of data.\n\nMicrosoft had a two-fold rationale for developing its new Microsoft Sentinel SAP SIEM solution: to better detect suspicious activity and to fully document security incidents and how the organization resolves them. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems like SAP are facing increasing cybersecurity threats, across the industry spectrum, from healthcare and manufacturing, to finance, retail, and e-commerce. Threat actors, recognizing such systems\u2019 vulnerabilities, have identified ERP systems as a prime target. SAP vulnerability is a critical concern for enterprise executives and senior security professionals, given that the average cost of an SAP breach is $5 million per attack. That cost doesn\u2019t figure in the reputational damage a breach or attack might confer, which is often substantial and prolonged.\n\n[Using Microsoft Azure AD MFA at Microsoft to enhance remote security. Moving to next-generation SIEM with Microsoft Sentinel. Using shielded virtual machines to help protect high-value assets.]\n\nIdentifying threats\u2014and a solution\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel and Microsoft\u2019s SAP Security teams defined a roadmap to address current challenges and chart a path to using the preventive and detective capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Azure. Additionally, the collaborative efforts of SAP and Microsoft Azure increase end-to-end visibility across enterprise systems and applications and help bolster system resilience. Although Microsoft has tools in place to detect and log threats across its SAP landscape, the challenge was managing the number of tools, the data sources, and the effort required to analyze and help remediate a threat.\n\nConsidering that any breach in Microsoft SAP applications could have catastrophic consequences for us, we knew that we needed a solution that enabled rapid vulnerability detection and monitoring capabilities to reduce risks to the organization. We needed an internally managed and configured SIEM solution that could baseline user behaviors and detect anomalies across SAP to include the OS and network layer, the database layer, and the application and business logic layers. \u2014Kusuma Sri Veeranki, senior software engineer and SAP security lead, Microsoft Digital\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft also wanted to implement a centralized SIEM solution that detects and helps prevent threats. The SIEM tools in use were effective, but the monitoring structure was inherently reactive because it didn\u2019t allow for real-time monitoring. When a potential threat or an active security incident was identified, an alert was generated. However, the time to assess and remediate threats was variable, and response lags were common. Further, the process for addressing some vulnerabilities involved patching, for example, so any exposure remained viable until patches were applied across the system. Finally, there wasn\u2019t an easy way to follow an SAP security alert through the system to determine the remedial actions taken within Microsoft and by whom.\n\nMicrosoft also recognized that the existing SAP SIEM solution didn\u2019t always meet its stringent compliance requirements and didn\u2019t permit sufficient visibility into the entire threat environment. And from an enterprise-wide perspective, Microsoft was essentially operating separate corporate and SAP security solutions, an outdated model that the company sought to replace. The new monitoring solution, when operational, would include a separate Sentinel instance for SAP but would also fully integrate with the Microsoft corporate Security Operations Center (SOC).\n\nWe\u2019re excited to be able to use the capabilities that Sentinel provides our customers out of the box along with SAP specific capabilities on an initiative as important as Microsoft SAP security. This represents a new approach in SIEM solutions. \u2014Yoav Daniely, principal group product manager, Microsoft Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management\n\n\u201cConsidering that any breach in Microsoft SAP applications could have catastrophic consequences for us, we knew that we needed a solution that enabled rapid vulnerability detection and monitoring capabilities to reduce risks to the organization,\u201d says Kusuma Sri Veeranki, a senior software engineer and SAP security lead for Microsoft Digital, the organization that powers, protects, and transforms the company. \u201cWe needed an internally managed and configured SIEM solution that could baseline user behaviors and detect anomalies across SAP to include the OS and network layer, the database layer, and the application and business logic layers.\u201d\n\nThe ideal solution, Veeranki says, would also permit visibility into all other systems, products, and applications that interconnect with SAP.\n\nSAP as Microsoft Sentinel \u2019customer zero\u2019\n\nTo develop its new SIEM solution for SAP, the organization decided to use Microsoft Sentinel, a relatively new product, in conjunction with Microsoft\u2019s existing security, orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform. Developed initially for Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinel is designed to collect data and monitor suspicious activities at cloud scale by using sophisticated analytics and threat intelligence. Recently cited in a Forrester Consulting study as an efficient, highly scalable, and flexible SIEM solution that incorporates Azure Log Analytics, Sentinel is also the first cloud-native product in the market.\n\nOur objective is to deliver a configurable solution that has the ability to monitor end-to-end processes and take the appropriate action as defined within the system, including those that should be stopped. Many of the current products on the market are SAP-centric but are limited in their integration capabilities. So, we\u2019re customer zero for leveraging Microsoft Sentinel for SAP security and for enabling that cross-correlation capability. \u2014Aaron Hillard, principal software engineering manager and SAP security lead, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be able to use the capabilities that Sentinel provides our customers out of the box along with SAP specific capabilities on an initiative as important as Microsoft SAP security,\u201d says Yoav Daniely, principal group product manager on the Microsoft Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management (SCIM) team. \u201cThis represents a new approach in SIEM solutions.\u201d\n\nTo configure Microsoft Sentinel to monitor the entire Microsoft SAP environment\u2014it includes 15 SAP production systems including six Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) systems\u2014the engineering team and the Microsoft Azure product group recognized that the solution also needed to provide cross-correlation coverage. Cross correlation is the ability to surveil the entire organization to include junctures where SAP integrates with other systems and applications such as Microsoft Dynamics 365. For example, Sentinel could detect a hypothetical scenario in which a user who creates a new payee in Dynamics but also \u201cpays\u201d that customer in SAP without the activity being detected.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to deliver a configurable solution that has the ability to monitor end-to-end processes and take the appropriate action as defined within the system, including those that should be stopped,\u201d says Aaron Hillard, principal software engineering manager and SAP security lead in Microsoft Digital. \u201cMany of the current products on the market are SAP-centric but are limited in their integration capabilities. So, we\u2019re customer zero for leveraging Microsoft Sentinel for SAP security and for enabling that cross-correlation capability.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the goal is to equip Microsoft Sentinel to assess and respond dynamically to all security threats across all enterprise hosts, platforms, applications, and business processes, and then provide automated remediation as feasible and appropriate. The risk scenarios that Microsoft Sentinel addresses will continue to expand as the product evolves.\n\n\u201cSentinel gives us the ability to monitor the data and activities holistically, because Microsoft, like many other enterprises, uses numerous systems throughout the operations environment,\u201d Veeranki says. \u201cThat\u2019s a key differentiator of Sentinel compared to SIEM systems that are designed purely for SAP.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel incorporates advanced machine learning and AI capabilities that identify suspicious patterns and activities that previously defied detection. Additionally, it is able to readily integrate numerous platforms and products that enterprise companies use and enable organizations to customize configuration to meet their security-monitoring needs.\n\nManaging massive inputs efficiently with an innovative data connector\n\nTo date, the Microsoft SAP and Microsoft Sentinel SAP threat monitoring engineering teams identified an initial 27 initial high-risk scenarios that encompass a broad range of use cases. These use cases involve changes in system, client, or audit-log configuration, and suspicious or unauthorized user logins, data access, or role assignments. Monitoring also covers account-modification or password-change activities, and any audit-log manipulation or brute-force attack, among others. Other risk scenarios are being identified with respect to highly sensitive business and financial threats, and the teams are developing and completing proofs of concept for those scenarios. The SAP and Sentinel teams will continue to expand the threat-detection capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel and the risk scenarios that it addresses the product evolves.\n\nThe Microsoft SAP footprint is massive and change management within the platforms is highly complex. Therefore, to prevent system overload because of memory requirements, the engineering team must deploy a robust yet nimble mechanism to accommodate the vast amount of data coming into Microsoft Sentinel. To that end, the engineering team developed a Microsoft Sentinel-specific data connector that manages SAP inputs in a manner that\u2019s specific to the underlying applications. The connector facilitates a complete security solution to visualize, alert, and respond to threats, and it\u2019s easily configurable through built-in watchlists that match specific environment needs.\n\nThe data connector extracts data for monitoring, stores it, and then moves it through Sentinel in an incremental manner that the system can \u201cunderstand,\u201d says Anirudh Dahuja, an SAP platform engineer in Microsoft Digital. \u201cOtherwise, there\u2019s a risk of overloading the system, an issue that we\u2019ve encountered,\u201d he says.\n\nTo accomplish efficient use of the new tool, the engineering team used indexing to accommodate unwieldy tables and expedite querying. The team also incorporated secrets connectivity by using the Microsoft Azure Key Vault, which provides a secure store to create, store, and maintain keys that access and encrypt cloud resources, apps, and solutions. To manage the requisite memory optimization, the team leveraged Docker containers to accommodate the data connector functions before moving data into Microsoft Sentinel using custom Microsoft Azure APIs.\n\nThere\u2019s another challenge that Microsoft Sentinel engineers are experiencing and working to remedy: how to reduce the \u201cnoise\u201d in the monitoring system to differentiate between authorized, permissible activities and real threats that warrant action. Because Sentinel is designed to detect a very broad range of potentially suspicious or intentionally malicious activities, the number of alerts it raised initially produced many false positives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re working on now\u2014improving alert fidelity and fine-tuning the system to produce fewer false positives,\u201d Veeranki says.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest advantage of using Sentinel for SAP monitoring\u2014the analytics. There are a lot of other tools in the market that alert you to SAP threats, but that\u2019s where they stop. Microsoft Sentinel offers a scalable cross-platform solution to detect and mitigate threats in near real time. We\u2019re not only detecting threats but also quickly responding to and remediating them. \u2014Anirudh Dahuja, SAP platform engineer, Microsoft Digital\n\nShe adds that Microsoft will continue to share the challenges and remedies that teams discover as the Microsoft Sentinel implementation proceeds. Customers then can accelerate their own implementations by using these learnings.\n\nTallying early Sentinel benefits and moving forward\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel allows for comprehensive cross correlation across enterprise resources, in addition to SAP, thereby helping identify known and previously difficult-to-detect security threats in near real time. That\u2019s a capability high on the wish list for many of Microsoft\u2019s existing enterprise customers. Interestingly, two other critical Sentinel benefits are emerging. Despite the initiative\u2019s early development stage\u2014it\u2019s been less than a year since its inception\u2014Microsoft Sentinel has proved highly scalable and customizable from the outset. It also promises to engender efficiencies generally for Microsoft security operations, by providing a single SIEM system and \u201cpane of glass\u201d through which to continuously view security logs, alerts, and incidents across the enterprise.\n\nFurther benefits, still in development, are the advanced analytics being integrated to help detect anomalies in activities involving SAP systems and the automated remediation that Microsoft Sentinel will eventually provide. That\u2019s a winning combination, in Dahuja\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest advantage of using Sentinel for SAP monitoring\u2014the analytics. There are a lot of other tools in the market that alert you to SAP threats, but that\u2019s where they stop. Microsoft Sentinel offers a scalable cross-platform solution to detect and mitigate threats in near real time,\u201d Dahuja says. \u201cWe\u2019re not only detecting threats but also quickly responding to and remediating them.\u201d",

He said advances by these firms would not have been possible \u201cwithout new partnerships founded on large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s president Brad Smith revealed the news in a blog post on Friday, in which he also called for the US government and tech businesses to take steps to ensure American AI technology is adopted around the world rather than alternatives supplied by China.\n\nMicrosoft says it plans to spend $80 billion on building AI data centers in the 2025 financial year, a significant increase on last year.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build-out AI-enabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world. More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.\u201d\n\nThe $80 billion would reflect a significant increase on the $53 billion capex spend Microsoft made in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s data center build-out in the US and beyond has already been extensive. Documents leaked last April revealed it had more than 5GW of capacity at its disposal, with plans to add an additional 1.5GW in the first half of 2025. It is possible this has since been revised upwards as it looks to provide compute power to OpenAI to run ChatGPT and its other AI services, as well as supporting its own Azure public cloud platform.\n\nDespite this, it has been reported that OpenAI is looking to work with other data center providers because Microsoft is unable to keep up with its demands.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft are said to have been working on plans for a massive 5GW data center known as Stargate, that could open by 2028.\n\nUS must be smart to win the AI race with China\n\nSmith also used the blog post to call for the US to take steps to ensure American AI technology is adopted in markets around the world.\n\nThe US and China have been engaged in a tech trade war across the last two presidencies, with America restricting Chinese access to key components made by home-grown companies such as Nvidia.\n\nThis has led China to start developing its own alternatives, which Smith believes could be adopted in emerging markets around the world.\n\nHe used the example of telecoms infrastructure, where Chinese company Huawei has successfully embedded itself as a key digital infrastructure vendor in many regions.

            "content": "Let me use this introductory paragraph to make two horrible confessions. The first: I am one of perhaps several people worldwide who use Microsoft Edge as my default personal browser. Second: My use of Edge means I sometimes accidentally use Bing, Microsoft's Google-but-worse, whenever I search for something in the URL bar. I could go into the settings and switch my default search engine, but no, I prefer to feel the hot sting of shame whenever I search for something and get precisely not what I'm looking for. Also it gets me Microsoft points or something.\n\nMost people aren't me, though, and quite sensibly use browsers that surpass 'basically fine' and search engines that do better than 'worthless', which is presumably why Microsoft seems to be trying to trick Bing users into thinking they're actually on Google. As spotted by Windows Latest, if you open up a Bing tab right now and use it to search 'Google', the search engine will return a big honking box that looks suspiciously like Google on top of the regular search results. Here's an example to save you the psychic damage of using Bing yourself.\n\nYes, I'm writing this on a Mac. My crimes are immane and without number. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nWhich seems downright egregious if you ask me. OK, sure, it could be worse: Microsoft could have wiped out the normal search results entirely, or worked some algorithm magic to make full-fat Google something other than the top search result, but it's still pretty bad. Not only does the page bear a striking resemblance to everyone's default search engine (featuring some kind of doodle), but Bing actually subtly scrolls you down when it loads the page to obscure the big ol' Microsoft Bing banner at the top.\n\nIt probably wouldn't fool you or me, but I'd bet a billion it'd hoodwink your less tech-literate family members and friends. You know, the kind of people who might find themselves doing a Bing search for 'Google'. It's frankly pretty gross, and seems like a tacit admission that, yeah, no one wants to use Bing, so the best it can do is dress itself up as the thing people actually want instead. It's like if Pepsi started distributing itself in red cans.\n\nPlus, I mean, imagine being bad enough that disguising yourself as Google is a step-up? It might be the default search engine for most of us, but in an era of AI garbage and SEO-massaged slop pumped out into disposable website after disposable website, even the king of search is looking pretty sickly these days.

Now it\u2019s all about seeing what we can do with it.\u201d\n\nAligning IT infrastructure innovation with the rest of the organization\n\nThe strategy for AI transformation in core IT infrastructure is one part of a larger vision for the impact of AI across all of Microsoft Digital.\n\n\u201cThe potential for transformation through AI is nearly limitless,\u201d says Natalie D\u2019Hers, corporate vice president of Microsoft Digital. \u201cWe\u2019re evaluating every service in our portfolio to consider how AI can improve outcomes, lower costs, and create a sustained competitive advantage for Microsoft and for our customers.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re hyper-focused on our employee experience, and AI will be instrumental in shaping the future of how Microsoft employees interact with customers, the organization, and each other.\n\nTransforming and securing our network and infrastructure\n\nAI holds enormous potential across all of Microsoft Digital, but within IT infrastructure, the benefits of AI-enabled transformation play out across several specific pillars where we\u2019re focusing our efforts: Device management, network infrastructure, tenant management, security, and the IT support experience.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe can\u2019t transform without adequate security. Properly implemented security controls and governance provide the secure foundation on which our engineering teams build solutions, and that security is especially relevant as we incorporate AI into our services and solutions.\n\nSecuring our network and endpoints is imperative, and our Zero Trust Networking efforts across our IT infrastructure provide essential protection against threats to our network security. AI will enhance the security and compliance of these efforts in our cloud and on-premises environments.\n\nAI-based network assignment for devices will simplify network classification and provide more robust risk-based isolation to isolate risky devices and reduce unwanted movement across the network.\n\nWe\u2019re automating access controls for our wired and wireless networks to improve security effectiveness. AI-infused processes for analyzing device vulnerabilities, detecting anomalous firewall traffic flow, and diagnosing other network incidents will play a critical role in our continued shift toward the internet as our primary network transport.\n\nWe anticipate that AI-supplemented capability in Microsoft 365\u2019s multi-tenant organization feature will help us meet our ever-changing network segmentation needs by maintaining tenant separation and enabling secure tenant cross-collaboration when required.\n\nAI will help us manage third-party app access and revolutionize how we understand user interactions with applications across managed devices or SaaS platforms. We\u2019ll increase access efficiency and reduce costs by capturing third-party app usage and needs more accurately, using AI to determine the how, why, and when of user access.\n\nIntelligent infrastructure\n\nMark Sherwood (left to right), Pete Apple, Senthil Selvaraj, and Phil Suver were part of the team incorporating AI into Microsoft Digital\u2019s vision for core IT.\n\nSoftware-defined networking and infrastructure code are already transforming how we approach networking, but AI amplifies the benefits radically.\n\nAI enables us to build data-driven intelligence into network infrastructure, engineering, and operations. AI-driven processes will help us eliminate configuration drift, comply with security policies, reduce operator errors, and efficiently respond to rapidly changing business needs.\n\nWe\u2019re implementing AI-driven automation to simplify resource management and deployment, capitalizing on the flexibility provided by software-defined networking and infrastructure as code.\n\nAI will assist with generating code designs, defining and managing network configurations, managing deployments, conducting pre- and post-deployment verifications, and assisting with change management over time. Near real-time streaming telemetry from network devices will form the foundation to guide operation and continuous improvement.\n\nWe\u2019re improving network self-healing capabilities by using AI to detect and remediate network issues, creating a more reliable, resilient, and elastic network environment and reducing human intervention and potential for error.\n\nOne of our current projects is creating an AI-based assistant app for our direct engineering teams that mines and analyzes our current network infrastructure catalog, providing an advanced set of capabilities that supplement our engineers\u2019 expertise in the field. The assistant app improves productivity and mitigation time for network infrastructure incidents. The AI component is trained on more than 200,000 prior incidents for anomaly detection and predictive analytics. We\u2019re confident it will lead to a considerable reduction in network outages and maintenance costs.\n\nDevice management\n\nWith more than 1 million interconnected devices, AI-powered capabilities will significantly benefit our device management practices with a focus on user and administrator workflows.\n\nWe\u2019re implementing intelligent device recommendations to ensure our employees have the best tools to do their work. Building AI into a centralized device lifecycle management tool will create efficiencies in procurement, tracking, and responsible device recycling.\n\nWe\u2019re designing AI-powered predictive maintenance and intelligent troubleshooting to reduce device-related issues significantly. AI-enabled device maintenance schedules and tasks will automate the device management process and reduce the load on our IT help desk by correcting device issues before they become user problems, reducing device-related helpdesk incidents.\n\nAcross our vast scope of device management, many alerts and tickets contain information or fixes that our helpdesk engineers can use in other situations. We\u2019re employing AI to generate device insights by analyzing a massive set of signals, including device configurations, network traffic, vulnerabilities, and user behavior. These insights will power more informed decisions across the device management portfolio, including device replacement, software updates, and capacity increases.\n\nWe have more than 100,000 IoT devices on our corporate network. AI-automated IoT device registration will create more robust and efficient IoT device management, tracking, and security.\n\nAI and machine learning will help us to perform aggregated meetings and call data for device monitoring across personal devices, Microsoft Teams meeting rooms, networks, IoT devices, and Microsoft 365, improving and safeguarding the user experience.\n\nTenant management\n\nOur cloud tenants in Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and the Power Platform are among those platforms\u2019 largest and most complex implementations. Our internal implementation includes more than 205,000 Microsoft Teams, 534,000 SharePoint sites, 430,00 Microsoft Exchange mailboxes, 93,00 Power Apps, 5,000 Viva Engage communities, and a massive 25,000 Microsoft Azure subscriptions.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to manage, and AI will improve how we do it.\n\nIn tenants of our size, unmanaged assets can lead to unnecessary costs. Our asset compliance and lifecycle management processes will include an AI-powered compliance assistant that informs tenant users and owners, recommends assets for deletion, and proactively identifies areas of high risk for the tenant. Through the assistant, tenant admins gain an all-up view of compliance status and can investigate and resolve issues more granularly.\n\nAI is also simplifying and streamlining our license management processes. We adhere to precise rules and regulations, which result in complex access scenarios across different countries and regions. AI will bolster our ability to detect and remediate non-compliant tenants amidst this complexity.\n\nIT support\n\nWe\u2019re poised to transform how Microsoft employees interact with our support services using generative AI.\n\nOur employees interact with Microsoft support services in a complex, global hybrid environment. Our self-help solution using Microsoft Azure OpenAI will enable contextual and human-like conversation and support in the employee\u2019s local language. Our chat and incident summarization tools will use AI to summarize incidents and provide context when assisted support is necessary.\n\nWe\u2019re infusing our support ticketing systems with AI capability for forecasting support requirements and proactively checking the health of devices to reduce issues and improve resource planning and response times.\n\nTransforming our IT infrastructure as Customer Zero\n\nAs Customer Zero for Microsoft, we pilot and deploy new products and capabilities in our IT infrastructure before releasing them externally. Our scale, size, and knowledge of our products and services enable us to envision connected experiences across large enterprises, manage complex combinations of product use cases, and engineer solutions on top of our product platforms.\n\nAI improves our role as Customer Zero by accelerating insights and improving time-to-value. We\u2019re using AI capabilities to capture, review, analyze, and report on the most important and actionable insights from the Customer Zero experience. We\u2019re also using AI to redevelop processes, regulatory compliance, security reviews, and deployment practices within the Customer Zero environment.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to envision a future for corporate IT infrastructure without AI. Our active planning for AI in our infrastructure is continually evolving, and we\u2019ve only just begun our implementation. We\u2019re positioning Microsoft to be a catalyst for innovation, and we\u2019re committed to innovating with AI to streamline our IT operations.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to infuse AI into every dimension of our enterprise portfolio,\u201d Sherwood says. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to identify new opportunities for building AI-powered applications and services that improve how we deliver IT services to the company.\u201d\n\nBy showcasing our progress with AI capabilities, we aim to transform our approach to AI internally here at Microsoft and to fuel a similar transformation across the IT sector.",

Can you explain what is happening? My email address is an old Verizon.net address. Will my email and Outlook continue to work indefinitely? Will I be able to get a new version of Office with Outlook with a new computer? I would hate to lose it.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, this issue hits close to home for me as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft announced the end of support for Office 2019, which includes Outlook 2019. This simply means it will no longer issue any software updates or security fixes for this version, and will not guarantee it will continue to work properly with Microsoft\u2019s mail server software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, here\u2019s what Microsoft says: \u201cUsing versions of Office that are no longer supported, or using Office on unsupported operating systems, might cause performance and reliability issues over time.

Nothing in the computer world will work indefinitely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, you might have loved Windows 95, but eventually you needed to move on.\n\nYou might find an old Windows 95 computer in your attic, and it may still boot up, but I\u2019m not sure how much of the software on it would still work.\n\nOutlook 2019 will not work indefinitely. You might keep your current computer running it, but eventually it will not be compatible with the mail servers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour mail provider may require your version of Outlook to have a certain level of security certificate, and out of date products don\u2019t get those updates from Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can continue to use Outlook 2019 past the end of support date, which is currently set for Oct. 14.\n\nAfter that day you won\u2019t notice much difference \u2014 maybe not even for a long time. There may be pop-ups that will nag you to update.\n\nAs long as your computer\u2019s operating system is compatible, the software will launch. If your computer ever dies, and you replace it with whatever the operating system is at the time, don\u2019t count on being able to obtain or use older versions of your apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all need to plan for what\u2019s next \u2014 even if we like what we have now.\n\nJim Rossman is a tech columnist for Tribune News Service.

Otherwise, users expose themselves to considerable security risks and make themselves vulnerable to dangerous cyber attacks and data loss.\"\n\nOn October 14, 2025, Windows 10 will no longer receive free security updates for the operating system unless owners purchase extended security updates. This means that Windows 10 users will be at risk of any new vulnerabilities that are discovered, which could lead to significant breaches and malware distribution.\n\nAccording to ESET, approximately 32 million computers in Germany run Windows 10, making it around 65 percent of all devices in households. In contrast, Windows 11 runs on only 33% of German devices, which is approximately 16.5 million devices.\n\nStatCounter backs up these figures, and as of December 2024, almost 63% of all Windows users worldwide are using Windows 10, compared to about 34% who are using Windows 11.\n\nWindows operating system usage worldwide\n\nSource: StatCounter\n\nThe Steam Hardware & Software Survey paints a better picture for Windows 11 gamers, with 54.96% utilizing Windows 11 and only 42.39% using Windows 10 as of the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, gamers tend to be on the cutting edge of hardware, commonly upgrading their components and devices to play the latest games with good performance.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses and other consumers tend to lag behind as their older computers still run well, and there has not been a real need to upgrade yet.\n\nThis Windows version transition is worse than when users migrated from Windows 7, as almost 70% of users were using Windows 10 before Windows 7 reached the end of support.\n\n\"The situation is more dangerous than when support for Windows 7 ended in early 2020,\" explains Urbanski.\n\n\"Even before the official date, at the end of 2019, only around 20 percent of users were still using Windows 7. Over 70 percent were already using the new Windows 10. The current situation is extremely dangerous. Cyber \u200b\u200bcriminals know these numbers very well and are just waiting for the day when support ends.\"\n\nMany Windows 10 users have been hesitant to upgrade to Windows 11 due to popular features being missing in the newer operating system, performance issues, and the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) hardware requirement, which is preventing some older devices from upgrading.\n\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that many of these older devices run Windows 10, and likely Windows 11, without a problem, but they can't be used because of a missing TPM.\n\nMicrosoft recently stated that the Windows 11 TPM requirement is \"non-negotiable\" as it powers numerous security features, such as how the operating system stores cryptography keys and protects credentials, and is integrated with Secure Boot and Windows Hello for Business.\n\nFor those who cannot upgrade their devices to Windows 10, Microsoft offers extended security updates (ESU) to businesses and consumers. However, they are not cheap.\n\nBusinesses who wish to receive extended security updates can do so for three years, being charged $61 for the first year, $122 for the second year, and $244 for the third. This brings the total price for ESU on a Windows 10 device to $427 over three years.\n\nMicrosoft is also offering a consumer ESU program for one year at $30 per device, which is more affordable but can get expensive if you have multiple devices in a household.",

In its fiscal year, the tech giant plans to have spent $80 billion on new datacenters.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s fiscal year ends in June, so its commitment relies on a lot of work that\u2019s already been done. Microsoft Chair and VP Brad Smith believe that some $80 billion in investments will have been put forward by the company between July 2024 and June 2025. He explains that most of these billions will be paid in U.S. dollars, too. \u201cMore than half of this total investment will be in the United States,\u201d he says, \u201creflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.\u201d\n\nAI as an export\n\nSmith refers several times to the potential of AI as an export for the US. He refers to the earlier successes around telecom equipment, rolled out globally by Western companies like Lucent and Nokia. However, Chinese infrastructure followed in their wake, notably Huawei. They subsequently delivered products that were cheaper and ultimately more popular, overtaking the American and European competition. Replacing Huawei when espionage suspicions arose proved to be costly and ought not to be repeated with AI, as the Microsoft Chair argues.\n\nIn short, Microsoft is casting AI as a new economic engine for the US. The text is an unmistakable charm offensive toward incoming President Trump. It emphasizes the continuity of issues and solutions offered in his first term, with the disruptive power of AI a new twist in the tale.\n\nThe thrust of \u201cAmerican AI\u201d is easy to defend. Microsoft relies primarily on Nvidia GPUs when building out AI and uses OpenAI\u2019s models throughout its software suite. However, Smith\u2019s example around telcos is a bit of a non-sequitur: the only American company he mentions besides European players Alcatel, Ericsson and Nokia is Lucent, which went defunct in 2006.\n\nEuropean ally\n\nHence, it is unsurprising that Smith also looks to partners in other countries, including European nations. The implication, however, is that the EU is mostly ahead in regulating AI, not so much the technology itself. Also, Microsoft\u2019s investment in Europe is presumably far less impressive than the total figure may suggest, as less than $40 billion is spread across AI datacenters in all regions outside the US.\n\nAlso read: Microsoft shows water-saving design for datacenters",

            "content": "As internet usage started to reach critical mass in the early 2000s, long before smartphones effortlessly connected us to fast wireless networks, several companies sought to create or augment devices that would allow web browsing without a PC, so-called \u201cinternet appliances.\u201d In the consumer market, the most successful of these was WebTV, which survived as MSN TV until 2013. But there were plenty of swings and misses from startups and giants alike, including the Virgin Webplayer, 3Com\u2019s Audrey, Sony\u2019s eVilla, and Microsoft\u2019s Web Companions. In the commercial market, Oracle spinout Network Computer, Inc. attracted the most attention, but its product was slow and came to market as PC prices were in freefall.\n\n(Image credit: Laptop Mag)\n\nThe rise and fall of cheap and easy internet connected devices\n\nIn 2008, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington floated the idea for a cheap, open-source web tablet that would come to be known as the CrunchPad. But a few weeks before it was set to launch, his design partner claimed it as their own, ultimately releasing it as the disappointing JooJoo. Meanwhile, a small Boston startup called Litl shipped a more polished netbook-class device, the thoughtfully designed Webbook . Priced at $700, it made little headway. But it set the stage for the first broadly successful web-centric device class: the Chromebook. Leveraging Google\u2019s market-leading browser (now targeted for divestment by the U.S. Department of Justice), Chromebooks were cheap yet familiar, highly compatible with websites, fast, and secure. They quickly became a hit in education and earned a place in the product lines of major PC companies that had seen little success with Android. (In fact, Google itself is one of the few companies that has left the Chromebook market.) Connectivity was viewed as so important that the first Chromebook, Google\u2019s own Cr48 aimed at developers, came with a few gigabytes of free Verizon wireless internet access if a hotspot wasn\u2019t available.\n\nOver the years, though, Chrome OS has lost much of its less-is-more differentiation. The big move came in 2019 when Chrome OS began supporting Android apps. Chromebooks can also now run Linux distributions (albeit mostly for developers). And, while its implementation is still far from perfect, Google has improved its tablet interface to the point where it is now best-in-class at accommodating both desktop and touchscreen interfaces. Regardless of whether rumors that Google is looking to fold Chrome OS into Android hold true, Chrome OS as an expression of \u201cbrowser as operating system\u201d is long dead.\n\nIntroducing Windows 365 Link - YouTube Watch On\n\nCan Microsoft pick up where Google left off?\n\nCuriously, as Google has been pushing Chrome OS away from cloud-centricity, Microsoft has become more aggressive on the opposite path, at least in education and enterprises. At the launch of the Surface Laptop, the company positioned inexpensive third-party Windows notebooks, aka \u201cCloudbooks,\u201d as answers to Chromebooks. In November 2021, it waded into the low-cost laptop waters with an education-exclusive Surface Laptop SE featuring a stripped-down version of Windows 11 that didn\u2019t allow downloading of any apps, even from the Microsoft store. That was also the year it launched Windows 365 for enterprises.\n\nNow, Microsoft has unveiled Windows 365 Link, a thin client that can connect only to Windows 365. Microsoft says that Link is the first Windows 365 client that it intends to develop both in-house and with third parties. The paradox in the consumer market is that while Microsoft and others have pushed the performance limits of broadband with cloud gaming platforms, there\u2019s never been much momentum behind a cloud PC service aimed at consumers. That\u2019s in large part because most other traditional consumer PC applications, e.g., word processing, email, and even file managers like OneDrive and Google Drive, are already available there as web apps. Meanwhile, with the 2024 debut of CoPilot+ PCs on a rejuvenated Qualcomm platform and their push across x86 processor architectures in 2025, local PCs aren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nWhat's next for cloud computing?\n\nStill, those early internet appliance advocates have been partially vindicated. While the Chromebook as a pure web play is dead, it may soon play host to an enhanced version of Android, one of the two smartphone/tablet OSes that offer a simpler interface than desktop OSes. And AI-imbued smart glasses are progressing toward a world where \u201ccomputing\u201d involves little more than statements or stares.",

The certifications focus on a variety of Microsoft products like Azure, Dynamics, Microsoft 365, and more.\n\nTech jobs \u2014 whether it's an IT role at a mid-sized business or a job at Microsoft itself \u2014 are known for being highly competitive. Given the prevalence of Microsoft products in the business world, these certifications shouldn't be overlooked as a way to both show your knowledge and demonstrate your proficiency with Microsoft products.\n\nHow Microsoft certifications work\n\nIf you're interested in a Microsoft certification, you have a few routes you can take to learn the material: you can pay for instructor-led training from Microsoft itself or from a Microsoft-partnered training organization, or you can take free, self-paced training provided by Microsoft.\n\nTo actually become certified, you'll need to pay to take an exam. Most of the exams are online proctored exams that you can do from your own home and computer, but you also have the option to schedule your exam at a test center if you wish.\n\nMicrosoft certifications come with free self-paced training modules you can work on at your convenience. LumiNola/Getty Images\n\nIf you're doing the online version, know that you'll be assigned a proctor to monitor you during the exam, and you'll have to submit photos of your ID and the room you're taking the exam in.\n\nWith some exceptions, most Microsoft certifications are good for 12 months, after which they must be renewed. The good news is that renewals are free and just require you to pass an online assessment that is shorter than the original exam. The assessments are also un-proctored and open book. But be warned: you have only six months to complete this or you'll have to retake the original exam.\n\nHow much do Microsoft certifications cost?\n\nExam and training costs can vary significantly depending on the Microsoft certification, and depending on where you're located. Instructor-led courses typically cost the most \u2014 some courses in the US can total thousands of dollars \u2014 but you have the benefit of a human instructor who can answer your questions and offer tips on the material and exam.\n\nIf you go the self-paced training route through Microsoft, your only cost is the exam, which typically costs between $99 and $165, depending on the certification and your location.\n\nWhat are the most valuable Microsoft certifications?\n\nWhat Microsoft certifications you should get boils down to your personal interests, and what certifications are most in demand and correlate with high-earning jobs. This can fluctuate over time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWith the prevalence of cloud computing these days, Azure-based certifications are in high demand and jobs like network engineer pay quite well. And amid the ongoing AI arms race that has taken the tech world by storm, a certification in machine learning or generative AI solutions could give you a competitive edge in the job market.\n\nCybersecurity skills are also in high demand, and Microsoft offers a certification for cybersecurity solutions using Microsoft technologies.\n\nMicrosoft's website allows you to browse credentials and filter the various Microsoft certifications based on what type of role you're seeking, such as DevOps engineer or database administrator, or what type of product you want to specialize in, like Microsoft Fabric, Windows, Power BI, or Copilot.\n\nYou can browse Microsoft certifications based on product, role, or even your level of expertise. Michelle Mark/Business Insider\n\nMicrosoft certifications for beginners\n\nWhile intermediate and senior certifications generally correlate with the highest annual salaries, the material is complex and advanced, and they're not necessarily the first certifications you should look for if you're new to the IT field, cloud computing, or to Microsoft technology.\n\nMicrosoft certifications are categorized into levels, and labeled as beginner, intermediate, or advanced. You can always start with beginner certifications like Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (also known as AZ-900) that teaches you the fundamentals of Azure.\n\nEven if you don't take the fundamentals exam and are aiming for a higher-level certification, it can still be worth going through the free self-paced training documentation for the fundamentals courses to help bring yourself up to speed.

            "content": "Opinion The resurfacing of a 1995 Usenet post earlier this month prompted The Reg FOSS desk to re-examine a pivotal operating system flop \u2026 and its long-term consequences.\n\nA 1995 Usenet post from Gordon Letwin, Microsoft's lead architect on the OS/2 project, has been rediscovered. To modern eyes, it looks like an email, but it wasn't. Usenet was the original social network and this was a public post. In case you don't recognize Letwin's name, he was one of the founding staff members of Microsoft \u2013 he's in the famous 1978 Albuquerque photo. He literally wrote the book on OS/2, that book being Inside OS/2.\n\nLetwin's 1995 post says:\n\nOriginally I'd planned on posting this on Aug 24, but real life events are foreshadowing things so I'll post a bit early.\n\nWhy not the August 24? Because August 24, 1995, was the day that Microsoft launched Windows 95. What's interesting about the post is that it seems to show that even by 1995 \u2013 just before what would prove to be Microsoft's most successful OS launch ever \u2013 Microsoft's OS/2 head honcho still hadn't put his finger on precisely why it flopped.\n\nArguably the most important changes in software and hardware that shaped the modern computing gathered force in the 1980s. Industry-standard desktop computers went from eight-bit machines to 16-bit, and then to 32-bit, all over the space of just ten years. This set the stage for the developments of the 1990s that put us where we are today, in a world of multicore 64-bit machines running mainly just two extended families of operating systems \u2013 Windows NT and Unix \u2013 which take tens of gigabytes and are still growing.\n\nWindows 95 was a big launch, but its success wasn't a huge surprise. Beta versions had been circulating for over a year. It's fair to say that by 1995, OS/2 was dead software walking. That's not a big revelation; it is the central theme of Letwin's post. Almost exactly a year later, on September 25, 1996, the last ever major version of OS/2, Warp 4, was released.\n\nFor context, by 1995 everyone knew that Windows 95 was going to be a big deal, and that it was all over for OS/2 bar the shouting. A keen user of OS/2 2.0, this vulture moved his home PC to Windows 95 while it was still in beta. The UI was far superior, more hardware worked, and Doom ran much better.\n\nBut does Letwin's post miss the real point?\n\nNo, he says:\n\nWhat was OS/2's problem? Why was it doomed? Because it's [sic] main attraction was as an engine to run MS-Windows applications.\n\nThat, we submit, is wrong on multiple levels (not just the grocer's apostrophe). Only 32-bit OS/2 \u2013 that's OS/2 2.0 and its successors \u2013 could run Windows apps. That isn't why it was doomed. It's a red herring. It's true, but it was a symptom of the decline, not a cause of it. The lack of native apps was a sure sign that OS/2 had already flopped.\n\n(As an aside, OS/2 1.x did have big-name native apps. For instance, the market leaders, Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, both appeared on OS/2 before Windows. Lotus 1-2-3/G on OS/2 predated 1-2-3/W for Windows. There was a Wordperfect for OS/2 before the first Windows version.)\n\nYou don't need a deep knowledge of the history to work out why this was an effect, not a cause. The logic is inexorable. Let's step back through the reasoning, chronologically.\n\nNot many high-profile native applications were developed for 32-bit OS/2, because it could run Windows 3.x apps.\n\nThis means all the commercially important apps were already Windows apps.\n\nWhy? Because Windows was already dominant.\n\nWhen OS/2 2.0 launched in April 1992, a good enough and commercially successful version of Windows already dominated the market. That was Windows 3.0, launched in May 1990.\n\nIn other words, OS/2 2.0 trailed Windows 3.0 by nearly two years. When OS/2 finally went 32-bit, as a platform it had already lost the battle. The lack of native apps was not the reason it lost; the lack of native apps was proof that Windows 3 had already won.\n\nHow did Windows 3 win? Because OS/2 1.x had already flopped.\n\nThat's the real crux, but Letwin buries it and almost dismisses it. The really important bit is not about Windows applications. The real question is how and why Windows 3 was able to gain that dominance, why it's the platform that other companies wrote the apps for.\n\nLetwin mentions this, but he misses the significance. It's this part:\n\nThe miscalculation came about with the 386 coming out sooner than we expected ... When the 386 did come out earlier than expected and we saw what was happening, Microsoft wanted to abandon OS/2 1.0 before it was released and work on a 386-only version, one that would be able to emulate more than one DOS box and do a better job at that.\n\nThat's absolutely right. But Letwin still misses the key element of the story.\n\nAn 80386-specific OS/2 1 would have been the right thing to do. Microsoft jointly announced OS/2 1.0 in April 1987, a year and a half after Intel launched the 80386 in October 1985. OS/2 1.0 was so unfinished it didn't even have a graphical desktop yet. It was a text-mode, command-line-only OS, it cost $325 and required 2 MB of RAM.\n\nIf that text-only OS/2 1.0 had been able to multitask DOS apps, it would have been an attractive option. DOS multitasking is all that Quarterdeck's DESQview could do, for instance \u2013 and it cost $399.\n\nBut no, as Letwin spells out, OS/2 1.x was limited to the 16-bit 80286:\n\nBut, as you'll remember, Compaq was the first to have a 386 box; IBM was slow to follow suit. IBM was strong in 286's and weak in 386's, so it was strongly opposed to dropping the 286 in favor of leapfrogging to the 386 and they insisted that we stay the course for the 286.\n\nWhat he wrote was true, but we think it was not the core reason for IBM's intransigence.\n\nYes, Compaq shipped a 386 first, the Compaq Deskpro 386, whose importance we've looked at before. Even so, IBM was in the market early and strongly with 386 machines.\n\nThe IBM PS/2 Model 80 was a best-seller. As a callow 20-year-old, this vulture set up quite a few SCO Xenix systems on Model 80 machines. Suffice to say, the author still owns one today.\n\nCompaq was first. The Deskpro 386 launched in September 1986, but it was crippled by a 16-bit ISA expansion bus \u2013 only its proprietary memory card slot was 32-bit, and $6,499 ($18,718 today) is a lot of money for a very limited machine.\n\nIBM launched the PS/2 lineup in April 1987, with the Model 80 (386) following in July. Unlike the Compaq, IBM's 386 machines had a full 32-bit expansion bus and could drive 32-bit peripherals.\n\nNobody could design and build a superior machine in less than a year; it would take more than 11 months to design, implement, and manufacture the first fully 32-bit PC with a wholly new expansion architecture.\n\nYes, IBM was slower to market and that hurt it, but the Model 80 (and the desktop Model 70, the fastest x86 PC in the world, bar none) was a stunning kit for the time, and they sold well despite being the cost of a good sports car.\n\nIBM was slow to market, but it wasn't that slow. By comparison, Compaq rushed the Deskpro 386 out, and it showed.\n\nThe key point was not the timing, as Letwin alleges. Yes, one of the original clone vendors rushed out an impressive but flawed product; Compaq got there first, and that was embarrassing.\n\nBut it was just a minor embarrassment. The real deal was this.\n\nIBM made a promise, and IBM kept its promises. It shipped the PS/2 range with 286s front and center, promising OS/2 compatibility to its customers \u2013 a promise IBM wouldn't break. So it vetoed Microsoft's plan of pivoting the new OS to the 386, even if that plan was solid and motivated by the correct reasoning.\n\nIf OS/2 1.0 had been an 80386 OS, and had been able to multitask DOS apps, we think it would have been a big hit. On the back of that hypothetical success, IBM could have individually couriered a replacement 80386 \"planar\" (\"motherboard\" to lesser vendors) to every customer who bought an 80286 PS/2 and wanted OS/2. IBM would still have made more money in the long run.\n\nIn his early 20s, this reporter worked on lots of 286 PS/2s and the bulk of owners had never heard of OS/2 and didn't care. IBM sold the machines as high-quality DOS computers, and that's all most customers wanted.\n\nBut backtracking on its promise that all PS/2 machines would run OS/2 would mean IBM admitted that it had made a mistake. That could not be. IBM did not make mistakes.\n\nAs an example, the PS/2 computers did not have reset buttons, because a reset button is how you reboot a computer that's locked up so hard that Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work. A reset button would mean acknowledging IBM computers crashed, and that was unacceptable. Instead, you had to waste a minute or two power-cycling the things. We did that a lot.\n\nEven nearly a decade after OS/2 flopped, its lead architect, Gordon Letwin, could not admit when and why it flopped. He did know. As he says, OS/2's initial 1980s versions were 16-bit products, at IBM's insistence.\n\nThat is when the war was lost. That is when OS/2 flopped. Because its initial versions were even more crippled than the Deskpro 386. The Deskpro worked; it was just slow. OS/2's fate was already sealed long before in the 1980s, because the 16-bit versions were no better at running DOS apps than DOS itself.\n\nBecause OS/2 1.x flopped, Microsoft launched a product that fixed the key weakness of OS/2 1.x. That product was Windows 3, which worked perfectly acceptably on 286 machines, but if you ran the same installed copy on a 32-bit 386 PC, it worked better. Windows 3.0 could use the more sophisticated hardware of a 386 to give better multitasking of the market-dominating DOS apps.\n\nOS/2 1.x ran fine on a 386, but it ran exactly the same as it did on a 286. You got no additional benefit from your 32-bit hardware. But Windows 3.0 did. You got memory protection and virtual memory, as well as a usable GUI.\n\nWindows 3 beat OS/2 because IBM insisted that OS/2 ran on the 80286, which crippled the new OS. IBM's determination to serve its customers with 80286 PS/2s, and keep a promise, resulted in OS/2 being a failure. That is what allowed Windows to gain the upper hand.\n\nIn other words, the really important bit of Letwin's post isn't what its author thought it was. IBM's poor planning shaped the PC industry of the 1990s more than Microsoft's successes.\n\nWindows 3.0 wasn't great, but it was good enough. It reversed people's perception of Windows after the failures of Windows 1 and Windows 2. Windows 3 achieved what OS/2 had intended to do. It transformed IBM PC compatibles from single-tasking text-only computers into graphical computers, with poor but just about usable multitasking.\n\nIBM and Microsoft divorced to go separate ways. IBM kept the planned future 32-bit OS/2 for 386 chips, which was surprisingly close to ready by 1990. Microsoft kept the planned CPU-independent, portable OS/2, known as OS/2 3 but internally nicknamed OS/2 NT after the N-Ten chip, which became the Intel i860 RISC processor.\n\nSoon after Windows 3.0 turned out to be a hit, OS/2 NT was rebranded as Windows NT. Even the most ardent Linux enthusiast must concede that Windows NT did quite well over three decades.\n\nOS/2 flopped because the company paying for the work, IBM, designed it for machines that it had already sold. It did not want to let existing customers down.\n\nEven at the time, by its own admission, Microsoft realized that aiming its new OS at emerging CPU technology made more sense.\n\nSo with Microsoft's next OS, Windows NT, that's what it did. It ended up eventually dominating the industry because it aimed at future hardware: it was designed to run on the i860, specifically the Dazzle motherboard, then the MIPS R3000, as well as x86 machines.\n\nOS/2 2.0 was relatively tiny. In 1992, it needed just 4 MB RAM and 60 MB disk. A year later, at release in 1993, Windows NT 3.1 needed four times as much memory as well as more disk space. As someone who deployed it in production, it wanted considerably more to run well.\n\nThe result? Decades of growth in program size, because the dogma is focus on the future, designing for ever-more-powerful hardware and higher-spec computers. Even now, Windows 11 won't run on a perfectly serviceable kit.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Microsoft plotted a course. By 1995, the signs were there that it had forgotten exactly why. \u00ae",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nMicrosoft is heavily invested in SAP applications\u2014it uses them extensively to run finance, human resources, global trade, supply chain, and other parts of its $168.1 billion global business. That\u2019s why it was a big deal when Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud and Microsoft Azure.\n\nMoving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative. \u2014Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager, Microsoft SAP program, Microsoft Digital\n\nIn early 2018, the company finished moving its entire SAP landscape\u2014an estimated 50 terabytes\u2014to Microsoft Azure. It was at that time, when the last, most important systems were moved over one busy weekend, that the company was able to seize on a new opportunity.\n\n\u201cMoving to the cloud saved us money, but this was really about becoming more agile and innovative,\u201d says Krassimir Karamfilov, general manager of the Microsoft SAP program in Microsoft Digital. \u201cThis allowed our teams to stop worrying about keeping our infrastructure up and running and to focus on innovating without a lot of heartburn. They can now run experiments, learn, and then use those learnings to take us in new directions\u2014and if an experiment doesn\u2019t work? They can easily shut it down and move on to something else.\u201d\n\nMoving from on-premises to Microsoft Azure slashed the Microsoft SAP budget by 20 percent to 25 percent, cost savings that came from fine-tuning usage, snoozing systems at night and on weekends, and by leaving behind old processes that weren\u2019t needed anymore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent in the cloud, and since Azure is the trusted cloud provider, our entire SAP landscape is now more secure than ever,\u201d says Karamfilov, explaining that the employees who manage the company\u2019s SAP in many instances were given new tools to work with. \u201cThe shift to the cloud enabled us to start using machine learning and artificial intelligence to look at the data underneath our entire landscape, and to start learning from that.\u201d\n\n\n\nReutter answers questions about the company\u2019s SAP on Microsoft Azure migration and lessons learned along the way.\n\nAt the time, the move to the cloud represented how committed Microsoft was and still is to its partnership with SAP, Karamfilov says. Officially and publicly, SAP has adopted a \u201cmulti-cloud strategy\u201d where it supports all hyperscale cloud providers to enable customers to use their preferred cloud. Also at the time, SAP announced it had selected Microsoft Azure to run many of its internal mission-critical SAP business systems (since then SAP has moved a lot of those internal systems to the cloud on Microsoft Azure).\n\n[Learn how Microsoft uses telemetry and monitoring on its SAP on Microsoft Azure workload. Here\u2019s how Microsoft is examining SAP transactions with Microsoft Azure Anomaly Detector. Find out how Microsoft is optimizing SAP for Microsoft Azure.]\n\nMaking the move to Azure\n\nLooking back at how Microsoft moved its SAP workload to the cloud, the Microsoft SAP team had been thinking about making the move since 2013, but it was only in 2017 that Azure added virtual machine SKUs big enough to handle a Microsoft-sized SAP ERP system, says Hans Reutter, the Microsoft Digital engineering manager who led the cloud migration.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the size, it was the complexity,\u201d Reutter says, giving the example of several independent enterprise-scale purchasing processes needing to come together seamlessly at the point of purchase so the customer has a good buying experience. \u201cAll of these production landscapes were highly dependent on each other because of the traffic that flows back and forth between them.\u201d\n\nWe started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit. First we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong. \u2014Hans Reutter, group engineering manager, Microsoft Digital\n\nMicrosoft Azure developed the M-Series specifically to address the enterprise market demand for larger virtual machines capable of running SAP landscapes at companies just like Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWe just happened to be one of the enterprises waiting for the M-Series,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cIt was exactly what we needed to make our move to the cloud.\u201d\n\nWith Azure\u2019s M64 and M128 SKUs in hand, Reutter\u2019s team migrated the company\u2019s largest and most complex SAP systems to Azure over one weekend (the team used smaller virtual machines to move most of the Microsoft landscape over the prior year).\n\nTo understand how they did it, Reutter says think horizontally and vertically.\n\n\u201cWe started with the low-risk stuff\u2014the low-hanging fruit,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cFirst, we moved the sandbox systems because we knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any impact on our customers if something went wrong.\u201d\n\nThat was the base layer. Next came the next least important layer, and the next, and the next. The team worked up layer by layer until it eventually got to the most important production systems. That was the horizontal approach. \u201cIf we missed anything, we found out really quickly\u2014before we got to the really important systems,\u201d Reutter says.\n\nThe team wrote migration scripts, found landmines, and worked out kinks while working in the base layers, which allowed it to get everything down pat by the time things got serious.\n\nNow to the vertical.\n\nThe team also used an end-to-end vertical strategy, migrating a few systems\u2014from development all the way to production\u2014all at once. \u201cWe tested the whole stack to make sure there were no gaps or surprises,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cThis vertical strategy allowed the team to accelerate learning and getting a jump on production processes.\u201d\n\nBy getting it right in both dimensions, they were able to migrate the mission critical systems seamlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to move some small stuff,\u201d Reutter says. \u201cYou want to make sure the crown jewels land in a safe spot.\u201d\n\nAnd while the migration wasn\u2019t without bumps, it went smoothly and the crown jewels were kept safe.\n\nGetting it right at home\n\nJuergen Thomas hears it all the time. If a customer is considering moving his or her SAP systems to Microsoft Azure, they always ask the same question.\n\nThe ask?\n\n\u201cDoes Microsoft run its landscape in Azure?\u201d\n\nThomas, a partner architect who manages a team in Microsoft Azure that helps SAP customers move to the cloud, was happy when he could start answering with a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d and even more importantly, that he also then had a good answer to their inevitable second question, which is \u201chow did you do it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure. We talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child. Running our own backend business processes with SAP in Azure is a main differentiator between us and our competitors who don\u2019t run SAP at all, or not in their own clouds. \u2014Juergen Thomas, partner architect, Microsoft Azure\n\n\u201cThen they immediately want to get into the details, which is a good thing,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIt was very important to be able to say that Microsoft is leading again and is ahead of the mass of companies.\u201d\n\nThomas says the story of moving the Microsoft ERP systems to the cloud has become a key showcase for the Microsoft Azure team because it shows Microsoft Azure can handle the biggest and most complicated SAP instances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proof that the Microsoft Azure platform can carry and sustain such a complex SAP platform on our Azure infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talk about it in customer briefings and conferences\u2014it is our poster child.

Because it's the 2019 version (and the sale helps, too). That's not really a bad thing, though.

            "content": "Microsoft has had three CEOs since its founding in 1975.\n\nBill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and Satya Nadella have steered the company through its 50-year history.\n\nRead about the CEOs who oversaw Microsoft's successes, failures, launches, acquisitions, and more.\n\nSatya Nadella has been Microsoft's CEO since February 4, 2014, and its executive chairman since June 2021. He is the company's third CEO since its incorporation in 1975.\n\nLet's break down the company's chief executives and their tenures:\n\nBill Gates (1975-2000)\n\nThe Microsoft Corporation was co-founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, shortly after the pair dropped out of Harvard University. Gates said he dropped out of Harvard to found Microsoft because he feared missing out on being a pioneer of the personal computing revolution.\n\nBill Gates led Microsoft through the launch of wildly successful products like Windows and Microsoft Office. Doug Wilson/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nAs the company's first chief executive, Gates steered the company through its formative years and set forth Microsoft's original mission of \"a computer on every desk and in every home.\" A pivotal moment came in 1980 when Microsoft secured a deal to supply the operating system for IBM's first personal computer. To accomplish this, Microsoft purchased an existing operating system, modified it, and renamed it MS-DOS \u2014 short for Microsoft Disk Operating System \u2014 which became the foundation for the company's early success.\n\nIn 1985, the company launched Windows 1.0, introducing the Graphical User Interface that made computing more accessible to the masses. Subsequent releases like Windows 3.0 in 1990 and the highly successful Windows 95 in 1995 built upon this innovation, with each release solidifying Microsoft's operating system market dominance, which Microsoft enjoys to this day \u2014 in part due to the success of these earlier operating systems. Under Gates' leadership, the company also developed the Microsoft Office suite, which became the industry standard for business productivity software.\n\nTo this day, Microsoft is perhaps best known for its operating systems like Windows 95. DB/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nThe company's rapid growth led to its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 1986, making Gates a billionaire by the age of 31 and, at one point, the world's richest man. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft's influence expanded globally, but it also faced significant legal challenges. In 1998, the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the corporate giant of monopolistic practices by bundling Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system. The prolonged legal battle brought scrutiny, but ultimately, the two parties reached a settlement in 2001 that imposed certain restrictions on Microsoft's business practices.\n\nDespite these challenges, Gates continued to drive innovation, investing heavily in research and development. Microsoft expanded into various areas, including enterprise software, internet services, and gaming, laying the groundwork for future ventures like the Xbox. Gates' leadership emphasized not only technological advancement but also strategic business moves that kept Microsoft at the forefront of the industry.\n\nAfter leading the company for its first 25 years, Gates resigned in 2000 to focus on his philanthropic efforts, founding the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that same year. His tenure left a significant mark on the industry, with Microsoft's software becoming integral to personal and professional computing worldwide. Gates continued on as Microsoft's chief software architect until 2006 and as company chairman until 2014, when Satya Nadella took over the role. Gates remained on the board as a technical advisor before stepping down entirely in 2020.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSteve Ballmer (2000-2014)\n\nSteve Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980 as the company's first business manager, played a pivotal role in shaping its early business strategies. Ballmer succeeded Bill Gates as president and CEO of the company after the founder stepped down in 2000. Recognizing the need for agility in a rapidly evolving tech industry, he initiated extensive internal restructuring that favored speed and fewer bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nSteve Ballmer first joined Microsoft in 1980, before replacing Bill Gates as CEO in 2000. Jeff Chistensen/Getty Images\n\nWith Ballmer at the helm, Microsoft faced significant successes, but also its fair share of challenges. In 2001, the company launched the Xbox, marking its entry into the gaming console market. The Xbox and its successors would come to rival and challenge the market dominance of the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo. The success seen by the Xbox and its successors helped cement Microsoft as a serious player in the entertainment sector.\n\nBallmer's tenure also saw the release of Windows XP, an operating system so successful that it took until 2016 for another iteration of Windows to actually surpass Windows XP in terms of user base. The following year, it was still the third most popular operating system in the world, despite Windows XP's retirement in April 2014.\n\nHowever, not all initiatives fared so well. The release of Windows Vista in 2007 was met with widespread criticism due to performance issues and compatibility problems, tarnishing the reputation of Microsoft's flagship operating system. Additionally, Microsoft's efforts in the smartphone arena with Windows Mobile struggled to gain traction. Combined with the introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007 and the rapid advancement of Google's Android platform, this led to Microsoft ceding significant ground in the burgeoning mobile market that it never recovered. Microsoft tried again with the Windows Phone mobile operating system in October 2010 before throwing in the towel in 2017 and prioritizing iOS and Android development in 2018.\n\nBallmer oversaw challenges at Microsoft like Windows Mobile and the release of Windows Vista.

The Skype acquisition helped Microsoft gain valuable ground in both consumer and enterprise communication sectors that was not usurped until 2021 when Microsoft voluntarily replaced it in the business context with Microsoft Teams.\n\nDespite the challenges that Microsoft confronted during Ballmer's tenure as CEO, Microsoft experienced significant financial growth under his leadership. By the time Ballmer announced his retirement in 2013 and officially stepped down in February 2014, the company's annual revenue had tripled. This growth reflected the company's product portfolio expansion and its increased global market reach. Ballmer's tenure was marked by his efforts to diversify Microsoft's offerings and navigate the company through a transformative era in the technology industry, contending with fierce competition and headwinds while building on the company's foundations.\n\nSatya Nadella (2014-present)\n\nSatya Nadella has spearheaded Microsoft's AI efforts \u2014 notably, a partnership with OpenAI and the launch of Microsoft Copilot. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFollowing Steve Ballmer's resignation in February 2014, Satya Nadella took on the role of chief executive and chairman of the board.\n\nUnder Nadella's leadership, the company has undergone a significant transformation from a traditional software provider to a leader in cloud computing and subscription services. Recognizing the shifting tech landscape, Nadella prioritized investment in cloud infrastructure, expanding Microsoft Azure into one of the world's foremost cloud platforms. In fact, in 2020 Azure surpassed Microsoft's Windows business. This monumental strategic pivot also involved embracing mobile technologies and shifting key products to subscription-based models, exemplified by the launch of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) in June 2011. By 2015, the number of monthly Microsoft 365 users exceeded 50 million.\n\nNadella's tenure has been marked by several high-profile acquisitions aimed at diversifying Microsoft's portfolio and strengthening its position across various markets. In 2014, Microsoft acquired Mojang, the creator of the immensely popular video game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion. This was followed by the purchase of the professional networking site LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion and GitHub in 2018, the leading platform for software development collaboration, for $7.6 billion. These acquisitions broadened Microsoft's offerings and integrated valuable communities and services into its ecosystem.\n\nIn more recent years, Nadella has steered Microsoft toward becoming a key player in artificial intelligence. The company has invested heavily in AI research and development, most notably through Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, after overcoming initial skepticism. As of 2024, Microsoft has invested $13 billion into its OpenAI partnership, plans to obtain 1.8 million AI chips by year-end, and invest $100 billion through 2027 in GPUs and expanding its AI data centers.",

For the nation's economic future, Smith believes that the United States must lead globally in AI.\n\nSmith called on President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to support university research and the National Science Foundation, which, in a detailed online post, announced an increase in their budgets to encourage innovation. He said the competition over AI between the U.S. and China was a battle over setting global standards. He said China is lending subsidized access to AI chips and data centres to developing nations to lock them in its ecosystem.\n\nDeveloping AI data centers is where Microsoft is planning to put its hefty investment, along with model training and cloud-based AI applications around the globe. Although they have joined major rival tech giants, such as Amazon, Google and OpenAI, in channelling billions into AI, the time to substantial returns is still far off.\n\n'Over the next four years, it will be critical in terms of building our remaining lead in the area of artificial intelligence and kind of countering what is becoming inevitable,' said Smith. Microsoft ends on a fiscal year basis, and the end is June 2025, so it is a bold step toward the future of AI.\n\nThis commitment from Microsoft underscores the fast-accelerating geopolitical and economic stakes in this technological race as AI continues to redraw industry lines.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "A vision for technology success during the next four years\n\nAs we usher in a New Year, we will welcome a new president into the White House as well as a golden opportunity for American technology and economic competitiveness. Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation\u2019s economy. In many ways, artificial intelligence is the electricity of our age, and the next four years can build a foundation for America\u2019s economic success for the next quarter century.\n\nAt Microsoft, we see a three-part vision for America\u2019s technology success. This starts with advances and investments in world-leading American AI technology and infrastructure. Second, the country needs to champion skilling programs that will enable widespread AI adoption and enhanced career opportunities across the economy. Finally, the United States must focus on exporting American AI to our allies and friends, bolstering our domestic economy and ensuring that other countries benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe country has a unique opportunity to pursue this vision and build on the foundational ideas set for AI policy during President Trump\u2019s first term. Achieving this vision will require a partnership that unites leaders from government, the private sector, and the country\u2019s educational and non-profit institutions. At Microsoft, we are excited to take part in this journey.\n\nTechnology as a foundation for economic growth\n\nSince the mid-1700s, the world has witnessed great leaps forward through major industrial revolutions, each driven by groundbreaking technology. The steam engine ignited the world\u2019s first industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, intensifying economic growth through subsequent and rapid advances in ironworking.\n\nThe second industrial revolution, starting in the late 1800s, catapulted the United States to global economic leadership. Americans uniquely harnessed the power of electricity across the economy, including by transforming machine tooling to build the world\u2019s largest manufacturing-based economy.\n\nThe third industrial revolution emerged in the latter half of the 1900s, fueled by computer chips and software. Once again, the United States led the world in this new technological era, giving rise to new companies that included Microsoft itself, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary this April.\n\nEach of these eras was marked by what economists call a General-Purpose Technology, or GPT. In contrast to single-purpose products, GPTs boost innovation and productivity across the economy. Ironworking, electricity, machine tooling, computer chips, and software all rank among history\u2019s most impactful GPTs.\n\nWorld-leading AI technology and infrastructure\n\nAs we look into the future, it\u2019s clear that artificial intelligence is poised to become a world-changing GPT. AI promises to drive innovation and boost productivity in every sector of the economy. The United States is poised to stand at the forefront of this new technology wave, especially if it doubles down on its strengths and effectively partners internationally.\n\nAmerica\u2019s technological strength has always been rooted in the private sector. Today, the United States leads the global AI race thanks to the investment of private capital and innovations by American companies of all sizes, from dynamic start-ups to well-established enterprises. At Microsoft, we\u2019ve seen this firsthand through our partnership with OpenAI, from rising firms such as Anthropic and xAI, and our own AI-enabled software platforms and applications. Across the nation, a new generation of AI firms is emerging, each capitalizing on rapid advances in AI models and chips, moving to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and AI Accelerator Chips. And across the economy, software programs are being redesigned to operate as AI-enabled applications.\n\nNone of this progress would be possible without new partnerships founded on large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use. In FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world. More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy.\n\nOur success, however, depends on a broad and competitive technology ecosystem, much of which is based on open-source development. This includes our longstanding competitors, chip suppliers, applications companies, systems integrators, service providers, and the millions of software developers who use our products to create customized solutions working for our customers. The massive datacenters that make all this possible are being built by construction firms, steel and other manufacturers, and innovative advances in electricity and liquid cooling, all reliant on large numbers of skilled electricians and pipefitters, including members of organized labor unions. Together, all these groups have enabled the technology sector to become an economic backbone for the United States and the world.\n\nSince the Second World War, America\u2019s technological innovation has been driven by research and development (R&D) based on two critical ingredients. The first is sustained support for basic research. While a few tech companies invest substantial sums in basic research, as we do through Microsoft Research (MSR), most world-leading basic research is pursued by academics at American universities, often based on funding from the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. Driven by curiosity rather than a profit motive, this research often leads to unexpected but profound discoveries that are published publicly.\n\nThe second ingredient is a sustained commitment to investments in product development by companies of all sizes. The United States, more than any other country, has mastered the process of moving new ideas quickly from universities to the private sector. This success rests on healthy investments in both R and D, recognizing that basic research is often publicly funded and typically in universities, while product development is robustly and privately funded through companies. It\u2019s the combination of the two that makes American R&D so successful.\n\nThe incoming Administration can strengthen these foundational elements, building on the work from President Trump\u2019s first term. In 2019, the President approved an executive order designed to strengthen America\u2019s lead in artificial intelligence. It rightly focused on federal investments in AI research and making federal data and computing resources more accessible. Five years later, President Trump and Congress should expand on these efforts to support advancing America\u2019s AI leadership. More funding for basic research at the National Science Foundation and through our universities is one good place to start.\n\nAI skilling\n\nSkilling was a centerpiece of President Trump\u2019s 2019 AI Executive Order. It prioritized AI within existing federal educational grants and fellowship programs to help build a bigger pipeline of skilled AI researchers and practitioners. It also highlighted the importance of integrating AI technologies into educational curricula and called for the development of apprenticeship and skills programs, particularly in STEM fields, to ensure that American workers are well-prepared for the future.\n\nThis focus was prescient, as five years later, AI skilling has become a necessity for the nation. AI is reshaping the nature of work and the future of jobs. This mirrors the lessons from prior industrial revolutions. Ironworking in the 1700s spread rapidly in the United Kingdom because technical associations and apprenticeships enabled workers to master new skills. Machine tooling in the late 1800s spread quickly in the United States because land grant colleges expanded the number of mechanical engineers. And digital technology spread swiftly in the U.S. in the second half of the twentieth century because new computer science departments in American colleges and universities produced the software developers the nation needed. In sum, one of the most important elements in spreading a GPT across an economy is the skilling infrastructure that equips both current and future workers with the capabilities needed to put new technology to work.\n\nAI, like all new technologies, will disrupt the economy and displace some jobs. But as we\u2019ve worked on skilling initiatives during the past few years, our confidence has grown that AI will create new opportunities that will outweigh many of the challenges ahead. If used well, AI will help lower the barriers to entry for many professions, replace rote tasks, and create a foundation for human creativity that builds on AI tools. AI will create new economic opportunities, allowing entrepreneurs to start new businesses and create new jobs. Along the way, AI can boost productivity in every sector of the economy, adding to the country\u2019s opportunity for economic growth.\n\nAI is already becoming a tool to enable small business owners with fewer staff to compete in new ways with larger companies. And it offers the best opportunity so far this century to help high school grads and others with less post-secondary education to reverse the growing economic inequality that has gripped the nation since the early 1990s.\n\nThe key will be to develop a national AI talent strategy that equips Americans of all ages and backgrounds with the opportunity to acquire the AI skills needed for economic advancement. A key opportunity for most people will be to develop an AI fluency that will enable them to use AI in their jobs, much as they use laptops, smartphones, software applications, and the internet today.\n\nThere is a lesson here from the recent past. A big part of Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history has been tied to the creation of knowledge workers that drive the modern services economy of the United States and many other countries. The PC/Mobile era has created a global economy with more than a billion such workers. During the next quarter century, we believe AI can help create the next billion AI-enabled jobs, reaching not just services but manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, government, and every other part of the economy.\n\nIn this new AI era, some individuals will want and need deeper training. Some of this will happen on the job, through online platforms such as LinkedIn Learning, or at a community college or four-year institution. For some people, this training will build upon existing disciplines like computer and data science, potentially evolving into a new generation of AI engineering. Other individuals will take business classes that will equip them to help design or manage the integration of AI systems into the business processes that support organizations across the private, public, and non-profit sectors.\n\nCompanies across the tech sector are already playing an important part. For instance, in 2025 alone, Microsoft is on a path to train 2.5 million American students, workers, and community members with the AI skills to land new jobs, pursue new careers, and build new businesses.\n\nOur work is providing us with a broad perspective and a firm belief that now is the time for the country to pursue a new national goal to make AI skilling accessible and useful for every American. By definition, this will require a very broad range of partnerships, spanning across geographic, organizational, economic, and political divides.\n\nThis is why our work focuses in part on community colleges. In every part of the United States, they are integral to American workforce development, offering accessible, affordable, and flexible education. We\u2019re already partnering with the National AI Consortium for Community Colleges to provide industry-aligned AI curriculum. And we\u2019re developing faculty training through AI Bootcamps that will help prepare students with in-demand skills that meet regional workforce needs.\n\nWe\u2019ve also developed new AI training programs for teachers. And we\u2019re partnering with workforce agencies to enhance AI skills and career guidance through a Microsoft Copilot for Career Navigators initiative, which provides tools to effectively support communities in the AI-driven economy.\n\nOur goal is to reach every corner of the country, including rural communities. The National 4-H AI Skills Partnership will use Minecraft Education to introduce AI concepts and increase AI fluency for 1.4 million youth. And with the Future Farmers of America\u2019s FarmBeats for Students program, we are helping young people use AI to advance precision agriculture.\n\nOne conclusion jumps out from our work more than anything else: AI offers not only new tools for people\u2019s work but also new ways to help people learn almost anything. We have the opportunity as a country to equip all Americans with the skills needed to use AI to pursue higher-paying jobs and more successful careers. This should be our national north star.\n\nAI exports\n\nA third critical priority for 2025 is the promotion of American AI exports. President Trump\u2019s 2019 executive order rightly emphasized the need to promote an international environment that \u201copens markets for American AI industries while protecting our technological advantage in AI and protecting our critical AI technologies from acquisition by strategic competitors and adversarial nations.\u201d Since then, the advent of generative AI has increased the importance of this priority. Even more critically, the rapid development of China\u2019s AI sector has heightened competition between American and Chinese AI, with much of this likely to play out during the next four years in international markets around the world.\n\nWhile the U.S. government rightly has focused on protecting sensitive AI components in secure datacenters through export controls, an even more important element of this competition will involve a race between the United States and China to spread their respective technologies to other countries. Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover. Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.\n\nThis fundamental lesson emerges from the past 20 years of telecommunications equipment exports. Initially, American and European companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, Ericsson, and Nokia built innovative products that defined international standards. But as Huawei invested in innovation and China\u2019s government subsidized sales of its products, especially across the developing world, adoption of these Chinese products outpaced the competition and became the backbone of numerous countries\u2019 telecommunications networks. This created the technology foundation for what later became an important issue for the Trump Administration in 2020, as it grappled with the presence of Huawei\u2019s 5G products and their implications for national and cybersecurity.\n\nAs we enter the second half of the decade, early signs suggest the Government of China is interested in replicating its successful telecommunications strategy. China is starting to offer developing countries subsidized access to scarce chips, and it\u2019s promising to build local AI datacenters. The Chinese wisely recognize that if a country standardizes on China\u2019s AI platform, it likely will continue to rely on that platform in the future.\n\nThe best response for the United States is not to complain about the competition but to ensure we win the race ahead. This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative. And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends.\n\nThe United States currently has multiple advantages. American companies currently have better technology, from chips to AI models to software applications. In addition, many U.S. companies, including Microsoft, have invested heavily in building AI that is more trustworthy than most products from China. We are designing AI technology that protects cybersecurity, privacy, digital safety, and other responsible uses of AI. And we are making this technology available around the world through datacenters that meet the U.S. Government\u2019s highest cyber and physical security standards.\n\nIncreasingly, this is also backed by strong international regulatory cooperation among the North American, European, and Asian and Pacific democracies. If the Trump Administration can build upon the best AI steps that have emerged in the past four years through international AI diplomacy, including the G7, the United States will offer the world a compelling value proposition.\n\nEqually important, American tech companies and private capital markets are investing heavily to spread American AI platforms around the world. And building on the historic Abraham Accords of President Trump\u2019s first term, the United States is forging stronger technology and economic ties with key nations and sovereign investors in the Middle East. All this is creating a powerful approach that far exceeds what the United States and Europe had available to counter Chinese government subsidies in the telecommunications space.\n\nMicrosoft itself represents this effort more than any other single entity. Last year, we announced with national leaders that we intend to invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build trusted and secure AI and cloud datacenter infrastructure. This is part of a global infrastructure that now reaches 40 countries, including in the Global South, where China has frequently focused so many of its Belt and Road investments. To enhance our capabilities, we are partnering with the UAE\u2019s sovereign AI company, G42, to bring AI infrastructure to Kenya. And we\u2019re working with Blackrock and MGX to create an international investment fund to add up to $100 billion of additional funding for AI infrastructure and the AI supply chain.\n\nOther companies are accelerating their investments as well. Firms like Google, Amazon, and others are investing heavily. And more private capital is joining in.\n\nWe should expect China\u2019s government to spend public funds on international subsidies to support the adoption of its technology, especially in places like Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But it will be difficult for China to match America\u2019s private sector investments and these international capital funds.\n\nPut in this context, the most important priority for the U.S. Government won\u2019t be to match Chinese subsidies with American public spending, although there may be some parts of the developing world where development banks and foreign aid may have a role to play. Instead, the most important U.S. public policy priority should be to ensure that the U.S. private sector can continue to advance with the wind at its back. The United States cannot afford to slow its own private sector with heavy-handed regulations. The country instead needs a pragmatic export control policy that balances strong security protection for AI components in trusted datacenters with an ability for U.S. companies to expand rapidly and provide a reliable source of supply to the many countries that are American allies and friends.\n\nCauses for American Optimism\n\nIn sum, as we look to the four years ahead, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the role of American AI.\n\nAs a nation, we have a solid AI technology foundation fueled by the world\u2019s most robust and innovative private sector. With a thoughtful approach to government policy, we can sustain our leadership through well-funded basic research at the nation\u2019s universities and broad support for private sector innovation.\n\nOur strong educational system can spread new AI skills to work that will energize our economy. Technology platforms and non-profits can help people use AI to enhance their careers. We have the world\u2019s most dynamic business sector that excels in adopting new technology. If the Trump Administration can develop a strong national AI talent strategy and use AI to make the government itself more effective and efficient, it will put the country on a promising path.\n\nFinally, the United States is in a strong position to win the essential race with China by advancing international adoption of American AI. American products are more trusted than their Chinese counterparts, and our private sector is unmatched in its ability to invest in infrastructure around the world. With a balanced and common-sense approach to export control policy, the United States can solidify the diplomatic relations that will be critical to global AI adoption.\n\nThe key to the future is to bring together the best of what we can offer across American society, from across our private sector, educational and non-profit institutions, and government. Teamwork based on technology collaboration will build the foundation for a golden AI opportunity\u2014and for the next generation of American prosperity.\n\nTags: AI, AI for Good, economy, global ai, Technology, United States",

            "content": "Quantum computing is evolving from a futuristic concept to a technological reality. Governments have categorized quantum as a \u2018critical technology,\u2019 and industry end-users continue to experiment with its potential while the quantum ecosystem expands as more specialist entrants set out to deliver on the quantum promise.\n\nPerennial upsurges in investment indicate that governments and private enterprises are starting to understand the potential of quantum technologies\u2019 capacity to tackle acute societal challenges such as climate change and recast national and transnational sectors through applicable use cases.\n\nHowever, while investment signifies the growing understanding of the benefits of quantum technology, it does not denote awareness of the inner workings of quantum itself. Although the need for explaining qubits, entanglement, and superposition around the watercoolers has decreased over the years, other areas, such as the role of error correction in quantum primitives and algorithms, remain not entirely grasped by stakeholders.\n\nGovernments and industries still need to develop a deeper understanding of quantum computing\u2019s capabilities and limitations as the technology progresses toward practical use cases.\n\nGovernment institutions such as the Department of Energy, and industries like those in chemical and material sciences must tap the potential benefits of quantum computing now before it becomes standard practice and leaves late adopters behind.\n\nThis article will recapitulate this sentiment, examining the role of Microsoft and its partners, such as Atom Computing, in driving quantum computing from noisy experiments to logical practicality, with an impetus to develop quantum-ready applications, harnessing the opportunities of quantum for scientific and, eventually, commercial advantage as these systems scale.\n\nAnimating the article, two quantum experts \u2013 Dr. Krysta Svore, Technical Fellow in Advanced Quantum Development at Microsoft, and Dr. Ben Bloom, Founder and CEO of Atom Computing will provide their unique insights from the ground floor, pressing the importance of understanding and exploring quantum computing.\n\nYou can also dive into the details and interact with Microsoft and Atom Computing as they reveal how they are paving the way to logical quantum computing through the Azure Quantum compute platform. Register here for the upcoming webinar on January16.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Journey in Developing Logical Quantum Computing\n\nPursuing resilient quantum computing, Microsoft has made substantial strides in transforming noisy physical qubits into reliable logical ones using their qubit virtualization system. This platform solution combines physical qubits and applies them with built-in error correction to produce logical qubits capable of running computations more reliably than the underlying physical qubits.\n\nIn September 2024, Microsoft and Quantinuum announced the successful creation, entanglement, and scaling of 12 logical qubits with a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.8%. This milestone was achieved using Quantinuum\u2019s H2 machine integrated with Microsoft\u2019s qubit-virtualization system [1] and received notoriety as it was the highest fidelity count seen, inching closer to the benchmark known as the \u2018triple nine,\u2019 or the fidelity threshold of fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n\nMicrosoft and Atom Computing\n\nTwo months later, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced they had demonstrated the ability to detect and correct errors, and perform computation, on 28 logical qubits. Notably, Atom Computing broke the triple nine fidelity barrier for single-qubit gate fidelity and achieved 99.6% in two-qubit gate fidelity, the highest recorded in the neutral atom modality. [2]\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Qubit Virtualization System was applied to Atom Computing\u2019s neutral-atom hardware to create logical qubits that serve as the foundation to a reliable quantum machine. By combining this reliable quantum system with cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI), both companies are offering a commercial discovery suite.\n\nThe announcements above helped push the industry from level 1, noisy physical qubits, to level 2, resilient quantum computing. These technical milestones, combined with the strengths and reach of Microsoft as a global software development company, produce a recipe that can fast-track the commercialization of quantum computing.\n\nQuantum Technologies Applications and Opportunities\n\nAs is well-known, quantum computers currently lack practical functionality to solve real-world problems. However, general advantages are on the near horizon, as indicated by the milestones achieved between Microsoft, Quantinuum, and Atom Computing.\n\nFor example, Microsoft\u2019s logical qubit roadmap \u2013 see Figure 1 below \u2013 in the quest to reliable quantum computing is a great steer for what end users like governments and industries can expect:\n\n50 logical qubits: General advantage in simulations driven by quantum computing.\n\n100 logical qubits: Scientific advantage in utilizing reliable logical quantum computing to solve scientific problems intractable for classical computers.\n\n1000 logical qubits: Industrial advantage where application domains such as catalysis and deep computational chemistry analysis can be utilized to discover improved, greener, and cleaner material compounds for better products.\n\nIn the interim, current application domains can be explored using a hybrid approach such as Microsoft\u2019s science platform, Azure Elements. As hybrid solutions scale, so will their complementary strengths:\n\nThe simulation power from cloud-based high-powered computing (HPC) to explore vast option spaces. The ultra-precise identification and characterization capabilities of reliable quantum computing to analyze and aggregate deep data on chosen options. The development of bespoke advanced AI models using deep data from quantum computing to produce simulated variations of chosen options to optimize their greatest possible permutation.\n\nThis unified platform promises to have the potential to tackle complex and critical challenges, such as climate change, which are intractable for classical computing to solve individually.\n\nAs TQI has posited in the past, the following outlines a set of challenges that governments and sectors such as material discovery and life sciences may be able to solve if explored and matured using the aforementioned technology:\n\nCustomers/Institutions can utilize the Azure Elements platform to discover new and improved energy storage materials and optimize electrical grids.\n\nThe chemical and materials sciences sector can use density functional theory to simulate the properties of compound materials, identifying new catalyst methods for improved sustainable industrial processes.\n\nIn the future, the life sciences industry can utilize quantum computing\u2019s precision to identify and characterize the dynamics and behavior of molecules to improve the early stages of drug discovery.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure Quantum Compute platform, as demonstrated through partnerships with Atom Computing and Quantinuum, is leading the development of reliable logical quantum computation to facilitate entirely new application domains in solving society\u2019s most complex challenges \u2013 instigating development from proofs-of-concept to commercial impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is understood that quantum computing has significant potential across public and private sectors in providing specific computational solutions to solve complex societal problems of utmost importance to stakeholders globally.\n\nUp until recently, murmuring \u2018quantum computing\u2019 had to include careful model verbs such as \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 \u2013 and while developments are yet to be achieved \u2013 the commercial discovery suite announced between Microsoft and Atom Computing has for many shortened the timeline estimates for when reliable and logical quantum computing can be attained.\n\nIn the meantime, promising full-stack solutions such as Azure Elements, which combine HPC with custom AI models, should be on the agenda for government agencies\u2019 and industrial players\u2019 strategy meetings.\n\nFor more information on how Microsoft\u2019s Azure Quantum compute platform is developing quantum-ready applications to solve globally acute challenges, watch and participate in the upcoming Microsoft webinar \u2018Enabling the Next Generation of Quantum Applications With Reliable Quantum Computing\u2019 on January 16, 2025.\n\nThis webinar will delve into the details of the Microsoft and Atom Computing collaboration to accelerate the development of quantum-ready applications, featuring leading experts such as Dr. Svore and Dr. Bloom and hosted by Brian Lenahan.

            "content": "Both Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) and Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) saw strong growth in their cloud-computing business units in 2024. While Microsoft's Azure saw the higher revenue growth, it was Amazon's stock that outperformed in 2024.\n\nLet's see which stock could be the bigger winner this year.\n\nCloud-computing growth\n\nCloud computing has been one of the biggest areas of growth stemming from the rise in artificial intelligence (AI), as organizations use services from these companies to help build their own AI models and applications.\n\nAmazon created the cloud-computing industry back in 2006 when it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help speed up the infrastructure development it had started doing for partners and affiliates. Today, this infrastructure-as-a service business is Amazon's most profitable segment, nicely exceeding its retail operations. On a trailing-12-month basis, AWS produced $36.4 billion in operating income, while Amazon's North American and international operations generated operating income of $24.3 billion.\n\nToday, the company has about a 31% market share in the cloud-computing space, nicely ahead of Microsoft's Azure with a 20% share. Last quarter, the segment's revenue climbed 19%, while its operating income surged 49%. The increase was led by AI-related revenue, which rose by triple digits.\n\nAmazon is profiting from AI in its AWS segment through a number of services, including its Bedrock and SageMaker solutions. With Bedrock, the company provides its customers with a selection of foundational AI models that they can use as a starting point to help build AI applications. It offers models not just from itself but also from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta Platforms, Mistral, and others. SageMaker, meanwhile, is a solution to help customers build and train their AI models and then move them into production.\n\nAmazon also makes custom AI chips designed specifically for training large language models (LLMs) and AI inference, called Graviton and Trainium, that were developed through its prior acquisition of Annapurna Labs. It has several well-known customers using its chips, including Apple, Anthropic, and SAP.\n\nAzure, meanwhile, has been one of the fastest growing parts of Microsoft's business, with revenue jumping 33% last quarter. Azure is a consumption-based service that is nicely benefiting from Microsoft helping customers build their own AI agents and copilots. The company said Azure's OpenAI usage doubled last quarter as a number of customers began moving apps from test to production. It also noted that Azure AI is helping increase usage of its data and analytics services, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB.\n\nCurrently, a lack of capacity is keeping growth restrained, as Microsoft continued to build its AI infrastructure to keep up with demand. It forecast Azure revenue to increase by 31% to 32% in constant currency in the fiscal second quarter (ended in December) and then to accelerate in the second half of its fiscal year as its prior capital expenditures (capex) kick in to add more capacity.\n\nBeyond the cloud\n\nAmazon and Microsoft, of course, are more than just their cloud businesses. Amazon is still the world's largest e-commerce and logistics company. It also owns the Prime Video streaming service.\n\nThe retail side of Amazon's business is growing solidly, with its North American sales rising by 9% last quarter, while internationally its sales rose 12%. The company is using AI and robotics to help lower costs by increasing warehouse and logics efficiencies.\n\nAmazon is also seeing strong growth in its higher-margin sponsored ad business. This led operating income growth to greatly outpace revenue growth in the quarter, with its North American segment seeing a 33% jump in operating income to $5.7 billion and its international segment seeing operating income of $1.3 billion compared to a small loss a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, is still the dominant player in workplace productivity tools with its Microsoft Office 365 suite of tools that include programs such as Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. Its Windows personal computing operating system is also a huge business. In addition, it owns LinkedIn, Xbox, GitHub, and other businesses.\n\nThe company has a robust growth opportunity with its Copilot 365 AI agents. Microsoft continues to advance what these AI pilots can do, including being able use Python in Excel with only natural language prompts. At $30 per enterprise user per month along with a 365 subscription, this is a big revenue opportunity for the company moving forward.\n\nValuation and verdict\n\nWhen looking at forward valuations, it is worth noting that Microsoft and Amazon are on different fiscal years. Amazon currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 36 times next year's analyst estimates (ending in December 2025), while Microsoft is trading at just under 32.5 times this year's analyst estimates (ending in June 2025). So Microsoft is the cheaper stock. It is also growing its revenue a bit faster (16% last quarter versus 11% for Amazon).\n\nOverall, I like both stocks heading into 2025 and think both will prove to be long-term winners. However, with a cheaper valuation, faster revenue growth, and a big potential opportunity with its AI copilots, I slightly prefer Microsoft between the two for 2025.",

Employees can access their personalized Cloud PC on any device.\n\nAt Microsoft Digital (MSD), the organization that supports, protects, and empowers Microsoft employees through technology, we\u2019re discovering new and innovative ways we can use Windows 365 to improve the daily lives of employees across Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWe see ourselves as the real Customer Zero,\u201d says Carl McBain, director of IT service management for MSD. \u201cSo, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to use new Microsoft products and services as an internal support organization.\u201d\n\nFor us, two key self-service use cases are emerging as big winners when it comes to deploying Windows 365 Cloud PCs:\n\nOur Techlink device loaner program provides temporary Cloud PCs when employees\u2019 physical hardware is under repair.\n\nAn alternative option for when employees replace their physical PCs as part of the device refresh cycle.\n\n[Discover how Microsoft protects assets by shielding virtual machines.

Employees can have a dedicated Cloud PC with all their Microsoft 365 apps ready to go, and if they\u2019re an existing employee, their OneDrive data automatically syncs to the device, similar to how we provision a physical PC with Autopilot. \u2014Dave Rodriguez, principal product manager Frictionless Devices team, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cWith Windows 365, we have SaaS-ifed the power of Windows,\u201d says Scott Manchester, vice president of Windows Cloud products. \u201cCloud PCs give organizations the benefit of elasticity across multiple dimensions\u2014scale, power, security and flexibility.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially useful in hybrid work environments or settings where users have diverse or shifting device needs. Think contractors and interns, customer-facing agents moving from kiosk to kiosk, or frequent travelers.\n\nIn Microsoft Digital, we\u2019re able to use Windows 365 Cloud PCs to quickly help our employees get up and running again when their primary PC stops working.\n\n\u201cWindows 365 is great for serving an immediate need for a dedicated PC,\u201d says Dave Rodriguez, principal product manager on the Frictionless Devices team in MSD. \u201cEmployees can have a dedicated Cloud PC with all their Microsoft 365 apps ready to go, and if they\u2019re an existing employee, their OneDrive data automatically syncs to the device, similar to how we provision a physical PC with Autopilot.\u201d\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, our goal is making things as simple as possible for our technicians and returning employees to productivity as soon as we can. \u2014Carl McBain, director of IT service management, Microsoft Digital\n\nNew approaches to PC provisioning for Microsoft employees\n\nFor us, Windows 365 doesn\u2019t just simplify processes that have the potential for frustration and inefficiency. It also unlocks opportunities for self-service, giving employees the chance to choose the technology that meets their needs in the context that suits them best.\n\n\u201cFrom an operational standpoint, our goal is making things as simple as possible for our technicians and returning employees to productivity as soon as we can,\u201d McBain says.\n\nFor our Techlink loaner program and device refresh alternative, we used the process automation capabilities of our ServiceNow enterprise installation to create a first-of-its-kind Windows 365 self-serve request solution. Powered by Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management, this solution has several benefits that include reducing operations overhead, improving user productivity, and enhancing device security by leaning into Zero Trust principles through the standard user profile for Windows 365.\n\nTechlink loaner program\n\nLike many processes, our Techlink reimaging, repair, and break-fix loaner services had to evolve rapidly because of COVID-19. Microsoft\u2019s transition to a hybrid work model meant we needed to de-emphasize physical service locations and onsite, walk-up support.\n\nThe Windows Cloud product group and MSD partnered to present Windows 365 Cloud PCs as ideal alternatives to physical retrieval options like simplified Techlink dispatch locations or digital lockers. As a result, we launched Cloud PCs as a self-service request option within our IT service catalog and made 200 Windows 365 licenses available in our initial loaner pool.\n\nWhen an employee experiences a device issue, they can initiate a service request within our standard Techlink support portal. The service request pushes them through a workflow that gathers all the necessary approvals and initiates Cloud PC provisioning. Less than an hour later, the employee receives access to a Windows 365 Cloud PC, allowing them to get to their personal files, apps, data, and settings from any device, whether it\u2019s their own or a spare machine someone shares with them.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is a massive company with so many internal sites to access,\u201d says Tony Bouker, solution delivery product manager for ServiceNow at Microsoft. \u201cSelf-service through our unified ServiceNow solution helps people find things more easily, and it also has the side effect of deflecting some requests that might otherwise come to MSD help desks.\u201d\n\nThe result? Our Techlink support specialists save time by avoiding lengthy reimaging processes for physical loaner devices, and our employees get back to work faster.\n\nDevice refresh alternative\n\nProviding Windows 365 Cloud PCs as an alternative to physical devices during the hardware refresh cycle follows a similar process, but it\u2019s driven by different needs. Employees might love the layout or familiarity of their physical devices, but the hardware is outdated. More advanced users might want to pair their device\u2019s local computing power with a Windows 365 Cloud PC that\u2019s backed by Azure to boost productivity.\n\nWhatever the reasons, spinning up a Cloud PC on one of your devices instead of buying a new one can have a positive impact on both operations and cost-savings.\n\nWhen an employee discovers they\u2019re eligible for a device refresh via their administrator or an automated invitation, they access our TechWeb service portal, where they learn about Windows 365. The portal directs them to a workflow where they can select the Cloud PC configuration and start the approval and provisioning process. After that process is complete, they\u2019ll be provisioned with a new Cloud PC in less than an hour\u2014a huge step up from the days or weeks getting a physical device replacement might take.\n\nIn our scenarios, the ServiceNow workflow launches after the employee makes their request through a questionnaire detailing parameters including device needs and region. We\u2019ve configured the workflow to check things like Cloud PC eligibility before passing the request along to the employee\u2019s approving manager and then to MSD for the provisioning stage. \u2014Tony Bouker, solution delivery product manager, ServiceNow at Microsoft\n\nLinking self-service integration to PC provisioning simplicity\n\nOn our employee enablement journey, we\u2019ve learned that choice and self-determination help drive effective self-service. So a tool like ServiceNow, which helps us realize the value of Windows 365 for employees quickly and painlessly, not only saves time and money but leads to better outcomes for employees.\n\n\u201cIn our scenarios, the ServiceNow workflow launches after the employee makes their request through a questionnaire detailing parameters including device needs and region,\u201d Bouker says. \u201cWe\u2019ve configured the workflow to check things like Cloud PC eligibility before passing the request along to the employee\u2019s approving manager and then to MSD for the provisioning stage.\u201d\n\nWe built Windows 365 to integrate easily with traditional IT workflows, and we invest in APIs to ensure we can automate processes and deliver this IT service model effectively. It\u2019s all about the simplicity of spinning Cloud PCs up and down so we can empower people who make device decisions but don\u2019t have virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) expertise. \u2014Scott Manchester, vice president, Windows Cloud products\n\nAfter the workflow, ServiceNow\u2019s integration with tools like Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365 security features makes deployment simple. The requesting employee gets placed in a Microsoft Entra ID group, and that triggers a provisioning workflow, including the creation of the Cloud PC, a final MSD review, and a notification to the Cloud PC recipient that they\u2019re all set.\n\nOur self-service workflow for provisioning Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\n(click on image to view a larger version)\n\n\u201cWe built Windows 365 to integrate easily with traditional IT workflows, and we invest in APIs to ensure we can automate processes and deliver this IT service model effectively,\u201d Manchester says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the simplicity of spinning Cloud PCs up and down so we can empower people who make device decisions but don\u2019t have virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) expertise.\u201d\n\nWindows 365 is our fastest-growing new service in MSD, with over 200 percent growth this fiscal year. We estimate that our support technicians are saving as many as three hours per request. And of course, with Cloud PCs spinning up within an hour of approval, our employees can get back to work much faster than ever before. That\u2019s something everyone can get on board with. \u2014Dave Rodriguez, principal product manager Frictionless Devices team, Microsoft Digital\n\nMany organizations don\u2019t have Microsoft\u2019s substantial IT resources or VDI experience. For those businesses, automating Windows 365 self-service Cloud PC provisioning through ServiceNow has enormous potential.\n\nAccelerating the next phase of cloud transformation\n\nSimplicity and value mean these kinds of programs are accelerating quickly. \u201cWindows 365 is our fastest-growing new service in MSD, with over 200 percent growth this fiscal year,\u201d Rodriguez says.\n\nWithin the Techlink loaner program, we\u2019ve already reached our initial 200 Cloud PC loaner capacity, and demand remains high.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that our support technicians are saving as many as three hours per request,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cAnd of course, with Cloud PCs spinning up within an hour of approval, our employees can get back to work much faster than ever before. That\u2019s something everyone can get on board with.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about creating better experiences for our employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about making something IT loves,\u201d Manchester says. \u201cIt\u2019s about making something every employee loves.\u201d\n\nHere are some tips for getting started with Windows 365 at your company:\n\nEvaluate potential use cases where Windows 365 could transform your organization, where flexibility and scalability are table stakes.\n\nUse existing tools like Intune and Microsoft Entra ID to simplify desktop management and integrate with Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\nConsider implementing a self-serve request solution to enable on-demand access to Windows 365 Cloud PCs, reducing IT admin overhead and enhancing user choice and flexibility.\n\nPilot, try the program out, and gather feedback as a gateway to general implementation.\n\nMeasure the benefits of using Cloud PCs for different use cases. Those include improved user productivity, reduced operations overhead, and improved device security.\n\nThink through all the workflow permutations you might encounter to help capture edge cases and inefficiencies.\n\nUse automation and Zero Trust principles to ensure you\u2019re capturing the benefits of Cloud PCs securely.\n\nSign up to try Windows 365 Cloud PCs: Share your info with us here if you\u2019re an enterprise customer or sign up for a trial here if you\u2019re a business customer.\n\nWant more information?

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to scale and adapt traditional on-premises SIEM offerings, leading to gaps in coverage, high costs, and inefficiencies.\n\nWith SOC teams managing an average of 3,832 alerts daily2, outdated SIEM technology increases the risk of critical threats slipping through undetected. Reflecting that: 71% of SOC practitioners worry about missing a real attack buried in a flood of alerts.3 The business stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Experts peg the average cost of a data breach at $4.88 million in 2024, which is 10% higher than last year.4\n\nIncreasingly, security leaders are turning to Microsoft Sentinel, an industry-leading, modern SIEM, to address the evolving challenges of the modern threat landscape.\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is transforming the SOC with a comprehensive solution that delivers built-in security orchestration automation and response (SOAR), user entity and behavior analytics (UEBA), threat intelligence (TI), and Generative AI (GenAI) to make threat detection, investigation, and response seamless. Further, Microsoft Sentinel empowers analysts to get started quickly with native integrations of XDR, cloud security, and exposure management in Microsoft\u2019s unified SecOps platform.\n\nThe Microsoft Sentinel advantage\n\nWhat follows are some of the reasons security pros are turning to Microsoft Sentinel.\n\nCloud flexibility and cost management. As the first cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel offers unparalleled scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. Organizations benefit from a 44% reduction in costs and a 35% lower risk of data breaches versus traditional on-premises SIEMs, resulting in up to a 234% return on investment (ROI) according to The Total Economic Impact\u2122 Of Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft Sentinel protects the entire digital environment, collecting and analyzing disparate security data from applications logs to vulnerability alerts\u2014and everything in between\u2014using over 350+ out-of-the-box connectors. The solution makes it easy to deploy custom connectors with its codeless connector platform, enabling customers to achieve a 93% reduction in configuration time.\n\n\u201c[Microsoft] provided us with a significant discount in terms of what we were facing as opposed to Splunk.\u201d \u2013 Microsoft Sentinel customer, healthcare\n\nComprehensive coverage. Microsoft Sentinel is the only fully functional SIEM solution that is built into a security operations platform that combines the full capabilities of SIEM, extended detection and response (XDR), exposure management, GenAI, and global threat intelligence. Together, this streamlines the analyst experience with a single list of prioritized incidents, automated enrichment of alerts with all relevant data, built-in response actions, and a single hunting experience. This delivers unmatched efficiency, enhanced protection, and greater insights for investigations, reducing time spent training analysts on different tools and minimizing context switching during investigations. By bringing these capabilities all together, 70% of security practitioners said Microsoft Sentinel was more intuitive than competitive SIEMs, according to research from Microsoft.\n\n\u201cIt integrates with everything super easily\u2014it\u2019s pretty seamless.

Construction at those two sites is paused.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced plans to invest $3.3 billion to build an artificial intelligence data center on land once slated for development by Foxconn in Mount Pleasant. At that time, Microsoft pledged to bring more than 2,000 union construction jobs to the area.\n\nThe company broke ground in January 2024 as part of an initial plan. Since first announcing its plans, the company has steadily purchased land in Mount Pleasant, and now it owns almost 1,900 acres.\n\nPlans for Microsoft\u2019s data center campus came years after Foxconn promised to build an LCD screen manufacturing center in Mount Pleasant that would create 13,000 jobs. Now, Foxconn says it employs more than 1,000 people and builds data servers in the village.\n\nWhile work on Microsoft\u2019s development has slowed, Ryan said village officials \u201chave no reason to believe\u201d the pause will affect the \u201coverall scope or nature\u201d of the project.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Microsoft being transparent with Village leaders about the construction timeline for its Mount Pleasant data centers,\u201d he said.",

Two of the three shortcomings reside in Power Platform's OData Web API Filter, while the third vulnerability is rooted in the FetchXML API.\n\nThe root cause of the first vulnerability is the lack of access control on the OData Web API Filter, thereby allowing access to the contacts table that holds sensitive information such as full names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, and password hashes.\n\nA threat actor could then weaponize the flaw to perform a boolean-based search to extract the complete hash by guessing each character of the hash sequentially until the correct value is identified.\n\n\"For example, we start by sending startswith(adx_identity_passwordhash, 'a') then startswith(adx_identity_passwordhash , 'aa') then startswith(adx_identity_passwordhash , 'ab') and so on until it returns results that start with ab,\" Stratus Security said.\n\n\"We continue this process until the query returns results that start with 'ab'. Eventually, when no further characters return a valid result, we know we have obtained the complete value.\"\n\nThe second vulnerability, on the other hand, lies in using the orderby clause in the same API to obtain the data from the necessary database table column (e.g., EMailAddress1, which refers to the primary email address for the contact).\n\nLastly, Stratus Security also found that the FetchXML API could be exploited in conjunction with the contacts table to access restricted columns using an orderby query.\n\n\"When utilizing the FetchXML API, an attacker can craft an orderby query on any column, completely bypassing the existing access controls,\" it said. \"Unlike the previous vulnerabilities, this method does not necessitate the orderby to be in descending order, adding a layer of flexibility to the attack.\"\n\nAn attacker weaponizing these flaws could, therefore, compile a list of password hashes and emails, then crack the passwords or sell the data.\n\n\"The discovery of vulnerabilities in the Dynamics 365 and Power Apps API underscores a critical reminder: cybersecurity requires constant vigilance, especially for large companies that hold so much data like Microsoft,\" Stratus Security said.",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s recent deployment of Windows 11 to 190,000 devices across the company is enabling its employees to work smarter and stay better connected.\n\nMicrosoft Digital, the organization that powers, protects, and transforms the company, completed the rollout in five weeks\u2014the fastest deployment of an operating system in company history\u2014without disruption.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the data, our time to deploy and the number of support contacts, Windows 11 is the most successful Windows deployment in our history,\u201d says Nathalie D\u2019Hers, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of Microsoft Digital. \u201cFor a major release, it was so straightforward and fast that it was almost a non-event. Windows 11 raises the bar for all future deployments.\u201d\n\nGetting Windows 11 to employees in a fast, hassle-free way was crucial. Ensuring rollouts are free of disruption makes a big difference for Microsoft employees and\u2014because employee feedback gets rolled into the products\u2014for customers.\n\nA device is your connection to your work experience, especially when you can\u2019t go into the office. Your device shouldn\u2019t get in the way of what you\u2019re doing, so we wanted to make sure our employees had a good upgrade experience. \u2014Nathalie D\u2019Hers, corporate vice president, Microsoft Digital\n\n\u201cMicrosoft employees are very vocal when it comes to giving us feedback about our products and features and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d D\u2019Hers says. \u201cIf the product isn\u2019t working well, we hear about it early on, and that wasn\u2019t the case this time. When we deployed Windows 11, we received very few requests for support\u2014that\u2019s an important indicator of product quality for us.\u201d\n\nMaking deployment seamless for employees\n\nA good Windows deployment is frictionless, where employees are not inconvenienced or prohibited from using their devices, apps, or important features.\n\n\u201cA device is your connection to your work experience, especially when you can\u2019t go into the office,\u201d D\u2019Hers says. \u201cYour device shouldn\u2019t get in the way of what you\u2019re doing, so we wanted to make sure our employees had a good upgrade experience.\u201d\n\nThe experience of moving from Windows 10 to Windows 11 was so smooth, it felt more like an update than an upgrade. \u2014Sean MacDonald, partner director of program management, Microsoft Digital\n\nThe Microsoft Digital team knew improvements in Windows 11, including an intuitive and improved user interface, would help employees stay connected and work smarter. That made a straightforward deployment\u2014where critical business applications weren\u2019t risked and security wasn\u2019t compromised\u2014even more important.\n\n\u201cIt always starts with the user, the employee, the person\u2014that\u2019s who we center around,\u201d says Sean MacDonald, partner director of program management with the Microsoft Digital team who oversaw the deployment of Windows 11 at Microsoft. \u201cWindows 11 does a great job of taking that perspective, it\u2019s about the user, which is key to our employee experience.\u201d\n\nHelping to make this deployment frictionless were familiar processes that had been utilized for Windows 10 releases. \u201cThe experience of moving from Windows 10 to Windows 11 was so smooth, it felt more like an update than an upgrade,\u201d MacDonald says.\n\nThere was no disruption to business, just a download that occurred in the background, an alert telling the employee that their device was ready, and a quick restart to finish installing the new operating system. As soon as 20 minutes later, the employee was up and running in Windows 11. The device owner could also schedule the upgrade to take place during non-work hours\u2014when they logged in the next day, they were using the new operating system.\n\nFor a transcript, please view the video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40B99JJpaUo, select the \u201cMore actions\u201d button (three dots icon) below the video, and then select \u201cShow transcript.\u201d\n\nWangui McKelvey and Nathalie D\u2019Hers speak about Microsoft\u2019s internal Windows 11 upgrade. McKelvey is the general manager of Microsoft 365 and D\u2019Hers is Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of Microsoft Digital.\n\nConnecting with employees\n\nCommunications played a key part in Microsoft\u2019s disruption-free rollout.\n\nWindows 11 has specific hardware requirements, which meant not every device at Microsoft would be part of the deployment.\n\n\u201cMost devices were eligible but letting everyone know about hardware requirements was an early step,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cSince Windows 10 and Windows 11 work in tandem with no additional overhead, we\u2019re able to seamlessly co-manage both upgraded and non-upgraded devices until all of our older Windows 10 devices are replaced.\u201d\n\nSharing this fact with employees across Microsoft eased anxieties.\n\nFrom that point on, it was about sharing clear and concise messaging that encouraged employees to upgrade and provide feedback. Communication plans emphasized empowering employees across Microsoft to submit comments through Feedback Hub, a tool where users can voice and upvote suggestions. Elsewhere, Microsoft support teams readied their own listening systems to resolve queries and to report feedback to the product group.\n\nEven with many channels open, few issues were reported.\n\n\u201cWe saw no uptick in support contacts,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cIf the only noise is people talking about features, that\u2019s the sign of a good deployment.\u201d\n\nA better deployment experience\n\nMicrosoft Digital encounters many of the same challenges other IT organizations face. But with the deployment of Windows 11, an established playbook of trusted practices along with modern solutions, like Windows Update for Business, converged for a streamlined experience.\n\nA large part of this is due to the Windows Update for Business deployment service.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly Windows-as-a-Service,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cWindows Update for Business deployment service is easy to control, highly compliant, and adoption is straightforward.\u201d\n\nWindows Update for Business deployment service combines two workstreams into one, which sped up Microsoft\u2019s internal deployment of Windows 11. Instead of building separate deployment plans for Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) devices, Windows Update for Business deployment service allowed the team to establish a single strategy for the entire environment. Within the service, Microsoft Digital was able to handle exclusions, automatically stage deployment waves, and bypass devices that were ineligible for the upgrade.\n\nOther tools, like Windows Update for Business reports, further reduced the workload placed on the team. Using Update Compliance, the organization quickly and easily analyzed the device population for hardware eligibility. Data gathered from Update Compliance and Microsoft Endpoint Manager informed Microsoft Digital of a device\u2019s deployment status, giving clear visibility to which ones had moved to Windows 11.\n\nOver the course of five weeks, Microsoft Digital seamlessly rolled out Windows 11 to all eligible employee devices.\n\nSuccess measured in outcomes\n\nThe deployment of Windows 11 represents the right chemistry of technology and expertise working together for a harmonious experience. Employees at Microsoft quickly and easily upgraded to Windows 11 on their schedules. Microsoft Digital utilized tools like Windows Update for Business deployment service to streamline familiar processes.\n\n\u201cWe had to target the devices that could run Windows 11, but we have a plan to ramp up and refresh all devices as we go,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cWe have a path to Windows 11 for everyone.\u201d\n\nWindows 11 has done a good job of keeping the user in mind. The aesthetics are simple. The user experience is familiar but improved, making it easier to complete the common tasks and activities I do every day. \u2014Nathalie D\u2019Hers, corporate vice president, Microsoft Digital\n\nThanks to its design, Microsoft Digital will be able to easily co-manage Windows 11 and Windows 10 side-by-side. Microsoft designed Windows 11 to ensure backward compatibility with Windows 10, so apps remain compatible, removing another challenge typically found during the release of new operating systems.\n\nThe transformation continues\n\nThe success of the deployment of Windows 11 validates Microsoft Digital\u2019s approach to new features and product releases, which empowers people to succeed while minimizing disruption.\n\n\u201cWindows 11 has done a good job of keeping the user in mind,\u201d D\u2019Hers says. \u201cThe aesthetics are simple. The user experience is familiar but improved, making it easier to complete the common tasks and activities I do every day.\u201d\n\nWith new functionality, like snap assist and docking, users can work more efficiently. Device hardware baselines, including a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM) requirement, enhance the security of devices and create better hardware-to-software integration in Windows 11. Transport Layer Security, an encryption protocol for transferring data over a network, empowers Microsoft Digital to perform IT functions remotely without fear of a compromise.\n\nAll of this improves how Microsoft employees can stay safe and productive.\n\n\u201cAn important part of our Customer Zero role is to provide our employees and other internal users with the best products and services as early as possible,\u201d D\u2019Hers says.",

These updates, including bug fixes and security enhancements from the previous month, are known as \u201cPatch Tuesday.\u201d The monthly update is an important opportunity to ensure that security features and applications are up to date.\n\nMicrosoft details the official Patch Tuesday release in their Security Update Guide. Below, TechRepublic explores its purpose, how it works, and how you can prepare for it.\n\nWhat is the purpose of Patch Tuesday?\n\nPatch Tuesday is designed to collect and release many enterprise software updates simultaneously. While some updates are urgent enough to require immediate attention throughout the month, non-urgent or quality-of-life fixes are consolidated for release on Patch Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re an IT administrator or a general user, Windows monthly updates provide you with the security fixes to help keep your devices protected\u2014as well as enhancements based on your feedback,\u201d wrote Microsoft Senior Director of Communications Chris Morrissey in a 2023 blog post.\n\nPatch Tuesday is technically known as Microsoft\u2019s \u201cB\u201d release,\u201d as opposed to \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d releases, which occur during the third and fourth weeks of the month. Other companies, including Adobe, have followed Microsoft\u2019s lead in rolling out mass patches on the second Tuesday of each month.\n\nWhat to know\n\nTechRepublic covers Patch Tuesday each month, including the latest updates on Dec. 10.\n\nIn December, Microsoft patched 16 critical vulnerabilities and at least 70 vulnerabilities overall.\n\nThese patches are exclusively for Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices.\n\nHow does Patch Tuesday work?\n\nAdministrators and users can access these updates through various tools, including:\n\nWindows Update\n\nWindows Update for Business\n\nMicrosoft Intune\n\nMicrosoft Configuration Manager\n\nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS)\n\nThe Microsoft Update Catalog\n\nBefore rolling out patches across an organization, administrators should test them in an isolated environment and a small test group. Additionally, administrators should have a rollback plan in place if issues arise.\n\nSEE: Microsoft power users may want to watch for monthly PowerToys updates.\n\nSince exploits from the previous month are detailed on Patch Tuesday, the following day often sees a spike in copycat attacks targeting unpatched systems. Organizations should prioritize applying critical security updates to mitigate this risk.\n\nAs of the February 2023 commercial control update, administrators have some control over which patches to immediately apply. This allows for flexibility in managing updates that introduce new capabilities, remove existing ones, or significantly alter user-facing features, such as the start menu.\n\nWhat is the difference between Patch Tuesday and out-of-band updates?\n\nAlong with the letter naming system for releases, you might hear the term \u201cout-of-band release\u201d when it comes to patches. Out-of-band releases are not sent out on a schedule like the planned monthly patches. Instead, atypical updates may be sent out at any time to address an ongoing security or quality issue.\n\nHow can I prepare for Patch Tuesday updates?\n\nAdmins should have a process for applying Patch Tuesday updates, but these processes will differ based on the organization\u2019s size and needs. Some patches should be applied right away \u2014 especially with security fixes for backdoors that are being actively exploited. Admins might want to wait to deploy non-critical patches in case Microsoft issues any revisions.",

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$422 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Microsoft is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $561.17, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Microsoft\u2019s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it\u2019s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.\n\nCan we expect growth from Microsoft?\n\nNasdaqGS:MSFT Earnings and Revenue Growth January 1st 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 50%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since MSFT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on MSFT for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy MSFT. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.",

The investigation examines whether Microsoft\u2019s business practices violated federal law, particularly in the context of bundling software licenses and cybersecurity services.\n\nBundling Tactics and Federal Impact\n\nThe scrutiny stems from actions Microsoft undertook after a series of cyberattacks heightened the need for robust cybersecurity across federal agencies. ProPublica reports that Microsoft offered to upgrade existing software bundles for free temporarily, integrating advanced cybersecurity features into packages that included widely used products such as Word, Outlook, and Excel. Alongside these upgrades, the company provided consultants to facilitate installation. This arrangement was embraced across large portions of the federal government, including all branches of the Defense Department.\n\nRelated: Microsoft Demands FTC Investigation into Alleged Antitrust Probe Leak\n\nOnce the free trial period ended, agencies began paying for the upgraded services, effectively locking them into the Microsoft ecosystem. Former sales leaders involved in the initiative likened this strategy to a \u201cfree sample\u201d approach, designed to ensure long-term dependency on Microsoft\u2019s products. This tactic, according to ProPublica, displaced existing cybersecurity providers and reduced market opportunities for competitors like Amazon Web Services, as agencies transitioned to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform.\n\nLegal Concerns and Internal Scrutiny\n\nExperts cited by ProPublica have raised questions about whether these practices adhered to federal regulations governing contracting and competition. The bundling and subsequent dominance in the federal market may have undermined competitive fairness, potentially violating antitrust laws. Notably, the report highlighted that even some of Microsoft\u2019s legal advisors expressed concerns about the deals\u2019 compliance with antitrust regulations.\n\nIndustry and Regulatory Implications\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s practices not only raised alarms among competitors but also drew attention to the broader implications for market competition in the technology sector. The FTC\u2019s investigation signals a growing focus on the competitive landscape shaped by dominant tech companies. If violations are substantiated, this could lead to significant regulatory actions and reforms.\n\nSource: ProPublica",

            "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution will be an ongoing focus for investors, given its transformational potential. However, the winners and losers in the market could change rapidly in this fast-evolving space.\n\nIn a recent interview, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella mentioned something that could be concerning for 2023 and 2024's big winner Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has run away with a lot of AI value gains thus far. But Nadella's statement could be very bullish for a certain commodity whose associated stocks often come with high dividends for passive income.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\n\"Not chip constrained\" anymore\n\nEarlier this month, Nadella appeared on a podcast with venture capitalists Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley. The wide-ranging, hour-plus interview dealt with AI. But while the interview was largely bullish on the prospects of AI broadly, one topic did come up that seemed to put a damper on sentiment around Nvidia.\n\nWhen asked if Microsoft was still supply constrained for Nvidia chips as it was throughout 2024, Nadella noted:\n\nI am power [constrained], yes, I'm not chip supply constrained ... We were definitely constrained in '24. What we have told the street is that's why we are optimistic about the first half of '25 which is the rest of our fiscal year. And then after that I think we'll be in better shape going into 2026 and so we have good line of sight.\n\nSince that statement, Nvidia's stock has been somewhat weak. That's not surprising. Since 2023, there has been far more demand for Nvidia's chips than it could supply, leading to big revenue increases and high margins for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). And Microsoft has been Nvidia's biggest customer by far, with some estimating Microsoft accounted for 20% of Nvidia's sales over the past year.\n\nOn recent earnings calls, Microsoft noted it had been supply constrained; otherwise, its Azure cloud growth, especially for AI workloads, would have been even faster. So now, Nadella's hinting those supply constraints may be coming to an end could mean one of three things: Demand for AI is slowing; chip supply is improving; or a bit of both is happening.\n\nAre AI improvements slowing? Is Maia ramping?\n\nThere have been some rumbles that improvements to AI large language models may be harder to come by, and the pace of innovation may slow down. These rumors have been denied by some major industry participants, but they could have an effect on AI chip purchases. After all, if the projected returns on AI experimentation and applications are slow to show up, demand could slow down. Even if Microsoft has plenty of demand from enterprise customers, it's possible that smaller buyers of GPUs, such as mini-cloud CoreWeave or others that supply capacity to riskier AI start-ups, may be seeing less demand.\n\nStill, most companies in the space are still pretty bullish on AI demand. One other possibility is that Microsoft sees in-house-designed Maia accelerators ramping to greater volumes in mid-2025. Microsoft was well behind the other cloud giants that have been engineering their own custom chips for years and that use them internally in order to not be as dependent on Nvidia's expensive GPUs. This is why Microsoft buys so many more Nvidia GPUs than its cloud-computing rivals.\n\nMicrosoft, however, first introduced its Maia accelerators and Cobalt central processing units (CPUs) just at the end of 2023, one year ago. So with a year for Microsoft to hone its design and perhaps ramp up a new manufacturing supply, Nadella may merely be seeing Maia chips ramping to higher volumes in the new year, alleviating its chip constraints.\n\nNadella's commentary about being energy constrained seems to indicate demand is still there, at least for Microsoft's enterprise customer base, and this could be more of a Maia ramp than a downturn in AI chip demand.\n\nCould natural gas stocks beat Nvidia in 2025?\n\nConcerning AI opportunities that could present themselves in 2025, let's turn to the phrase that Microsoft is \"power constrained.\"\n\nIt has been posited that the U.S. will have unprecedented demand for electricity in the years ahead, with the growth of that demand outstripping that of the past 10 years, in large part due to AI data centers.\n\nWhat types of clean energy can brought on quickly to meet demand? Renewables will no doubt have a role here, but renewables don't run 24/7, and solar arrays and wind farms may be constructed in faraway places that need to be connected to the grid.\n\nIn addition, some of the biggest 2024 winners were nuclear stocks. Microsoft itself inked a deal to bring on power from the shuttered Three Mile Island facility to feed its AI data centers for 20 years. However, shuttered nuclear facilities take a long time to get up and running. Three Mile Island itself won't be able to return to service until 2028. So, imagine the cost and time lags to get new nuclear facilities fully operational. With nuclear-oriented stocks having rocketed higher this year, there could be some disappointment in the offing.\n\nFamous hedge fund manager David Tepper also doesn't think the AI revolution can be satisfied by nuclear for all these reasons. That leaves only one other option to quickly deploy at existing or easy-to-build facilities: natural gas. Back in September, Tepper warned, \"If you're going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you're going to have to use natural gas.\"\n\nThat sentiment was echoed recently by Morgan Stanley energy sell-side analyst Stephen Byrd. Last year, Byrd predicted the rise of nuclear stocks, which came to pass. This year, Byrd expects natural gas stocks to benefit from the inevitable demand to provide power to AI data centers. He even sees new natural gas facilities being built on the same land as AI data centers and connecting directly to them, thereby bypassing the grid and the long transmission-approval process that comes with traditional power deals.\n\nIf natural gas sees a new surge of demand, the sector's biggest stocks could do very well.\n\nThe quintessential natural gas play\n\nIf Nvidia is the quintessential AI stock, EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) might be the quintessential natural gas stock. EQT has amassed the largest acreage in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of the Appalachian Basin, which is home to the largest, low-cost reserves of natural gas in the U.S.\n\nWith the most acreage and lowest drilling costs in the Appalachian Basin, EQT just lowered its break-even costs even more with the acquisition of midstream company Equitrans. The deal closed at the end of July.\n\nThe Equitrans acquisition turns EQT into the only vertically integrated play in the Basin, not only with production but also with gathering, processing, storage, and pipelines. This acquisition should be beneficial in several ways. EQT will now not have to pay a pipeline operator margins to take away its gas, lowering its break-even costs to the lowest of its peer group. In fact, EQT says that post-acquisition, its break-even price is now about $2 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu), which is down from about $2.50 for EQT as a stand-alone corporation and roughly equal to the lowest prices seen for natural gas during the pandemic, as well as during a downturn earlier this year.\n\nSo while most natural gas companies have to hedge natural gas prices to protect solvency in a low price scenario, EQT says it will hedge a lot less after 2025 when its current hedges roll off. This is because EQT is confident it can break even at low prices, whereas competitors can't afford to operate at those levels. Not having as much downside protection means EQT can realize higher prices should the price of natural gas surge, as it won't have capped upside. And if the AI revolution, coal replacement, and LNG export markets increase, there could be substantially higher natural gas prices through the rest of the decade.\n\nWhile natural gas prices have just about doubled off their lows to just under $4 per MMBtu today, they did go over $9 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Trading at just 18 times 2025 earnings expectations, EQT could be one of the biggest \"AI winners\" in the year ahead -- maybe even bigger, stock appreciation-wise, than Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in EQT right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in EQT, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and EQT wasn\u2019t one of them.

This marks a shift from AIs that just talk about doing things to AIs that can actually do them.\n\nAd\n\nUnlike traditional language models like GPT-4o, which mainly process and generate text, LAMs can turn user requests into real actions - whether that's operating software or controlling robots. While the concept isn't entirely new, this is the first model specifically trained to work with Microsoft Office products.\n\nShare Recommend our article Share\n\nLAMs can understand what users want from various types of input - text, voice, or images - and turn those requests into detailed step-by-step plans. What's more, they can adjust their approach based on what's happening in real-time.\n\nTraining an LLM to take action\n\nBuilding a LAM involves four main steps. First, the model learns to break tasks into logical steps. Then it learns from more advanced AI like GPT-4o to turn those plans into actions. After that, it explores new solutions on its own, even tackling problems that stumped other AI systems. Finally, the system gets fine-tuned through reward-based training.\n\nAd\n\nAd THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. \u2713 Weekly \u2713 Free \u2713 Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty\n\nFor their test case, they built a LAM based on Mistral-7B and let it loose in a Word test environment. It completed tasks successfully 71% of the time, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 63% success rate (without visual information).\n\nThe LAM was also much faster, needing only 30 seconds per task compared to GPT-4o's 86 seconds. However, when GPT-4o got visual information, it was more accurate, with a 75.5% success rate.\n\nBuilding the training data\n\nThe team started with 29,000 task-plan pairs collected from Microsoft documentation, wikiHow articles, and Bing searches. To expand this further, they used GPT-4o to transform simple tasks into more complex ones. A basic task like \"Create a drop-down list\" evolved into \"Create a dependent drop-down list where the first selection filters the options in the second list.\"\n\nThis \"data evolving\" strategy helped them grow their dataset to 76,000 pairs - a 150% increase. From all these examples, about 2,000 successful action sequences made it into the final training set.\n\nThe system still faces several hurdles: there are valid concerns about AI actions going wrong, regulatory questions that need answers, and technical limitations that make it difficult to scale up or adapt to different applications.\n\nDespite these challenges, the researchers believe LAMs represent an important shift in AI development and say these \"Large Action Models\" mark a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Instead of AI systems that just understand and generate text, we might soon have AI assistants that can actively help us complete real-world tasks.\n\nAd",

Although that moment has passed, we\u2019re republishing it here so you can see what our thinking and experience was like at the time.]\n\nHybrid meetings aren\u2019t new. Microsoft is a global company, and even before the COVID-19 pandemic, teammates dialed into conference rooms from all over the world. But when everyone started working remotely in March 2020, all our meetings moved to Microsoft Teams. And the truth is, all the amazing features available in Teams changed how we think about meetings. We\u2019ve come to rely on technology to provide everyone an equal opportunity to be seen and heard.\n\nMicrosoft has fully embraced being a flexible workplace, which means that hybrid meetings\u2014where some people join remotely and others join from a Microsoft worksite\u2014are increasingly common.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nFrom May to November 2022, the number of monthly hybrid meetings we\u2019ve held at Microsoft increased nearly 92 percent. To put that in perspective, during those six months, we held nearly 2 million hybrid meetings here at Microsoft.\n\nWith that in mind, how are we making sure our hybrid meetings are inclusive and effective for everyone involved, no matter how they\u2019re joining? In theory, it\u2019s simple:\n\nBring remote-meeting etiquette to the meeting room\n\nAgree on and adopt new best practices that support hybrid\n\nYou\u2019ll notice these focus on behavior. We\u2019re not asking people to use new technology; we\u2019re asking them to change how they use existing technology. And as most of us know from personal experience, changing behavior is hard.\n\nIn Microsoft Digital, we power, protect, and transform the employee experience and provide the blueprint for customers and partners to follow. We wondered, how could we help people at Microsoft shift habits and change how they think about meetings to build a healthy meeting culture?\n\nChanging behavior is hard. Gamification can help.\n\nEighty percent of US workers believe game-based learning is more engaging than other types of training. When Avanade (a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft) gamified sales training, the region with the highest program participation had 33 percent higher sales. There\u2019s science behind the benefits of play-based learning, too. Psychiatrist Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play, has said, \u201cNothing lights up the brain like play. Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum, puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe\u2014the executive portion\u2014helps contextual memory be developed.\u201d\n\nSo we teamed up with the Minecraft Education team to explore whether we might develop a Minecraft learning experience about hybrid meetings. Minecraft: Education Edition is a game-based learning platform used by millions of teachers and students. Learners can explore a wide range of subjects in immersive, blocky worlds including computer science, reading and history, and sustainability.\n\nIn the past, the Minecraft team has collaborated with partners including Microsoft\u2019s Inclusive Hiring team, Sustainability, and Real Estate & Facilities on Minecraft worlds that illuminate key topics or support company initiatives. We pitched the concept of a hybrid learning map to the Minecraft Education team, and they were immediately supportive.\n\nHaving a deep background in gaming, I am very aware of the magic that can happen during gameplay. When Laura came to us with the idea for a game, we wanted to understand if it would resonate with our large and diverse internal audience. After a couple of conversations about the value of gameplay in learning, and the broad appeal of Minecraft, I was all in. \u2014Sara Bush, principal PM manager, Seamless Teamwork team\n\n\u201cFiguring out how to portray a business setting in Minecraft (with mobs!) sounded like a fun challenge,\u201d says Bryan Bonham, senior business program manager for Minecraft Education.\n\nIt was a natural next step to partner with the team at Microsoft that is trying to help employees get more out of the many hybrid meetings that they now attend every day.\n\n\u201cHaving a deep background in gaming, I am very aware of the magic that can happen during gameplay,\u201d says Sara Bush, principal PM manager on MDEE\u2019s Seamless Teamwork team. \u201cWhen Laura came to us with the idea for a game, we wanted to understand if it would resonate with our large and diverse internal audience.

I think adding some humor helps when learning something new. Best not to take yourself too seriously, we all make mistakes as we learn! \u2014Bryan Bonham, Senior Business Program Manager, Minecraft Education\n\nThis was a first-time collaboration between Microsoft Digital and Minecraft and the first time Minecraft was used within Microsoft to support employee learning.\n\nFrom idea to execution\n\nThe concept we landed on was \u201cHybrid Hero: The game where the fate of a meeting lies with you!\u201d The player experiences different scenarios and must make the right choices to ensure their meeting is effective and inclusive. We based the game\u2019s script and decision points on the Microsoft Teams Meeting Guide, which is full of research-based guidance.\n\nEarly on, we decided that humor was key.\n\n\u201cRemote and hybrid work has led to some funny moments for all of us,\u201d Bonham says. \u201cI think adding some humor helps when learning something new. Best not to take yourself too seriously. We all make mistakes as we learn!\u201d\n\nWe also wanted to make sure Hybrid Hero was accessible and fun for everyone at Microsoft even if they\u2019ve never played Minecraft before. In every round of testing, we looked at the game from a newbie mindset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played Minecraft before but figured that if preschoolers are playing it, I can surely play it, too,\u201d says senior program manager Chanda Jensen, who supports meeting technology for Seamless Teamwork. \u201cMost of the game was intuitive and really easy to get the hang of, and it was a fun way to teach hybrid-meeting best practices. As an added bonus, my kids now think my job is \u2018cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn early testing, 93 percent of players responded positively to the game as did 88 percent of first-time players. Making sure the game was beginner-friendly paid off.\n\nLet the games begin\n\nSince it launched in September 2022, Hybrid Hero has been played by Microsoft employees in 40 countries, and we\u2019ve heard from global teams who\u2019ve used it as both a learning opportunity and team morale event. The game\u2019s internal marketing campaign has garnered over 350,000 impressions on Yammer, helping to spread the word about hybrid-meeting best practices.\n\nHybrid Hero was truly a \u201cOne Microsoft\u201d effort, requiring all team members to think outside the box and approach the project with a growth mindset. Employees are eager for innovative learning opportunities, and we\u2019ll continue to do our best to innovate and create exceptional experiences for them.\n\nFor more information about teaching and learning with Minecraft: Education Edition, visit education.minecraft.net. Anyone can download a few demos of the game and try lessons like the Minecraft Hour of Code. Microsoft employees can sign in with their corporate email account to access the full game features and content.\n\nAfter years of remote-only meetings, employees need to shift habits and change how they think about meetings to create a healthy meeting culture.\n\nFor hybrid meetings to be inclusive and effective, people need to be aware of and follow hybrid-meeting best practices.\n\nGamification and play-based learning are often more engaging and effective for employees.\n\nEmployees are eager for innovative learning experiences.\n\nWant more information?

This is because these domains will soon be unavailable due to the bankruptcy and upcoming closure of CDN provider Edgio.\n\nSpecifically, the domains \u201cdotnetcli.azureedge.net\u201d and \u201cdotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\u201d will go offline in the coming months. This may disrupt the functionality of projects that depend on these domains.\n\nThis problem affects developers using .NET installers that reside on the affected domains, among others. It also affects organizations using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps with custom pipelines calling these domains. Also, the issue affects Docker users and script users with files and code that reference the retired domains.\n\nNecessary switch\n\n\u201cWe maintain multiple Content Delivery Network (CDN) instances for delivering .NET builds. Some end at azureedge.net. These domains are hosted by Edgio, which will soon cease operations due to bankruptcy. We are forced to switch to a new CDN.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will use new domains in the future,\u201d Microsoft explained. \u201cIt is possible that azureedge.net domains will experience short-term downtime. We expect these domains to be permanently discontinued in the first few months of 2025.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft advises developers to look for references to azureedge.net and dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net in their code, scripts and configurations, and replace the references with builds.dotnet.microsoft.com. During the transition, the new domains will be supported by a combination of Edgio, Akamai and Azure Front Door. This is while Microsoft works to consolidate the final distribution model with other CDN providers.\n\nKey actions for CI/CD teams\n\nCI/CD teams should ensure that GitHub Actions (actions/setup-dotnet) and Azure DevOps tasks are updated to versions that support the new domains. Updates to Azure DevOps Server are expected in early 2025.\n\nIn addition, given the use of new CDN domains, even if configurations are updated automatically, firewalls must be set up to allow traffic from the new locations (builds.dotnet.microsoft.com and ci.dot.net).\n\nUnfortunate timing\n\nMicrosoft acknowledges that the timing is unfortunate. Affected users must take action during the holiday season. That\u2019s when many IT teams are understaffed. When asked why Microsoft could not simply take over the domains and continue to use them, Rich Lander, Program Manager of .NET at Microsoft, replied that it could not.\n\n\u201cWe asked the same question. We were told that option was not available. We have no further information on that,\u201d Lander explained. The answer is confusing, as Microsoft\u2019s Scott Hanselman confirmed that Microsoft has already acquired ownership of the domains, stating that \u201cno other party will ever have access to the use of these domains.\u201d\n\nOwning the domains and preventing reuse minimizes the chance of a supply chain compromise for those who do not migrate their applications. However, this does not explain the sudden rush to migrate domains and the risks of operational disruptions.\n\nLearn more\n\nIf you are affected, you can follow the issue more closely and view status updates on this GitHub page.",

This feature allows customers to utilize NVIDIA A100 GPUs and NVIDIA T4 GPUs in a serverless environment, providing scaling and flexibility for real-time custom model inferencing and other machine-learning tasks.\n\nAzure Container Apps is a fully-managed serverless container service that allows developers to deploy, run, and scale containerized applications without managing infrastructure. With serverless GPUs, they can run GPU-powered applications without managing the underlying infrastructure and benefit from scale-to-zero capabilities; resources can dynamically scale based on demand, reducing idle costs. In addition, they can benefit from per-second billing for GPU usage with data governance that keeps information within container boundaries, flexible options with NVIDIA A100 and T4 GPUs, and a managed serverless platform for deploying their own AI models.\n\nAccording to the company, Azure\u2019s serverless GPUs excel in use cases like real-time AI inferencing, machine learning model deployments, and high-performance computing tasks. The platform ensures smooth integration into existing Azure workflows.\n\n(Source: Azure Blogs on Apps blog post)\n\nDuring an Ignite Session of Azure Functions Flex Consumption and GPUs, Simon Jakesch, principal product manager Azure Container Apps at Microsoft, said:\n\nAnyone who has used serverless or in combination with Azure Container Apps has found it to be extremely powerful. This technology brings the same power to GPU use, making GPUs easily accessible.\n\nMicrosoft is not the sole provider of GPU capabilities for accelerating workloads such as real-time AI inferencing and machine learning model deployments. Others are Modal, RunPod, Replicate, Baseten, Koyeb and Fal. Furthermore, Google Cloud Run supports NVIDIA L4 GPUs for real-time AI inferencing.\n\nLars Wurm, a platform leader in Core Infrastructure at Inter Ikea, posted on LinkedIn:\n\nWith the introduction of serverless GPUs using Azure Container Apps, several new workloads and usage scenarios are enabled, shaping the offering into a one-stop shop for container workloads. This is particularly beneficial when workloads do not rely on committed ACA instances.\n\nAnd in an NVIDIA corporate blog post, Dave Salvator wrote:\n\nServerless GPUs allow development teams to focus more on innovation and less on infrastructure management. With per-second billing and scale-to-zero capabilities, customers pay only for the compute they use, helping ensure resource utilization is both economical and efficient. NVIDIA is also working with Microsoft to bring NVIDIA NIM microservices to serverless NVIDIA GPUs in Azure to optimize AI model performance.\n\nServerless GPUs are available in a select set of Azure regions during the public preview phase.

The success is in no small part due to the efforts at Microsoft to slam shut any exploitable openings in the Operating System (OS) that hackers, identity thieves and malware writers could take advantage of. Sadly, those efforts will end on October 14th when Microsoft stops updating the venerable OS for free, leaving hundreds of millions of computers vulnerable to attack.\n\nClearly an undisguised method of coaxing millions to move to Windows 11 , this is nothing new to those with older Windows 7, Chromebook and Mac computers shut out of updates. The bottom line is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have a Windows 10 desktop, notebook or even a Microsoft Surface tablet, the prospect of new attacks being ignored can feel like a three alarm fire starting in your computer.\n\nFear not, here are five things you can do to extinguish the blaze before it starts.\n\nUpgrade to Windows 11 \u2026 if you can\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nThe end is near and the most obvious solution to the Windows 10 security dilemma is to quit procrastinating and upgrade to Windows 11 which promises many years of security updates.

Unfortunately, the processor on my last Win 10 system doesn\u2019t meet the rather severe Win 11 minimum requirements.\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft/Asus | Remix by Nick Bush)\n\nThe snag could just as easily be the lack of a security-minded Trusted Platform Module 2.0 ( TPM ).

There are several tricks to fool the Microsoft installer into thinking it\u2019s OK to go ahead and run Windows 11. In fact, it seems every third person online has a way of loading Windows 11 on an older PC. Most revolve around bypassing the requirements portion of the Registry or using a free utility like Rufus (great for adding an SSD to your Steam Deck too) to put the installation files onto a bootable USB drive.\n\nNo surprise, Microsoft is warning about potential security and stability issues resulting from running Windows 11 on stale hardware. In fact, the company might add an \u201cUnauthorized\u201d watermark to the screen and cut you off from security updates, which was the reason for this exercise in the first place.

ESUs have been around for a long time for companies and individuals that want to safely continue using their systems after security updates stop; it\u2019s about $60 a year, although ESUs are included with Windows 365 but not Microsoft 365.\n\nThe ESU subscription is expected to add new features and bug fixes. If that were the worst part, I might go along with this security shake-down and pay up. Unfortunately, the Windows 10 ESU plan will only include the most critical and important security updates, ignoring the moderate or low priority updates as well as tech support for Windows 10. This can leave users feeling abandoned should something serious go wrong.\n\nDo nothing\n\nIf paying for vital updates rubs you the wrong way \u2013 as it does me \u2013 doing nothing has risks but can be a viable strategy to Microsoft\u2019s abandonment of the Windows 10 platform. There\u2019s a good chance that the best antivirus software you\u2019re already using will continue to evolve and adapt to the future threat landscape. It\u2019s best to check with the provider as to their post-October plans but most will attempt to knock off dangers, like traditional malware, phishing attempts and ransomware exploits \u2013 one at a time.\n\n(Image credit: AVG)\n\nWhile it\u2019s second best compared to Microsoft\u2019s OS security updates, many providers, including AVG , Bitdefender and Norton , continue to effectively protect Windows 7 systems, which had its last Microsoft security update five years ago.\n\nSecurity software providers will try to be proactive against threats and stay a step ahead of hackers with enhanced scanning, extra emphasis on heuristic behavioral monitoring and greater efforts to find new exploits in the wild before they hit your computer.\n\nThose who spend their days protecting PCs have two suggestions for Windows 10 loyalists. In addition to being extra cautious online to not download potential timebombs, they advise updating everything \u2013 from your browser and add-ons to your security programs, apps and drivers.\n\nIt might be time for a new Windows 11 PC\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news about Microsoft wiping its hands of free Windows 10 security updates. The good news is that if you break down and get a new computer, it will likely have better security, a more powerful processor, more RAM and storage as well as faster Wi-Fi and USB ports. In other words, it\u2019s an opportunity to make a fresh start with a computer that won\u2019t be tired and bogged down by accumulated software.\n\nI\u2019m not one for reading technological tea leaves but if the past is any indication, there\u2019s also bad news coming on the horizon. No matter what you do, you\u2019ll likely have to go through a similar OS shuffle in about six years when Windows 11 reaches its end of life date and Microsoft stops sending out free security updates once again.",

What are the advantages of using Excel tables with ArcGIS Pro?\n\nUsing Excel data can enhance or add value to other geographic information you\u2019re working with. Microsoft Excel can help you organize, calculate, and analyze data in a spreadsheet format. Adding an Excel spreadsheet to ArcGIS Pro allows you to combine tabular data with spatial data, enhance analysis and visualization capabilities, and uncover insights that may not be immediately apparent from the data table alone, such as the following map, which displays confirmed COVID-19 cases reported worldwide during the height of the pandemic.\n\nWorld map of Coronavirus Covid-19, Covid-19 map confirmed cases reported worldwide globally.\n\n2.

Microsoft drivers help bridge communication and data transfers between files proprietary to the Microsoft Office system and other non-Microsoft Office applications, such as ArcGIS Pro.\n\nSupported Microsoft Drivers\n\nTwo primary Microsoft drivers can be installed if needed:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Access Runtime \u2014( OfficeSetup.exe )\u2014The Microsoft 365 Access Runtime files are available to download in either the 64-bit (x64) or 32-bit (x86) versions in all supported languages. Once you select the language you want, click the appropriate bit version to download. See Download and install Microsoft 365 Access Runtime for the complete installation instructions . TIP : The ArcGIS Pro 3.4 release introduced support for Microsoft 365 Access Runtime! CAUTION : The Microsoft 365 Access Runtime is not compatible with Microsoft Office products installed with a Microsoft Installer (MSI) . For more information, see Office installed with Click-to-Run and Windows Installer on the same computer isn\u2019t supported .\n\n\u2014( )\u2014The 365 Access Runtime files are available to download in either the 64-bit (x64) or 32-bit (x86) versions in all supported languages. Once you select the language you want, click the appropriate bit version to download.\n\nMicrosoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable\u2014(AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe /AccessDatabaseEngine.exe)\u2014You can download this driver in either 64-bit or 32-bit (x86) versions. The Microsoft Download Center lists supported operating systems and detailed installation instructions.\n\nClient machine details\n\nTo determine the best driver to install, you must first answer the following questions about the machine where ArcGIS Pro is installed.\n\nAre any Microsoft products installed on the client machine? If no , proceed to the decision tree guides. If yes , proceed with the next question.\n\n\n\nAre the Microsoft products installed using Click-to-Run (CTR) technology or a Microsoft Installer (MSI) method?\n\nClick here to learn more about MSI vs. Click-to-Run (CTR) installers and how to identify the type used for Microsoft products on your machine. Microsoft Office is installed in one of two ways: MSI or Click-to-Run (CTR). A Microsoft Installer (MSI) file, which more recently is referred to as a Windows Installer file, is typically one large download file containing the installer and all the Office components. Microsoft Office (CTR) is an alternative to the traditional (MSI) installer-based method and uses streaming and virtualization technology to install and launch Office products faster. Knowing the type of installer used is important because Microsoft Office products installed using CTR (such as Microsoft Office 365) can prevent the installation of specific drivers if your Microsoft Office is already set up with it.\n\n\n\nFollow these instructions to determine if the installer type is MSI or Click-to-Run (CTR) for your Microsoft products.\n\nNote: These instructions apply to any Office app (Word, Excel, etc.).\n\n\n\nInstructions: Using Word, choose File and then select Account. The Product Information section within About Word will either show Click-to-Run or nothing after the build number. If nothing is after the build number, it\u2019s an MSI install; otherwise, \u201cClick-to-Run\u201d will display if this installer type was used.\n\n\n\nWhat is the bit version of the installed Microsoft products, 64-bit or 32-bit?\n\nClick here to learn more about 64-bit and 32-bit levels and how to identify the bit level of the Microsoft products installed on your machine . You also need to know the bit-level installed for these Microsoft products. This information is essential because if you try to install the downloaded AccessDatabaseEngine.exe file on a machine that already has a Microsoft 64-bit application, you will get an error message saying you can\u2019t install a 32-bit version of the database engine because you currently have 64-bit Office products installed. A similar error message will display if you try installing the AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe file on a machine with a Microsoft 32-bit application. For more information, choose between the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Office.\n\n\n\nFollow these instructions to determine if the Microsoft products were installed as 64-bit or 32-bit.\n\nNote: These instructions apply to any Office app (Word, Excel, etc.).\n\nInstructions: Click the About Word icon. Clicking the icon will open the About Microsoft Word window. The top line contains the combined version and build number; at the end, it displays 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n5. How do I use the decision tree guides?\n\nBased on your answers to the above questions, use the following decision tree guides to help you determine if a driver needs to be installed and, if so, which driver(s) should be installed.\n\nSome configurations may require a silent installation to successfully install an additional driver before accessing Excel files from ArcGIS Pro.\n\nArcGIS Pro version-specific driver decision guide\n\nArcGIS Pro 3.4\n\nArcGIS Pro 3.3\n\nArcGIS Pro 3.0 \u2013 3.2\n\nAfter reviewing the decision tree guide specific to the ArcGIS Pro version you will be using and the notes containing additional ArcGIS Pro version-specific details, do you need to perform a silent installation?\n\nNo, then proceed with these Install Instructions. Yes, then proceed with the steps outlined below in question 8.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are unsure whether a silent install is needed or if you happen to have both 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft products installed, download the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable 64-bit driver (AccessDatabaseEngine_X64) and follow the steps outlined below in Question 7 to complete a silent install of this driver.\n\n6. Why am I encountering errors?\n\nIf the necessary driver(s) are missing or not installed correctly, attempting to access an Excel file in ArcGIS Pro can yield the following error message: \u201cRequired Microsoft driver is not installed.\u201d\n\nTo work around this, complete the following steps to perform a silent mode installation of the downloaded files:\n\nMicrosoft policy only allows you to install drivers with the same bit version as the installed Microsoft Office products.\n\nFor example, you can only install 32-bit drivers on a machine with 32-bit Microsoft products installed and 64-bit drivers on a machine with 64-bit Microsoft products installed; you cannot mix and match between the two.\n\nIf you try installing the downloaded AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe file on a machine with a Microsoft 32-bit application installed, you will receive an error message. The error message indicates that you can\u2019t install a 64-bit database engine version because you currently have 32-bit Microsoft Office products installed. If you try installing the AccessDatabaseEngine.exe file on a machine with a Microsoft 64-bit application installed, a similar error message appears.\n\nIf you happen to encounter either of these issues mentioned above, don't despair! There's a simple workaround, which involves performing a silent installation of the downloaded driver files.\n\nSee question 7 to learn more about silent installs.\n\nSee question 8 for the steps to complete a silent mode installation of the downloaded files.\n\n7. What is a \u201csilent install,\u201d and is it for me?\n\nA silent (or unattended) installation enables software setup (typically an MSI or an EXE) without user input and bypasses the typical checks and prompts. This means clicking through an install wizard where you might need to click Next multiple times is unnecessary. The application will be installed automatically by calling the installer with specific silent install parameters. If you\u2019re interested in this approach, the steps to silently install your Microsoft driver are outlined below in question 8.\n\n8. How do I perform a silent install for a Microsoft driver?\n\nNOTE: Before beginning, ensure your ArcGIS Pro application and any other ESRI software running on your client machine are closed. Additionally, you must first remove any previous versions of the Access Database Engine from your computer by using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.\n\nAs a reminder, the two primary drivers that can be installed are: Microsoft 365 Access Runtime Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable\n\n\n\nComplete the following steps to perform a silent install of the Microsoft driver:\n\nStep 1. Decide which driver and bit level you need for your specific machine configuration.\n\nTIP: The driver selected should be based on your answer from question 4 and reviewing the decision tree guides in question 5.\n\nFrom the drop-down list, select the language you want.\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate bit-level version you need. Select the Download button and save the downloaded file locally to your hard disk.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nOn my local machine, where ArcGIS Pro resides, I created a new folder named Driver.\n\nFor this exercise, I\u2019ve downloaded the Microsoft 365 Access Runtime (64-bit and 32-bit) and the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable (64-bit and 32-bit) drivers and placed them in this newly created folder.\n\nStep 2. Open the Command Prompt and click Run as administrator.\n\nIn the Windows taskbar Search box, type cmd into the search box. You will see Command Prompt appear in the search window. Then, click or tap on the Run as administrator option displayed on the right side of the Search window.\n\n\n\nStep 3. From the command prompt, run a silent install of the driver.\n\nProvide the full path for the Microsoft driver .exe file stored locally on your machine and add /quiet , then hit enter on your keyboard to run this as a silent install.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nHere\u2019s the full path of the Microsoft 365 Access Runtime 64-bit driver .exe file run as a silent install:\n\n\n\nC:\\Driver\\OfficeSetup_X64.exe /quiet\n\nHere\u2019s the full path of the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable 64-bit driver .exe file run as a silent install:\n\n\n\nC:\\Driver\\accessdatabaseengine_X64.exe /quiet\n\nStep 4. Verify the driver was installed successfully.\n\nTo verify that the driver(s) was installed successfully, type Add or Remove programs in the taskbar search box and select Add or Remove Programs System settings from the search results. The Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable 64-bit driver and the Microsoft 365 Access Runtime 64-bit driver would appear.\n\n\n\nStep 5. From ArcGIS Pro, connect to a folder on a local or network computer that contains the Excel files that you want to display within ArcGIS Pro.\n\nOpen the ArcGIS Pro application.\n\n\n\nNote: If ArcGIS Pro was opened while installing the driver, close and reopen ArcGIS Pro.\n\nFrom the Catalog pane, click and expand Folders. Right-click Folders and select Add Folder Connection.\n\n\n\nBrowse to, type, or copy the full path to the folder on your local or network computer that contains the Excel files; click OK . The folder connection appears in the Catalog pane in the Folders category.\n\n\n\nStep 6. Click your Excel (.xlsx) file to expand the workbook and display one or more worksheets.\n\nTIP: When accessed from ArcGIS Pro, a worksheet is shown as a separate table with a dollar sign symbol ($) displayed at the end of the worksheet name. Spaces in worksheet names will be replaced by underscores.\n\nIf you receive error messages or have difficulty accessing Excel files from ArcGIS Pro, please contact Esri Support Services. Posting comments and questions on the Esri community forums is also a great way to get peer-to-peer feedback and answers to software questions.\n\nRemember, when creating and maintaining data in Excel that you will use within ArcGIS Pro, typically, some data preparation is necessary to ensure the data is correctly identified in ArcGIS Pro. Therefore, it\u2019s important to be aware of limitations and follow these guidelines when working with Excel data.\n\nCheck out the Work with Microsoft Excel and CSV files in ArcGIS Pro blog post to explore a step-by-step workflow for importing geological data maintained by a mining company in Microsoft Excel and CSV files for use in an ArcGIS Pro project.\n\nNow that you can work with Excel files in ArcGIS Pro, an entirely new treasure trove of data has been opened for exploration.\n\nWhat will you do with your newfound powers?\n\nThis article was originally published on September 21, 2020, and was last updated on December 31st, 2024.",

Some end inazureedge.net. These domains are hosted by edg.io, which will soon cease operations due to bankruptcy. We are required to migrate to a new CDN and will be using new domains going forward. It is possible that azureedge.net domains will have downtime in the near-term. We expect that these domains will be permanently retired in the first few months of 2025.\n\nThe two affected domains are dotnetcli.azureedge.net and dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.

It was a chance to deepen their understanding of allyship, engage in continuous learning and development, and reaffirm their commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive.\n\nIn the age of AI, we face both unprecedented opportunities and significant expectations for creating an inclusive AI experience. Our goal is for AI to be culturally competent, offering relevant content that enables authenticity and productivity while enhancing collaborative business outcomes.\n\nA highlight of the day, hosted by Microsoft\u2019s Experience Center\u2014Silicon Valley, featured immersive learning and development sessions showcasing our latest innovations in accessibility across our offerings.\n\n\u201cDiversity and inclusion are fundamental to how we build products, serve customers, and collaborate as a team,\u201d said Annie Pearl, corporate vice president, Azure Experiences & Ecosystems.\n\nCultivating allyship\n\nAllyship at Microsoft is more than a concept; it\u2019s a dedicated practice that aligns with our core values to support one another. This commitment creates an environment where we can embrace and respect our differences.\n\nHow do you create a culture of allyship?\n\nCathy Campbell, a practice leader for Microsoft\u2019s Talent, Diversity, Inclusion, and Learning team, along with Carolina Bogado Gomez, human resources lead for Microsoft Bay Area, engaged employees in a discussion about building an inclusive culture and practicing allyship.\n\nCathy emphasized that allyship is not an inherent trait but a deliberate choice to support others and foster inclusion and respect. It requires continuous effort and self-reflection.\n\n\u201cAllyship involves taking action,\u201d Cathy explained. \u201cIt varies depending on the scenario and when you decide to act as an ally.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s 2024 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report underscores that true allyship is dynamic and contextual, demanding an adaptive approach to champion inclusivity across different circumstances and communities.\n\nThe importance of courage in allyship\n\nOne of the most challenging yet essential aspects of allyship is demonstrating courage. As Cathy highlighted, courage is a critical inclusive capability at Microsoft. It involves finding opportunities to share thoughts, ideas, and opinions, even when it might be uncomfortable.\n\nCreating an inclusive culture requires building a foundation of trust. Carolina emphasized that one powerful way to do that is to point out and reinforce positive behaviors. This can encourage others to replicate positive actions, she said.\n\n\u201cAllyship is about making conscious choices to support and uplift others, create safe spaces, and practice empathy to foster an inclusive environment,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen at Microsoft: Branding and career empowerment\n\nThe day also included a leadership development session led by Women at Microsoft Bay Area on the topics of branding and networking.\n\nCarol Scott, senior director, Software and Development Platforms, and customer success leader, focused on helping audience members identify how they contribute to the organization and how they\u2019re seen by peers and leadership.\n\nShe led the audience through an exercise of identifying what they\u2019re most proud of at work, naming a skill or talent that colleagues rely on them for, and thinking about a career highlight to share. All of that can be used when preparing for a job interview or writing a LinkedIn profile, she said.\n\nBuilding a culture of accessibility beyond Microsoft: An immersive experience\n\nAccessibility is core to Microsoft\u2019s mission, and our products are built with inclusive design principles as a foundation. This objective extends beyond Microsoft; it addresses a societal need and a fundamental right.\n\nTo deepen participants\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s emphasis on accessibility, the Bay Area Culture and Inclusion Day included an immersive learning experience at the Experience Center\u2014Silicon Valley.\n\nJohn Payes, senior director of the Experience Center, and his team members led employees through exhibits focused on Copilot and AI innovation, with a particular focus on how the technology is enhancing accessibility.\n\nHe encouraged employees to take an active role in building an inclusive culture where everyone can be their true selves at work and in demonstrating customer obsession to make the difference.",

Yes, the best laptops today will be lighter, boast better performance and have longer battery life than the notebooks of yesteryear, but generally, they don't transform my daily computing routine from the many years I've been reviewing them.\n\nThat's when Microsoft's introduction of Copilot+ PCs gave me hope.\n\nIn May 2024, the tech giant announced its new wave of AI-driven laptops, claiming to be the \"fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\" Perks such as all-day battery life and 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second) were thrown around, but nothing grabbed me as much as Microsoft stating that these PCs will \"enable you to do things you can\u2019t on any other PC.\"\n\nThat's the big claim I had been looking for. However, it wasn't the ability to generate AI images on the fly via Cocreator or seeing real-time translations on-screen using Live Captions that caught my attention \u2014 it was Windows Recall.\n\nHaving a fully explorable timeline of everything I do on my Windows 11 PC and being able to search for any website, photo, message and more I've seen with just a quick search? \"Count me in!\" was my initial thought. But then, reality started to kick in, and the snowball effect of Microsoft's controversial AI feature continues to this day.\n\nMicrosoft had high hopes for its Recall tool at launch, but it missed a crucial aspect in all the hype surrounding its new Copilot venture into computing: security and privacy. Surprisingly, people aren't fans of having everything they do online recorded and stored, and as an advocate of all things cybersecurity, you bet I'm one of them.\n\nBut I can't help but think of how Windows Recall could be a viable tool, especially for professionals or the forgetful ones among us (myself included).\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

After the severe backlash it caused, including the U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) calling it into question, Microsoft delayed the launch of its AI feature in June. Then, it was delayed once again in October, and only now is it available on Copilot+ PCs \u2014 albeit for preview with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel.\n\nFor those not in the know, Recall allows users to access what they\u2019ve seen and done on their PC by searching for words they remember or by scrubbing through a timeline of past activity.\n\nThis includes everything in apps, documents, images, links, emails, messages and websites \u2014 anything that\u2019s been shown on screen. The feature does this through snapshots that are taken every few seconds, which Microsoft states are locally stored and analyzed on the PC.\n\nEffectively, Recall lets users continue where they left off in a past activity. That sounds pretty useful, right? Imagine working on a report that's pages long, creating a complicated spreadsheet or drawing digital art that took hours when all of a sudden it disappears. It happens to the best of us, and that sinking feeling can be unbearable. With Recall, that feeling would never happen, as you can just retrace your steps and get it all back.\n\nIt's also the little things that make it valuable: finding out the name of a song you missed from a few days ago, looking up a specific web page you accidentally closed, getting information from a message that was sent a while back and more.\n\nThis is a tool I would use to save me precious time instead of trying to remember minute details of words I've written and websites I've visited. It would even save me from hoarding tabs on a web browser \u2014 no longer needing to keep one open just in case I forget about it.\n\nMore so than any other Copilot feature, with a couple being a tad lackluster, Recall would change the way I go about doing everyday tasks on my laptop. In saying that, it's a shame I'm likely to never use it.\n\nThe problems with Windows Recall\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nWhen Microsoft says that Recall captures anything on screen, it means it. That includes confidential information, passwords, credit card details, locations, websites visited \u2014 you name it.\n\nThe amount of exposed personal data is limitless, and all it takes is a hacker to take control of your device or a malware threat such as ransomware to infect your laptop for all the private information to be exposed. However, it can also make users fearful of what they search online in case it's seen by prying eyes.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, privacy lead at Mozilla, Jen Caltrider, says it best: \"That means no more logging into financial accounts, looking up sensitive health information, asking embarrassing questions, or even looking up information about a domestic violence shelter, reproductive health clinic or immigration lawyer.\"\n\nAt the very least, Microsoft has spelled out how Recall can be customized to suit the user\u2019s preferences. This includes being able to pause snapshots, filter out websites and apps or completely disable the tool during setup and at any time. These screenshots are also meant to be encrypted and even have a \"Filter sensitive information\" setting enabled by default.\n\nThe problem is that this isn't working all the time. Recently, our colleague over at Tom's Hardware tested this sensitive information filter, which Microsoft claims will prevent Recall from capturing a snapshot of financial information such as credit card and Social Security numbers. As per the report, this only worked a couple of times, as Recall was still caught capturing credit card and Social Security numbers.\n\nWhile the feature is still in preview, it's clear Microsoft has some issues to sort out before Recall is fully made available to all Windows 11 users (if ever). What's more, the ability to filter specific websites and private browsing activity is only available on specific web browsers, which include the following:\n\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nFirefox\n\nOpera\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nIf you're using other Chromium-based browsers (124 or later), Recall won't be able to filter specific websites\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese privacy risks are no joke, and even with the tech giant's reassurances of needing Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-In to access Recall and using a Copilot+ PC's Pluton security processor, it will do little to persuade people to opt in or turn it on when they boot up their laptops.\n\nIs Windows Recall worth giving a try?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIt's a shame Windows Recall didn't live up to Microsoft's expectations, as it brought the innovation I was looking for in a new generation of AI-powered laptops. However, it's even more of a shame the company didn't expect the immediate backlash when it was announced.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I very much enjoy the sprawling selection of laptops we get to choose these days, but it's a pity Copilot+ PCs haven't lived up to their promise yet, and Recall would have been a huge selling point for these laptops. Sadly, the security risks are still too, well, risky.\n\nOf course, if you're wise about what you look up online, know Recall's privacy filters will work in your favor and actively turn off Recall when you have private information on-screen, then Windows Recall could be a handy tool for you to utilize. Unfortunately, I won't be one of its users, unless Microsoft fully figures out its security and privacy faults.\n\nIf you're looking to give it a go yourself, you can enable Windows Recall on your PC by joining the Windows Insider Program. Don't worry, it's easy to turn it off, too.",

While the company is optimistic about its long-term monetization plan amid a healthy demand scenario, the market will closely watch how soon the investments translate into revenues.\n\nFor Microsoft shares, 2024 was a mixed year marked by several ups and downs. After climbing to an all-time high mid-year, the stock has lost about 9%. Experts are quite bullish on MSFT\u2019s prospects, with consensus estimates suggesting that the stock would cross the $500 mark in 12 months. Considering Microsoft\u2019s aggressive AI initiatives and growing demand for its cloud services, the stock seems to be a compelling investment.\n\nRecord Revenue\n\nMicrosoft generated $65.6 billion of revenue in the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared to $56.5 billion in the same period last year. Growing 20% annually, the Intelligent Cloud division, which includes the Azure business, contributed significantly to the top line. The other operating segments \u2013 Productivity & Business Processes and More Personal Computing \u2013 also registered double-digit revenue growth.\n\nRevenue topped expectations, the seventh beat in a row. First-quarter net profit rose to $24.7 billion or $3.30 per share from $22.3 billion or $2.99 per share in the previous year\u2019s comparable period. The company delivered better-than-expected bottom-line performance consistently in every quarter over the past two years.\n\nFrom Microsoft\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue momentum. More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own copilots and agents.\u201d\n\nCapEx Spree\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the company announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden, to expand capacity in line with its long-term demand signals. It is estimated that recent investments in AI capacity expansion would result in Azure growing at an accelerated pace in the second half of the year compared to the early half. According to the company, its AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter. Meanwhile, there is no clarity yet on how the AI-powered Copilot chat service is performing in revenue generation.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock was trading down 1.5% on Monday afternoon, after gaining about 13% this year.

Some end inazureedge.net. These domains are hosted by edg.io, which will soon cease operations due to bankruptcy. We are required to migrate to a new CDN and will be using new domains going forward,\" explains Microsoft.\n\n\"It is possible that azureedge.net domains will have downtime in the near-term. We expect that these domains will be permanently retired in the first few months of 2025.\"\n\nMicrosoft recommends that potentially impacted developers search their code, scripts, and configurations for references to azureedge.net and dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net and replace them with builds.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nDuring the transition, the new domains will be catered by a combination of Edgio, Akamai, and Azure Front Door, as Microsoft works on solidifying the final distribution model with other CDN providers.\n\nCI/CD teams need to ensure GitHub Actions (actions/setup-dotnet) and Azure DevOps tasks are updated to versions supporting the new domains, while updates for Azure DevOps Server are expected in early 2025.\n\nAdditionally, given that new CDN domains will now be used, even when configurations are auto-updated, firewalls need to be set to allow traffic from the new locations (builds.dotnet.microsoft.com and ci.dot.net).\n\nThe tech giant notes that the timing is quite unfortunate, as impacted users are requested to take action during the holidays when most IT teams are understaffed.\n\nWhen asked why Microsoft can't simply transfer the domains and continue using them, Rich Lander, Program Manager of .NET at Microsoft, said it was not possible.\n\n\"We asked the same question. We were told that this option wasn't being made available. We don't have more information on that,\" explained Lander.\n\nThe answer is confusing as Microsoft's Scott Hanselman confirmed that Microsoft already obtained ownership of the domains, stating that \"no other party will ever have access to use these domains.\"\n\nBy owning the domains and preventing their reuse, the chances of a supply chain compromise for those not migrating their applications are minimal. However, it still doesn't explain the sudden rush to migrate domains and the risks of operational disruptions.\n\nIf you're impacted, you can follow the issue more closely and access status updates on this GitHub page.\n\nBleepingComputer contacted Microsoft with questions about this .NET domain migration but has not received a reply at this time.",

On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.97%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.19%.\n\nThe software maker's shares have seen an increase of 1.67% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.8% and outstripping the S&P 500's loss of 0.36%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Microsoft in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $3.14, reflecting a 7.17% increase from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $68.75 billion, showing a 10.86% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.93 per share and revenue of $277.69 billion, which would represent changes of +9.58% and +13.29%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. As of now, Microsoft holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Microsoft is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 33.3. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 32.44.\n\nMeanwhile, MSFT's PEG ratio is currently 2.28. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.3 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.
