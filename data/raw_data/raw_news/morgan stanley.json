            "content": "Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) is trying its best to stay relevant in the multi-billion dollar obesity treatment market. Despite a few setbacks in recent months, its stock has strengthened. The up-and-coming telehealth player offers a direct-to-consumer platform providing access to a wide range of health and wellness products and services.\n\nHowever, dark clouds are brewing. Market goliath Amazon (AMZN) recently entered the telehealth market, while HIMS is set to lose its grip on one of its most lucrative drugs later this year. So, despite the company\u2019s innovative niche and strong performance to date, I\u2019m leaning bearish on HIMS stock. Both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America expect the stock to underperform over the coming twelve months, rating it as a Hold.\n\nHIMS initially focused on discrete conditions like erectile dysfunction and hair loss. More recently, the company has forayed into weight loss solutions following the advent of drugs like Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Zepbound (tirzepatide) and Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Wegovy (semaglutide).\n\nWhile semaglutide was in short supply throughout 2024, HIMS provided compounded semaglutide, accelerating growth. In recent months, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk resolved the shortages, leaving HIMS without compounded semaglutide. Upon closer inspection, the company\u2019s strategy to maintain its grip on the obesity treatment market appears uninspiring. As a result, HIMS\u2019 premium P/E ratio of 58.1 may be unwarranted, given uncertainties surrounding its weight-loss segment \u2014 leaving me bearish on HIMS stock.\n\nCan HIMS Cope Without Its $300M Revenue Catalyst?\n\nHIMS introduced compounded semaglutide in May 2024. GLP-1 drugs, like semaglutide, contributed nearly $300 million to the company\u2019s full-year 2024 revenues. Given that the company generated a total of $1.5 billion last year, this implies that GLP-1 drugs comprised 20% of total revenues. This is far from negligible and significant enough to raise concerns among analysts and existing shareholders.\n\nOn February 21, the FDA said semaglutide shortages had been resolved, leaving compounders with limited time to stop production. Days later, HIMS revealed its 2025 guidance.\n\nFor Q1, HIMS anticipates revenue of ~$530 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of ~11.5%. Full-year 2025 revenue is projected to be around $2.35 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins of ~12.5%. During the earnings call, HIMS management forecasted that its weight-loss segment should contribute at least $725 million to its bottom line.\n\nWeight-Loss Strategy Breakdown\n\nWith compounded semaglutide\u2019s exit imminent, HIMS is shifting its attention to another GLP-1 drug, liraglutide. Also known as \u201cVictoza,\u201d liraglutide lost exclusivity in 2024, flooding the market with generic and compounded drugs. Unfortunately for HIMS, liraglutide is an inferior drug to semaglutide in many ways. For starters, patients taking liraglutide tend to lose half the weight as those taking semaglutide. Also, liraglutide is injected daily, whereas semaglutide is injected weekly. That\u2019s 365 needle injections per year compared to 52.\n\nA significant uncertainty is how HIMS\u2019 semaglutide subscribers adjust to the changes. The telehealth pioneer grew its subscriber count from 1,537,000 in 2023 to 2,229,000 in 2024, driven mainly by compounded semaglutide.\n\nMain Street Data showing HIMS\u2019 subscriptions since 2020\n\nOn April 1, Hims announced plans to offer branded tirzepatide (Zepbound) on its platform to \u201cexpand access.\u201d However, HIMS\u2019 $1,899 per month price on Zepbound (also including medical consultations and ongoing support) is over $1,000 the cost of Zepbound via Eli Lilly\u2019s own pricing through LIllyDirect, where Zepbound is available starting at $349 for self-paying customers. All things considered, it is difficult to envisage HIMS being a go-to spot for weight loss solutions without compounded semaglutide.\n\nMarket Risks and Pipeline Opportunities\n\nFortunately, HIMS is not totally dependent on its weight loss segment. Revenues excluding GLP-1s grew 43% year-over-year to over $1.2 billion last year. Its offerings span many health categories, including skin care, mental health, and supplements. Its brand is appealing and resonates with its target market. Its subscription model provides a reliable source of income. Finally, HIMS is a leader in a large and expanding telehealth sector.\n\nOn the flip side, HIMS faces high customer acquisition costs that limit profitability. Its marketing expenses in Q4 were $221 million, representing nearly 50% of revenue. In parallel, the telehealth market is very competitive, and there are now many companies that resemble HIMS like Ro, Keeps, and Roman.\n\nMain Street Data showing HIMS\u2019 operating expenses broken down by business unit\n\nAmazon is the elephant in the room (and now the telehealth market). In November, the online shopping king unveiled \u201cAmazon One Medical,\u201d which is described as a low-cost telehealth service with treatments for common conditions such as men\u2019s hair loss and erectile dysfunction, on-demand messaging visits, and free medication delivery for Prime members.\n\nThis makes Amazon a direct competitor to HIMS. While Amazon does not succeed in every venture, a direct B2C telehealth platform has many synergies with its existing business, including delivery and subscriptions. In addition, Amazon has more than 200 million global Prime members and an unmatched ability to advertise to everyone.\n\nIs HIMS Stock a Buy?\n\nOn Wall Street, HIMS stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on five Buy, six Hold, and two Sell ratings over the past three months. HIMS\u2019s average price target of $46.50 per share implies approximately 49% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nJust yesterday, Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley maintained a Hold rating on HIMS with a price target of $60. He, too, is unconvinced that HIMS\u2019 expanded weight loss offerings will be enough to meet its goals.\n\nElsewhere on Wall St., Bank of America maintained its Underperform rating, citing revenue generated from Zepbound as \u201cimmaterial.\u201d They also expressed concern over the company\u2019s margins, which could fall further given the switch towards selling lower-margin branded drugs through its telehealth platform. Remember that HIMS\u2019 gross margins fell from 83% in Q4 2023 to 77% in Q4 2024 due to its revenue contributions increasingly favoring its weight loss segment.\n\nPricey Pivots and Amazon Market Entry Cast Doubt on 2025 Growth\n\nIn summation, Hims\u2019 post-semaglutide strategy does not stir confidence. Its pivot to an inferior GLP-1 compounded drug and a costly subscription for a branded drug raises questions about its ability to meet lofty expectations in 2025. While HIMS finds success in segments outside of weight loss, the competitive landscape in telehealth is shifting, as evidenced by Amazon\u2019s entry into the space.\n\nWhile its brand has power, I\u2019m afraid its services lack differentiation and may not compete effectively with others, like Amazon, in terms of price. Given the confluence of factors overshadowing the stock, it is hard to envision HIMS outperforming market expectations for the foreseeable future.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision. Alternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG.

            "content": "The world is on track for disastrous global heating \u2013 but this will create profits for some air conditioning companies, according to forecasts by leading Wall Street financial institutions.\n\nRecent reports by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and the Institute of International Finance all make clear the finance sector considers the Paris climate agreement limiting global temperatures, signed a decade ago by nearly 200 nations, is effectively dead and investors should plan accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe now expect a 3C world,\u201d states a March analysis by Morgan Stanley. This level of global heating above preindustrial times is well beyond the 2C limit agreed to by governments and would lead to catastrophic heatwaves, floods, economic strife and other upheavals.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley investor research forecasts, though, that multiplying heatwaves will provide a windfall for companies that provide air conditioning, and that the global market could grow by 41% to be worth $331bn by the end of this decade. The analysis outlines several dozen air conditioning businesses around the world that are likely to profit from a hotter world.\n\n\u201cProgress on climate change is likely to fall short of net-zero targets,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe expect cooling \u2013 critical to human health and productivity in many climates \u2013 to be a potent long-term growth theme.\u201d\n\nThe skepticism of top Wall Street firms over climate targets is shared by many other analysts, including at the United Nations, who have predicted that the Paris goals are wildly off-track due to persistently high greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe parlous trajectory of the climate crisis has been underscored by the return of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has called climate change \u201ca giant hoax\u201d, withdrawn the US from the Paris treaty and set about dismantling environmental rules designed to limit harmful pollution.\n\nBanks, too, have shown signs they are scaling back their climate concerns. Since December, the six biggest US banks \u2013 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs \u2013 have all quit a group called the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which sets responsible banking practices to meet climate goals.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly seeing a broad retreat on climate from the finance sector,\u201d said Paddy McCully, senior analyst at Reclaim Finance, a group that pushes financial firms to act on the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is to a very large extent being influenced by Trump and his agenda of accelerating climate change, although also due to banks using Trumpism as an excuse to roll back commitments that they had never actually intended to keep.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s investor research on air conditioning is \u201cmind numbingly cynical\u201d, McCully said. \u201cEspecially as it comes just months after they first weakened their decarbonization targets and then quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s report does acknowledge that surging deployment of air conditioning, primarily in wealthier countries, is not a panacea in a hotter world. If powered by fossil fuels, air conditioning use itself causes more planet-heating emissions that will further raise global temperatures.\n\n\u201cMorgan Stanley Research does not provide firm views, we assess evidence provided by experts such as those developed by the scientific community,\u201d said Stephen Byrd, global head of sustainability research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

I would instead suggest that we will see large volumes of capital deployed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and cooling (among other products, such as smart power grids) would be one such category of increased capital allocation.\u201d\n\nAs the world warps from higher temperatures, some businesses have eyed opportunities such as shipping routes through a previously ice-bound Arctic Ocean. This motivation, as well as the valuable minerals being exposed for mining as ice retreats, is thought to be part of Trump\u2019s rationale for wanting to annex Greenland.\n\n\u201cThis is a bit like saying the quiet part out loud,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, about the banks\u2019 forecasts. Wagner said that there is \u201clots of greenhushing\u201d, the opposite of greenwashing, now occurring among corporations.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the world won\u2019t stay below 1.5C of warming, largely because we\u2019re already there,\u201d Wagner said of the Paris deal\u2019s most ambitious stretch target. Last year was the first individual year, globally, to top 1.5C of heating.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, that means that climate risks will get worse before they get better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat much is clear. In part, that means investment opportunities that wouldn\u2019t have materialized without climate change.\u201d",

            "content": "With President Donald Trump's key tariff announcement looming, Morgan Stanley has ideas for how investors can better position their portfolios. Trump is expected to make major announcements related to trade policy on Wednesday. While the policy has not been officially unveiled as of Tuesday afternoon, the Washington Post reported that the president is considering a roughly 20% tariff on most imports. Uncertainty around the levies has sent markets into a tailspin. The S & P 500 dropped 4.6% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarterly performance since 2022. Given this environment, Morgan Stanley screened for names that can mitigate the impact of tariffs through strategies like pricing power, foreign exchange hedging, stockpiling inventory or altering supply chains. Here's 10 names the firm found can handle the shift in policy: McDonald's is one name that made the list. The company is one of the internationally diverse and mainly franchised quick service chains that will be less impacted, given that they have global revenue and local suppliers. Shares of the Chicago-based company have jumped more than 8% in 2025, reversing course after falling in the prior year. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target implying shares can rise more than 5% over the next year. While Yeti has manufacturing exposure to Mexico, it was still able to make the cut due to its ability to employ pricing power. The outdoor products maker has hit a rough patch, with shares dropping around 13% this year after tumbling more than 25% in 2025. While most Wall Street analysts have a hold, the typical analyst expects a rebound ahead, per LSEG. The average price target suggests more than 31% in upside. Martin Marietta is one industrial name that got a spot on the list. That's because the firm said it has pricing power, which it called the \"easiest and cheapest\" way to alleviate tariff pressures. The stock has slid nearly 7% in 2025. Despite that slide, most analysts polled by LSEG have a buy rating and price target projecting more than 28% in upside.

            "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned -9.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 points to a change of +8.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.41 indicates a change of +9.3% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.",

            "content": "Top Wall Street institutions are preparing for a severe future of global warming that blows past the temperature limits agreed to by more than 190 nations a decade ago, industry documents show.\n\nThe big banks\u2019 acknowledgment that the world is likely to fail at preventing warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is spelled out in obscure reports for clients, investors and trade association members. Most were published after the reelection of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to repeal federal policies that support clean energy while turbocharging the production of oil, gas and coal \u2014 the main sources of global warming.\n\nThe recent reports \u2014 from Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and the Institute of International Finance \u2014 show that Wall Street has determined the temperature goal is effectively dead and describe how top financial institutions plan to continue operating profitably as temperatures and damages soar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe now expect a 3\u00b0C world,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote earlier this month, citing \u201crecent setbacks to global decarbonization efforts.\u201d\n\nThe stunning conclusion indicates that the bank believes the planet is hurtling toward a future in which severe droughts and harvest failures become widespread, sea-level rise is measured in feet rather than inches and tropical regions experience episodes of extreme heat and humidity for weeks at a time that would bring deadly risks to people who work outdoors.\n\nThe global Paris Agreement, from which the U.S. is withdrawing under Trump, aims to limit average temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Scientists have warned that permanently exceeding 1.5 degrees \u2014 a threshold the world breached for the first time last year \u2014 could lead to increasingly severe climate impacts, such as the demise of coral reef ecosystems that hundreds of millions of people rely on for food and storm surge protection.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s climate forecast was tucked into a mundane research report on the future of air conditioning stocks, which it provided to clients on March 17. A 3 degree warming scenario, the analysts determined, could more than double the growth rate of the $235 billion cooling market every year, from 3 percent to 7 percent until 2030.\n\n\u201cThe political environment has changed, so some of them are conforming to that,\u201d Gautam Jain, a former investment banker who is now a senior research scholar at Columbia University, said of Wall Street\u2019s increasingly dire climate projections. \u201cBut mostly it is a rational business decision.\u201d\n\nThe new warming estimates come as heat-trapping gases continue to rise globally and as international commitments to limit the burning of oil, gas and coal that\u2019s responsible for the bulk of emissions have stalled. Meanwhile, megabanks like Wells Fargo are backsliding on their previous climate pledges and exiting from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a United Nations-backed group that encouraged members to slash their emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which in October watered down its climate-related lending targets, declined to comment.\n\nBetting on potentially catastrophic global warming is both an acknowledgment of the current emissions trajectory and a politically savvy move in the second Trump era, according to Jain.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be seen as going against\u201d the administration\u2019s pro-fossil-fuel energy policy, he said. \u201cThese banks are businesses, so they have to look at the risk that they have in their portfolio and the opportunities that they see in the most likely environment.\u201d\n\n\u2018Recalibrate targets\u2019\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s frank assessment of the air conditioning market follows a trade association briefing in February in which industry officials argued that the financial sector needs a coordinated messaging campaign to regulators, investors and the public that the Paris targets are no longer within reach \u2014 and banks should not be expected to pursue them.\n\n\u201cThe world is not on track to limit temperature rise below 2\u00b0C \u2014 and limiting warming [to] 1.5\u00b0C is almost certainly unachievable,\u201d the Institute of International Finance wrote in bolded text, citing analyses from the energy research firm the Rhodium Group and the Climate Action Tracker, an environmental collaborative.\n\n\u201cFinancial institutions need to recalibrate targets to reflect that 1.5\u00b0C are no longer suitable as strategic goals,\u201d the briefing said. \u201cReputational concerns may arise in the absence of an aligned view amongst stakeholders on how such processes should be handled, and what criteria may need to be applied.\u201d\n\nThe banking industry can support the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy but capital will only move \u201cat scale when the economics make sense,\u201d Mary Kate Binecki, a spokesperson for the Institute of International Finance, said in an email. The institute represents about 400 members from more than 60 countries, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.\n\nJPMorgan, the world\u2019s most valuable bank, has been describing to investors how it evaluates climate risks in a detailed report published annually since 2022. At that time and in subsequent reports, the bank said it vets investments using \u201cbaseline\u201d scenarios that assume global warming of 2.7 degrees to more than 3 degrees by the end of this century.\n\nIn JPMorgan\u2019s most recent report, released in late November, CEO Jamie Dimon outlined the bank\u2019s commitment to financing a global transition to cleaner energy. But he also hinted at the role Trump and other political leaders could play in slowing climate progress.\n\n\u201cConstructive government leadership and policy is also necessary, particularly on taxes, permitting, energy grids, infrastructure and technological innovation,\u201d Dimon said in a foreword to the report.\n\nA JPMorgan spokesperson emphasized that, while the bank stress tests its investments using a variety of potential climate scenarios, it remains committed to zeroing out its emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nWall Street knows how to run the numbers, and right now the smart money expects warming to exceed 2 degrees, explained Jain, the former investment banker.\n\n\u201cThese guys are not making assumptions out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are following the science.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report misstated when JPMorgan published its first climate report. The initial edition ran in 2019, was included in its broader environmental, social and governance reports for a couple of years, and then became a standalone publication again in 2022.",

            "content": "KLA is set for further market share gains in the semiconductor equipment market, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Shane Brett upgraded KLA to overweight from equal weight and lifted his price target by $122 to $870. His new forecast implies 29.2% potential upside for the company. KLA has a majority share of the process control market within the wafer fabrication equipment, or WFE, industry, which involves machines inspecting semiconductor wafers. Given its competitive standing, Brett forecasts KLA to exceed industry WFE forecasts on \"structural and idiosyncratic drivers\" throughout the next couple of years. \"We expect KLA to outgrow WFE in 2025-2026 and see a rich catalyst path for a re-rating,\" Brett said, modeling KLA's revenue to grow at 8% and 12%, respectively, in the next two years. According to the analyst, the two catalysts that should support KLA's revenue growth are process control intensity and market share increase. Brett said KLA's market share in the process control intensity should increase going forward given the industry's transition toward larger die sizes and increased design starts, which leads to lower yield, or a higher percentage of nonfunctional or low-quality chips. Larger die sizes refers to a greater size of the integrated circuit on a chip, which means the chip could boast a higher performance but potentially have more defects, for example. This benefit for KLA from these trends is evident so far with the company's performance mirroring Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's capex spending. \"KLA's share of TSMC capex and memory share has increased and we expect share to increase at TSMC and memory share to recover from 2024 going forward,\" Brett said. He added that \"[market] share increase, where KLA should continue to gain market share in process control given the company is first to inflections, has the fundamental technology to enable that, and the data processing capabilities to keep customers, all combining to deepen KLA's moat.\" KLA shares are up 6.9% this year, outperforming the broader market. The stock is down more than 2% over the past year, however. KLAC 1Y mountain KLAC stock performance. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

            "content": "Open source, a code-sharing practice once confined to the developer community, has spread across investment, commercial and payment firms, as many of the world's biggest banks push forward with IT modernization.\n\nDov Katz, distinguished engineer and managing director at Morgan Stanley, has witnessed open source\u2019s steady uptake over the last decade.\n\n\u201cHistorically the industry was pretty restricted because of a sensitivity around intellectual property,\u201d Katz said. \u201cGoing back 15 or 20 years, a lot of the libraries that we used were probably built in-house.\u201d\n\nAs individual banks warmed to open source, the ethos proliferated, according to Gabriele Columbro, executive director of the Fintech Open Source Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt's become clear that open source is a positive sum game for the industry,\u201d Columbro said. \u201cEach of the constituencies in the industry has something to gain, both in the lower layer of infrastructure, where things are very similar across the different business lines or areas of the industry, and through collaborating on common standards.\u201d\n\nIt took time for the notoriously cautious, heavily regulated industry to buy-in on a software development methodology built on sharing. But the rapid pace of cloud migration coupled with an influx of engineers trained on the open development norms of Silicon Valley has accelerated adoption since the foundation, called FINOS, was founded in 2018.\n\nAs a measure of the shift to open source, the non-profit industry coalition \u2014 which allied itself with the Linux Foundation in 2020 \u2014 reached a milestone this year, surpassing the 100-member mark in January.\n\nThe FINOS roster amounts to a who\u2019s who in global financial services, with Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley among its premier members. BlackRock, Capital One, Discover and Bank of America\u2019s securities division are also members, as are numerous technology providers, including the three largest hyperscalers: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud.\n\nThe organization aims to follow the lead of its members in helping foster adoption of open-source development and standards in banking, Columbro said.\n\nAs generative AI adoption picked up momentum last year, FINOS drafted open governance guidelines and a compliance framework for the technology. The AI initiative followed closely on the heels of the organization\u2019s efforts to standardize public cloud compliance, resilience and security controls.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing open source move up the stack, and not just from a technology perspective,\u201d Columbro said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting visibility and understanding at increasingly senior levels within organizations.\u201d\n\nLess is more\n\nOpen source adoption goes hand-in-hand with a move to rationalize hybrid ecosystems, where cloud platforms sit atop infrastructure that has accumulated over decades. Banks are turning to open source to chew through years of accumulated technical debt and eliminate interoperability pain points, as shared code moves up the stack.\n\nOpen source is freeing banks from the constraints of proprietary systems without curtailing their ability to customize systems as technology needs evolve, Accenture said in its annual banking trends report, published in January.\n\n\u201cThe future of banking is being reshaped by open-source systems, with banks moving away from legacy technologies to embrace platforms such as Linux as their computer foundation,\u201d said Michael Abbott, who is the report\u2019s author and Accenture\u2019s senior managing director and global banking lead.\n\nLinux is already a dominant operating system, according to Accenture. By 2028 the firm expects 83% of the world\u2019s physical and virtualized servers to run on the open-source code, up from less than three-quarters in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of the bank starts at the hardware layer, with all the different operating systems,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIf you move towards a common OS, you\u2019ve simplified the core environment \u2014 it\u2019s the only way to get at the structural cost challenges in these legacy banks.\u201d\n\nShared solutions\n\nFINOS members are walking the open-source walk.\n\nCiti spearheaded the common cloud controls project in 2023 and rolled out a digital assets management platform built on open-source components last year. As of January, the bank had retired 2,000 legacy applications as part of a massive, multiyear IT transformation project designed to simplify internal processes and improve data operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase open sourced through FINOS and GitHub a digital regulatory reporting tool created by its developers in 2023. Last year the company tapped Sri Shivananda to become its firmwide CTO. Shivananda, who is now the bank\u2019s CIO of Payments, came to JPMorgan Chase from PayPal, a fintech company that open-sourced its JunoDB data system in 2023.\n\nLast year, FINOS certified an in-house desktop connectivity platform called ComposeUI built by Morgan Stanley developers and shared with the open-source community.\n\n\u201cWe really have a lot to collaborate on that doesn't get anywhere near our sources of competitive advantage,\u201d said Katz. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big accomplishment for a very regulated industry to start thinking that way.\u201d\n\nOpen-source contributions resonate beyond the banking community. \u201cPeople pay attention to what you have out there,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt attracts talent. It engages and retains the current talent. And it enhances the talent we have.\u201d\n\nAt the operations level, the logic of open source is one of technology\u2019s least well kept secrets, Columbro said.\n\nAbbott agreed. \u201cWhy shouldn't every bank in the world share their regulatory and compliance driven approach to open source?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey don't need to share the data, but why not share the code?\u201d",

(NYSE:DELL) stands against other AI news and ratings making waves on Wall Street.\n\nAccording to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global data center market, valued at $242.72 billion in 2024, is expected to grow to $585 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7%. North America led the market in 2024, holding a nearly 39% share.\n\nAccording to the report, generative AI is significantly impacting the sector, as its deep learning models require substantial computing power, scalable storage, and high-performance infrastructure. The market is also shifting towards hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, enabling organizations to integrate public, private, and on-premise solutions efficiently. Additionally, modular data centers are gaining traction due to their cost-effectiveness, scalability, and faster deployment compared to traditional facilities, the report stated.\n\nMeeting AI Demand with Scalable and Sustainable Data Centers\n\nThe expansion of AI infrastructure through large-scale data center investments reflects the growing need for computational power. Companies are securing energy sources and developing specialized facilities to address scalability, sustainability, and efficiency challenges. For example, Related Companies is advancing into AI-driven data center development through its new division, Related Digital, using its expertise in renewable energy to meet rising demand from major tech firms.\n\nIn an interview at CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street,\u2019 CEO Jeff Blau highlighted the company\u2019s strategic move to assemble a specialized team to lead these projects. To support the growth, Related has secured sites with over five gigawatts of power across the U.S., investing $500 million of its own capital while planning to raise an additional $8 billion. With firms like Microsoft and Alphabet significantly increasing their capital expenditures, demand from hyperscalers remains strong. To mitigate risk, Related is securing long-term, 15-year commitments from tenants before beginning construction. Given the limited availability of power on the grid, Blau sees the company\u2019s early investment in securing capacity as a major competitive advantage in the fast-evolving AI infrastructure landscape.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Profits may come under pressure at General Motors (GM), which sources 26% of its vehicles from Mexico, and Ford (F), which sources 17% of cars from the country, Morgan Stanley said. Other auto companies with unfavorable tariff exposure include Stellantis (STLA), BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and Volkswagen.\n\nPotential tariffs on goods from Vietnam could impact footwear companies, as 34% of shoe imports were sourced from the country last year, Morgan Stanley said. Nike (NKE), Allbirds (BIRD), On Holding (ONON), and Skechers USA (SKX) may be particularly challenged by such tariffs, the analysts said.\n\nTariffs may be tougher adjustment for retailers like Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Five Below (FIVE), Warby Parker (WRBY), Wayfair (W), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), the analysts said. Meanwhile, Bath & Body Works (BBWI) and Levi Strauss (LEVI) appear relatively insulated, the analysts said.\n\nChina is still an epicenter of hardware production for tech devices like smartphones, tablets, computer monitors, and headphones, so tariffs could weigh on retailers like Best Buy (BBY), the note said.\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ:CRDO) stands against other best mid cap AI stocks to buy now.\n\nIn 2025, the technology companies continue to focus on developing AI platforms that meet their enterprise customers\u2019 needs for optimized performance, profitability and security, says Morgan Stanley. In doing so, they have been partnering throughout the AI ecosystem of chips companies, hyperscalers, large language models, and data and software companies while grappling with the US trade policy unknowns and resource constraints. The firm believes that the top trends in new AI frontiers and the emphasis on enterprises consist of AI reasoning, cloud migrations, custom silicon, systems to measure AI efficacy, and developing an agentic AI future.\n\nKey Themes Likely to Shape the Industry\n\nMorgan Stanley, while quoting executives from companies designing and making chips, stated that AI reasoning happens to be one of the biggest drivers of higher compute demand, and thus, semiconductors. Notably, AI reasoning goes over and above the basic understanding and into advanced learning and decision-making, which needs additional compute for pre-training, post-training, and inference. As per Marco Lagos Morales (Head of U.S. Semiconductor Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley), for chip companies, customer demand remains in the breadth of AI workloads for programmable infrastructure.\n\nThe next theme revolves around LLMs seeing potential in AI reasoning for enterprises. Morgan Stanley highlighted that companies that have developed the world\u2019s biggest LLMs focus on using the most effective chips and building the best software to provide AI services that become critical for companies and consumers. As per LLM executives, while the early use cases for LLMs revolved around content generation, summarization, and classification, the biggest untapped potential is in AI reasoning for the enterprise data.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSoftware Companies Focusing on Agentic AI, Says Morgan Stanley\n\nThe software executives mentioned regarding their current use of AI for the purposes of productivity gains in marketing and engineering and their longer-term prospects in a bid to gain market share in an agentic computing future.

            "content": "Preparing for a Potential Recession: Insights from Morgan Stanley\n\nWall Street analysts are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession, with Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, suggesting strategic moves for investors to prepare for an economic downturn. According to a report by Yahoo Finance, Wilson has raised the likelihood of a recession to 30%-35%, up from the previous estimate of 10%-20% earlier this year. This shift in outlook has implications for the stock market, with the S&P 500 potentially dropping below 5,500 in the event of a severe economic contraction.\n\nDespite the gloomy forecast, Morgan Stanley's base case remains optimistic, projecting that the S&P 500 could rise to 6,500 over the next 12 months, marking a 14% increase from current levels. This perspective aligns with data from the IndexBox platform, which highlights trends in market performance and economic indicators.\n\nWilson emphasized the importance of tactical positioning, noting that Morgan Stanley's Focus List has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering a 7% return year-to-date compared to the benchmark index's 3% loss. The bank has strategically shifted away from consumer goods stocks due to perceived economic weaknesses, a move that has proven beneficial over the past three years.\n\nConsumer confidence has been declining, with the Conference Board's latest survey indicating a drop in expectations for income, business activity, and the job market. Additionally, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations reveals that only 63% of US households have enough cash to cover a $2,000 emergency expense, the lowest level since 2015.\n\nIn response to these economic signals, Morgan Stanley has also reduced its exposure to small-cap stocks, as evidenced by the Russell 2000's 7% decline this year. Wilson advises investors to focus on high-quality companies in defensive and growth sectors, as these firms are better positioned to withstand the current economic climate.\n\nAs the economy potentially enters a recession, Wilson suggests that investors should be prepared to invest in underperforming sectors such as consumer goods, materials, and energy, which may benefit from a \"rolling recovery.\" These sectors require fresh economic growth to rebound and present opportunities for investors willing to take calculated risks.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Markets are turning increasingly concerned about a recession due to uncertainty related to the new US government\u2019s trade policies.\n\nWhile equities tend to underperform during economic slowdowns, dividend stocks often remain a great pick as they offer a significant cushion against potential losses amidst challenging times.\n\nThat said, here are the top 2 US tech stocks that are in a position to initiate dividend payments in 2025, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.\n\nTwilio Inc TWLO\n\nMorgan Stanley sees Twilio as incredibly positioned to start paying a dividend this year as its free cash flow yield currently sits at a solid 4.7%.\n\nTwilio shares have lost more than 30% since mid-February amidst a tariffs driven rout in the US tech stocks.\n\nBut investors should capitalise on the sell-off as the risk-reward tied to this quality name is rather attractive at current levels, the investment firm told clients in a recent note.\n\nIts analyst, Meta Marshall, now rates TWLO stock at \u201coverweight\u201d. Her recently revised price target of $160 indicates potential upside of more than 55% in shares of the cloud communications company.\n\nMarshall sees \u201copportunity for both multiple expansion and estimate revision\u201d as Twilio continues to tap on artificial intelligence to drive innovation and attract more customers.\n\nAdditionally, she expects improved cross-selling to unlock significant further upside in TWLO shares.\n\nMorgan Stanley dubbed the ongoing weakness in the cloud stock as \u201coverdone\u201d in its recent note, particularly because the company narrowed its loss and improved sales in its latest reported quarter.\n\nDespite the sell-off this year, Twilio stock is up nearly 100% versus its 52-week low at the time of writing.\n\nOkta Inc OKTA\n\nAnother tech name that Morgan Stanley sees as well-positioned to initiate dividend payments this year is the San Francisco headquartered Okta Inc.\n\nThat\u2019s because the identity and access management company currently boasts an even better free cash flow yield of about 5.4%.\n\nThe investment firm expects OKTA to announce its first-ever dividend in 2025 also because it\u2019s doing well financially.\n\nEarlier in March, the Nasdaq-listed firm reported market-beating results for its fourth quarter and issues guidance that surpassed expectations as well.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Okta to see accelerated growth ahead as \u201crenewal headwinds abate, go to market strategy is further refined and new products continue to gain traction.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to navigate the new tariffs environment and a potential recession is already evidenced in its year-to-date stock price action.\n\nWhile the majority of tech stocks have had a hard time in recent weeks, Okta shares are up nearly 45% versus the start of 2025.\n\nNote that a bunch of other Wall Street analysts agree with Morgan Stanley\u2019s positive view, given the consensus rating on Okta Inc currently sits at \u201coverweight\u201d.",

(NYSE:S) stands against other best mid cap AI stocks to buy now.\n\nIn 2025, the technology companies continue to focus on developing AI platforms that meet their enterprise customers\u2019 needs for optimized performance, profitability and security, says Morgan Stanley. In doing so, they have been partnering throughout the AI ecosystem of chips companies, hyperscalers, large language models, and data and software companies while grappling with the US trade policy unknowns and resource constraints. The firm believes that the top trends in new AI frontiers and the emphasis on enterprises consist of AI reasoning, cloud migrations, custom silicon, systems to measure AI efficacy, and developing an agentic AI future.\n\nKey Themes Likely to Shape the Industry\n\nMorgan Stanley, while quoting executives from companies designing and making chips, stated that AI reasoning happens to be one of the biggest drivers of higher compute demand, and thus, semiconductors. Notably, AI reasoning goes over and above the basic understanding and into advanced learning and decision-making, which needs additional compute for pre-training, post-training, and inference. As per Marco Lagos Morales (Head of U.S. Semiconductor Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley), for chip companies, customer demand remains in the breadth of AI workloads for programmable infrastructure.\n\nThe next theme revolves around LLMs seeing potential in AI reasoning for enterprises. Morgan Stanley highlighted that companies that have developed the world\u2019s biggest LLMs focus on using the most effective chips and building the best software to provide AI services that become critical for companies and consumers. As per LLM executives, while the early use cases for LLMs revolved around content generation, summarization, and classification, the biggest untapped potential is in AI reasoning for the enterprise data.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSoftware Companies Focusing on Agentic AI, Says Morgan Stanley\n\nThe software executives mentioned regarding their current use of AI for the purposes of productivity gains in marketing and engineering and their longer-term prospects in a bid to gain market share in an agentic computing future. Morgan Stanley further highlighted that such companies continue to aim to create large systems deploying AI agents to make decisions, take autonomous actions, and adapt to dynamic environments for real-world applications throughout various industries. According to Brittany Skoda, Global Head of Software Banking, software companies continue to compete to create larger operating systems that harness machine learning, natural language processing, LLMs, GenAI, and decision-making algorithms to move towards an agentic future.",

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Andrew Sheets, Head of Corporate Credit Research at Morgan Stanley. Today I\u2019m going to talk about why we think near term improvement may be temporary, and thus an opportunity to improve credit quality.\n\nIt's Friday March 28th at 2pm in London.\n\nIn volatile markets, it is always hard to parse how much is emotion, and how much is real change. As you would have heard earlier this week from my colleague Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist, we see a window for short-term relief in U.S. stock markets, as a number of indicators suggest that markets may have been oversold.\n\nBut for credit, we think this relief will be temporary. Fundamentals around the medium-term story are on the wrong track, with both growth and inflation moving in the wrong direction. Credit investors should use this respite to improve portfolio quality.\n\nTaking a step back, our original thinking entering 2025 was that the future presented a much wider range of economic scenarios, not a great outcome for credit per se, and some real slowing of U.S. growth into 2026, again not a particularly attractive outcome.\n\nYet we also thought it would take time for these risks to arrive. For the economy, it entered 2025 with some pretty decent momentum. We thought it would take time for any changes in policy to both materialize and change the real economic trajectory.\n\nMeanwhile, credit had several tailwinds, including attractive yields, strong demand and stable balance sheet metrics. And so we initially thought that credit would remain quite resilient, even if other asset classes showed more volatility.\n\nBut our conviction in that resilience from credit is weakening as the fundamental backdrop is getting worse. Changes to U.S. policy have been more aggressive, and happened more quickly than we previously expected. And partly as a result, Morgan Stanley's forecasts for growth, inflation and policy rates are all moving in the wrong direction \u2013 with forecasts showing now weaker growth, higher inflation and fewer rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than we thought at the start of this year. And it\u2019s not just us. The Federal Reserve's latest Summary of Economic Projections, recently released, show a similar expectation for lower growth and higher inflation relative to the Fed\u2019s prior forecast path.\n\nIn short, Morgan Stanley\u2019s economic forecasts point to rising odds of a scenario we think is challenging: weaker growth, and yet a central bank that may be hesitant to cut rates to support the economy, given persistent inflation.\n\nThe rising risks of a scenario of weaker growth, higher inflation and less help from central bank policy temper our enthusiasm to buy the so-called dip \u2013 and add exposure given some modest recent weakness. Our U.S. credit strategy team, led by Vishwas Patkar, thinks that U.S. investment grade spreads are only 'fair', given these changing conditions, while spreads for U.S. high yield and U.S. loans should actually now be modestly wider through year-end \u2013 given the rising risks.\n\nIn short, credit investors should try to keep powder dry, resist the urge to buy the dip, and look to improve portfolio quality.\n\nThanks for listening.

            "content": "Despite the recent high volatility, Carvana\u2019s shares have gained 127% in the past 12 months. With the COVID pandemic in the rear-view mirror, Carvana has been thriving \u2013 and has emerged as a leader in the nation\u2019s used-car market; a look at its most recent financial results, covering the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, will show that the company\u2019s sales and revenues are increasing.\n\nCarvana offers customers a unique used-car shopping experience. The company has brought the used car market online, allowing customers to shop for cars and compare prices through the website or via mobile app. Once a customer has chosen a vehicle, he can arrange delivery to the nearest Carvana office. In a twist that is unique in the US used car market, Carvana also offers car-sized \u2018vending machines,\u2019 automated facilities where vehicles can be delivered for test drives or pick-up. The company\u2019s network currently includes more than 30 of these vending machines, with more planned.\n\nThe first stock we\u2019re looking at here is Carvana, a company that specializes in the resale of used vehicles. The Tempe, Arizona-based company was only founded in 2012, but is now the second-largest used car retailer operating in the US.\n\nThe stock analysts at Morgan Stanley are picking out specific stocks for investors to bet on in such a rally. Using the TipRanks platform , we\u2019ve looked up the bigger picture on two of them\u2014both are Buy-rated. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the combination of stronger seasonals, a falling dollar/10-year yield, oversold sentiment/positioning indicators and month/quarter end flows continue to make ~5500 support for a tradeable rally in the near term. As expected, lower quality, higher beta stocks have led the market higher after it reached the lower end of our 1H trading range (~5500-6100). Keep in mind that while the S&P was down only 10% in this correction, many stocks experienced 20%+ drawdowns,\u201d Wilson noted.\n\nCovering the market situation from Morgan Stanley, equity strategist Mike Wilson takes a deeper dive into the ins and outs of financial trends\u2014and he comes out on a cautiously optimistic note, at least for the near term.\n\nBut there are some green lights flashing on the market dashboard. For starters, the prices of some staple goods are coming down \u2013 prices are dropping for both gasoline and eggs, for instance \u2013 and in the past two weeks, markets have turned back upward.\n\nMarkets have proven highly volatile in the first two months of President Trump\u2019s new term of office, as investors are worried about everything from trade and tariff policy to increased inflation to geopolitics.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn the full-year 2024, Carvana reported a 33% year-over-year increase in sales, to 416,348 units. This brought in record annual revenue, which hit $13.67 billion for a 27% year-over-year increase. In the fourth quarter, unit sales hit 114,379, for a 50% y/y gain, and quarterly revenue hit $3.55 billion, up 46% y/y. Both the full-year and quarterly net income figures were records, at $404 million and $159 million, respectively.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s automotive expert Adam Jonas is impressed by Carvana\u2019s success and potential and sees the stock\u2019s current pullback from peak levels as a sound buying opportunity. He writes of the stock, \u201cCarvana shares have pulled back >25% since its 2025 high of $285, primarily due to the broader market unwind and sensitivity around high-growth/consumer-exposed names on tariff/geopolitical fears and positioning. We believe this broader market pullback creates an opportunistic entry point for a company we believe to be a generational compounder (22% revenue CAGR through 2030, 15% through 2040) with a business model (vertically integrated, national inventory sourcing and reconditioning, operating leverage with scale) that positions Carvana for upside optionality, as well as a favorable risk-reward skew\u2026\u201d\n\nJonas goes on to put an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on CVNA shares, and his price target, now set at $280, implies a 12-month upside potential of 37%. (To watch Jonas\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nThis stock\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating is derived from 15 recent analyst reviews that include 10 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. The stock is currently priced at $204.87, and its $285.71 average price target is slightly more bullish than the Morgan Stanley view, suggesting that a 39.5% increase is in store for the stock this coming year. (See CVNA stock forecast)\n\nResMed, Inc. (RMD)\n\nNext on our list is a San Diego-based medical equipment company, ResMed. ResMed focuses on issues of sleep and breathing, and its products include CPAP devices, designed to treat sleep apnea, as well as treatments for snoring and insomnia. The company makes use of AI technology to power digital health solutions, enabling smarter, cloud-connected devices for more personalized home healthcare solutions. ResMed describes its mission as delivering better sleep and breathing, for a better life.\n\nEarlier this month, the company made an important marketing move, announcing that it is consolidating all of its products under a single, unified brand name. Going forward, all of ResMed\u2019s products, no matter their particular health application, will be marketed under the ResMed name. The goal of this move is to create a recognized brand presence for sleep and breathing medical technologies. ResMed expects that a unified brand will make its marketing campaigns easier to manage.\n\nAs a next step, ResMed will also launch three marketing initiatives. The first aims at destigmatizing CPAP therapies in the US market; the second will target primary care physicians in an effort to promote earlier diagnosis of sleep apnea; and the third campaign will target various markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region to overcome barriers to seeking treatment for sleep disorders. The company estimates the global patient base for sleep apnea, insomnia, COPD, or other respiratory insufficiencies at 2.3 billion people, or about 28% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nAt the end of January, ResMed reported its financial results for fiscal 2Q25. The company\u2019s top-line revenue, at $1.28 billion, was up 6.7% year-over-year, and beat the Street\u2019s forecast by $10 million, while the bottom-line earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS, came to $2.43, $0.12 ahead of the estimates. ResMed reported an operating cash flow in the quarter of $309 million.\n\nThis stock caught the attention of Morgan Stanley\u2019s David Bailey, who notes that ResMed is currently taking advantage of a competitor\u2019s misfortune \u2013 and improving its market share position. He also notes that the company has sound prospects for growth, saying of ResMed\u2019s stock, \u201cResmed is a global market leader, with increased share following the recall of Philips DreamStation devices; our forecasts assume Philips re-enters the US market in 2027. Our forecasts imply high single-digit EPS growth over the medium-longer term, with solid free cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet position\u2026 We see potential for increased diagnosis/awareness following the approval of GLP-1 RA in the treatment of OSA in obese patients\u2026 We also see valuation appeal at current levels.\u201d\n\nFor Bailey, all of this adds up to an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating for RMD. He complements this with a bullish price target, which at $280 points toward a one-year gain of 26%. (To watch Bailey\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis stock has 14 recent analyst reviews that break down to 9 Buys and 5 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. RMD shares are priced at $221.88, and their $274.40 average price target together imply an upside potential of 24% by this time next year.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nOpen source, a code-sharing practice once confined to the developer community, has spread across investment, commercial and payment firms, as many of the world's biggest banks push forward with IT modernization.\n\nDov Katz, distinguished engineer and managing director at Morgan Stanley, has witnessed open source\u2019s steady uptake over the last decade.\n\n\u201cHistorically the industry was pretty restricted because of a sensitivity around intellectual property,\u201d Katz said. \u201cGoing back 15 or 20 years, a lot of the libraries that we used were probably built in-house.\u201d\n\nAs individual banks warmed to open source, the ethos proliferated, according to Gabriele Columbro, executive director of the Fintech Open Source Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt's become clear that open source is a positive sum game for the industry,\u201d Columbro said. \u201cEach of the constituencies in the industry has something to gain, both in the lower layer of infrastructure, where things are very similar across the different business lines or areas of the industry, and through collaborating on common standards.\u201d\n\nIt took time for the notoriously cautious, heavily regulated industry to buy-in on a software development methodology built on sharing. But the rapid pace of cloud migration coupled with an influx of engineers trained on the open development norms of Silicon Valley has accelerated adoption since the foundation, called FINOS, was founded in 2018.\n\nAs a measure of the shift to open source, the non-profit industry coalition \u2014 which allied itself with the Linux Foundation in 2020 \u2014 reached a milestone earlier this year, surpassing the 100-member mark in January.\n\nThe FINOS roster amounts to a who\u2019s who in global financial services, with Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley among its premier members. BlackRock, Capital One, Discover and Bank of America\u2019s securities division are also members, as are numerous technology providers, including the three largest hyperscalers: AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud.\n\nThe organization aims to follow the lead of its members in helping foster adoption of open-source development and standards in banking, according to Columbro.\n\nAs generative AI adoption picked up momentum last year, FINOS drafted open governance guidelines and a compliance framework for the technology. The AI initiative followed closely on the heels of the organization\u2019s efforts to standardize public cloud compliance, resilience and security controls.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing open source move up the stack, and not just from a technology perspective,\u201d Columbro said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting visibility and understanding at increasingly senior levels within organizations.\u201d\n\nLess is more\n\nOpen source adoption goes hand-in-hand with a move to rationalize hybrid ecosystems, where cloud platforms sit atop infrastructure that has accumulated over decades. Banks are turning to open source to chew through years of accumulated technical debt and eliminate interoperability pain points, as shared code moves up the stack.\n\nOpen source is freeing banks from the constraints of proprietary systems without curtailing their ability to customize systems as technology needs evolve, Accenture said in its annual banking trends report, published in January.\n\n\u201cThe future of banking is being reshaped by open-source systems, with banks moving away from legacy technologies to embrace platforms such as Linux as their computer foundation,\u201d Accenture Senior Managing Director and Global Banking Lead Michael Abbott, the report\u2019s author, said.\n\nLinux is already a dominant operating system, according to Accenture. By 2028 the firm expects 83% of the world\u2019s physical and virtualized servers to run on the open-source code, up from less than three-quarters in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of the bank starts at the hardware layer, with all the different operating systems,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIf you move towards a common OS, you\u2019ve simplified the core environment \u2014 it\u2019s the only way to get at the structural cost challenges in these legacy banks.\u201d\n\nShared solutions\n\nFINOS members are walking the open-source walk.\n\nCiti spearheaded the common cloud controls project in 2023 and rolled out a digital assets management platform built on open-source components last year. As of January, the bank had retired 2,000 legacy applications as part of a massive, multiyear IT transformation project designed to simplify internal processes and improve data operations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase open sourced through FINOS and GitHub a digital regulatory reporting tool created by its developers in 2023. Last year the company tapped Sri Shivananda to become its firmwide CTO. Shivananda, who is now the bank\u2019s CIO of Payments, came to JPMorgan Chase from PayPal, a fintech company that open-sourced its JunoDB data system in 2023.\n\nLast year, FINOS certified an in-house desktop connectivity platform called ComposeUI built by Morgan Stanley developers and shared with the open-source community.\n\n\u201cWe really have a lot to collaborate on that doesn't get anywhere near our sources of competitive advantage,\u201d said Katz. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big accomplishment for a very regulated industry to start thinking that way.\u201d\n\nOpen-source contributions resonate beyond the banking community. \u201cPeople pay attention to what you have out there,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt attracts talent. It engages and retains the current talent. And it enhances the talent we have.\u201d\n\nAt the operations level, the logic of open source is one of technology\u2019s least well kept secrets, Columbro said.\n\nAbbott agreed. \u201cWhy shouldn't every bank in the world share their regulatory and compliance driven approach to open source?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey don't need to share the data, but why not share the code?\u201d",

Mr. Snyder and his team are known for their in-depth thematic work on U.S. Reshoring.\n\n\u201c\u2026If you look at my companies, they continue to show pretty steady growth in that mid-single-digit range.\n\nThe reason my capital goods coverage has bifurcated versus manufacturing output is because these companies are efficiency providers and this is why we are positive on U.S. Industrials.\n\nThe only reason a customer upgrades a capital good is to drive some sort of efficiency.\n\nThat could be energy savings in the case of HVAC, it could be labor productivity in the case of automation companies.\n\nAll these companies have some efficiency value-add.\n\nIt\u2019s usually cutting out electricity or cutting out labor.\n\nAnd if you look, electricity and labor have inflated 30% versus 2019.\n\nFrom the customer standpoint, when you\u2019re doing your ROI and payback analysis, it\u2019s just better than it used to be, because the costs you\u2019re offsetting have now gone up 30%, and they\u2019re still continuing to inflate at a faster rate than history.\n\nEssentially, my companies are providing more value to the world and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nProviding more value generates demand and allows more margin to accrue to them.\n\nFor example, if the paybacks on your HVAC system just got cut in half, I\u2019m not going to let you take all of those economics.\n\nI\u2019m going to get a little taste myself.\n\nThen, the second reason, and this is what our team is the most known for, is U.S. reshoring.\n\nThe U.S. industrial economy hasn\u2019t grown in 25 years; since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2000, the industrial economy hasn\u2019t grown.\n\nThat includes the capex that we\u2019re putting into it to grow the fixed asset base and it also includes the production, like the widgets coming out of these facilities.\n\nMy companies have been fighting a zero-growth market for 25 years.\n\nI believe that this is changing for a variety of reasons, and we see growth returning to the industrial economy.\n\nThat will allow our coverage to collectively grow topline and earnings at a faster rate than history.\u201d\n\nTrump Tariffs will benefit the US stocks that Chris Snyder and his team at Morgan Stanley covers.\n\n\u201cI certainly think industrials are well-positioned for tariffs.\n\nIf you step back, and you could say every end market, if the prices of the goods have gone higher, then the demand for those goods are less; that\u2019s just the elasticity.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fair to say the same thing about industrials, but relative to, say, consumer or these other verticals, industrials have a very positive offset.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just that protectionism in tariffs, I believe, will drive more investment into the country, and that benefits my companies.\n\nFor example, the U.S. is about 55% of the revenue in my coverage.\n\nThe companies are multinationals, but the U.S. is their home market.\n\nThe U.S. only accounts for about 16% of global industrial production.\n\nSo, we\u2019re just shifting activity to where they have the best market share, where they do the best margins.\n\nThat\u2019s the positive offset, and I think it\u2019s going to bring more investment into the country, not only for the companies that build this stuff, but also the companies that service the production or sell into that production thereafter.\n\nThat\u2019s because you build these facilities, but then they\u2019re here and that brings a long tail of opportunities after the initial capex or investment cycle.\u201d\n\nChris Snyder and his team at Morgan Stanley believe the USA is will benefit from the Trump Tariffs with its unique consumption economics.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like we came out of a 45-year period where global manufacturing capex just searched for low-cost labor.\n\nLike that\u2019s the motivation, I have to go find it.\n\nThe U.S. always loses when that\u2019s the case.\n\nNow, I think it\u2019s increasingly driven by access to technology, capital, and power, and those are parameters where the U.S. will win.\n\nSo, I think, collectively, the U.S. is going to take share of capex.\n\nRegarding a lot of these foreign countries, I think there will be a lot of complaints, and obviously foreign countries don\u2019t like the tariffs, but they will continue to serve the U.S. market \u2014 they do not have a choice.\n\nThe U.S. accounts for about 30% of global consumption.\n\nThat\u2019s equal to the EU and China combined. It\u2019s the best demand region in the world.\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s less appreciated is that it\u2019s the best margin region in the world.\n\nCertainly, all of my companies do the best margin in the U.S., but we\u2019re talking to our international counterparts and digging up as many numbers on this as we can find.\n\nFor the most part, international companies also do their best margins in the U.S.\n\nI think you would struggle to find any other country in the world where foreign companies are doing their best margin in your market.\n\nI think it would be very difficult to find that.\n\nIf you think about the U.S., it\u2019s the best demand region and it\u2019s the best margin region.\n\nIf you raise the cost to serve it, it\u2019s going to still be an important market that they have to attach themselves to.\u201d\n\nHumanoid robots are one sector poised to benefit from the Trump Tariffs.\n\n\u201cOne, we\u2019ve seen a lot of advancement on the HVAC and the cooling side.\n\nData centers play into that, with things like liquid cooling, and companies like Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) that can sell into the higher density AI data centers.\n\nAlso, on the automation side of the house, we published a very big report this week on humanoid robots, which some of our colleagues here at Morgan Stanley, especially on the auto team, have led the debate on.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s early stage there, but to me that is something that everyone needs to be watching, because it really is going to dramatically change the landscape of global manufacturing.\n\nPoint one: If you think about it from a U.S. versus a low-cost manufacturer perspective, it will lower everyone\u2019s cost curve.\n\nBut the U.S. factory workers make, say, five, six times as much as Asia counterparts, so the savings is much stronger here.\n\nIt is also a structural competitive advantage as we continually squeeze out labor.\n\nEveryone saves.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe, and any developed region will save the most.\n\nPoint two, which I think is very interesting is, when we think about these humanoid robots, where are they going to be made?\n\nI think they\u2019re going to be made domestically. I think there\u2019s going to be extreme sensitivity around these supply chains, and that\u2019s going to drive more protectionism and investments in the U.S.\n\nPoint three is power.\n\nThe market is not thinking about this yet but the next thing we\u2019re going to think about in manufacturing is power bottlenecks.\n\nThis is where the U.S. really stands out.\n\nElectricity prices in the U.S. are about 25% cheaper than in Europe.\n\nAsia pays about $14 per MMBtu to import liquefied natural gas \u2014 LNG \u2014 from us.\n\nWe pay about $3.50; they\u2019re paying four times as much as we are.\n\nThen, when we think about humanoids, the cost is powering them.\n\nIf you compare the U.S. to Asia, right now our workforce, humans, is a lot more expensive.\n\nIf you look out into the future and the biggest cost of the workforce is actually the electricity to power them, well, now the calculus has very dramatically changed.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s very far looking out, of course, but manufacturing facilities are very long-lived assets.\n\nThese are mega-projects.\n\nThey take four or five years to build, and then they serve these companies for 30 to 50 years thereafter.\n\nSo, when you make these regional capex decisions, you\u2019re very forward-looking, and have an appreciation of where the technology is going and ultimately what that means for the cost profile a decade or two down the road.\u201d\n\nThe Top Three Trump Tariff trades recommended by Chris Snyder and his team at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cOf the three stocks right now that we really would be recommending, the first one would be Trane Technologies.\n\nI talked about this theme of being an efficiency provider. I think the value of efficiency has never been higher than it is right now, and there\u2019s no company that plays into that better than Trane.\n\nThey are the HVAC technology leader.\n\nThey reinvest the most in the business.\n\nThey\u2019re always the ones that are pushing the envelope on, on innovation.\n\nWhen we think about the demand in the market right now, the reason it\u2019s good is not because we\u2019re building a ton of stuff. It\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing very proactive upgrades, because the paybacks have gotten so much better.\n\nThose benefits primarily accrue to the company that is providing the most efficiency.\n\nSo we really like Trane.\n\nAfter that, it would be Rockwell.\n\nRockwell is the U.S. leader in factory automation.\n\nThey\u2019re the cleanest beneficiary of U.S. reshoring, of a Trump presidency and the opportunities that that brings.\n\nAnd they\u2019re coming out of a cyclical trough.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, they were negative 10% organic. We see really nice acceleration, orders turning the right way.\n\nThat\u2019s another stock we very much like.\n\nThe third one would be Eaton (NYSE:ETN).\n\nEaton is the leading supplier of electrical systems and solutions in the United States.\n\nThey touch every good secular trend you could want.\n\nThey sell into reshoring, data centers, utility investment.\n\nThey really are checking all the big boxes.\n\nAnd, particularly on the reshoring side, the power opportunity there is still underappreciated.\n\nEveryone\u2019s focused on data centers consuming electricity.\n\nData centers account for 4% of U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nThe manufacturing economy accounts for 26%.\n\nAnd that manufacturing industrial consumption has been down since 2000 because we haven\u2019t grown production.\n\nIf I\u2019m right, and production returns to growth, structurally, you\u2019re going to start to see the industrial economy pull on the grid as well.\n\nAnd that\u2019s coming off a much higher 26% starting point.\n\nThen over time, as we layer in things like humanoids and robotics and just more automation equipment, the pull is going to go even higher.\n\nEven on the power side, I still think it\u2019s very much underappreciated. Everyone\u2019s just so hyper-focused on data centers and I think they\u2019re missing this, which is a great opportunity for them, of course.\n\nBut I think the manufacturing side is really important because it adds duration to it.\n\nEveryone\u2019s always worried: \u201cWhat about when data center capex stops growing?\u201d\n\nBut we have a very nice kind of off-ramp here that just adds duration to the positive demand story.\u201d\n\nGet the complete interview with Morgan Stanley Executive Director Chris Snyder, exclusively in the Wall Street Transcript.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS -7.50%) has arguably undergone the most significant transformation among the major Wall Street banks in recent years. Beyond a strategic expansion in wealth management, the bank has embraced technology to enhance profitability.\n\nThe initiatives have paid off for shareholders, as Morgan Stanley stock has returned 330% in the past five years, outpacing the 133% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC -3.79%). Yet since reaching an all-time high price of $142.03 on Feb. 7, the stock is down about 12% amid concerns about the strength of the economy.\n\nLet's discuss what it will take for Morgan Stanley to rebound, and if you should buy the stock now while it's below $140.\n\nRock-solid fundamentals\n\nLast year was stellar for Morgan Stanley, capitalizing on a resilient macroeconomic environment and strong performance of capital markets. Net revenue surged by 14% year over year, with management citing the operating momentum across the bank's platform.\n\nInvestment banking was a bright spot, as recovery in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) boosted fee-based income. The bank gained market share in equity and fixed-income trading activities.\n\nIn wealth management, Morgan Stanley's 2020 acquisitions of retail brokerage E*TRADE and investment manager Eaton Vance continue to bear fruit. In 2024, total client assets reached $7.9 trillion, up 20% from 2023 and nearly three times the $2.8 trillion in 2018, highlighting the bank's ascent in this high-growth segment.\n\nMorgan Stanley translated its new cross-selling opportunities -- alongside an expanding deposit base and growing loan portfolio -- into 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $7.95, which was 38% higher than the prior year's adjusted result. An 18.8% return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), which is approaching the bank's 20% long-term goal, demonstrates the effectiveness of the bank's diversified model at generating profits from its balance sheet.\n\nThe trend likely fueled Morgan Stanley's decision to raise its quarterly dividend to $0.925 per share and repurchase $3.3 billion in stock during 2024, projecting confidence in its cash flow and growth trajectory. Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo! Finance share that optimism, forecasting 7% revenue growth in 2025, while their EPS average estimate of $8.69 is a 9.3% increase from 2024.\n\nNavigating macroeconomic uncertainties\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's improved operating diversification and global footprint, the bank remains closely tied to trends in the broader U.S. economy. Indicators like steady consumer spending, low unemployment, and a rising stock market lifted the business last year, yet 2025 has brought fresh doubts about whether those tailwinds will hold.\n\nThe risk investors must weigh is the chance that conditions worsen, with concerns that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners could pinch businesses and consumers. A scenario where corporations pull back from M&A or dial down investment projects would directly hit the bank's lending opportunities and growth potential.\n\nOn the upside, it's possible the recent recession fears in headlines simply fade, with the U.S. economy and broader stock market climbing over yet another version of the ever-present wall of worry. More positive developments include February's consumer price index (CPI) showing an annual inflation rate of 2.8%, down from 3% in January. This cooling trend might provide flexibility for the Federal Reserve to cut rates, boosting economic activity and loan demand while supporting Morgan Stanley's outlook.\n\nAll this is in the context of what I believe is an attractive valuation for Morgan Stanley. Its pricing metrics -- including a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 14.3 and a price-to-book value (P/B) of 2.1 -- stand shoulder to shoulder with those of its larger rival, JPMorgan Chase. That said, Morgan Stanley's stock holds a clear edge with its stronger growth and larger dividend (3%), compared to JPMorgan's 2.2% yield.\n\nIs it time to buy Morgan Stanley?\n\nThe recent stock market correction presents investors with an excellent opportunity to buy the dip in shares of a high-quality industry leader that's well positioned to reward shareholders over the long run. With some optimism toward the global economy, I'm bullish on Morgan Stanley, and predict its stock price will rally back above $140 by this time next year.",

Management highlighted that top merchants on the platform generate about 10% of their revenue through the site, signaling strong network effects.\n\n\n\nGlobal-e\u2019s plan to charge a 10% revenue share on Borderfree.com GMV could become a meaningful revenue contributor by 2027.\n\nGlobal-e is trading in line with peers despite faster projected growth and a more favorable outlook.

The drivers, in short, include an increasingly health-conscious consumer, but also economic pressures that could be short-term.\n\n\"With alcohol per capita consumption likely to decline, we see the zero-alcohol segment as ripe for strong growth,\" Morgan Stanley wrote. \"We believe that beer is better positioned than spirits in this regard. We similarly see higher growth for soft drinks, aided by stronger pricing power, and with innovation to better satisfy the 'good for you' criteria increasingly demanded by the younger consumer.\"\n\nCompanies are making decisions informed by the same trends. PepsiCo (PEP) earlier this month agreed to buy prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.65 billion. Reed's, a company known for ginger ales that trades over the counter, on a recent conference call discussed a new \"multifunctional\" line of sodas made with ingredients like organic ginger and mushroom extracts and comparably low calorie counts.\n\n\"These beverages cater to the rising demand for health conscious, functional refreshment options and position us at the forefront of the evolving beverage market,\" Reed's CEO Norman Snyder said on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. Snyder added that \"the early response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforced by their expansion of shelf space dedicated to the functional and better-for-you beverage category.\"\n\nAmong Morgan Stanley's recommendations: Buy Coca-Cola (KO), avoid Brown-Forman (BF.B). They're also positive on several European and Asian companies known for their beer offerings.\n\n\"We believe that, in developed markets spirits growth will slow, as consumers shift towards lower/non-alcoholic options,\" the analysts wrote. \"For the beer market, we see this as an opportunity.\"",

Analyst Craig Hettenbach initiated the health-care services stock with an overweight rating. Hettenbach's $165 price target implies 26.2% upside from Tuesday's close. Despite political uncertainty weighing on the stock, Hettenbach said the company should be boosted by a shift toward outpatient care and lower-cost services. \"A significant business model and balance sheet transformation has yet to be captured in THC's multiple,\" Hettenbach wrote to clients in a Wednesday note. \"Risks of government spending cuts likely remain an overhang near term, providing entry points for patient investors in what should emerge as a much cleaner story and durable business.\" Specifically, the analyst said Tenet is expanding and leveraging its USPI business, which has ambulatory and surgical offerings. That is done in part through tuck-in acquisitions, he said. On top of that, Hettenbach said Tenet is a leader within the ambulatory surgery center space and is the \"largest provider in a fragmented market.\" Due to that, he thinks the Texas-based company can see tailwinds. Elsewhere, Hettenbach said Tenet could pick up its pace for stock buybacks as free cash flow improves and the balance sheet grows stronger. Shares have climbed more than 3% in 2025, bucking the downtrend seen in the broad market this year. With this call, Hettenbach joins the majority on Wall Street with a buy-equivalent rating, per LSEG. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

The widely followed analyst upgraded the online used car marketplace to overweight from equal weight. He also raised his price target on the stock to $280 from $260, signaling more than 31% upside from Monday's close. Jonas labeled Carvana \"a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a leader in auto retail and fleet fulfillment,\" in light of the stock's more than 8% pullback in March. CVNA YTD mountain Carvana stock in 2025. Previously, Jonas was cautious on Carvana because of the high leverage on its balance sheet. Those worries have now abated thanks to strong free cash flow generation, which can help pay down the company's $5.6 billion corporate debt. \"While Carvana remains more exposed to a lower strata of auto credit relative to the rest of our auto coverage, the company has demonstrated execution with profitable growth and addressed leverage concerns,\" Jonas said. Jonas also pointed to Carvana's \"impressive operating execution\" as well as its performance relative to peers in the sector. He noted that Carvana has shown an ability to grow its used vehicle volume, which amounted to four-straight quarters of double digit retail unit growth year-over-year in 2024. Shares were up nearly 4% after the upgrade. Analysts are generally split on the stock, however. Of the 24 who cover it, 12 rate it a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG.

Private Wealth Stewardship, a practice affiliated with Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\nThe team is led by founder and CEO Duane Peoples, who became an advisor after managing a family-owned, export manufacturing company for 25 years. His wife, Patricia Peoples, had been with Morgan Stanley for 32 years. She\u2019ll serve as a managing partner at Peoples & Co. The couple is joined by their son, Craig Peoples, director of private client wealth solutions; and daughter, Grace Peoples, director of marketing.\n\nOther team members include Seth Maulfair, who oversees operations, and Brian Gicking, who manages administration.\n\n\u201cWhen other advisors ask me about our transition story, I tell them I used to think that those who stayed in a wirehouse setting rather than going independent just lacked the courage,\u201d Duane Peoples said in a statement. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s way more to it. We had tremendous onboarding support, from marketing to technology to operations. No one at Commonwealth ever showed resistance to our questions, even when they were repetitive. It\u2019s a big leap, but once you\u2019re here, the water is quite warm.\u201d\n\nRelated:Cambridge Hires Schwab Veteran as CTO\n\nIn a statement, Patricia Peoples said she was impressed with Commonwealth\u2019s home office expertise in custom marketing and investment management and with the interactions with the firm\u2019s compliance team.\n\nThe firm provides investment management, risk management, estate planning and cash management for individuals, families and business owners. Duane and Patricia Peoples hold the Certified Kingdom Advisor designation, a certification for Christian financial professionals who aim to integrate biblical values into their financial advice.\n\n\u201cThe economics are much better for our team, and we have access to everything we need for our clients,\u201d said Duane Peoples. \u201cWe\u2019re already experiencing notable success\u2014I only wish we\u2019d made this change 10 years ago. But now, we\u2019re in the right model, and the right home, for the long term. And with both our children in the business, who are well into their CFP studies, I\u2019m confident that the \u2018long term\u2019 stretches far into the future.\u201d\n\nThis follows news in February that Commonwealth recruited Schneider Wealth Strategies, a New York-based team with more than $320 million in assets under advisement.

Schneider was previously affiliated with Cambridge Investment Research for the last 17 years.\n\nRelated:MassMutual Affiliate Adds $325M Across Two Teams\n\nCommonwealth is dually headquartered in Waltham, Mass., and San Diego, and also has an operations hub in Blue Ash, Ohio.

So, the last couple of days though stocks have acted better, and that can take the index higher. How high? 5,900. So, we're almost there.\"\n\nThe major indexes had a notable start to the week.

Beyond the tactical rally, volatility will likely persist this year.\"\n\nAnd, he won't rule out new lows for the year.\n\n\"Whatever rally we're getting now, we think probably end up fading into earnings, into May and June,\" he added. \"Then, we'll probably make a more durable low later in the year.\"\n\nAccording to Wilson, the market weakness is mostly tied to fundamentals and technicals.",

In a note, Jonas has predicted that Tesla stock will rebound over 90% within the next year. The Morgan Stanley analyst and long-standing Tesla enthusiast, forecasts a significant recovery for Tesla's stock, projecting a potential increase. Despite recently lowering his price target and sales expectations due to intensifying competition, an aging product lineup, and a \"Buyers' strike\" stemming from negative brand perception, Jonas maintains his overweight rating and considers Tesla a top investment choice.Tesla's stock has fallen 50% from its peak in December 2024, but the Morgan Stanley team has set a $430 price target, suggesting a 93% rebound from its current price of $223.59.Jonas views the current dip as an attractive entry point for investors, describing Tesla as an \"embodied [artificial intelligence] compounder\" in a recent note. While acknowledging short-term challenges such as declining sales, waning brand sentiment, and a market \"de-grossing,\" he argues that these issues do not fundamentally alter Tesla's long-term narrative, which hinges on advancements in robotics and AI. He notes that media attention has shifted toward Elon Musk 's political endeavors, overshadowing Tesla's AI initiatives and reshaping its public image.Jonas outlines a range of possibilities for Tesla's stock, with a bear case of $200 and a bull case of $800 within the next 12 months. He identifies potential catalysts for a stock resurgence, including the rollout of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) Unsupervised for paid rideshare services in Texas later this year. Although the Tesla Cybercab remains a longer-term prospect, Jonas believes that FSD Unsupervised rides in Model 3 or Model Y vehicles could highlight the promise of Tesla's robotaxi ambitions.Adding to the optimism, billionaire investor Ron Baron has reaffirmed his staunch support for Elon Musk and Tesla, undeterred by recent criticism of Musk's political activities. Despite near-term hurdles, Jonas remains confident that Tesla's focus on transformative technologies will drive its stock upward.",

            "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls have long stood firm against waves of skepticism, but recent woes have sparked some doubts about the company\u2019s current trajectory, even among some of the camp\u2019s most bullish members.\n\nThis brings us to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a Tesla bull who has consistently banged the drum for the EV leader. However, Jonas now thinks it is time to temper near-term expectations.\n\nFollowing a slew of data that has pointed to crushing sales across the globe, Jonas has reduced his auto deliveries forecast for both the first quarter and the full year. The analyst now expects 1Q25 deliveries will hit 351k, amounting to a 9.3% year-over-year drop vs. 415k (+7.3% y/y) beforehand. Additionally, Jonas now sees FY25 deliveries at 1,615k (a 9.8% y/y decline) down from the prior expectation of 1,924k (+7.5% y/y).\n\nJonas cites factors such as increased competition, an aging vehicle lineup, a buyers\u2019 strike caused by negative brand sentiment, and the upcoming release of new products as the reasons behind the lowered expectations.\n\nThe downward revisions don\u2019t end there. Jonas also lowered his FY25 revenue forecast from $105.1 billion to $94.5 billion, while the auto gross margin ex credits is brought down to 14.4% from 15.9%. Additionally, Jonas lowered his adj. EPS estimate from $2.70 to $2.18.\n\nSo, no great news there. That said, for those thinking Jonas might be crossing over from the bull camp to the bear enclave, that is not the case. The analyst thinks the lower expected delivery haul is \u201cnot particularly narrative changing for our investment thesis.\u201d That\u2019s because Jonas finds the silver lining in the soft numbers.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Tesla\u2019s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive \u2018pure play\u2019 to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\u201d the analyst opined.\n\nAnd as AI transitions from the digital realm (bits and bytes) to the physical realm (atoms and photons), Jonas anticipates that Tesla\u2019s total addressable market will continue to grow into new areas, many of which are currently not reflected in analysts\u2019 financial models.\n\n\u201cWhile the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year in which investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,\u201d the analyst summed up.\n\nDespite trimming his price target from $430 to $410, Jonas remains optimistic, retaining an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on Tesla shares and highlighting them as a Top Pick. With a potential upside of 73.5% from current levels, he believes Tesla\u2019s future, though it may encounter some bumps, holds considerable promise. (To watch Jonas\u2019 track record, click here)\n\n13 other analysts also keep an optimistic stance on TSLA, yet with an additional 11 Holds and Sells, each, the stock only claims a Hold consensus rating. Still, the average target stands at $335.32, implying the shares will gain ~35% in the months ahead.

The majority of investors\u2019 views were bullish. Investors began the year on the bullish (58%) note, in line with last quarter (59%). Furthermore, the results also revealed that around 2 out of 3 investors (64%) saw the market rising by the end of the quarter.\n\nWhat\u2019s On Retail Investors\u2019 Minds?\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management\u2019s survey revealed that inflation has been the top worry for investors\u2019 portfolios at 45%, almost in line with the last quarter at 46%, with market volatility at 24% coming out to be the second. Notably, the concerns related to the new administration declined 13 percentage points since the last quarter. Furthermore, around 3 out of 5 (59%) of investors see that the broader US economy remains healthy. Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, stated that with any new administration taking power, the potential policy changes can bring uncertainty in the broader markets. That being said, investors are optimistic and resilient amid a soft start to the new year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nCurrent Trends in Retail Investing\n\nRetail outflows from the US equities increased to ~$4 billion over the previous 2 weeks due to the uncertainties related to tariffs and increased economic concerns, which resulted in a strong pullback in the S&P 500, reported CNBC, while quoting data from Barclays. Rob Austin, director of research at Alight Solutions, says that if people tried to buy the dip, there would have been evidence hinting at the increased buying of the large-cap equities. On the contrary, people are selling large-cap equities. Austin believes that this seems to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity.\n\nCNBC, while highlighting the comments made by Venu Krishna (Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy), reported that there remains sufficient capacity for the retail investors to further disengage from the broader equity market. Notably, Barclays\u2019 proprietary euphoria indicator exhibited that the sentiments are down to the levels that were seen around the time of the US election back in November, but remain elevated by historic standards. The increased sell-off came as American households remained more sensitive than ever to the significant volatility in the broader equity markets.",

The gauge drifted lower on Thursday following a 1% jump in the previous session after Federal Reserve officials signalled that they remain on track to cut interest rates twice this year, leaving them unchanged in their latest meeting.\u201cMaybe there is not a Trump put, but the Fed is still there,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIf we do have a worse growth outcome, I think they\u2019ll react pretty quickly.\u201dThe strategist recommended investors position their portfolios defensively, focusing on companies with strong forward earnings revisions. In particular, he advised buying stocks in the the financial, software, consumer services and media and entertainment industries. In contrast, low-quality companies with poor balance sheets have led the market\u2019s recent relief rallies, he said.Meanwhile, Wilson sees the outperformance of Europe relative to the US fading, with earnings revisions for the region looking weaker than what American companies are reporting.\u201cI would advocate S&P 500 over Europe on a rebound trade,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the spotlight at GTC 2025, offering investors a sneak peek into its future endeavors and its perspective on the evolving AI landscape for the next few years.\n\nYet, those who anticipated this event to reignite the stock\u2019s momentum were met with disappointment as the shares actually tilted into the red during the week.\n\nThis lack of fireworks, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, may explain the tepid reaction, although that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t plenty of good stuff to savor.\n\nThat can be put down to the lack of any huge surprises, says Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, although that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t plenty of good stuff to savor.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much in the way of newsbreaking headlines, but this was one of the more impressive GTCs that we have attended,\u201d the 5-star analyst said. \u201cCEO Jensen Huang was optimistic at CES, but somewhat hedged given early ramp challenges; he is currently not hedged.\u201d\n\nMoore believes Huang made a strong case for Nvidia\u2019s \u201cmultiyear scaling\u201d in training and inference, showcasing a technology roadmap poised to outpace ASIC and merchant competitors and tackle new demands in physical AI. While Moore thinks it would be prudent not to base any views solely on comments made by the management team, his discussions with industry players and customers reinforce the same outlook. Previously, Moore viewed the January \u2013 April period as a transitional phase, but the analyst no longer holds that stance and now anticipates a \u201cvery strong period for the next few quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand the headwinds aren\u2019t entirely coming from micro data points, amid macro concerns, export control concerns, and concerns about the sustainability of scaling out frontier models, but the company will have a very strong product cycle to offset those concerns,\u201d Moore went on to say.\n\nMoore highlighted that the optimism around the Blackwell ramp-up stages was \u201cnotable,\u201d particularly as it contrasts with a market that appears to be \u201closing confidence.\u201d\n\nThe company said it had delivered 3.6 million units of its Blackwell GPUs to the top four U.S. CSPs, excluding AI-focused companies and startups. But equally significant as the numbers, says Moore, is the reason Nvidia chose to make such an announcement. As anyone keeping a close watch on Nvidia will know, this is the first time the company has shared any information about datacenter units. To Moore, it is evident that the purpose of the announcement was to \u201crefocus the narrative on the strength of the demand profile.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Moore pinpointed \u201cinference at scale\u201d as the industry\u2019s biggest challenge that will shape future growth. Despite massive investments, demand still outpaces supply \u2013 highlighted by GPU shortages even for ChatGPT, let alone broader AI adoption. Millions of users still rely on non-reasoning models, and enterprise AI remains largely untapped. \u201cNvidia made a compelling case as to why efficiencies that have made the market skittish in recent weeks should drive higher demand over time,\u201d says Moore, who also noted that Nvidia made a \u201cstrong case\u201d for programmable solutions over ASICs.\n\nSo, what does that all mean for investors? Nvidia remains a Top Pick for Moore, who assigns the stock an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating with a $162 price target. Should this target be met, investors could see returns of ~38% a year from now. (To watch Moore\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nNvidia retains strong support from the rest of the Street, too; based on 39 Buys vs. 3 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy. Going by the $176.54 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 50% premium.

The label comes with a few important restrictions/caveats that leave room for Apellis\u2019s (APLS) Empaveli to differentiate itself. The firm highlights that Fabhalta is indicated for adults with C3G, and is indicated to reduce proteinuria. Moreover, the label explicitly states that outcomes have not been established in post-transplant patients. Morgan Stanley says that overall, the restricted label language for Fabhalta and the strength of the VALIANT data set do little to alter its assumption that Empaveli can commercialize as a leader in C3G/ICMPGN. Recall, the sNDA for Empaveli in C3G/IC-MPGN has been submitted. If approved, Apellis expects a commercial launch in the second half of 2025. The firm sees significant potential for Empaveli in these indications, modeling peak U.S. adjusted revenue of $550M, which contributes $12 to its $30 price target on Equal Weight-rated Apellis.\n\nLight Up your Portfolio with Spark:\n\nEasily identify stocks' risks and opportunities.\n\nDiscover stocks' market position with detailed competitor analyses.\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Furthermore, the results also revealed that around 2 out of 3 investors (64%) saw the market rising by the end of the quarter.\n\nWhat\u2019s On Retail Investors\u2019 Minds?\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management\u2019s survey revealed that inflation has been the top worry for investors\u2019 portfolios at 45%, almost in line with the last quarter at 46%, with market volatility at 24% coming out to be the second.

Rob Austin, director of research at Alight Solutions, says that if people tried to buy the dip, there would have been evidence hinting at the increased buying of the large-cap equities. On the contrary, people are selling large-cap equities. Austin believes that this seems to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity.\n\nCNBC, while highlighting the comments made by Venu Krishna (Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy), reported that there remains sufficient capacity for the retail investors to further disengage from the broader equity market. Notably, Barclays\u2019 proprietary euphoria indicator exhibited that the sentiments are down to the levels that were seen around the time of the US election back in November, but remain elevated by historic standards.

            "content": "First on our list is a Silicon Valley company, Palo Alto Networks. This firm is a giant in the cybersecurity industry, founded in 2005 and today boasting a market cap of $121 billion. The company offers its subscribers and users a full line of comprehensive solutions and firewalls designed to meet the various threats of modern cyberattacks and permit a safe and secure online work environment for cloud, network, and endpoint services. Palo Alto is a leader in the global cybersec field and prides itself on keeping up with the constantly accelerating pace of change in the digital world.\n\nBacked by this thesis, Weiss has spotlighted several top cybersecurity stocks. Using the TipRanks platform , we\u2019ve dug into three of his picks \u2013 each with Buy ratings and double-digit upside potential. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nSumming up the situation in a recent note, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Keith Weiss, an analyst ranked in the top 2% of Wall Street stock experts, explained: \u201cGrowing attack surface area matched with a rising threat environment should sustain cyber demand. At the same time, we see promising product cycles across Machine Identity, Security Analytics and SASE. Against a volatile market backdrop, Security looks poised to regain its safe haven status.\u201d\n\nOne such sector is cybersecurity. In a world where digital threats are only becoming more sophisticated, cybersecurity companies provide essential services that remain in demand regardless of market conditions. Unlike cyclical industries that ebb and flow with economic shifts, the need for data protection, network security, and compliance solutions is non-negotiable. Businesses, governments, and individuals are continually increasing their cybersecurity spending, creating a resilient revenue stream for industry leaders.\n\nIf the last few months have proven anything, it\u2019s that even a long-term bull run is still open to volatile market forces. The S&P 500 has been flirting with correction territory amid concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies and escalating trade wars with key partners like Canada, Mexico, and China. These protectionist measures have led to increased market volatility, disrupted global supply chains, and heightened fears of an economic slowdown.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the forefront of Palo Alto\u2019s current approach is Precision AI, the company\u2019s AI platform built and trained based on the rich security dataset that Palo Alto has built up over the past two decades. The company\u2019s basic premise is simple: the advent of AI, especially generative AI, has given cyber attackers a tremendous boost in speed \u2013 and defenses will need to fight that fire with fire. Palo Alto has embedded Precision AI across its product portfolio and even uses it to provide for more secure system access. The result is a simpler but much smarter security environment that makes use of intuitive AI-powered platforms to outsmart potential attackers.\n\nUsers like Palo Alto\u2019s security features because they have proven successful. The company can protect any cloud-based network, a vital asset these days, and automation has always been a key feature \u2013 even before Palo Alto introduced its AI-powered products. The company claims that it can meet and defeat any cybersecurity challenge, no matter how advanced, and its use of AI and machine learning tech has become a key feature in that claim.\n\nLast month, Palo Alto released its results for fiscal 2Q25, the period ending on January 31 of this calendar year. For that period, Palo Alto reported total revenue of $2.26 billion, up 14% year-over-year and beating the estimates by $20 million. At the bottom line, the company realized non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents per share, or 3 cents per share better than the forecasts. In two metrics that bode well going forward, the company reported that its next-generation security ARR (annual recurring revenue) had grown 37% year-over-year to reach $4.8 billion and that it had a remaining performance obligation, or work backlog, that hit $13 billion, up 21% year-over-year.\n\nThis stock is covered by Keith Weiss, and the 5-star analyst is upbeat on the prospects for AI tech to drive continued gains. He writes of PANW, \u201cWhile still early days and likely a net tailwind across our security coverage, we think the most immediate beneficiaries from GenAI are those with large, unique data sets across multiple threat vectors. In our view, Palo Alto Networks will likely be one of the top security beneficiaries from GenAI proliferation longer term, largely driven by AI-enabled efficiencies, ramping product cycles (Cortex XSIAM, AI security) and larger platform deals\u2026 From a product perspective, the company remains well-positioned to sustain strong growth in the SecOps automation opportunity through Cortex XSIAM, which continues to see strong momentum and reached >$1B in cumulative bookings during the latest quarter.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom line, Weiss notes several points that should continue to support this stock, saying, \u201cOverall, we remain positive on Palo Alto Networks\u2019 opportunity to sustain durable long-term growth, with AI likely a fundamental driver given the need for 1) securing employee access to AI, 2) securing AI workloads in the Cloud, and 3) securing AI-related network traffic.\u201d\n\nQuantifying his stance on PANW, Weiss rates the stock as Overweight (i.e., Buy) with a $230 price target that points toward a 12-month gain of 22.5% for the shares. (To watch Weiss\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis stock gets a bullish outlook from the Street, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 recent reviews that break down to 25 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently priced at $187.54, and their average price target of $218.90 implies an upside potential for the coming year of 17%. (See PANW stock forecast)\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)\n\nThe next stock we\u2019ll look at is another large-cap name in the cybersecurity world, CrowdStrike. This company specializes in endpoint security, identity threat detection, and ransomware protection. In the 14 years since its founding, CrowdStrike has become one of the industry\u2019s go-to names, and with its $90 billion market cap, it is another industry giant.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s flagship Falcon platform is designed for a proactive approach to security, actively detecting threats and stopping breaches. The platform is billed as cloud-native, providing multi-tenant intelligent security solutions that protect networked workspaces, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or virtualized \u2013 and across all endpoints, from desktops and laptops to servers, virtual machines, and IoT devices. CrowdStrike offers 29 cloud modules on its Falcon platform, through the popular software-as-a-service model.\n\nCrowdStrike backs up its security platform with a full range of services. These include the mundane \u2013 a variety of option packages and pricing plans for the security platform \u2013 and the technical \u2013 such as AI integration for \u2018red team\u2019 penetration testing of application security. The company uses AI to improve its security stance, as the expanding adoption of the technology is causing a surge in cybersecurity risks. According to CrowdStrike, while a majority of companies regularly use generative AI technology, only 38% are actively addressing the increased security risks associated with it. CrowdStrike aims to bring AI to the security realm, to maximize efficiency while not sacrificing security. The company\u2019s AI capabilities include maintaining system integrity, preventing harmful activity, and guarding sensitive data.\n\nThe key to all of this is giving customers both what they want and what they need. CrowdStrike accomplishes this with a modular approach to its flagship platform, allowing subscribers to pick and choose packages or features, find the right pricing plan, and even customize a security installation.\n\nCrowdStrike completed its fiscal year 2025 this past January 31, and in the fiscal 4Q25 report, the company showed revenue of $1.06 billion, up 25% year-over-year and $20 million better than had been anticipated. The company\u2019s bottom line, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $1.03, was up 8 cents per share from the previous year period and was 17 cents per share over the forecasts.\n\nLooking ahead, CrowdStrike has a solid foundation to continue its record of strong performance. ARR was up year-over-year by 23%, to $4.24 billion, and of that total, $224 million was added during fiscal 4Q25.\n\nLooking at this cybersecurity stalwart\u2019s prospects, Weiss sees it as a solid choice in the space. Outlining CrowdStrike\u2019s advantages, he writes, \u201cCrowdStrike remains a leading platform consolidator within security and continues to gain share across core endpoint security, cloud security, identity protection and next-gen SIEM. CrowdStrike already has 32% of customers adopting 7+ modules across its platform, and has seven separate modules each contributing >$300M in total ARR. The company continues to win across the security stack, with ARR from Cloud security, identity security and LogScale Next-Gen SIEM growing ~50% YoY to >$1.3B in the latest quarter. We see a long runway for CrowdStrike to continue benefitting from platform consolidation, especially as benefits from prior customer commitment packages (CCP) roll off the model over the next few quarters and allow the company to drive larger TCV deals with longer duration.\u201d\n\nThe analyst goes on to put an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on these shares, along with a $429 price target that indicates an 14% gain lying in wait for the year ahead.\n\nTech stocks typically get a lot of attention from Wall Street, and CrowdStrike is no exception. The 34 recent reviews on record for the stock include 30 to Buy and 4 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target here is $421.61, implying a 12.5% upside potential from the current share price of $375.05. (See CRWD stock forecast)\n\nVaronis Systems (VRNS)\n\nFor the last stock on our list, we\u2019ll take a step down in size and look at Varonis Systems. This $4.7 billion company is an expert in automated data protection, taking the view that data is the basic commodity of the digital world and must be protected \u2018first, not last.\u2019\n\nTo achieve this, Varonis gives its customers a cloud-native data security platform, purpose-built to bring AI-powered automation capabilities to bear on the discovery and classification of critical data, the removal of security exposures, and the detection of advanced cybersecurity threats. Varonis\u2019 customers make use of the system and its AI technology to automate security outcomes across a wide range of online environments, including SaaS, IaaS, and hybrid clouds. These automated outcomes can include data security posture management, data classification, data access governance, data detection and response, and data loss prevention. The company\u2019s system can even provide insider risk management.\n\nFor Varonis, all of this is based on the recognition that valuable data is vulnerable data, and that cybersecurity must start where the threat is highest. The company has taken this outlook from its Miami headquarters to the global scene, with 14 offices around the world and more than 2,400 people engaged in cybersecurity work. The company generated $551 million in total revenue in 2024, for a 10% gain over 2023.\n\nIn its last reported quarter, 4Q24, Varonis reported a top line of $158.5 million, up 3% year-over-year \u2013 although we should note that the quarterly revenue missed expectations by $7.4 million. At the same time, Varonis had earnings of 18 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, a figure that was 4 cents per share better than expected. The company\u2019s SaaS revenue grew significantly year-over-year, from $23 million in 4Q23 to $72.2 million in 4Q24.\n\nWe\u2019ll check in again with analyst Keith Weiss, who lays out the Morgan Stanley view here, noting that Varonis presents investors with a chance to buy a quality stock at a relatively discounted price. He says of the company, \u201cVaronis offers a unique platform to manage, secure, and optimize human generated data, well positioned to address data protection compliance requirements in a number of industries and regions. With VRNS shares trading at a discount to its Security & SMID Software peer set, we see an increasingly attractive risk-reward profile, as a confluence of trends including signs of stabilizing demand, faster than anticipated traction with the Varonis SaaS platform, and secular tailwinds benefiting data security & governance (i.e. robust data growth, generative AI use cases, regulatory and data compliance standards), come together to drive an idiosyncratic inflection in business fundamentals.\u201d\n\nFor Weiss, this adds up to an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $54 price target suggests a 28% upside potential for the shares by this time next year.\n\nThere are 16 recent reviews on file for VRNS, with an 11 to 5 split, favoring Buy over Hold, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently trading for $42.26, and its $55.79 average target price implies that it will gain 32% in the next 12 months.

            "content": "In recent weeks, we've seen quite a sell-off in the stock market, with the S&P 500 index briefly entering correction territory on March 13. This downturn has some investors heading to the exits, but it also creates intriguing buying opportunities as some stocks are now trading at discounted levels.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS -0.98%) stock, for instance, trades down about 14% over the past month and just under 4% year to date. Those downturns come even though Morgan Stanley management has expressed optimism about a recovery in its core business over the past year. They also come because recent actions by the Trump administration may have implications for financial institutions.\n\nGiven the mixed signals and price volatility, is now a good time to consider purchasing shares of Morgan Stanley? Are further stock price declines likely in the near- to medium-term?\n\nInvestment banking rebounded in 2024 following a couple of tough years\n\nMorgan Stanley is one of the largest investment banks in the U.S. It has traditionally relied on its investment banking segment (which advises companies considering IPOs, undergoing mergers, or making significant acquisitions) to help drive its growth. This segment is somewhat vulnerable to changes in the broader economy. In recent years, the bank has expanded its service offerings into asset and wealth management to help diversify and stabilize its earnings.\n\nInvestment bankers dealt with a cool period for initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers & acquisitions (M&As) in 2022 and 2023 as a result of the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its benchmark interest rate to bring elevated inflation back in check. As a result, many companies put off making significant deals and fewer of them initiated public stock offerings.\n\nBut in 2024, interest rates stabilized somewhat, which helped improve the backdrop for deal-making. That resulted in an earnings boost for investment banks.\n\nExpectations for a dealmaking rebound are waning\n\n\"We are in the early stages of a multiyear investment banking-led cycle,\" Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told investors during the Q2 2024 earnings call back in mid-July 2024, adding that the company was enthused about the potential. Some investment banks hoped that the regulatory and macroeconomic environment would favor them under President Donald Trump. However, the outlook has gotten more murky in the wake of recent actions by the new administration. In one of its first tests, the Department of Justice under Trump blocked Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion deal to acquire Juniper Networks.\n\nThe administration also said it would continue to use the M&A guidelines established during the Biden administration. Under former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Lina Khan, the FTC and the Department of Justice issued strict guidelines that focused on antitrust and the importance of competition and choice for consumers.\n\nOver the past several years, some major deals have been called off after facing regulatory scrutiny, including the attempted mergers of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, Kroger and Albertsons, and Capri and Tapestry.\n\nIn addition, there are fears about the economic outlook amid uncertainty around Trump's tariffs and the possibility that stubborn inflation may head higher. Analysts at Morgan Stanley reduced their stock price targets for several banks, including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies Financial Group, and Bank of America. The analysts noted that the \"robust capital markets rebound we expected in 2025 is not playing out as anticipated.\"\n\nBuy, sell, or hold?\n\nInvestment banks are experiencing turbulence, and seeing fewer deals in the first quarter than anticipated. The unpredictability surrounding trade policies and their impact on the economy has added another layer of complexity to the picture. As a result, investment banks like Morgan Stanley could face a more challenging year than expected. That said, Morgan Stanley has done a good job of diversifying into other activities like asset and wealth management. Last year, its income from these businesses was $6.75 billion, compared to $6.66 billion from investment banking and trading.\n\nFor those looking to build a long-term position, the stock is definitely trading at a discount. However, I'd be inclined to hold off until we see more momentum on M&A and IPOs, where activity remains subdued.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should rush to sell shares if you already own them. Morgan Stanley is priced at 14.9 times its earnings, a reasonable valuation slightly above its 10-year average. While the near-term outlook could present some challenges to the company, I believe Morgan Stanley remains a hold for long-term investors.",

However, with AI reasoning, LLMs can help companies with context-aware recommendations, data insights, process optimizations, compliance and strategic planning.

Among the earliest industries to fully harness tailored AI to do tenfold work may be biotechnology, for clinical trials and regulatory submissions, and law, for AI-powered paralegal work.\n\nMost enterprises want AI models that can ensure the security of their data, which is why some LLMs are researching and trying to commercialize mechanistic interpretability, which aims to understand why a model does what it does. This is important for all companies, but especially those in regulated industries such as financial services. \u201cLLMs are competing to deliver the best inference stack to enterprises, which includes reasoning capabilities and strong AI governance,\u201d said Brett Klein, Head of East Coast Technology Banking. \u201cWith sophisticated reasoning and adaptive learning, agentic AI will be able to make decisions and take actions to achieve business goals with minimal human intervention.\u201d\n\nLLM executives also spoke about working with foundries to design and make custom silicon, to reduce the costs related to developing features such as recommender systems for ads or videos at scale.

            "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley, who is one of the most optimistic voices for Tesla's shares, has joined the recent wave of share price target cuts for the firm. Morgan Stanley has slashed its Tesla share price target by $20 to $410 as it lowers the firm's delivery estimates for the first quarter and the full year. Tesla's vehicle deliveries have been at the forefront of investor attention this month and have contributed to a 19% month-to-date share price drop. Investment banks and analysts have weighed in on the extent of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political activities on the demand for his firm's products and wondered whether vehicle upgrades and slower production are also playing a role.\n\nMorgan Stanley Also Lowers 2030 Tesla Vehicle Delivery Estimates By Half A Million\n\nTesla's shares were flat during the course of today's trading as the firm announced that it would recall 46,000 Cybertrucks due to trim detachments increasing the risks of an accident. The stock is down by 10% since last week's selloff after paring back some of its losses. However, since its post-election December peak, the shares are down by more than 50% as investors sour on the firm's delivery estimates for the first quarter and full year 2025.\n\nIn its latest analyst note, Morgan Stanley reduces Tesla's share price target to $410 from an earlier $430. The bank, however, notes that while Tesla's deliveries have lagged estimates, they do not change its investment thesis. As part of its rationale behind the price target cut, Morgan Stanley reduces Tesla's first quarter and full year deliveries due to \"competition, an aging lineup and a buyers\u2019 strike from negative brand sentiment and upcoming new product.\"\n\n\"FY25 lowered to 1,615k (- 9.8% y/y) vs. 1,924k (+7.5% y/y) previously and FY30 lowered to 4.7mn vs. 5.2mn previously,\" adds analyst Adam Jonas.\n\nThe lower deliveries are at the heart of the price target cut, adds the analyst. Core Auto accounts for less than 20% of Morgan Stanley's fresh $410 Tesla share price target. The lower deliveries mean that fewer Teslas will be available for the firm to generate revenue through services, believes Jonas. Since services account for a larger portion of Morgan Stanley's Tesla valuation, the 'flow through' to services also accounts for the lower price target.\n\nThe investment bank maintains its Overweight rating on the shares and keeps the stock as a Top Pick among US autos. In his previous coverage, Jonas has opined that the dip in Tesla's share price could create an attractive entry point for the stock.\n\nHowever, for the first quarter, Jonas cites data from multiple sources to reduce his estimates. He reduces his first quarter deliveries by 64,000 to 351,000 for a 9.3% annual drop which stands in sharp contrast to the earlier expectations of a 7.3% annual growth.\n\nAlong with Morgan Stanley, Cantor's Andres Sheppard has also shared that the dip in Tesla shares could create an entry point. As it becomes \"bullish on TSLA ahead of material catalysts,\" the Cantor note adds that \"We see future revenue upside from FSD, Robotaxi, Energy Storage & Deployment, and Optimus Bots, to be fundamental to TSLA's thesis over the long term.\"",

            "content": "Bank regulation in the U.S. is likely to ease or stabilize under the new Trump administration, which could lead to stronger financial results for the industry, according to Morgan Stanley Research.\n\nFor the first time since the global financial crisis, which led to turmoil in markets and the economy from 2007 to 2009, banks are expected to face a more favorable regulatory environment. The new framework could boost lending and activity in capital markets in the coming years.\n\nEven if the economy slows because of policies related to trade, immigration and government efficiency initiatives, banks should be able to expand. \u201cWe expect bank regulators to address decade-old industry asks, shifting from years of increasing difficulty and complexity toward a more transparent, integrated and supportive approach\u201d says Betsy Graseck, Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThis is likely to support earnings growth.\u201d\n\nChanges Have Started\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet have made it clear that regulatory reform is a central priority. Since the inauguration, the new administration has reversed prior executive actions and initiated new ones to encourage industry growth at several agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has noted the need to \u201csmartly reinvigorate\u201d financial institutions with more \u201cefficient, effective and appropriately tailored\u201d regulation.1\n\nProposals to change agencies and rules on capital, liquidity and consumer lending are already under discussion, including:\n\nCFPB: The administration has taken steps to narrow the agency\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement activity. A more constrained CFPB, with less uncertainty and oversight, could benefit banks, according to Morgan Stanley Research. Previous rules related to credit card late fees, overdraft fees and medical debt are likely to be reversed.\n\nStress tests: This tool, which is used to inform regulators and the public how banks would fare under scenarios of extreme stress, could become more transparent in 2025. The Federal Reserve, which conducts the tests, has expressed its intention to take steps soon to reduce the volatility of results and begin to improve transparency.\n\nBasel Endgame: This is an international effort to create standards for capital requirements after the global financial crisis in 2007-2009. Regulators are expected to agree on a new set of rules after the initial proposal faced opposition. Having a final rule set would provide clarity for banks to fully optimize capital utilization for the first time since the global financial crisis.\n\nM&A to Accelerate This Year\n\nDealmaking activity is one of the areas likely to help improve the outlook for bank earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the annualized volume of completed M&A relative to nominal gross domestic product (GDP) was 44% below the annual average from 1996 to 2024. Last year there was only a slight improvement from 2023, when completed M&A volumes relative to GDP were at the lowest levels in three decades.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in M&A was driven primarily by macroeconomic uncertainty, including recession fears and sharply rising rates with debate around their end point,\u201d Morgan Stanley Equity Analyst Ryan Kenny says. \u201cHowever, antitrust enforcement also played a role.\u201d\n\nCompanies gave up on deals or kept them on hold because of greater regulatory scrutiny, which increases the cost and time required to complete M&A transactions. New FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson appears supportive of antitrust transparency, recently saying \u201cif you\u2019re not violating the law, the FTC is going to get out of the way.\u201d2\n\nAs boards become more comfortable with the economic outlook and the regulatory environment, Morgan Stanley Research expects M&A announcements to accelerate in the second half of 2025, fueled by three years of pent-up demand and about $4 trillion of sponsor dry powder to be deployed in deals.\n\nDespite business leaders\u2019 optimism around the new administration, activity in U.S. capital markets was still weak in January and February, with M&A fees yet to improve on an annual basis.\n\n\u201cCEOs need time to process the rapid changes coming their way including tariff whiplash, geopolitical developments, regulatory head changes and the impact of federal workforce reductions,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cWe are at peak uncertainty now and expect more clarity going forward.\u201d\n\nBanks Poised to Consolidate\n\nThe banking industry itself could also be a focus for dealmaking activity. Consolidation has been a prominent theme in the sector for more than 40 years as banks use M&A to become more efficient and competitive.\n\nAlso, the U.S. banking system currently encompasses about 4,000 banks, making it one of the most fragmented in the world.\n\n\u201cWe think smaller bank M&A deals, among banks with $25 billion in assets and below, will pick up first, likely over the next several months,\u201d Morgan Stanley Midcap Bank Analyst Manan Gosalia says. \u201cLarger deals are likely to follow over the medium term as management teams and boards get more clarity on the regulatory and macroeconomic backdrop.\u201d",

According to an internal company memo received by Institutional Investor, Sona Menon will join Morgan Stanley as head of OCIO. Effective April, she replaces Alper Daglioglu, who left in January to join Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nMenon will report to Lisa Shalett, CIO for the firm\u2019s wealth management division and head of the global investment office, and Jeremy France, head of institutional consulting services. Most recently, Menon was at Cambridge Associates, where she was the firm\u2019s OCIO and head of pensions for North America.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been working to build its OCIO business even as it looks to cut a significant portion of its workforce. In 2022, it assumed management of Hartford HealthCare\u2019s $4.3 billion portfolio, an unconventional move for healthcare providers at the time that sparked internal turmoil and resignations within HHC. Also that year, Morgan Stanley took control of Vanderbilt University Medical Center\u2019s $1.1 billion portfolio. As of June, Morgan Stanley is the sixth largest OCIO provider based on assets managed.\n\nThe OCIO industry is seeing rapid expansion, as nonprofits and healthcare increasingly turn to outsourcing. OCIO-managed assets are expected to reach $4.2 trillion in the U.S. by 2028. Globally, that figure could reach $7.3 trillion by 2029, based on Chestnut Advisory\u2019s updated forecast incorporating new reporting criteria.\n\nEndowments and foundations have been driving much of the OCIO growth. Cerulli Associates projects an 11.3 percent annual increase in outsourced E&F assets over the next five years.\n\nAs more institutions turn to outsourcing, large OCIO providers have also been seeking growth through consolidation (see Mercer buying Vanguard\u2019s OCIO business and investment boutique SECOR, Hightower buying into NEPC and Cerity Partners merging with Agility).",

The cuts are meant to keep costs down as executives face low attrition, or a low rate of employees leaving an organization through resignations, terminations, or retirements.\n\nSome employees impacted by the layoffs will be let go due to performance issues, while others will be cut because AI and automation have replaced their roles within the bank. A source told Bloomberg that the bank expects to make more job reductions due to AI in the coming years.\n\nRelated: AI Could Replace 200,000 Jobs on Wall Street, According to a New Report. These Are the Jobs Most at Risk.\n\nMorgan Stanley isn't the only major bank planning to cut roles due to AI. A Bloomberg Intelligence report released earlier this year surveyed chief information and technology officers at 93 major banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and found that executives expect to lay off an average of 3% of their workforce within the next three to five years as AI takes over tasks. That means up to 200,000 jobs on Wall Street are at risk of being cut due to automation.\n\nMorgan Stanley has released several internal AI tools for employees. In September 2023, the bank rolled out an AI knowledge assistant tool that quickly finds information within Morgan Stanley research for financial advisers. In June 2024, the bank released another AI tool that takes notes and finds action items for financial advisers during their video meetings with clients.\n\nPick told investors in June that the AI tools could save employees between 10 to 15 hours per week.\n\n\"This is potentially really game-changing,\" he stated at the time, per Reuters.\n\nTed Pick, CEO of Morgan Stanley. Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley executives credited the new AI technology with helping the bank report record revenue and profits. Pick told CNBC in October that AI makes the bank more cost-effective and productive. In 2024, Morgan Stanley achieved record net revenues of $61.8 billion, up from $54.1 billion in 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley is the latest bank to plan layoffs. One of its rivals, Goldman Sachs, is aiming to cut 3% to 5% of its 46,500-person workforce in the coming months. Goldman will reportedly ask some managers located in major hubs like New York City to move to emerging locations like Salt Lake City and Dallas.\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs Asks Some Managers to Move From Major Hubs Like New York City to Emerging Regions Like Dallas \u2014 Or Quit",

The cuts were also planned before the recent market correction. The financial sector has been one of the hardest hit by the recent selling action. We saw a huge run-up in financials after the election of President Trump. A lot of euphoria about what was going to happen in terms of banking deregulation, and now you've seen financials under a bit of pressure here. And then you have these job cuts. Jessica, I'm curious how you are looking at what's coming next for financials given the policy uncertainty.\n\n01:06 Jessica\n\nWell, one, I am really concerned with how this looks at the broader picture. I'm still very positive on that AI narrative. However, financials is what really led up at the beginning of the year. And post-election, it was really, really great. The same thing with technology was what led us up before, and then also led the decline. And this looks like it might be happening with financials as well. So, it needs policy certainty. We were promised this pro-business and less regulation that seemed to benefit these financials. What I'm worried about is if this spurs any type of larger trend. Any mass layoffs is absolutely a concern, and if there were hoarding of jobs and now we're cutting and getting into labor trimming, that's a cause, a very cause for concern if that has any bleed elsewhere.\n\n02:44 Speaker A\n\nI I thought it was really interesting, too, and I was just looking this up off the back of news about JP Morgan's traders scoring huge gains on the market amid the downturn that we've seen this year. That's something that's going to show up in their earnings, I imagine, right? If they are having so much success beating the market. I believe they're up double digits on the year. Meantime, the broader market is down nearly 10% on the year at the moment. So what does that look like in their earnings moving forward? Is that a good catalyst for financials?\n\n03:25 Jessica\n\nWell, and we want to know why the earnings are doing so well. Is it because of the cost cutting that's happening on the bottom line? Are they increasing revenue? There's a lot of more increase in fixed income that helps with their margins because of the spreads that they can capture. So I I really think financials have a lot of positive catalysts that go for them. But I think what what the market really cared about was that pro-business and administration. And so clarity on that will help. But I'm I am worried about the cost cutting and how that would bleed elsewhere. That's a concern.\n\n04:16 Speaker A\n\nAnd we have a former FTC commissioner on our show later who we'll be able to ask about that.",

(Credit: Morgan Stanley)\n\nMorgan Stanley is reportedly set to lay off approximately 2,000 employees later this month as part of a restructuring initiative aimed at enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nThe job reductions, which account for 2% to 3% of the bank\u2019s global workforce, will exclude financial advisers, reported Reuters, citing a source familiar with the decision.\n\nAs of the end of last year, Morgan Stanley employed over 80,000 people globally. The source emphasised that the layoffs are not linked to prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe decision comes as Wall Street institutions adjust their staffing levels amid economic uncertainty, according to the news agency. This follows newly imposed tariffs by US President Donald Trump.\n\nOther major banks have undertaken similar measures. Goldman Sachs has advanced its annual performance review process and is preparing to reduce its workforce by 3% to 5%.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America has cut 150 junior banker positions within its investment banking division.\n\nBloomberg News, which initially reported on Morgan Stanley\u2019s job cuts, indicated that some redundancies are tied to employee performance, while others stem from shifts in the bank\u2019s operational locations.\n\nThe financial sector had anticipated a resurgence in capital market activity following Trump\u2019s re-election, but fluctuating trade policies have tempered that optimism. Uncertainty around tariffs has contributed to a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions as well as new equity offerings.\n\nSpeaking at a recent conference, Morgan Stanley co-president Daniel Simkowitz acknowledged that deal-making activity is \u201ccertainly a bit on pause, or the bar is high because of some of the policy uncertainties.\u201d\n\nIn January, Morgan Stanley reported net revenues of $16.2bn in the fourth quarter of 2024 (Q4 2024), up from $12.9bn in the same period the previous year.\n\nNet income for the quarter reached $3.7bn, or $2.22 per diluted share, compared to $1.5bn, or $0.85 per diluted share, a year earlier.\n\nFor the full year 2024, net revenues totalled $61.8bn, with net income of $13.4bn, or $7.95 per diluted share, surpassing the previous year\u2019s $9.1bn, or $5.18 per diluted share.",

            "content": "Investors who rely on a traditional portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds may want to switch their strategy in this environment, according to Jim Caron, Morgan Stanley Investment Management's chief investment officer in the portfolio solutions group. The market has been dealing with bouts of volatility all year, as traders assess the state of the United States economy and the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade policy and increased tariffs . The 60/40 portfolio has mostly worked for the past 10 to 15 years because it is a passive strategy \u2014 and one that performs well when bonds have a low correlation to equities, Caron explained. But that has now changed, he said. \"Based on a three year rolling correlation between equities and bonds, correlations for returns are as high as they've ever been in 115 years,\" Caron said. When the correlation is high, bond returns and equity returns move down or up at the same time, he noted. \"What you should be trying to do is match off the volatility of bonds with the volatility of equities,\" he said. \"You should think of that as an active process where it's not '60/40 is the golden ratio.' It could vary.\" That could mean 40% bonds and 60% equities , 80/20 or even a 20/80 portfolio, depending on the current environment. By sticking with a passive 60/40, investors could be missing out on returns, Caron warned. For instance, the strategy gave investors about a 7.5% annual return, on average, from about 1981 to 2021, he said. However, if rates move sideways, a bond's return is largely due to the coupon payment rather than price improvement from the duration, he noted. If equities make an estimated 7% return on average, the 60/40 will give you a total return closer to 5%, he said. \"If you compound that over time, if you make a 7% return pretty consistently over time, then by compounding, you would double your money every 10 years,\" Caron explained. \"If you make a 5% return, then you would double your money every 15 years.\" How Caron is invested now Right now, Caron's preferred portfolio allocation is 55% stocks and 45% fixed income \u2014 but what is in those buckets is just as important. Equities are primarily in the equal-weighted S & P 500, an outlook available to individual investors through the equal-weighted S & P 500 ETF (RSP). \"By definition, we are taking an underweight to large-cap tech, and we're putting an overweight to large-cap value, to mid caps, to the broader segments of the market,\" he said. RSP YTD mountain Invesco S & P 500 Equal Weight ETF in 2025. Mega-cap tech stocks have been battered this year, with the Nasdaq down about 12% from its December record high. Caron also likes European equities right now, which are roughly a large-cap value play. He moved into an overweight position in February after he saw indications of pro-growth policies and deregulation coming from European political leaders. That aggressive rhetoric from politicians is a \"major game changer,\" he said. \"The reindustrialization of Europe is what I see,\" Caron said. \"If you have a reindustrialization, you need energy and you need energy security.\" In fixed income, he is taking a barbell approach with high-quality, short-duration bonds and some high-yield exposure. Net/net, the firm is investment grade, he said. Caron sticks with Treasurys, short-term investment-grade corporate bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in his high quality bucket. He also likes non-agency MBS and bank loans.",

A few big names joined the ranks of dividend payers in 2024, led by tech giants Meta Platforms , Alphabet and Salesforce , that began making cash payouts. The income payments themselves were modest to start with \u2014 dividend yields remain well below 1% \u2014 but Facebook parent Meta already announced a 5% dividend hike in February, to roughly 53 cents per share. Dividends reward long-term shareholders, who have the option of reinvesting them over time, which has the effect of compounding returns . To that end, Morgan Stanley called out a list of companies that may be poised to start spinning out income to investors. \"With the goal of generating new ideas and capturing additional alpha, we've identified companies that should have the ability to pay a dividend (and therefore potentially earn outsized returns),\" strategist Todd Castagno said in a March 6 report. He and his team identified companies that have the potential to soon initiate dividend payments \u2014 names that have a net cash position that is greater than 5% of their market capitalization and that generate a free cash flow yield that exceeds 3%. Managed care provider Molina Healthcare made Morgan Stanley's list. Shares are up 8% in 2025, outperforming the S & P 500's decline of nearly 5%. Molina has a free cash flow yield of 10.9%. The stock has come into focus recently as Republican lawmakers weigh cutting spending on Medicaid . However, analysts at Wells Fargo upgraded Molina to overweight from equal weight this month, hiking their price target to $372 from $295. The team thinks major cuts to Medicaid may not be the most likely outcome of efforts to control government spending, and that work requirements for the program \"would not appear problematic for the industry.\" \"We think risk/reward has improved, as there are increasing indications that the most disruptive cuts to Medicaid are unlikely to be politically viable and our analysis leaves us comfortable that the more realistic changes would prove manageable for Medicaid [managed care organizations],\" said analyst Stephen Baxter in a March 5 report. Wall Street is largely split on the stock, with seven of 17 analysts rating it the equivalent of a buy, while eight deem it a hold, per LSEG. Cloud communications company Twilio also emerged on Morgan Stanley's list. Shares are off more than 8% in 2025. The company has a free cash flow yield of 4.7%, the bank found. Despite Twilio's difficult start to the year, analysts like the stock. Eighteen of 30 analysts rate it a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG. Late last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall upgraded her rating on Twilio to overweight, lifting her 12-month price target to $160 from $144. She said a sell-off in the stock on the heels of its latest quarterly results was \"overdone\" and that it created an \"attractive buying opportunity\" for investors. \"We see opportunity for both multiple expansion and estimate revision across FY25 as [a] reacceleration story is proven out,\" she wrote in a Feb. 24 report. She pointed to improved cross selling, as well as traction in channels and product innovations, including artificial intelligence. Finally, Morgan Stanley highlighted identity management company Okta . Shares are already up roughly 43% in 2025, and the company has a free cash flow yield of 5.4%, the firm found. Earlier this month, Okta posted fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, and issued first-quarter revenue guidance that surpassed analysts' expectations. \"Okta should be able to reaccelerate growth over the next several quarters as renewal headwinds abate, [Go to Market] strategy is further refined and new products continue to gain traction \u2014 driving our positive view on the shares,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a Tuesday report. He also noted that fourth quarter results were \"strong,\" adding that he sees \"a favorable setup through CY25.\" Weiss is largely in good company, as 23 out of 41 analysts rate Okta the equivalent of a buy, according to LSEG. Other stocks that made Morgan Stanley's list of potential dividend initiators include Deckers Outdoor , Veeva Systems , Arista Networks and UiPath .",

Effective cash flow management and proactive tax planning can help dealerships preserve their hard-earned dollars and position themselves for future success.\n\nTo navigate financial challenges, dealerships must focus on enhancing cash flow which includes preparing for potential tax changes in 2025. (Photo: Stock image/Pixlr)\n\nEffective cash flow management begins with a close examination of receivables, which includes accounts receivables, warranty receivables, and contracts in transit. Brad Stanek and Paulina Matel, financial advisors for the Stanek-Haack Group at Morgan Stanley, highlight the importance of \u201cregularly reconciling receivables to ensure timely collection and prevent errors.\u201d\n\nThis involves not only monitoring accounts receivable but also processing warranty claims promptly to avoid missing out on critical reimbursements. By addressing these elements diligently, dealerships can improve their cash flow and reduce the risk of financial discrepancies.\n\nOPTIMIZING INVENTORY MANAGEMENT\n\nAfter the Covid pandemic, we saw firsthand that excessive inventory can tie up cash and increase floor plan costs. Jane Saxon, managing director of CBIZ Somerset, advises that dealerships should \u201cconduct regular audits and ensure physical inventory matches records.\u201d\n\nShe also points out that monitoring inventory and your day sale of inventory (DSI) helps prevent carrying aged units at high interest rates. \u201cImplementing cycle counting for parts inventory not only helps manage obsolete items but also reduces theft,\u201d Jane notes. Such practices contribute to better cash flow management by minimizing unnecessary financial strain related to inventory.\n\nEFFICIENT ACCOUNTS PAYABLE MANAGEMENT\n\nAccounts payable management also plays a significant role in cash flow. Timely and efficient payment practices can positively impact cash flow. According to Jane, dealerships should \u201cleverage early payment discounts where available and strategically manage payment terms.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, negotiating extended payment terms with suppliers can provide short-term cash flow relief, while maintaining good relationships with vendors. Jane emphasizes, \u201ckeeping a close eye on accounts payable aging reports is essential for optimizing cash flow.\u201d This approach helps dealerships effectively manage their cash outflows and maintain financial stability.\n\nPREPARING FOR TAX CHANGES\n\nAs we look to 2025, preparing for potential tax changes is going to be crucial for financial stability. With the sunsetting of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and new tax regulations potentially on the horizon, it is important for dealerships to stay informed about legislative updates that could affect their financial planning, including the top marginal tax rate increasing from 37% to 39.6%, and the elimination of the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction.\n\nBrad underscores the importance of \u201cproactive tax planning to understand and anticipate how changes may impact dealership operations.\u201d\n\nConsulting with tax professionals and utilizing available resources can help dealerships make informed decisions and adapt their strategies. Paulina emphasizes, \u201cStaying informed of potential changes is key to effective financial planning.\u201d\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the face of current financial pressures, dealerships must adopt a strategic approach to managing cash flow and preparing for tax changes. By focusing on effective receivables management, optimizing inventory and accounts payable, and staying informed about tax regulations, dealerships can navigate these challenges and position themselves for future success. Proactive financial management not only preserves cash but also strengthens the overall resilience of the dealership.\n\nUltimately, dealers must prioritize exit planning to protect their legacy, secure their financial future, and ensure the continued success of their dealership and their personal financial wellbeing. With the right approach, dealers can navigate the uncertainties of exit planning and achieve a favorable outcome that aligns with their personal and financial goals.\n\nThe Stanek-Haack team offers a complimentary service, the Second Opinion Service, which is a 360\u2212degree review of your dealership and personal financial situation.

Strategist Michael Wilson said in a note to clients Monday that the 5,500 level on the S & P 500 should create a \"tradable rally\" for stocks, but that does not mean it will be long-lasting. The index was trading at around 5,650 on Monday. \"The more important question is whether such a rally is likely to extend into something more durable and mark the end of the volatility witnessed year to date. The short answer is, probably not,\" Wilson said. .SPX 5D mountain The S & P 500 is aiming for a second-straight positive session. Technical indicators support Wilson's argument that this rally may be on shaky ground. The strategist pointed out that the S & P 500 , Nasdaq-100 , Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value indexes are all trading below their 200-day moving averages, which suggests the rebound may be tough to sustain. \"At a minimum, this kind of technical damage will take time to repair, even if it doesn't lead to more price degradation at the index level,\" Wilson said. The early signs Monday do not exactly point to a strong rebound, either. The S & P 500 was up around 0.1% in midday trading , while the Nasdaq Composite was down about 0.4%. One piece of good news is that even if the losses get worse, this may be a good place for investors to jump in from a risk-reward perspective. RBC Capital Markets strategist Lori Calvasina did lower her \"bear case\" target for the S & P 500, but it was to 5,500 from 5,775, meaning full-year losses from here would be limited. \"We think it is a reasonable way to think about the year-end 2025 level for the S & P 500 if the index breaks significantly below recent lows and the stock market experiences a growth scare,\" Calvasina said in a note to clients Monday.",

            "content": "Are you dreaming of owning a home, but those mortgage rates are making you sweat? You're not alone. Everyone's wondering the same thing: Will mortgage rates go down in 2025? If you're looking for a straightforward answer right away, based on the latest insights from financial giant Morgan Stanley, then yes, there's a good chance mortgage rates could ease down in 2025.\n\nHowever, don't expect a sudden plunge back to those ultra-low pandemic rates we saw a few years ago. It's more nuanced than that, and understanding the details is key to making smart home buying decisions. Let\u2019s dive into what Morgan Stanley is predicting and what it really means for you and your homeownership dreams.\n\nWill Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2025: Morgan Stanley's Forecast\n\nThe Wild Ride of Mortgage Rates: A Quick Recap\n\nTo really get where we're going, we need a quick look back at how we got here. Remember just a few years ago, during the peak of the pandemic? It felt like interest rates were practically giving money away! The Federal Reserve, or \u201cthe Fed\u201d as they're commonly known, slashed interest rates to near zero to keep the economy afloat.\n\nThis sent 30-year mortgage rates tumbling to a historic low of around 2.65% in early 2021. It was a crazy time \u2013 everyone was refinancing, and the housing market went absolutely bonkers. If you blinked, houses were selling for way over asking price!\n\nBut, as you know, what goes down must come up. Inflation reared its ugly head, becoming a major economic headache. To combat rising prices, the Fed did a complete 180 and started aggressively raising interest rates.\n\nFast forward to October 2023, and we saw mortgage rates skyrocket to nearly 7.80%. Ouch! That's a massive jump, and it understandably threw a bucket of ice-cold water on the housing market. Suddenly, homes became significantly less affordable, and many would-be buyers were sidelined.\n\nIn 2024, we saw a bit of a breather. Inflation started to cool down, inching closer to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. The central bank even started to hint at potential rate cuts. While the Fed did reduce its benchmark rate by a full percentage point in 2024, those cuts didn't translate directly into a huge drop in mortgage rates.\n\nLong-term yields, which influence mortgage rates, kept fluctuating. As we entered January 2025, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was hovering just below 7%. Better than the peak, yes, but still a far cry from those sweet pre-pandemic days.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Crystal Ball: What to Expect in 2025 and 2026\n\nSo, where do we go from here? This is where Morgan Stanley\u2019s forecast comes into play. Their strategists, who spend their days analyzing economic trends and market movements, are predicting that mortgage rates could indeed go down in 2025. Their reasoning is tied to Treasury yields. Treasury yields are essentially the return you get on investments in US government debt, and they have a big influence on mortgage rates.\n\nMorgan Stanley believes that these yields could fall, which, in turn, could pull mortgage rates down with them. They also anticipate a slight easing of home prices due to an increase in housing supply.\n\nNow, it's important to manage expectations here. Morgan Stanley isn\u2019t saying we\u2019re going back to 3% mortgage rates anytime soon. The magnitude of the potential drop is still uncertain. Think of it as a gentle easing rather than a dramatic plunge.\n\nLooking further ahead to 2026, Morgan Stanley suggests that a slowing in US economic growth (GDP growth) could further push Treasury yields lower. If the economy cools down, it often leads to lower interest rates across the board. This could mean mortgage rates might see further declines in 2026, potentially improving housing affordability even more.\n\nHere's a quick summary of Morgan Stanley's forecast:\n\n2025: Mortgage rates could fall along with Treasury yields. Home prices may see a slight decrease due to increased housing supply.\n\nMortgage rates could fall along with Treasury yields. Home prices may see a slight decrease due to increased housing supply. 2026: Slower GDP growth could lead to further declines in Treasury yields and mortgage rates.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that these are forecasts, not guarantees. The economy is a complex beast, and many factors can influence interest rates. Geopolitical events, unexpected inflation spikes, and shifts in Fed policy can all throw a wrench into even the most well-thought-out predictions.\n\nWhat Does a Rate Drop Really Mean for Your Wallet?\n\nLet's talk real numbers. Even a small drop in mortgage rates can make a significant difference in your monthly payments and overall affordability. Morgan Stanley gives a great example:\n\nImagine a $1 million home.\n\nAt a 7% mortgage rate, your estimated monthly payment (principal and interest) would be around $5,322 .\n\nmortgage rate, your estimated monthly payment (principal and interest) would be around . If the rate drops to 6.25%, that monthly payment comes down to approximately $4,925.\n\nThat\u2019s a difference of roughly $397 per month! Over the life of a 30-year loan, that difference really adds up. It could be the difference between comfortably affording a home and feeling stretched too thin.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple table to illustrate the point further with varying home prices:\n\nHome Price 7% Mortgage Rate (Approx. Monthly Payment) 6.25% Mortgage Rate (Approx. Monthly Payment) Monthly Savings $500,000 $2,661 $2,463 $198 $750,000 $3,991 $3,694 $297 $1,000,000 $5,322 $4,925 $397 $1,500,000 $7,982 $7,388 $594\n\nThese are estimates and do not include property taxes, insurance, and other potential housing costs.\n\nAs you can see, even a 0.75% drop in mortgage rates can translate to hundreds of dollars in savings each month. For many families, that's a game-changer.\n\nHome Prices: Will They Cool Down Too?\n\nMortgage rates are only one piece of the affordability puzzle. Home prices are the other big factor. And let's be honest, home prices have been on a tear for the past few years. Morgan Stanley points out that average home prices are up about 30% since early 2020! That million-dollar home in 2019 could easily be listed for $1.3 million today. It's tough out there for buyers.\n\nOne of the reasons home prices have stayed stubbornly high, even with higher mortgage rates, is something called the \u201clock-in effect\u201d. Think about it: millions of homeowners locked in super-low mortgage rates during the pandemic. Why would they sell and give up that amazing rate to buy another home at today's higher rates? This has significantly reduced the number of existing homes on the market, keeping supply low and prices elevated.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley believes we could see some easing of home prices. They anticipate an increase in housing starts (new home construction) and new home sales in the coming years. More new homes being built and sold, along with potentially more turnover in existing homes, should gradually increase housing inventory. Increased inventory often puts downward pressure on prices, which could offer some relief to buyers.\n\nIt's not going to be a crash, though. Morgan Stanley is predicting a slight decrease in home prices, not a massive plunge. Don't expect to see 2019 prices again anytime soon. But any moderation in price growth would certainly be welcome.\n\nIs Now the Right Time to Jump into the Market?\n\nThis is the million-dollar question, isn\u2019t it? \u201cIs now the right time to buy a home?\u201d Honestly, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. As Morgan Stanley rightly says, it\u2019s both an economic and a personal decision.\n\nEconomically, waiting for mortgage rates to potentially come down further in 2025 and 2026 makes sense for many. If you can hold off and rates do ease, you could save significantly on your monthly payments and increase your buying power. And if home prices moderate slightly, that\u2019s even better.\n\nHowever, life isn\u2019t always about perfect timing. Maybe you're a young couple starting a family and need to be in a specific school district now. Maybe you're a retiree ready to buy that dream vacation home and enjoy it while you can. These personal factors can outweigh the economic considerations.\n\nMany buyers today are also banking on the idea of refinancing down the road. The hope is that mortgage rates will eventually fall further, allowing them to refinance their current mortgage at a lower rate and reduce their monthly payments. This strategy can make it easier to stomach a slightly higher rate now, knowing you might be able to improve your situation later.\n\nHere are some things to consider when deciding if now is the right time for you to buy:\n\nYour Financial Situation: Are you financially ready to buy? Do you have a solid down payment, good credit, and comfortable debt-to-income ratio?\n\nAre you financially ready to buy? Do you have a solid down payment, good credit, and comfortable debt-to-income ratio?

Personal Comfort Level: Are you comfortable with current mortgage rates and home prices, even if they don't drop dramatically?\n\nPersonally, based on what I'm seeing, I think we're entering a period of more stability in the housing market, albeit at a higher plateau than we were used to pre-pandemic. The days of rock-bottom rates are likely behind us for now, but the extreme volatility we saw in the past few years might also be easing. If you find a home you love and it fits within your budget, and you\u2019re in it for the long haul, then waiting for the absolute perfect moment might mean missing out.\n\nTalk to the Experts\n\nNavigating the housing market can be complex, especially with fluctuating mortgage rates and prices. This is where getting professional advice is crucial. Morgan Stanley suggests speaking with a financial advisor to understand your financing options and how current market conditions fit into your overall financial plan. They can help you evaluate different mortgage scenarios, assess your affordability, and make informed decisions tailored to your unique circumstances.\n\nDon't go it alone! Reach out to a qualified financial advisor and mortgage professional. They can provide personalized guidance and help you navigate the path to homeownership with confidence.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nWill mortgage rates go down in 2025? Morgan Stanley believes it's possible. They forecast a potential easing of rates alongside Treasury yields and a slight moderation in home prices due to increased housing supply. While a return to pre-pandemic affordability is unlikely, any decrease in mortgage rates would be a welcome relief for homebuyers. Ultimately, the decision to buy a home is a personal one, balancing economic factors with your individual needs and circumstances. Stay informed, do your research, and seek expert advice to make the best choices for your financial future.",

            "content": "Stocks have been crushed in recent weeks, but Wall Street forecasters think the worst may be over.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Citi said they saw 5,500 as the floor for the S&P 500.\n\nBoth banks are sticking to their year-end price target of 6,500, implying about 15% upside.\n\nThe worst of the stock market sell-off looks like it's just about over.\n\nThat's according to top Wall Street forecasters who say they expect a more positive trajectory for stocks after the latest tariff-induced decline.\n\nConcerns surrounding President Donald Trump's trade war and the prospect of a recession in the US helped wipe away about $5 trillion in market cap in the S&P 500 in recent weeks, taking the benchmark index solidly into correctional territory. Stocks capped off their worst weekly performance in two years last Friday. But Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts said the market may have found a bottom.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said there are five reasons the sell-off appears to be over and stocks should start to recover.\n\nFirst, the bank said major stock averages entered oversold territory last week. The S&P 500 traded close to 5,500 on Thursday, at the low end of the bank's expected trading range for the index in the first half of 2025.\n\nSecond, sentiment and positioning gauges for the benchmark index have started to \"lighten up considerably,\" a sign more upside is on the way.\n\nThird, seasonal indicators look like they've improved going into the second half of the month.\n\nFourth, the US dollar has weakened in recent weeks, which could spark a wave of positive corporate earnings revisions as companies log stronger sales in overseas markets.\n\nFinally, lower interest rates this year could help boost economic surprise indexes in the US, which could also help send stocks higher, the bank said.\n\n\"We stand by our call from last week that 5,500 should provide support for a tradable rally led by cyclical, lower quality, and expensive growth stocks that have been hit the hardest and where the short base is the greatest. Friday's price action seems to support that call,\" Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, wrote on Monday.\n\nCiti seemed to agree.\n\nAnalysts said the latest sell-off had taken the S&P 500 to a healthier valuation. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks also appear more \"rationally valued,\" the bank said. The group of top tech stocks now accounts for about 9 percentage points of the S&P 500's total return since December 2023, down significantly from last year's highs.\n\nThe S&P 500 is also down 10% from its record high in February. The decline is balancing the risk-reward of stocks \"to the upside,\" analysts said.\n\n\"This past week, we drew a line in the sand at 5,500 as a level where the risk-reward begins to skew more favorably,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Longer-term, we remain fundamentally constructive on the S&P 500 setup as productivity improvement, AI promise, operating leverage, shareholder influences, and ongoing business model maturation elements better describe our view of US exceptionalism,\" they added.\n\nCiti's positive outlook is notable given that the bank recently also recalibrated its view of US stocks, downgrading the market to \"neutral,\" while boosting its view of Chinese equities to \"overweight.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley and Citi analysts are sticking to year-end price targets of 6,500 for the benchmark index. That would be a gain of about 15% by the end of 2025.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe bear case\n\nSome pessimism, though, is still percolating on Wall Street as traders eye the potential for a growth slowdown in the US.\n\nIn recent days, Goldman Sachs and RBC have downgraded their price targets for the S&P 500 to 6,200.\n\nWhile not its base case, Citi said it thought the S&P 500 could fall as low as 5,100, assuming that policy uncertainty and growth fears would continue to weigh on sentiment.\n\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, thinks the index could drop as low as 4,600 in the event of a recession, an 18% decline from Monday's levels.\n\n\"We also think it's important for the S&P 500 to respond to the ~5500 level given the fundamental and technical support there. If it doesn't, that's a potential sign that growth could be deteriorating faster than expected, and recession risk could be increasing along with the odds of our bear case outcome,\" analysts said.\n\nOne thing seems clear: Markets shouldn't expect the Trump administration to swoop in and save stocks anytime soon. The president's team has repeatedly indicated that it isn't focused on markets, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that he was \"not at all\" concerned about the recent drop in stocks.\n\n\"I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal. What's not healthy is straight up,\" Bessent told NBC over the weekend, adding that he believed the market would perform \"great\" over the long term.\n\nHis remarks came a week after Trump refused to rule out a US recession as a result of the administration's policies.",

As executives primarily concerned with managing the company's financial affairs, CFOs would be hard-pressed to turn down initiatives that save their companies money.\n\nLarge corporations such as Coca-Cola and the NBA are making strides toward embracing more sustainable practices. The NBA is coordinating game schedules to reduce unnecessary travel between cities, while Coca-Cola is supporting plastic waste management efforts in Asia, where plastic waste is prevalent.\n\nData from the joint survey also revealed that while CFOs recognize their companies' potential savings from sustainability initiatives, many are still wary of larger structural sustainability projects that would require more substantial investments.\n\nHowever, CFOs must consider and invest in sustainability solutions to \"future-proof\" operations, particularly in meeting changing environmental regulatory standards. Making sustainability investments today means preparing companies for tomorrow.\n\nAs the world shifts toward a cleaner economy, investors are following suit. A Morgan Stanley report found that investors have a growing interest in sustainability investing, or supporting companies that demonstrate responsibility to effect positive (environmental) change in the world. A company's environmental, social, and governance metrics help investors determine whether a company is worth investing in.\n\nThe shift away from dirty energy and toward clean energy and sustainability is undeniable. Positioning companies to ride this wave is financially smart in the long run.\n\n\"These investors express a desire for their investments to advance positive environmental and social impact, creating opportunities for finance professionals to meet these needs,\" said Jessica Alsford, Morgan Stanley's chief sustainability officer, per Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"When done right, sustainability is good for business,\" Beth Bovis, global lead for sustainability at Kearney, said, per FinTech.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "FedEx's Third Quarter Results Awaited Amid Investor Optimism\n\nFedEx Corporation (FDX), a global leader in the shipping industry, is poised to announce its fiscal third-quarter results, with most analysts holding a positive outlook on the company's stock. Of the 15 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 12 have rated FedEx as a 'buy', two as a 'hold', and one as a 'sell', projecting an average price target of $318.60. This figure is significantly above last Friday's closing price of just over $241, suggesting a potential upside of over 31%. More details can be found in the original article.\n\nIndexBox data supports the expectation of a 20% rise in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $4.64 and a 1% increase in revenue to $21.97 billion compared to the previous year. Such an outcome would break the trend of revenue declines seen in eight of the last nine quarters, a challenge that FedEx shared with its competitor, UPS, due to reduced post-pandemic demand.\n\nDespite some resistance from Morgan Stanley analysts, who maintain an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target on FedEx shares, most view the anticipated results positively. The caution from Morgan Stanley hinges on an observed 'solid peak season but no major acceleration in underlying demand'. They also point out the ongoing impact of FedEx's restructuring efforts, including the company's DRIVE program aiming for $2.2 billion in cost reductions, which they predict may not yield as much benefit in the third quarter as initially hoped.\n\nLast quarter, FedEx missed earnings estimates and declared intentions to spin off its FedEx Freight segment, a move debated by Citi analysts as potentially unlocking value. The company's stock, having dropped 5% over the last 12 months, recently hit its lowest level in over a year, putting pressure on FedEx to deliver favorable results in its upcoming report.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

Senior executives from some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, including BlackRock, Pacific Investment Management Company, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone, attended the session.\n\n\"State affairs have remained stable over the past two and a half months under acting President Choi Sang-mok\u2019s leadership,\" the ambassador told investors, adding, \"Korea\u2019s financial and foreign exchange markets are swiftly rebounding, with a robust economic system effectively managing political risks.\"\n\nThe New York session followed Choi\u2019s earlier meetings with Asian investors in Singapore and Hong Kong in February as part of the government\u2019s efforts to address concerns about the country\u2019s economic stability following President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s martial law enactment in December and the ongoing impeachment trial.\n\nDuring the briefing, the ambassador highlighted key indicators of Korea\u2019s economic strength. \"Korea maintains strong external credibility,\" he said, noting that major rating agencies have upheld its sovereign rating, with Fitch reaffirming \"AA-\" last month.\n\nHe also stressed Korea\u2019s solid fundamentals, including the world\u2019s ninth-largest foreign exchange reserves, sixth-largest export volume and a $100 billion trade surplus. Korea's external payment capacity is strengthening, he added, with net external financial assets recently reaching a record $1.1 trillion.\n\nAsked about Korea's response to higher US tariffs, Choi said, \"We will address any misunderstandings through various channels and engage in discussions on sectors of key US interests, such as shipbuilding and energy, to ensure mutual benefit.\" He noted that, under the Korea-US free trade agreement, the applied tariff rate on Korean imports from the US stood at 0.79 percent in 2024.\n\nChoi reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to enhancing market value and accessibility. \"As with the World Government Bond Index inclusion, we expect Korea to naturally gain entry into Morgan Stanley Capital International's developed market index over time.\" Last summer, FTSE Russell maintained Korea\u2019s MSCI emerging market status.\n\nThe ambassador also held separate meetings with top financial institutions in New York. Speaking with FTSE CEO Fiona Bassett, he discussed Korea's preparations ahead of WGBI inclusion in November, while also briefing MSCI executives on the government's capital market reforms.\n\nThe ministry highlighted Choi's meeting with Evan Russo, CEO of New York-based Lazard Asset Management, who expressed the firm\u2019s commitment to expanding investments in Korea, noting that many capital market issues have been resolved.\n\nRusso also underscored Korea\u2019s key position in the global supply chain, stressing that the country should leverage this advantage in negotiations with the US to secure a stronger position over other nations.\n\nThe ministry added Choi would maintain engagement with global investors and visit additional countries, including Japan, ahead of the final WGBI review in April.\n\nBy Choi Ji-won (jwc@heraldcorp.com)",

The U.S. struggles to keep pace, exemplified by Syrah Resources Limited (ASX: SYR), whose Mozambique graphite mine faced market pressures and operational disruptions due to Chinese competition, policy inconsistencies, and local protests. In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) notably downgraded Vietnam\u2019s rare earth reserves from 22 million to 3.5 million metric tons, significantly altering its global ranking, though Vietnam continues to strengthen its trade relationship with the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing forward initiatives to boost domestic critical minerals production, including plans for Pentagon-managed refining facilities on military bases and appointing a critical minerals \u201cczar.\u201d Concurrently, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) anticipates the potential designation of copper as a critical mineral, seeking significant tax credits to enhance production, as Goldman Sachs forecasts substantial increases in U.S. copper imports ahead of potential tariffs. Revex Technologies Inc. secured a substantial $145 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to produce nickel and other critical minerals sustainably in northern Michigan, reinforcing U.S. efforts towards securing critical mineral independence.\n\nGeopolitical instability continues to affect critical minerals supply chains, as demonstrated by the M23 rebel group\u2019s significant revenue from coltan mining in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, amounting to $800,000 monthly. While the U.S. expresses openness toward new partnerships with the DRC, particularly in minerals-for-security deals, the challenges of instability and existing Chinese dominance remain significant. Uzbekistan also announced a $2.6-billion initiative targeting strategic minerals like lithium and vanadium, presenting further opportunities for U.S. collaboration. Additionally, leading technology firms including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Dow publicly endorsed tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050 to address future energy demands sustainably, aligning industry interests with broader international energy security goals.\n\nThe critical minerals pricing chart is supplied by the CMI Partners \u2013 MineralPrices.com\n\nThe Technology Metals Report (TMR) is a weekly compilation of the top stories selected by the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) Board of Directors.

Despite this, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, continues to use these resources as leverage in ongoing negotiations to prevent further tariffs on products like meat and pharmaceuticals. Foreign Minister Penny Wong confirmed the proposal involved secure supply arrangements for the U.S. The Australian government remains committed to strengthening supply chains and attracting U.S. investment in critical minerals, maintaining it as a key negotiation point.\n\nU.S. agency slashes its estimate of Vietnam\u2019s rare earth reserves in major revision (March 12, 2025, Source) The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) drastically reduced its estimate of Vietnam\u2019s rare earth reserves from 22 million to 3.5 million metric tons, dropping the country\u2019s global ranking from second to sixth behind China, Brazil, India, Australia, and Russia. This revision, based on new government information, could impact Vietnam\u2019s technological ambitions. Despite highlighting its rare earth potential, Vietnam\u2019s actual production remains limited, with only 300 tons extracted last year. Meanwhile, Vietnam continues strengthening ties with the U.S., expecting to sign new agreements on trade and critical minerals during Trade Minister Nguyen Hong Dien\u2019s upcoming visit.\n\nRebel group M23 hits mining jackpot in DRC, generating $800 000 per month (March 12, 2025, Source) The M23 rebel group has gained control of significant territories in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including the region\u2019s largest coltan mine in North Kivu province. Since their resurgence in 2021, the group has established its own administrative structures in these areas, imposing high taxes on natural resources and trade. With the Rubaya mine as a focal point, M23 generates approximately $800,000 monthly from coltan mining. They also tax each truck traveling to Rwanda and have initiated recruitment efforts to strengthen their forces. The region remains economically dependent on both imports from and exports to Rwanda. Despite M23 providing some security improvements, they have also enforced unpaid community service, sparking mixed reactions among the locals.\n\nChina still leads the pack in Africa\u2019s critical minerals race as US struggles to keep up (March 12, 2025, Source) China has effectively capitalized on its early investments in Africa\u2019s critical minerals sector, significantly outpacing the United States in the race for resources essential for high-tech and renewable energy industries. From the Democratic Republic of Congo to Botswana and Zimbabwe, Chinese companies have committed over $10 billion since 2023 in acquiring mines and processing facilities. This strategic positioning, aimed at securing a steady supply chain and enhancing its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in electric vehicles and solar panels, has heightened geopolitical and economic competition, particularly as the U.S. attempts to formulate a coherent strategy to counter China\u2019s dominance.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta and Dow back goal to triple nuclear capacity (March 12, 2025, Source) At CERAWeek 2025 in Houston, Texas, major technology companies and energy users, including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Dow, endorsed a pledge to support the tripling of global nuclear capacity by 2050. This commitment, dubbed the Large Energy Users Pledge, aligns with earlier commitments from countries, nuclear industry players, and global financial institutions. The pledge acknowledges the anticipated increase in energy demand across various industries due to economic growth, emphasizing nuclear energy\u2019s role in providing reliable, clean power irrespective of environmental conditions. The signatories advocate for equitable financing for nuclear projects to facilitate global deployment and urge other large energy consumers to join the initiative.\n\nBrazil, U.S. reignite critical mineral exploration efforts (March 11, 2025, Source) Brazil and the U.S. are resuming joint efforts to explore critical minerals like rare earths, lithium, tin, and cassiterite within Brazil, across three specified regions. This collaboration, reinitiated at the PDAC 2025 in Toronto, continues under a previously signed agreement, despite a temporary suspension by the Trump administration which was later overturned by a U.S. Supreme Court decision. The project includes fieldwork, sample analysis, and training initiatives, with a focus on scientific cooperation and future large-scale projects. The partnership emphasizes reducing U.S. reliance on foreign critical minerals, particularly from China, enhancing strategic resource security.\n\nWhy the U.S. Keeps Losing to China in the Battle Over Critical Minerals (March 11, 2025, Source) Syrah Resources Limited (ASX: SYR), an Australian mining firm, launched a graphite mine in Mozambique and a processing plant in Louisiana with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on China, which dominates the global supply of critical battery-grade graphite. Despite significant U.S. government support and a deal with Tesla, Syrah struggled when China increased graphite production, flooding the market and reducing prices. Additionally, U.S. policy delays and rule changes undermined Syrah\u2019s efforts by allowing continued imports of cheaper Chinese graphite. Local protests in Mozambique further disrupted operations. These challenges reflect broader issues faced by Western mining companies, such as policy inconsistencies, competitive disadvantages in high-risk regions, and the difficulty in competing with China\u2019s price control and rapid production capabilities.\n\nGoldman Sachs anticipates surge in US copper net imports (March 11, 2025, Source) Goldman Sachs predicts a significant increase in U.S. net copper imports, ranging from 50% to 100%, in response to anticipated higher domestic prices and before potential tariffs from the Trump administration. Currently, May 2025 U.S. copper prices are $756 per metric ton higher than the London Metal Exchange (LME) global benchmark. Although no specific tariffs have been proposed yet, Goldman Sachs expects a 25% duty on copper imports by the end of the year. This anticipation is likely to cause a surge in imports and a boost in U.S. copper inventories from 95,000 tons to 300,000-400,000 tons by the end of Q3, representing up to 60% of global inventories. Additionally, a global copper deficit of 180,000 tons is forecasted for 2025 due to increased demand and slow mine supply growth.\n\nUSGS projects world production capacity for 7 critical minerals and helium from 2025 to 2029 (March 11, 2025, Source) The USGS has released the first World Minerals Outlook, forecasting global production capacity for seven critical minerals and helium from 2025 to 2029. The report highlights a projected doubling in the production capacity for lithium and cobalt, crucial for battery technology, while expecting stable production for gallium, palladium, platinum, and helium. This outlook is part of a broader initiative under the Energy Act of 2020 to analyze production, consumption, and recycling trends for critical minerals. The methodology includes analyzing new and ending projects, accounting for idled capacities, and using conservative estimates when data is sparse. The outlook aims to guide U.S. policy and industry responses to supply chain vulnerabilities and market demands.\n\nWhy Ukraine hopes Trump minerals deal will win back US support (March 11, 2025, Source) Senior Ukrainian and US officials are meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss a ceasefire framework for Ukraine, with Kyiv aiming to restore strained relations with Washington. Ukraine seeks US investment through a proposed critical minerals deal, offering 50% profit-sharing to attract American companies. This initiative, centered around Ukraine\u2019s graphite reserves, aims to strengthen economic ties and potentially deter future Russian aggression. However, the US, under President Trump, has withheld military assurances, urging Ukrainians to compromise. Kyiv hopes the economic partnership will revitalize industries disrupted by war and secure US political and economic support.\n\nTrump seeks minerals refining on Pentagon bases to boost US output, sources say (March 10, 2025, Source) President Donald Trump seeks to boost domestic production of critical minerals by ordering the Pentagon to build refining facilities on military bases, sources say. The plan, part of an upcoming executive order, addresses concerns about China\u2019s dominance in minerals processing essential for weapons production. Trump also plans to appoint a critical minerals \u201cczar\u201d and expand the FAST-41 permitting process for mines. The initiative, however, does not involve creating a strategic mineral stockpile, imposing a \u201cBuy American\u201d mandate, or significantly reforming federal mine permitting processes, although minor expansions to expedite permitting are considered.\n\nUzbekistan launches drive to develop minerals & mining sector (March 10, 2025, Source) Uzbekistan recently announced a $2.6-billion initiative aimed at expanding its mineral and mining sector, potentially offering new opportunities for U.S. companies seeking access to critical minerals. The plan, introduced by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, covers 76 projects involving 28 strategic elements such as tungsten, lithium, titanium, and vanadium. Goals include increased geological prospecting, creation of technology hubs, and domestic manufacturing of high-tech products. U.S. officials previously emphasized collaboration through dialogues and agreements, including a 2024 memorandum of understanding. The initiative aligns with ongoing American interests to diversify rare-earth supplies and reduce dependency on China.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan hopes Trump declares copper a critical mineral (March 10, 2025, Source) Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) CEO Kathleen Quirk expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will designate copper as a critical mineral, which would enable significant tax credits under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, enhancing American copper production. Trump recently hinted at expanding critical mineral production, although details remain unspecified. Copper, extensively used in various industries, is not currently on the U.S. critical minerals list, which includes 50 other minerals. Designation as a critical mineral would financially benefit Freeport, potentially increasing its tax credits by over $500 million annually. Additionally, Trump is considering new tariffs on copper imports to bolster U.S. production.\n\nRevex Technologies Received $145 Million Contracted Grant Award from The U.S. Department of Energy for the Production of Critical Minerals (March 10, 2025, Source) Revex Technologies Inc. has been awarded a $145 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy to support the REV Nickel Project in northern Michigan, in partnership with Eagle Mine. This funding is part of the U.S. government\u2019s efforts under Executive Orders 14156 and 14154 to enhance national energy and critical minerals production. The project aims to produce sustainable nickel concentrate and other critical minerals using innovative processing solutions from waste sources like mine tailings and spent lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, the project will create new clean-tech jobs and engage in community and environmental benefit programs. The first product is expected within 20 months, contributing significantly to the domestic supply of nickel for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nUS open to minerals partnerships with Democratic Republic of Congo (March 9, 2025, Source) The United States is open to forming critical minerals partnerships with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), following outreach from Congolese officials proposing a minerals-for-security deal amid regional instability caused by Rwanda-backed rebels. The DRC, rich in cobalt, lithium, and uranium, seeks diversified partnerships and increased U.S. investment. Informal discussions have begun, though no detailed proposals have been publicly shared. Experts note U.S. private sector involvement would differ significantly from China\u2019s current dominance, requiring creative approaches since the U.S. lacks state-owned mining firms and currently has no active mining companies in Congo.\n\nInvestor.News Media Highlights\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \u2013 Where will the metals for the robot revolution come from? https://bit.ly/4bQlfhe\n\nMarch 12, 2025 \u2013 Notes/thoughts from PDAC 2025: Goldbug lives matter, everything else is just a critical mineral https://bit.ly/4218LjA\n\nInvestor.News Video Highlights\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \u2013 Mark Chalmers of Energy Fuels Highlights Strategy for U.S. Leadership in the Uranium and Critical Mineral Market https://youtu.be/xir_lBJc9Lo\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \u2013 Rare Element Resources\u2019 Jaye Pickarts on Driving American Rare Earths Independence with Wyoming\u2019s Bear Lodge Project and Innovative Proprietary Processing Technology https://youtu.be/fqSXstmCM54\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \u2013 WEALTH (WCPD Inc.)

Weaver says the list is comprised of companies with stable profits and solid business models, factors that make these quality stocks.\n\nIn a note to clients, Weaver and her team warn that selling out of stocks now could be a mistake as most corrections don\u2019t become full-blown bear markets. And while the U.S. economy is slowing, it remains healthy. Instead, Morgan Stanley encourages investors to focus on stocks with strong fundamentals such as positive earnings, low debt, and consistent dividend payouts.\n\nThe List\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s list includes several well-known technology stocks, as well as popular consumer brands and financials. Among the tech names are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nOutside of the technology sector, the investment bank likes reliable stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), and even luxury car maker Ferrari (RACE). Weaver says Ferrari exhibits many of the traits found in rock solid stocks, including a loyal customer base and predictable profits.\n\nMorgan Stanley also highlighted several stocks with cheap valuations, notably in the banking and financial sector. These include Citigroup (C) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG). Weaver stressed that Wall Street banks are expected to benefit from an eventual resumption in deals such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s own stock is down 8% so far this year.\n\nIs MS Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Morgan Stanley has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nCiti tapped Dipendra Malhotra, head of analytics, artificial intelligence and data at Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit, as head of wealth technology Monday. Malhotra will begin his new role in late May, CIO Jonathan Lofthouse said in an internal memo seen Wednesday by CIO Dive.\n\nMalhotra will report to Lofthouse and work closely with Eric Lordi, head of wealth platform and experience, and Joe Bonanno, head of data, analytics and innovation at the bank's wealth unit, the CIO said. Lofthouse became sole CIO at Citi in February, when the bank\u2019s co-CIO Shadman Zafar retired, a company spokesperson confirmed.\n\n\u201cDipendra brings a breadth of experience, having worked across complex technology stacks and client-centric products in wealth management,\u201d Lofthouse said in Wednesday\u2019s memo, noting the executive \u201cspearheaded the development and operations of critical wealth management data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, customer relationship management and marketing technology\u201d at Morgan Stanley.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nCiti\u2019s wealth unit turned a corner financially last year as the bank continued to invest aggressively in modernization.\n\nThe segment saw revenues grow 7% year over year under the leadership of wealth chief Andy Sieg, who came to Citi from Bank of America in 2023.\n\nTechnology has been a \u201climiting factor\u201d in Citi's wealth business, Sieg said in February, speaking at Bank of America's Securities Financial Services Conference. The executive said he sees technology \u2014 particularly AI \u2014 as an opportunity for the company to leapfrog forward.\n\n\u201cThe Citi-wide focus on topics like data and our overall technology architecture ... creates a tailwind for us, which is a good starting point,\u201d Sieg said. \u201cWe've got partners like Palantir and Google and Snowflake around our cloud architecture that are putting us in position to make progress, we think, in months, which once in my career would have been years of progress to move the platforms forward.\u201d\n\nSieg wasn\u2019t speaking out of turn.\n\nCiti has poured more than $30 billion into technology over the past three years to modernize infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls after what CEO Jane Fraser characterized as decades of underinvestment.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency slapped the bank with $135.6 million in penalties last year over data quality management deficiencies last year, a follow-on to 2020 consent orders that found the bank\u2019s risk management and internal controls lacking.\n\nCiti\u2019s data and infrastructure upgrades have spurred broader digital initiatives.\n\n\u201cThis transformation that Jane has been driving, in particular, has been focused on the quality of data inside Citi,\u201d Sieg said. \u201cFor us in Wealth, this is very fortuitous because starting with data and getting the data environment improved in this business, we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way \u2026 in terms of the experience that clients have as well as what it feels like for advisers and service personnel to work in this business.\u201d\n\nIn January, the company armed 30,000 of its developers with generative AI coding tools after cementing a multiyear partnership with Google Cloud to migrate applications and leverage the Vertex AI platform.\n\nFraser also reinforced the bank\u2019s technology leadership team last year, bringing in PwC veteran Tim Ryan to head technology and business enablement.\n\nSieg expressed confidence in Bonanno and Lordi, noting the two technologists had built AI platforms and driven digital experiences for other firms.\n\nLike Malhotra, Bonanno and Lordi previously held leadership roles at Morgan Stanley. Bonanno led analytics strategy and data architecture at the investment bank for four years prior to joining Citi in 2022. Lordi, whom Citi onboarded in January, previously served as managing director for the investment bank\u2019s wealth technology division.",

A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar\u2019s health has slumped more than 3% so far in 2025, the measure\u2019s worst year-to-date performance since 2008.\n\n\u201cFactors that had been seen as boosting US growth are now seen as potentially weighing on US growth,\u201d strategists including Matthew Hornbach and Andrew Watrous wrote in a note. \u201cThe prospect of a near-term US government shutdown could further weigh on the dollar broadly as investors estimate the implications for growth and future fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s bearish view on the dollar has stood out on Wall Street since late last year, when many banks were predicting continued strength in the currency. So far in 2025 the bank\u2019s thesis has been borne out.\n\nA slide in US bond yields as traders bet on more Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year \u2014 coupled with softer economic data and confusion surrounding the new administration\u2019s trade policies \u2014 has underpinned the greenback\u2019s turn of fortune since January.\n\nInvestors are closely watching spending deliberations in the US Congress ahead of the impending closure of the federal government on Saturday, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saying on Wednesday that his party would block a Republican spending bill.\n\nSince January, the firm has recommended going long the euro, pound and yen \u2014 all three of which have risen sharply against the dollar in recent weeks. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley updated the targets on those trade recommendations to include:\n\nLong yen targeting a roughly 2% move from current levels to 145\n\nLong euro targeting a roughly 3% rise to 1.12\n\nLong pound targeting a nearly 3% gain to 1.33\n\nThe yen has strengthened around 6.5% versus the dollar so far in 2025, outpacing nearly all of the US currency\u2019s major peers as investors bet on tighter monetary policy from the Bank of Japan \u2014 in sharp contrast to the easing cycles currently underway at other central banks, including the Federal Reserve.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley is continuing to iterate on its \u201cOld School Grit. New World Ideas\u201d campaign that looks to combine the financial marketer\u2019s legacy of determination with forward-thinking innovation. The brand\u2019s latest spot, \u201cBehind the Drive,\u201d is timed to The Players Championship, the so-called \u201cfifth major\u201d PGA tournament that begins Thursday (March 13).\n\nThe new ad focuses on the dedication demonstrated by a young golfer rather than spotlighting a professional, as last year\u2019s \u201cFrom Grit to Vision\u201d did with star Justin Rose. Morgan Stanley launched \u201cOld School Grit. New World Ideas\u201d in 2023, its first such global marketing effort since 2019.\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be really neat to not just talk about a famous PGA champion and what his journey was, but the journey of everyday children and the coaches that help them succeed in their journey to play the game of golf and to become leaders,\u201d said Morgan Stanley CMO Alice Milligan.\n\nThe 30-second spot will run in tandem with a 15-second version across online video, paid social, golf-specific digital publisher sponsorships and linear and streaming TV. In addition to its sports-focused message, the ad highlights Morgan Stanley\u2019s partnership with First Tee, a youth development organization that empowers children to develop life skills through the game of golf.\n\nMarketing Dive spoke with Milligan about how these purpose-driven efforts come alive in both ads and experiences, whether for fans or clients at the Players. The executive also discussed the brand\u2019s programming as part of its deal with upstart women\u2019s basketball league Unrivaled and other sport-focused initiatives.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMARKETING DIVE: What has Morgan Stanley learned from 10 years as a partner with The Players Championship? How do you take advantage of all the channels that live sports entails?\n\nALICE MILLIGAN: Every year we try to step up our game, as does the PGA, when it comes to the Players. Every year we leverage new marketing channels, we test new ways to expose the brand to the audiences. We\u2019re doing different things as it relates to where and how our logo shows up.\n\nWe\u2019re being smart about our advertising. In the beginning, we ran one ad and it became very monotonous. Now, we\u2019ll rotate through three different ads. We\u2019re doing a lot in terms of the activations. We\u2019ve really seen new ways to engage fans, whether they\u2019re there at the Players or they\u2019re at home.\n\nHow has new technology been a part of your efforts with the Players?\n\nWe try to push the envelope in terms of innovation and how we activate. We\u2019ve been really thoughtful about what we do. We try to do it in a way that it is complementary to the event, not a shiny pebble or technology for technology\u2019s sake.\n\nLast year, we did the \u201cTour Through Time\u201d through an augmented reality app. It was really well received. I think we had over 30,000 people engaged with that tool just during the week alone. It was amazing to see everybody get excited about it.\n\nThis year we\u2019re using artificial intelligence, where we\u2019re providing a tool for officials to map out the course setup. We took a little bit more of a data-driven and behind-the-scenes approach, but we\u2019re already seeing excitement from the officials and from the PGA about what this could mean to a very manual process. For me, the technology components are additive to the experience.\n\nHow do you figure out the best ways to partner with organizations like First Tee in a way that is meaningful?\n\nIn any partnership we do as a firm, the first thing is: Are the values of the organization consistent with our values? First Tee was a great example of that. The second thing is that financial services sometimes can be scary. Sometimes not everybody has access to the tools, the education, the mentoring and the coaching that\u2019s necessary to be successful in the space. That\u2019s what was happening also in the game of golf, especially as you think about diverse audiences, women, all of those things. The synergies between that organization and ours and the work that we could do together was really what drove that partnership.\n\nSpeaking of that, how is Morgan Stanley staying committed to diversity through marketing?\n\nOur brand believes that the thought leadership, the insight, the advice, the tools and financial empowerment are something that belongs to everybody. Ensuring that that access and opportunity exists universally is really what a lot of our sponsorships and our marketing is about, whether it\u2019s investing in women\u2019s sports or in coaching initiatives that help kids not only succeed in the game of golf, but also in life.\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do is break down barriers, not just for diverse groups, but for everyone who has a desire, a vision or a dream, and how they can use financial services and tools to empower and fuel that dream.\n\nIn that vein, can you talk more about the partnership with Unrivaled?\n\nMicky Lawler, who is the commissioner of the league, is somebody we worked with when we were doing the [Women\u2019s Tennis Association] partnership. In having conversations with her, what we saw was another opportunity to say, How do you coach, empower and guide these athletes in a way that\u2019s meaningful? Because they were doing something really new, innovative and visionary, we wanted to be a part of that, especially as you think about the \u201cNew World Ideas\u201d component of our brand campaign.\n\nUnrivaled has a new business model that is giving athletes a stake and a share in the equity of the league. This model is very new for the athletes and it opens a world of opportunity for them as individuals, business owners, entrepreneurs and investors. To be there to help them think through what the implications of being a partner in this league is, and how they could start to establish their own financial empowerment through this process, was really compelling to us.",

            "content": "Are you dreaming of owning a home, but those mortgage rates are making you sweat? You're not alone. Everyone's wondering the same thing: Will mortgage rates go down in 2025? If you're looking for a straightforward answer right away, based on the latest insights from financial giant Morgan Stanley, then yes, there's a good chance mortgage rates could ease down in 2025.\n\nHowever, don't expect a sudden plunge back to those ultra-low pandemic rates we saw a few years ago. It's more nuanced than that, and understanding the details is key to making smart home buying decisions. Let\u2019s dive into what Morgan Stanley is predicting and what it really means for you and your homeownership dreams.\n\nWill Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2025: Morgan Stanley's Forecast\n\nThe Wild Ride of Mortgage Rates: A Quick Recap\n\nTo really get where we're going, we need a quick look back at how we got here. Remember just a few years ago, during the peak of the pandemic? It felt like interest rates were practically giving money away! The Federal Reserve, or \u201cthe Fed\u201d as they're commonly known, slashed interest rates to near zero to keep the economy afloat.\n\nThis sent 30-year mortgage rates tumbling to a historic low of around 2.65% in early 2021. It was a crazy time \u2013 everyone was refinancing, and the housing market went absolutely bonkers. If you blinked, houses were selling for way over asking price!\n\nBut, as you know, what goes down must come up. Inflation reared its ugly head, becoming a major economic headache. To combat rising prices, the Fed did a complete 180 and started aggressively raising interest rates.\n\nFast forward to October 2023, and we saw mortgage rates skyrocket to nearly 7.80%. Ouch! That's a massive jump, and it understandably threw a bucket of ice-cold water on the housing market. Suddenly, homes became significantly less affordable, and many would-be buyers were sidelined.\n\nIn 2024, we saw a bit of a breather. Inflation started to cool down, inching closer to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. The central bank even started to hint at potential rate cuts. While the Fed did reduce its benchmark rate by a full percentage point in 2024, those cuts didn't translate directly into a huge drop in mortgage rates.\n\nLong-term yields, which influence mortgage rates, kept fluctuating. As we entered January 2025, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was hovering just below 7%. Better than the peak, yes, but still a far cry from those sweet pre-pandemic days.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Crystal Ball: What to Expect in 2025 and 2026\n\nSo, where do we go from here? This is where Morgan Stanley\u2019s forecast comes into play. Their strategists, who spend their days analyzing economic trends and market movements, are predicting that mortgage rates could indeed go down in 2025. Their reasoning is tied to Treasury yields. Treasury yields are essentially the return you get on investments in US government debt, and they have a big influence on mortgage rates.\n\nMorgan Stanley believes that these yields could fall, which, in turn, could pull mortgage rates down with them. They also anticipate a slight easing of home prices due to an increase in housing supply.\n\nNow, it's important to manage expectations here. Morgan Stanley isn\u2019t saying we\u2019re going back to 3% mortgage rates anytime soon. The magnitude of the potential drop is still uncertain. Think of it as a gentle easing rather than a dramatic plunge.\n\nLooking further ahead to 2026, Morgan Stanley suggests that a slowing in US economic growth (GDP growth) could further push Treasury yields lower. If the economy cools down, it often leads to lower interest rates across the board. This could mean mortgage rates might see further declines in 2026, potentially improving housing affordability even more.\n\nHere's a quick summary of Morgan Stanley's forecast:\n\n2025: Mortgage rates could fall along with Treasury yields. Home prices may see a slight decrease due to increased housing supply.\n\nMortgage rates could fall along with Treasury yields. Home prices may see a slight decrease due to increased housing supply. 2026: Slower GDP growth could lead to further declines in Treasury yields and mortgage rates.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that these are forecasts, not guarantees. The economy is a complex beast, and many factors can influence interest rates. Geopolitical events, unexpected inflation spikes, and shifts in Fed policy can all throw a wrench into even the most well-thought-out predictions.\n\nWhat Does a Rate Drop Really Mean for Your Wallet?\n\nLet's talk real numbers. Even a small drop in mortgage rates can make a significant difference in your monthly payments and overall affordability. Morgan Stanley gives a great example:\n\nImagine a $1 million home.\n\nAt a 7% mortgage rate, your estimated monthly payment (principal and interest) would be around $5,322 .\n\nmortgage rate, your estimated monthly payment (principal and interest) would be around . If the rate drops to 6.25%, that monthly payment comes down to approximately $4,925.\n\nThat\u2019s a difference of roughly $397 per month! Over the life of a 30-year loan, that difference really adds up. It could be the difference between comfortably affording a home and feeling stretched too thin.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple table to illustrate the point further with varying home prices:\n\nHome Price 7% Mortgage Rate (Approx. Monthly Payment) 6.25% Mortgage Rate (Approx. Monthly Payment) Monthly Savings $500,000 $2,661 $2,463 $198 $750,000 $3,991 $3,694 $297 $1,000,000 $5,322 $4,925 $397 $1,500,000 $7,982 $7,388 $594\n\nThese are estimates and do not include property taxes, insurance, and other potential housing costs.\n\nAs you can see, even a 0.75% drop in mortgage rates can translate to hundreds of dollars in savings each month. For many families, that's a game-changer.\n\nHome Prices: Will They Cool Down Too?\n\nMortgage rates are only one piece of the affordability puzzle. Home prices are the other big factor. And let's be honest, home prices have been on a tear for the past few years. Morgan Stanley points out that average home prices are up about 30% since early 2020! That million-dollar home in 2019 could easily be listed for $1.3 million today. It's tough out there for buyers.\n\nOne of the reasons home prices have stayed stubbornly high, even with higher mortgage rates, is something called the \u201clock-in effect\u201d. Think about it: millions of homeowners locked in super-low mortgage rates during the pandemic. Why would they sell and give up that amazing rate to buy another home at today's higher rates? This has significantly reduced the number of existing homes on the market, keeping supply low and prices elevated.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley believes we could see some easing of home prices. They anticipate an increase in housing starts (new home construction) and new home sales in the coming years. More new homes being built and sold, along with potentially more turnover in existing homes, should gradually increase housing inventory. Increased inventory often puts downward pressure on prices, which could offer some relief to buyers.\n\nIt's not going to be a crash, though. Morgan Stanley is predicting a slight decrease in home prices, not a massive plunge. Don't expect to see 2019 prices again anytime soon. But any moderation in price growth would certainly be welcome.\n\nIs Now the Right Time to Jump into the Market?\n\nThis is the million-dollar question, isn\u2019t it? \u201cIs now the right time to buy a home?\u201d Honestly, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. As Morgan Stanley rightly says, it\u2019s both an economic and a personal decision.\n\nEconomically, waiting for mortgage rates to potentially come down further in 2025 and 2026 makes sense for many. If you can hold off and rates do ease, you could save significantly on your monthly payments and increase your buying power. And if home prices moderate slightly, that\u2019s even better.\n\nHowever, life isn\u2019t always about perfect timing. Maybe you're a young couple starting a family and need to be in a specific school district now. Maybe you're a retiree ready to buy that dream vacation home and enjoy it while you can. These personal factors can outweigh the economic considerations.\n\nMany buyers today are also banking on the idea of refinancing down the road. The hope is that mortgage rates will eventually fall further, allowing them to refinance their current mortgage at a lower rate and reduce their monthly payments. This strategy can make it easier to stomach a slightly higher rate now, knowing you might be able to improve your situation later.\n\nHere are some things to consider when deciding if now is the right time for you to buy:\n\nYour Financial Situation: Are you financially ready to buy? Do you have a solid down payment, good credit, and comfortable debt-to-income ratio?\n\nAre you financially ready to buy?

Personal Comfort Level: Are you comfortable with current mortgage rates and home prices, even if they don't drop dramatically?\n\nPersonally, based on what I'm seeing, I think we're entering a period of more stability in the housing market, albeit at a higher plateau than we were used to pre-pandemic. The days of rock-bottom rates are likely behind us for now, but the extreme volatility we saw in the past few years might also be easing. If you find a home you love and it fits within your budget, and you\u2019re in it for the long haul, then waiting for the absolute perfect moment might mean missing out.\n\nTalk to the Experts\n\nNavigating the housing market can be complex, especially with fluctuating mortgage rates and prices. This is where getting professional advice is crucial. Morgan Stanley suggests speaking with a financial advisor to understand your financing options and how current market conditions fit into your overall financial plan. They can help you evaluate different mortgage scenarios, assess your affordability, and make informed decisions tailored to your unique circumstances.\n\nDon't go it alone! Reach out to a qualified financial advisor and mortgage professional. They can provide personalized guidance and help you navigate the path to homeownership with confidence.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nWill mortgage rates go down in 2025? Morgan Stanley believes it's possible. They forecast a potential easing of rates alongside Treasury yields and a slight moderation in home prices due to increased housing supply. While a return to pre-pandemic affordability is unlikely, any decrease in mortgage rates would be a welcome relief for homebuyers. Ultimately, the decision to buy a home is a personal one, balancing economic factors with your individual needs and circumstances. Stay informed, do your research, and seek expert advice to make the best choices for your financial future.",

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nInvesting in smaller companies involves greater risks not associated with investing in more established companies, such as business risk, significant stock price fluctuations and illiquidity.\n\nStocks of medium-sized companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful.

            "content": "Dipendra Malhotra is joining Citi as its head of wealth technology, Business Insider has learned.\n\nMalhotra spent 11 years at Morgan Stanley leading AI and tech for its wealth business.\n\nCiti's wealth business has been dragged down by its poor tech and operating platform.\n\nCiti's wealth boss, Andy Sieg, is bringing in a Morgan Stanley technology leader to strengthen the bank's offering in the ultra-competitive race to manage wealth clients' money.\n\nThe bank has hired Dipendra Malhotra as head of wealth technology, according to a person familiar with the matter. Malhotra is joining Citi in late-May after 11 years at its rival, Morgan Stanley, where he led the bank's AI, machine learning, analytics, and data for its wealth management business.\n\nImproving technology and digital offerings within Citi's wealth management unit has been a top priority for Sieg, who Citi CEO Jane Fraser tapped in 2023 to turn the wealth unit around. Citibank has struggled with its tech over the years, a problem that has extended to its wealth business. An internal audit conducted by Ernst & Young estimated that it would cost the bank at least $500 million to fix its patchwork of tech systems, Business Insider reported last year.\n\nStill, it's an area where Sieg is hoping to gain some ground.\n\nCiti's technology and operating platform \"has been a limiting factor in this business,\" Sieg said at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference in February. He has confidence that Fraser's transformation initiative, and its focus on data quality, is fortuitous for his business, adding that \"we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way to put work\" for both clients and advisors.\n\nWhile at Morgan Stanley, Malhotra was responsible for developing and maintaining data, AI, and machine learning tech for its wealth business. Morgan Stanley made headlines as one of the first Wall Street firms to partner with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which has afforded its financial advisors with generative AI tools to help lessen drudge work.\n\nWhen Malhotra joins Citi in a few months, he'll report directly to its chief information officer, Jonathan Lofthouse. Lofthouse became the bank's CIO when he absorbed the co-CIO position held by Shadman Zafar until he departed the bank in February.\n\nAt Citi, Malhotra is tasked with spearheading the modernization of its wealth technology, according to an internal memo from Lofthouse, seen by BI. He'll be working closely with two relatively new faces at Citi, Eric Lordi, a former JPMorgan executive, who heads up the wealth platform and experience and joined in January, and Joe Bonanno, who was named Citi's head of data, analytics, and innovation in July.\n\n\"Technology is the backbone of our ability to serve clients today and in the future, especially in an industry that is evolving at an unprecedented pace,\" Lofthouse said in the memo about Malhotra. \"To make sure we are providing the absolute best wealth experiences for our clients, our technology must be nothing short of industry-leading,\"",

Analyst Erik Woodring noted that while Apple is taking steps to minimize the impact, it's unlikely to fully absorb the extra costs without broad tariff exemptions something that hasn't been granted yet.\n\niPhone shipments for 2025 are also expected to take a hit. Morgan Stanley cut its forecast from 243 million to 230 million units, largely due to the delayed AI-powered Siri upgrade. Originally set to roll out in May, the update featuring on-screen awareness, personal context, and deep app integrationis now pushed to next year.\n\nWoodring pointed out that a more advanced Siri is the top AI feature iPhone buyers want, based on Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise Smartphone survey from November 2024. The delay could slow upgrade rates ahead of the iPhone 17 launch this fall.\n\nThis comes after Citi Research also revised its iPhone shipment forecast, lowering its 2025 estimate to 232 million units, now projecting a 2% year-over-year increase instead of 5%.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "\u201cMonetization\u201d was one of the most frequently spoken words during Morgan Stanley\u2019s 2025 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco.\n\nAfter several years of heavy investment in artificial intelligence, companies are starting to see the benefits of the technology. The technology companies that offer AI solutions are optimistic about their prospects for revenue and return on investment. But in technology and beyond, the corporate leaders who attended the conference spoke to AI\u2019s potential to aid in cost reduction, product development and broader customer reach, as well their own ability to leverage those benefits into stronger financial results.\n\n\u201cSoftware vendors can monetize the ability of GenAI products to bring new productivity gains for their end customers,\u201d said Keith Weiss, who leads U.S. Software Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research estimates that AI-driven productivity could add 30 basis points to 2025 net margins for members of the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cGetting AI to work at an enterprise scale is very hard, but I\u2019m finally seeing some signs of it. I am much more optimistic than before,\u201d said the CEO of a large transportation tech company. \u201cOver the next two to three years, we\u2019re going to see hundreds of millions of dollars of benefits.\u201d\n\nThis evolution hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. \u201cAI adopters are already outperforming the broader market,\u201d said Andrew Pauker, Morgan Stanley Research U.S. Equity Strategist. \u201cCompanies discussing AI adoption have been rewarded in fourth-quarter earnings.\u201d\n\nReturns on investments are appearing in different ways. Here are three areas:\n\n1. Cost Reductions\n\nCompanies are increasingly adopting \u201cagentics,\u201d an AI assistant with some level of autonomy to make decisions and take actions in some specific contexts. Agentics are trained, for example, to analyze inventory data and make necessary adjustments in response to changes in demand.\n\nIn contact centers, agentics can answer customer questions and act to resolve issues related to technical operation, delivery or payment. It\u2019s a powerful tool to reduce labor costs and accelerate processes.\n\nThe CEO of a telecommunications company noted that customers are already calling contact centers less because AI not only addresses issues more efficiently, but it also improves service quality.\n\n\u201cHaving fewer client calls reduces costs,\u201d the executive said. \u201cGood customer experience is good for the expense line.\u201d\n\n2. Product Development\n\nBecause of its capacity to quickly process large amounts of data, AI is a powerful tool to find the best solutions in product development.\n\nThe head of an AI software company spoke about how models are being applied in different phases of drug development, from research to trials. According to the executive, AI models have a much higher capacity than humans to cross-reference complex biological data and find accurate solutions. Processes in drug development that traditionally take months could be resolved in minutes.\n\n3. Customer Reach\n\nMedia companies are using AI to get a fast and detailed reading of customer behaviors and preferences. With that information, AI can personalize messages to boost engagement with content, including pitching the subscription of a product. That can be done in any part of the world and in different languages.\n\nAI\u2019s ability to provide precise data on consumer trends is also boosting marketing and advertising efficiency. AI tools can adjust the product or service to what customers want at a specific time and then to develop campaigns that will better resonate with the target audience.\n\nChallenges Still Exist\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, executives are challenged to act fast. Monetizing AI is a competitive race, in which both traditional companies and startups are rushing to identify opportunities and adjust their investments.\n\nInvesting in projects that can be valuable in the long term is another challenge that emerges for executives. The CFO of a big hardware company noted that, despite the urgency to proceed with those investments, datacenters can\u2019t be built overnight.\n\n\u201cWe have to see AI as a durable asset,\u201d the executive said at the conference. \u201cWe need to make sure that the results of AI investments are sellable and that we\u2019re building a portfolio that will improve our returns in the long term.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Product Officer of a social media company mentioned a third challenge, which is typical in any technology innovation cycle: over excitement.\n\nThe executive cited the example of projects for autonomous vehicles, about 20 years ago. At that time, many investors believed that the technology would be ready for use in about three to five years. But to this day, the use of autonomous vehicles is not yet widespread.\n\n\u201cSometimes it will take it longer than people expect to see the results,\u201d the CPO said. \u201cWe need to be patient.\u201d",

Investing in currency involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.\n\nThe indices are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted.

The risk of loss in value of a specific investment (such as with an investment manager or in a fund) is not the same as the risk of loss in a broad market index.

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I\u2019m Erik Woodring, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Head of U.S. IT Hardware Research.\n\nHere are some reflections I recorded last week at Morgan Stanley\u2019s Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco.\n\nIt\u2019s Monday, March 10th at 9am in New York.\n\nThis was another year of record attendance at our TMT Conference. And what is clear from speaking to investors is that the demand for new, under-discovered or under-appreciated ideas is higher than ever. In a stock-pickers\u2019 market \u2013 like the one we have now \u2013 investors are really digging into themes and single name ideas.\n\nBig picture \u2013 uncertainty was a key theme this week. Whether it\u2019s tariffs and the changing geopolitical landscape, market volatility, or government spending, the level of relative uncertainty is elevated. That said, we are not hearing about a material change in demand for PCs, smartphones, and other technology hardware.\n\nOn the enterprise side of my coverage, we are emerging from one of the most prolonged downcycles in the last 10-plus years, and what we heard from several enterprise hardware vendors and others is an expectation that most enterprise hardware markets \u2013 PCs , Servers, and Storage \u2013 return to growth this year given pent up refresh demand. This, despite the challenges of navigating the tariff situation, which is resulting in most companies raising prices to mitigate higher input costs.\n\nOn the consumer side of the world, the demand environment for more discretionary products like speakers, cameras, PCs and other endpoint devices looks a bit more challenged. The recent downtick in consumer sentiment is contributing to this environment given the close correlation between sentiment and discretionary spending on consumer technology goods.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the most dynamic topic of the conference remains GenerativeAI. What I\u2019ve been hearing is a confidence that new GenAI solutions can increasingly meet the needs of market participants. They also continue to evolve rapidly and build momentum towards successful GenAI monetization.\n\nTo this point, underlying infrastructure spending\u2014on servers, storage and other data center componentry \u2013 to enable these emerging AI solutions remains robust. To put some numbers behind this, the 10 largest cloud customers are spending upwards of [$]350 billion this year in capex, which is up over 30 percent year-over-year. Keep in mind that this is coming off the strongest year of growth on record in 2024. Early indications for 2026 CapEx spending still point to growth, albeit a deceleration from 2025.\n\nAnd what\u2019s even more compelling is that it\u2019s still early days. My fireside chats this week highlighted that AI infrastructure spending from their largest and most sophisticated customers is only in the second inning, while AI investments from enterprises, down to small and mid-sized businesses, is only in the first inning, or maybe even earlier. So there appears to be a long runway ahead for AI infrastructure spending, despite the volatility we have seen in AI infrastructure stocks, which we see as an opportunity for investors.\n\nI\u2019d just highlight that amidst the elevated market uncertainty, there is a prioritization on cost efficiencies and adopting GenAI to drive these efficiencies. Company executives from some of the major players this week all discussed near-term cost efficiency initiatives, and we expect these efforts to both help protect the bottom line and drive productivity growth amidst a quickly changing market backdrop.\n\nThanks for listening.

Analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his overweight rating and top-pick designation on the stock. Jonas' price target of $430 implies shares can rebound 93.6% over the next year from Monday's closing level. \"We see the pullback as a buying opportunity for an embodied [artificial intelligence] compounder,\" Jonas, a noted Tesla bull, wrote to clients in a Monday note. After Monday's sell-off of more than 15%, which marked its worst session since 2020, the stock is now down about 45% on the year. Shares are also more than 50% below a record high set in December. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla, 1-year That decline comes as pressure mounts due to weak sales data, souring brand sentiment and a de-grossing of the market, Jonas said. Brand \"degradation\" and sliding sales have taken over the Tesla narrative from its AI leadership with humanoid robots, the analyst added. Jonas said the stock could go as low as his $200 bear case and as high as his $800 bull case over the next 12 months. While Tesla's reputation has been reshaped by CEO Elon Musk's role helping President Donald Trump slash the federal workforce, Jonas said investors can also look to company-specific catalysts going forward. For one, Jonas said an Austin robotaxi unveiling event is expected between June and August that would show its first commercial product that does not have a steering wheel. The analyst also said to expect an AI and robot humanoid day before the end of the year. Jonas' call puts him in the majority on Wall Street. Despite growing concerns about the stock amid the pullback, the most popular rating of analysts polled by LSEG is a buy. Tesla shares popped more than 4% in Tuesday's premarket trading following Jonas' note to clients.",

Trump's tariff policies, which have waxed and waned in intensity over the past few weeks, have the intended goal of boosting US manufacturing, the White House said. Earlier this month, Honda was reportedly planning to build its next-generation Civic in the US in partial response to tariffs.\n\nAlso boosting Tesla today, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest bulls said it was time to buy the stock.\n\n\u201cTesla shares have fallen 50% from the Dec 17th highs (and down 45% YTD) on poor sales data, negative brand sentiment, and market de-grossing.

While it \u201csupports\u201d fair trade, it let the Trump White House know that it would also be exposed to some of the impacts that could be felt as a result of the tariffs:\n\n\u201cNonetheless, even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US.\u201d\n\nIt also urged Greer to:\n\n\u201cfurther evaluate domestic supply chain limitations to ensure that US manufacturers are not unduly burdened by trade actions that could result in the imposition of cost-prohibitive tariffs on necessary components.\u201d\n\nTesla also sends vehicles to countries like Canada, which are subject to tariffs. The company said the actions by the U.S. \u201chave resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries.\u201d\n\nThe letter, dated March 11, was written on the same day President Trump purchased a Deep Red Tesla Model S Plaid in an event in front of the White House featuring Musk alongside the President.\n\nTesla\u2019s a great company; they\u2019re American cars, it\u2019s American made. He employs thousands of people. He has the most modern plants in the world,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI know people that have these cars; It blows them away. They love them.\u201d\n\nThe letter shows that, while Musk and Trump are currently working alongside one another to iron out government spending, a task the Tesla CEO took on willingly as he campaigned for the President last election season, one thing remains: business is business.\n\nTesla has pushed prices upward in Canada as a response to the tariffs. Other vehicles in the Tesla lineup, including the flagship Model X, have had their prices see minor increases as well, and this is for U.S. customers.\n\nThe Trump administration has played hardball with Canada with tariffs, only for our neighbors up north to impose countertariffs on electric supply to some of the states in the Northeast. It seems, at least early on in as Trump establishes a narrative in his White House of how the U.S. will be treated, there will be some effects that impact Musk\u2019s companies as he works alongside the President.",

            "content": "Stock Image\n\nMorgan Stanley anticipates further gains in copper prices amid expectations of potential US tariffs.\n\nOn Monday, copper for May delivery declined 0.8%, reaching $4.67 per pound ($10,274 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Despite this dip, prices remain 16% higher year-to-date in 2025.\n\nIn February, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order initiating a Section 232 review of copper imports. These investigations assess the impact of imports on national security.\n\nMeanwhile, major commodity traders such as Glencore (LSE: GLEN) and Trafigura are rushing to ship copper to the US ahead of a potential tariff announcement, aiming to maximize profits, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThis month, US copper prices traded at a premium of up to $1,300 per tonne, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWith tariffs not yet imposed, there is a strong incentive to send metal to the US, tightening markets in the rest of the world as well,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a note, Investing.com reported.\n\n\u201cBeing long on a commodity in contango can be challenging, as the futures price \u2018rolls down\u2019 to the spot price. However, in backwardation, it can \u2018roll up,\u2019 and this shift can often drive investor inflows,\u201d the bank added.\n\nSupply constraints persist. Chile, the world\u2019s largest copper producer, saw its output decline 24% month-over-month in January, marking a nine-month low.\n\n\u201cWe remain constructive on copper, our preferred base metal. Fundamentals and price signals are positive, and inventories are tightening as metal is pulled into the US. While tariffs may bring demand concerns in the future, for now, physical markets continue to tighten,\u201d Morgan Stanley said.\n\nCopper production in the US has been steadily declining in recent years, with the country\u2019s permitting system continuing to hinder new mining projects.\n\nAccording to US Geological Survey data, US copper production fell 3% in 2024, following an 11% drop in 2023.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A chorus of Wall Street strategists is warning about rising volatility in the stock market, with Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson the latest to sound the alarm on slumping economic growth amid President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe strategist, who was a prominent bearish voice on equities until mid-2024, said he expects the S&P 500 Index to drop as much as 5% to 5,500 in the first half of the year as corporate earnings suffer from Trump\u2019s tariffs and lower fiscal spending. The broad equities benchmark closed Friday at 5,770.\n\nMarket forecasters at banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and RBC Capital Markets have also tempered bullish calls for 2025 as Trump\u2019s tariffs stoke fears of slowing economic growth. The S&P 500 has dropped about 2% this year, and investors are questioning the lofty valuations of big technology shares.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has more conviction today at all,\u201d Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler\u2019s chief investment strategist, said. \u201cMore uncertainty? Yes. A wider band of outcomes? Yes.\u201d\n\nWall Street is growing angsty as investors become increasingly unnerved by whipsawing tariff policy, sticky inflation and the unknown pace of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate easing. The Nasdaq 100 Index briefly slumped into a correction Friday as investors dumped the sector that propelled the stock market over the past two years.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 6.1% from its record less than a month ago, and futures on the gauge point to a further decline on Monday.\n\nWhile none of the soothsayers has reduced their year-end targets yet, there\u2019s a rising sense of uncertainty just three weeks after the S&P 500 hit a record. Historically, strategists\u2019 consensus target has typically lagged behind actual market moves by about 60 days, according to an analysis from Piper Sandler & Co.\n\nMany have been piling into short-dated Treasuries, pulling the two-year yield down sharply since mid-February, on expectations the Fed will resume cutting interest rates as soon as June to keep the economy from deteriorating. Yields across maturities were lower on Monday, with the two-year trading below 4%.\n\nBond traders are signaling an increasing risk that the US economy will stall as Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff rollouts and federal-workforce cuts threaten to further restrain the pace of growth.",

The event was closed to the public and the media, so details have been thin about what was discussed. Until now.\n\nOn Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts published a roundup of comments from the event, including some of what Altman and OpenAI discussed.\n\nThis company is one of the world's most valuable startups, working on AI technology that could revolutionize business and broader society. And Altman is probably the second most famous tech executive in the world, behind Elon Musk.\n\nThis makes it pretty important to check up on Altman's thinking regularly \u2014 especially when he shares thoughts in a semi-private setting.\n\nHere are some highlights from the event, according to Morgan Stanley analysts:\n\nAI = deflation?\n\nAltman spoke about how AI could be deflationary. He said that this is one of the impacts of this technology that is most underappreciated and misunderstood by investors.\n\n\"This potential deflationary impact is consistent with our Thematic work where we have highlighted the potential for higher global efficiency and productivity\u2026 which would help offset inflation,\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote.\n\nThe cost to access and use generative AI models has been collapsing. This is partly due to new techniques that have made creating top AI models easier. I wrote last year that there are tons of great models, so the laws of supply and demand dictate that they are becoming more of a commodity, and hence cheaper.\n\nThis is likely great news for developers and businesses that need to access these AI models because they are paying a lot less than a year ago.\n\nStill not enough GPUs\n\nOpenAI highlighted significant capacity constraints, saying that its large fleet of graphic processing units is \"completely saturated.\" This is true both in the training stage, where AI models are created, and in the inference stage, which runs these models.\n\nRelated stories\n\nOpenAI also said that it has never experienced a situation \"where it can't sell out access to its GPUs at reasonable margins.\"\n\n\"At a high level these comments are consistent with our thematic framework where a small number of leading companies (or individuals) are focused on training/building the leading LLM\u2026which will require significant compute,\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote, referring to large language models.\n\nThere's been some hand-wringing lately about how strong GPU demand may be in the future, so OpenAI's comments are notable.\n\nOpenAI isn't worried about training data\n\nIn contrast, OpenAI isn't worried about the supply of data to train its models.\n\nThe startup highlighted its ability to use its GPUs and existing AI models to create more data. This is known as synthetic data, and it's becoming increasingly useful for certain stages of the model-creation process.\n\n\"Data is not a constraint in the way that compute is a constraint (or even the way energy may one day be),\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote.\n\nOpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nDo you have a story to share about AI?

This negative price move occurred amid efforts to offload substantial debt related to Elon Musk's acquisition, a strategic decision reflecting shifts in the company\u2019s loan portfolio. Despite an impressive increase in fourth-quarter earnings, which saw net income rise to $3,714 million, the share buyback program and the appointment of new managing directors, broader market trends played a role. The S&P 500 faced its worst week since September, with ongoing concerns about potential economic slowdowns and market volatility, marking a challenging backdrop for Morgan Stanley's stock performance. While the market declined by 3.4% over the last seven days, investor sentiment was also influenced by the broader uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policies and economic indicators.\n\nNYSE:MS Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nMorgan Stanley has achieved substantial growth over the last five years, delivering total returns of 273.92%. The company's performance has outpaced the broader U.S. capital markets' industry, which returned 21.3% over the past year. Driving this growth were factors such as significant earnings improvements, with recent earnings announcements reflecting strong increases in net income, exemplified by a YOY net income rise to US$3.71 billion in Q4 2024. Furthermore, a successful share buyback program repurchased several million shares, enhancing shareholder value.\n\nNoteworthy corporate activities included the completion of a US$3 billion debt sale associated with Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of X (formerly Twitter), showcasing the firm's strategic financial maneuvers. Executive changes also played a role, with appointments of new Managing Directors across various sectors. This reshaping may have influenced long-term performance positively. Overall, these actions combined to support Morgan Stanley's impressive shareholder returns over the five-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Several Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase are abruptly changing their forecasts for the US stock market.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s head of global market intelligence Andrew Tyler says the lender\u2019s trading desk is flipping short-term bearish on the stock market amid a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, reports Bloomberg.\n\nAll in all, the US stock market has wiped out $3.4 trillion this year, giving up all of the gains witnessed since Trump won the election in November.\n\nTyler\u2019s team sees President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war as a headwind that could limit the US economy\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, we are changing our view to tactically bearish\u2026 Given the uncertainty, positioning, and potential for a negative feedback loop to push people to using the recession playbook, we think the bearish position makes the most sense.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs against both Canada and Mexico, leading to a 500-point drop in the Dow, alongside small drops in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\n\nAs the equity market retreats, Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin says in an investor note that equity valuations are not yet low enough to trigger a significant bounce. He also believes that the stock market will only regain bullish momentum if the US economy begins to show signs of strength.\n\n\u201cAn improvement in the US economic growth outlook will be required to fully reverse the recent equity market weakness.\u201d\n\nOn his forecast for stocks this year, Kostin says,\n\n\u201cEquity returns will be more modest than last year and match the trajectory of earnings growth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley believes that the stock market will see \u201cmuted\u201d gains this year. Andrew Slimmon, the firm\u2019s head of applied equity advisors team, says stocks have been in a bull market since 2023, leading to concerns that the market may be overvalued.\n\nSlimmon also says that the third year of an equities bull market typically prints mediocre gains on average based on historical data.\n\n\u201cWith enough negatives out there, including higher-for-longer interest rates and geopolitical noise, to cause a subpar year, the recently minted optimists could revert to being skeptics, only to have the market roar again in 2026. In that case, 2025 could be more of a pause year than anything more sinister.\u201d\n\nLast year, all three firms predicted that the S&P 500 would soar to greater heights this year, believing that a Trump presidency would create a favorable macroeconomic environment. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predicted that the S&P 500 will reach a new all-time high of 6,500 points in 2025.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "content": "00:00 Speaker A\n\nMorgan Stanley the latest firm to lower its 2025 economic growth forecast for the US concerns on tariffs and weak economic data bringing down optimism and Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins us now with more Josh. Yes, so we've been talking a lot about sort of this shifting growth story in the US, right? With the data that we've seen to start this year and what you're seeing now is economist put that data back into their models, maybe account for a little bit of tariffs and what is coming out is weaker growth forecast, right? See, makes Morgan Stanley Josh. Morgan Stanley now sees a real growth forecast for 20 or the end of 2025 at 1.5%. That's down from 1.9%, and then you're looking at Goldman Sachs also out today, lowering their forecast for the end of this year down to 1.7% from a prior reading of 2.2%. This, of course, follows what we've been talking about for Q1 data, right? So we've been talking a lot about the Atlanta Fed GDP now model, that's been getting a lot of buzz. The interesting part of that data set is always that it just follows data that comes out throughout the quarter, right? So it's following indicators as they come out if the quarter sort of ended today in some ways, that's where we're tracking. Normally, that data will probably come back up as what economists are projecting. That's that shift they're looking at this time. You and I were talking off camera about this earlier, and you said you were you're a little annoyed about the Atlanta GDP Fed Fed now. Uh is that fair to say? Yeah, cuz it's obvious. The January data was bad. So, of course, So it goes way down, and then it'll come back up. And then it likely comes back up, right? And I I think I'm a little bit annoyed about the conversation overall because I brought another chart with us from FactSet, and it's the amount of companies talking about a recession, and that's at a five-year low on earnings calls. And so we're I feel like we've been talking a little bit, and you hear some people talk about a recession trade. This to me is more of a slowdown trade. We're not talking about an economic recession here. That is not really where most economists are sitting. It's repositioning for maybe the US economy doesn't outperform the rest of the world again. Maybe the US economy doesn't surprise to the upside. Economic growth surprised to the upside for the first time in three years. So it's a little bit of a reset of growth expectations. But even the numbers that I read off the top there are a little bit below 2%. Yes, you're below your 2% marker that we always talk about, but it's not zero, right? And so I think that's an important part of this conversation. Well, we keep talking about the word stagflation, right? And implicit in the idea of stagflation is not that there's a recession. It's that you have stagnant growth that either slows or just kind of kind of goes along, and we don't see significant expansion at the same time that you see inflation remain high. Right. And inflation would remain sort of sticky, right? And so that seems to be what's becoming a little bit more of the consensus call right now. And of course, what we should also bring up, this is including tariffs from a lot of these forecasts, right? It's including that we actually eventually get full 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for some level of time. And to me, that also feels very up in the air, right? So it's again, it's this moving target of the market itself. The stock market is trying to price in and discount what tariffs mean, but so too are economists and forecasters, and it's just becoming a challenging thing to pin down. I think a lot of forecasters that we speak with hadn't wanted to necessarily move their forecast quite yet because what are we getting from tariffs? And so really, what it is, it's a best guess based on what the administration has said today, and that could also move next week. It could move this weekend. Right. And so it's it's again, it's a very big moving target. I think especially when we start talking about the entire year and what the economy is going to look like by the time we get to the end of this year. It's hard to know what we're going to get by the end of next week at this point. It later today. Right. Yeah.",

As you\u2019d expect, all parties tout these deals as \u201cwin-wins\u201d.\n\nYesterday, Kyncl was at pains to emphasize that WMG is \u201caligned\u201d with its partners: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to approach it collaboratively and build for the future together\u2026 you have to understand what\u2019s important to both sides.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly does that entail? Making sure Spotify can\u2019t do bundling shenanigans and cut out the music companies?\n\nIt sounds like yes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy about the certainties that we got [on price increases]. And then we\u2019ve moved the ball meaningfully forward on a whole bunch of other items,\u201d said Kyncl.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy about the certainties that we got [on price increases]. And then we\u2019ve moved the ball meaningfully forward on a whole bunch of other items.\u201d Robert Kyncl on WMG\u2019s new Spotify deal\n\nHe predicted \u201ca lot more price innovation\u201d in music streaming is coming, something which he said \u201cobviously hasn\u2019t been there for the previous 15 years\u201d.\n\nAccording to Kyncl, that means both higher prices such as Spotify\u2019s much-discussed \u2018Music Pro\u2019 tier, as well as lower prices, like YouTube\u2019s new Premium Lite tier, which was unveiled this week.\n\nWhen pushed on whether Warner\u2019s new Spotify deal cleaned up the music publishing (mechanical royalties) bundling issue, Kyncl \u2013 no doubt being careful to abide by NDAs \u2013 was coy. Yet to our ears, his message was obvious: \u201cWe are very strong supporters and defenders of songwriters and all the associated rights, and we\u2019re very happy with our deal.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Kyncl said the prospect of future streaming price increases represented only 25% of Warner\u2019s confidence about its long-term growth. The continued boom in streaming\u2019s volume/reach, he said, makes up the other 75%.\n\nKyncl opined that music streaming services were \u201cstill pretty significantly under-penetrated from a subscription standpoint relative to subscription video-on-demand [like Netflix etc.], even less so versus the television.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room to grow in all markets; even in the mature markets we\u2019re still under-penetrated versus [video-on-demand platforms].\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Warner Music Japan 2. Kyncl believes Team WMG\u2019s secret sauce is \u201cinstitutional knowledge\u201d combined with \u201cnew blood\u201d\n\nAll music company CEOs excitedly name-drop their artists. So it\u2019s no surprise that Kyncl mentioned everyone from Ed Sheeran to Lizzo, Linkin Park to Bruno Mars in his JPMorgan discussion. But he also went out of his way to give his creative execs credit.\n\nHe pointed out the initial success of Atlantic Music Group CEO, Elliot Grainge. He hailed Warner\u2019s new Japanese CEO, Takeshi Okada (pictured inset), as a \u201clocal superstar\u201d, and praised Alejandro Duque who \u201cruns our Latin American business\u2026he [now] reports to me, whereas before he was two layers down\u201d.\n\nKyncl argued that Warner\u2019s \u201ccradle to superstardom\u201d A&R capabilities are an \u201cunderappreciated\u201d part of the Warner story.\n\n\u201cEven last year, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims [showed artist development] is in the DNA of our company,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyncl also highlighted his commercial team, including Chief Digital Officer Carletta Higgson, who Kyncl brought over from YouTube, plus Chief Corporate Development Officer, Michael Ryan Southern, who was hired \u201cfrom Goldman Sachs to help acquire more IP \u2013 the Tempo acquisition was a great example of that\u201d.\n\nSaid Kyncl: \u201cChange management is hard and doing it while you\u2019re [publicly traded] is hard, but I\u2019m really excited about the team. It\u2019s a combination of having institutional knowledge and a whole bunch of new blood\u2026 mixing it all together and having safe space to basically argue it all out and move the ball forward\u2026 not following others, charting our own path.\u2018\n\nCredit: rafapress/Shutterstock 3. Kyncl sees restructuring and technology as ways to strengthen WMG\u2019s \u201cvalue proposition to artists\u201d while \u201cdriving efficiency\u201d\n\nKyncl talked about how WMG has fixed its \u201ccore infrastructure, like our digital supply chain, and lots of effectively boring things that you will never hear about, but they\u2019re absolutely necessary to drive the business, drive it efficiently, and give ourselves optionality for scaling.\u201d\n\nAnd he admitted the company is in its next phase, \u201cthe build phase\u201d, with \u201ctools that strengthen [its] value proposition with artists and songwriters\u201d.\n\nAt the same, he\u2019s clearly thinking about the right balance between global reach and local expertise.\n\n\u201cOur organizational structure needs to be [local] to a certain extent, but it is also less nimble than it could be. So there\u2019s a lot of work that we\u2019ve been doing on that front to change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcross the industry overall\u2026today the majority of our revenue is derived from global sources, from digital service providers, but our organizational structure is much more local,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be [local] to a certain extent, but it is [also] less nimble than it could be. So there\u2019s a lot of work that we\u2019ve been doing on that front to change that.\u201d\n\nWhat does all this add up to?\n\nWMG is making \u201csignificant changes while expanding market share at the same time.\u201d\n\n4. WMG\u2019s distribution strategy is \u201cfull force ahead\u201d but \u201cnot at all costs\u201d\n\nWhether you call it \u201cdistribution\u201d or not, it\u2019s a major growing force in the modern global marketplace: distie and services offerings for independent labels, artists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nWarner Music Group\u2019s in-house platform is ADA, a direct rival to the likes of The Orchard and Universal\u2019s Virgin Music Group.\n\nNotably, Kyncl and BMG previously agreed to end a long-running distribution deal through ADA. (BMG now distributes to Spotify and YouTube direct, while its physical releases go via Universal.)\n\nMeanwhile, Warner took a long, hard look at acquiring Believe last year, but ultimately walked away from a potential USD $1.8 billion takeover of the French company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at all distribution companies over the last 18 months, just being a responsible steward\u2026and what I can tell you is that we\u2019re not willing to grow [the market share of this area of the business] at all costs.\u201d\n\nKyncl has previously told MBW that he is determined to avoid \u201cempty calories\u201d distribution agreements with partners \u2013 a reference to thin margin deals that, as the adage goes, flatter the \u2018vanity\u2019 metric of topline revenues but add little to the \u2018sanity\u2019 metric of bottom-line profits.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, Kyncl said: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at all distribution companies over the last 18 months, just being a responsible steward\u2026and what I can tell you is that we\u2019re not willing to grow [the market share of this area of the business] at all costs.\n\n\u201cWe have investment criteria that are important to us. Expanding our margin is important to us. That doesn\u2019t mean that distribution isn\u2019t important to us; it just comes with specific investment parameters, and we also are in a unique position.\u201d\n\nKyncl teased that Warner\u2019s \u201cincredible technology team\u201d has, for the past year, been \u201cbuilding features\u201d that would augment WMG\u2019s distribution offering to independent partners.\n\nHe said the build of these features has \u201ca little bit more to go\u201d before launch, noting that a \u2018build vs. buy\u2019 strategy would \u201cforego market share jump[s] and those kinds of things in the short term.\u201d\n\nHowever, he argued that by investing in building new tech solutions internally, Warner can \u201cget to the same outcome much more efficiently \u2013 [although] it takes a little bit longer\u201d.\n\nThat said, Kyncl noted that Warner had accomplished substantial acquisitions in the distribution space in recent years, citing the examples of Africori in Africa and Qanawat in MENA.\n\nHe added that significant distribution partnerships with indies, including a recent tie-up with Three Six Zero\u2019s record company, showed it was \u201cfull force ahead\u201d for Warner\u2019s indie distribution play.Music Business Worldwide",

The investment bank also lowered its 2026 growth forecast to 1.2% from 1.3%. \u201cTariffs should translate into softer growth this year, whereas we previously assumed it would weigh on growth mainly in 2026,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley economist Michael Gapen in a report.\n\nMorgan Stanley went on to say that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies are expected to drive up inflation and put pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve as it looks to control price increases in the coming months. The bank reiterated its forecast of a single 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the American central bank this year, with that lone reduction likely to occur in June.\n\nGoldman Sachs Weighs In\n\nMorgan Stanley also took issue with market expectations for interest rate cuts this year, saying three rate reductions in 2025 is too optimistic. \u201cWe think markets will ultimately get these cuts, but much later than they expect,\u201d wrote Gapen in his economic assessment.\n\nMorgan Stanley is not alone in revising down its economic forecast for the U.S. economy. Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) also downgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for America, while citing risks posed from import tariffs.

            "content": "Lindsay Tyler: Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Lindsay Tyler, Morgan Stanley's Lead Investment Grade TMT Credit Research Analyst, and I'm here with Michelle Wang, Head of Investment Grade Debt Coverage in Global Capital Markets.\n\nOn this special episode, we're recording at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) Conference, and we will discuss the latest on the technology space from the fixed income perspective.\n\nIt's Thursday, March 6th at 12 pm in San Francisco.\n\nWhat a week it's been. Last I heard, we had over 350 companies here in attendance.\n\nTo set the stage for our discussion, technology has grown from about 2 percent of the broader investment grade market \u2013 about two decades ago \u2013 to almost 10 percent now; though that is still relatively a small percentage, relative to the weightings in the equity market.\n\nSo, can you address two questions? First, why was tech historically such a small part of investment grade? And then second, what has driven the growth sense?\n\nMichelle Wang: Technology is still a relatively young industry, right? I'm in my 40s and well over 90 percent of the companies that I cover were founded well within my lifetime. And if you add to that the fact that investment grade debt is, by definition, a later stage capital raising tool. When the business of these companies reaches sufficient scale and cash generation to be rated investment grade by the rating agencies, you wind up with just a small subset of the overall investment grade universe.\n\nThe second question on what has been driving the growth? Twofold. Number one the organic maturation of the tech industry results in an increasing number of scaled investment grade companies. And then secondly, the increasing use of debt as a cheap source of capital to fund their growth. This could be to fund R&D or CapEx or, in some cases, M&A.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Right, and I would just add in this context that my view for this year on technology credit is a more neutral one, and that's against a backdrop of being more cautious on the communications and media space.\n\nAnd part of that is just driven by the spread compression and the lack of dispersion that we see in the market. And you mentioned M&A and capital allocation; I do think that financial policy and changes there, whether it's investment, M&A, shareholder returns \u2013 that will be the main driver of credit spreads.\n\nBut let's turn back to the conference and on the \u2013 you know, I mentioned investment. Let's talk about investment.\n\nAI has dominated the conversation here at the conference the past two years, and this year is no different. Morgan Stanley's research department has four key investment themes. One of those is AI and tech diffusion.\n\nBut from the fixed income angle, there is that focus on ongoing and upcoming hyperscaler AI CapEx needs.\n\nMichelle Wang: Yep.\n\nLindsay Tyler: There are significant cash flows generated by many of these companies, but we just discussed that the investment grade tech space has grown relative to the index in recent history.\n\nCan you discuss the scale of the technology CapEx that we're talking about and the related implications from your perspective?\n\nMichelle Wang: Let's actually get into some of the numbers. So in the past three years, total hyperscaler CapEx has increased from [$]125 billion three years ago to [$]220 billion today; and is expected to exceed [$]300 billion in 2027.\n\nThe hyperscalers have all publicly stated that generative AI is key to their future growth aspirations. So, why are they spending all this money? They're investing heavily in the digital infrastructure to propel this growth. These companies, however, as you've pointed out, are some of the most scaled, best capitalized companies in the entire world. They have a combined market cap of [$]9 trillion. Among them, their balance sheet cash ranges from [$]70 to [$]100 billion per company. And their annual free cash flow, so the money that they generate organically, ranges from [$]30 to [$]75 billion.\n\nSo they can certainly fund some of this CapEx organically. However, the unprecedented amount of spend for GenAI raises the probability that these hyperscalers could choose to raise capital externally.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Got it.\n\nMichelle Wang: Now, how this capital is raised is where it gets really interesting. The most straightforward way to raise capital for a lot of these companies is just to do an investment grade bond deal.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Yep.\n\nMichelle Wang: However, there are other more customized funding solutions available for them to achieve objectives like more favorable accounting or rating agency treatment, ways for them to offload some of their CapEx to a private credit firm. Even if that means that these occur at a higher cost of capital.\n\nLindsay Tyler: You touched on private credit. I'd love to dig in there. These bespoke capital solutions.\n\nMichelle Wang: Right.\n\nLindsay Tyler: I have seen it in the semiconductor space and telecom infrastructure, but can you please just shed some more light, right? How has this trend come to fruition? How are companies assessing the opportunity? And what are other key implications that you would flag?\n\nMichelle Wang: Yeah, for the benefit of the audience, Lindsay, I think just to touch a little bit\u2026\n\nLindsay Tyler: Some definitions,\n\nMichelle Wang: Yes, some definitions around ...\n\nLindsay Tyler: Get some context.\n\nMichelle Wang: What we\u2019re talking about.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Yes.\n\nSo the \u2013 I think what you're referring to is investment grade companies doing asset level financing. Usually in conjunction with a private credit firm, and like all financing trends that came before it, all good financing trends, this one also resulted from the serendipitous intersection of supply and demand of capital.\n\nOn the supply of capital, the private credit pocket of capital driven by large pockets of insurance capital is now north of $2 trillion and it has increased 10x in scale in the past decade. So, the need to deploy these funds is driving these private credit firms to seek out ways to invest in investment grade companies in a yield enhanced manner.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Right. And typically, we're saying 150 to 200 basis points greater than what maybe an IG bond would yield.\n\nMichelle Wang: That's exactly right. That's when it starts to get interesting for them, right? And then the demand of capital, the demand for this type of capital, that's always existed in other industries that are more asset-heavy like telcos.\n\nHowever, the new development of late is the demand for capital from tech due to two megatrends that we're seeing in tech. The first is semiconductors. Building these chip factories is an extremely capital-intensive exercise, so creates a demand for capital. And then the second megatrend is what we've seen with the hyperscalers and GenerativeAI needs. Building data centers and digital infrastructure for GenerativeAI is also extremely expensive, and that creates another pocket of demand for capital that private credit conveniently kinda serves a role in.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Right.\n\nMichelle Wang: So look, think we've talked about the ways that companies are using these tools. I'm interested to get your view, Lindsay, on the investor perspective.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Sure.\n\nMichelle Wang: How do investors think about some of these more bespoke solutions?\n\nLindsay Tyler: I would say that with deals that have this touch of extra complexity, it does feel that investor communication and understanding is all important. And I have found that, some of these points that you're raising \u2013 whether it's the spread pickup and the insurance capital at the asset managers and also layering in ratings implications and the deal terms. I think all of that is important for investors to get more comfortable and have a better understanding of these types of deals.\n\nThe last topic I do want us to address is the macro environment. This has been another key theme with the conference and with this recent earnings season, so whether it's rate moves this year, the talk of M& A, tariffs \u2013 what's your sense on how companies are viewing and assessing macro in their decision making?\n\nMichelle Wang: There are three components to how they're thinking about it.\n\nThe first is the rate move. So, the fact that we're 50 to 60 basis points lower in Treasury yields in the past month, that's welcome news for any company looking to issue debt. The second thing I'll say here is about credit spreads. They remain extremely tight. Speaking to the incredible kind of resilience of the investment grade investor base. The last thing I'll talk about is, I think, the uncertainty. [Because] that's what we're hearing a ton about in all the conversations that we've had with companies that have presented here today at the conference.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Yeah. For my perspective, also the regulatory environment around that M&A, whether or not companies will make the move to maybe be more acquisitive with the current new administration.\n\nMichelle Wang: Right, so until the dust settles on some of these issues, it's really difficult as a corporate decision maker to do things like big transformative M&A, to make a company public when you don't know what could happen both from a the market environment and, as you point out, regulatory standpoint.\n\nThe thing that's interesting is that raising debt capital as an investment grade company has some counter cyclical dynamics to it. Because risk-off sentiment usually translates into lower treasury yields and more favorable cost of debt.\n\nAnd then the second point is when companies are risk averse it drives sometimes cash hoarding behavior, right? So, companies will raise what they call, you know, rainy day liquidity and park it on balance sheet \u2013 just to feel a little bit better about where their balance sheets are. To make sure they're in good shape\u2026\n\nLindsay Tyler: Yeah, deal with the maturities that they have right here in the near term.\n\nMichelle Wang: That's exactly right. So, I think as a consequence of that, you know, we do see some tailwinds for debt issuance volumes in an uncertain environment.\n\nLindsay Tyler: Got it. Well, appreciate all your insights. This has been great. Thank you for taking the time, Michelle, to talk during such a busy week.\n\nMichelle Wang: It's great speaking with you, Lindsay.\n\nLindsay Tyler: And thanks to everyone listening in to this special episode recorded at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco.

            "content": "Index Definitions\n\nFor index, indicator and survey definitions referenced in this report please visit the following:\n\nhttps://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-investmentsolutions/wmir-definitions\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nInterest on municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax; however, some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Also, municipal bonds acquired in the secondary market at a discount may be subject to the market discount tax provisions, and therefore could give rise to taxable income. Typically, state tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s state of residence and, if applicable, local tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s city of residence. The tax-exempt status of municipal securities may be changed by legislative process, which could affect their value and marketability.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nREITs investing risks are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate: property value fluctuations, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessionsInvesting in commodities entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.\n\nPhysical precious metals are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) provides certain protection for customers\u2019 cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm\u2019s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers\u2019 assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias. You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.\n\nRebalancing does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets. There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy. Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.\n\nThe indices are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted.

Grimes couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. While he was at Morgan Stanley, he worked with Elon Musk \u2014 now a close Trump adviser \u2014 on his purchase of Twitter, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe move shows the administration is moving forward with an executive order Trump issued in February on the sovereign fund idea. The president floated the idea on the campaign trail last year as a vehicle to funnel money from tariffs to invest in manufacturing hubs, defense and medical research. The current planning for the fund, which remains fluid, would not involve collecting tariff revenue, one of the people said.\n\nLast month, the Treasury Department named JR Gibbens, a Wall Street and military veteran to advise on plans for the fund.\n\nOne idea being floated is that the sovereign wealth fund would pair with the US International Development Finance Corp. and Export-Import Bank to act as a catalyst for American investment in areas considered national security priorities, according to one of the people. Among those priorities, the person said, are critical minerals, rare earths, manufacturing, technology, defense technology and defense sourcing. Of particular interest will be targeting areas in which China holds a dominant market position that could be a national security threat.\n\nBloomberg News reported in January that Trump advisers had previously discussed how the DFC could use investments to deliver on the president\u2019s ambitions for greater US influence over Greenland and Panama. Backers of the agency said at the time it would be able to trigger hundreds of billions in geopolitically driven overseas commitments by some of America\u2019s most powerful institutional investors.",

Invest in companies with products so good that they can raise their prices at will.\n\nThat's the thinking behind a list of stocks Morgan Stanley published in a client note on Monday.\n\nThe bank's top equity strategist, Mike Wilson, had his team of analysts put together a list of companies that they think are most protected from tariffs compared to other firms in their respective industries, perhaps because they can pass along the higher import costs to consumers.\n\nThe note came amid news that President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is back in full force \u2014 for now, at least.\n\nStocks fell on Tuesday on the news as investors worried about the ramifications for inflation, interest rates, and corporate earnings.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted that the 25% tariffs imposed on America's two neighbors and the 20% import fees on Chinese goods could be reduced soon, it remains unclear to what degree they could come down and for how long. New tariffs on goods from European Union countries are also expected at some point.\n\nBelow are the 18 stocks on the list that Morgan Stanley also has an \"Overweight\" rating on, meaning the bank thinks investors might do well to hold the stock in their portfolios above its weight in the S&P 500.

            "content": "Revenue from generative AI is likely to increase more than 20-fold over the next three years, with software and internet companies expected to see a positive return on their AI investments as soon as this year, as the expanding functionality of GenAI prompts broader use and triggers a new technology cycle.\n\nAfter an unprecedented level of investment, GenAI could drive potential revenue of about $1.1 trillion in 2028, up from $45 billion in 2024, according to Morgan Stanley Research.\n\n\u201cNow that we've had GenAI products in the marketplace for more than a year and they've proved their efficacy, the market is going to be ready to start adopting these solutions,\u201d says Keith Weiss, who leads Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Software Research. \u201cThat's when revenue starts to flow to the software companies that are trying to automate business processes.\u201d\n\nAI Becomes Mainstream\n\nGenAI caught the general public's attention in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, followed by the first raft of commercially targeted products in the fall of 2023. At that point, there was no clarity on whether and when the technology would offer a return. However, as product development and more robust infrastructure have led to mainstream pickup of GenAI products, there\u2019s more visibility on the potential for revenue and profits, Weiss says.\n\nOf the $1.1 trillion revenue opportunity forecast for 2028, $400 billion would come from corporate spending on software focused on productivity improvements from automation. \u201cWe took a look at the labor and wage calculations that GenAI can impact,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cAnd that's where productivity gains come from.\u201d\n\nConsumer platforms, which include ecommerce, search, social media, autonomous and wearables, could generate additional revenue of $680 billion as companies automate their consumer processes, making shopping and devices more efficient.\n\nFor 2025, Morgan Stanley Research predicts potential revenue of $153 billion, with enterprise software accounting for $59 billion. Consumer platforms would generate the remaining $94 billion in sales.\n\nIn fact, for the first time, return on investment (ROI) is expected to be positive with analysts expecting GenAI to yield a 34% contribution margin, or the equivalent of $51 billion in 2025. Last year, GenAI ROI, with expenses, resulted in a -5% contribution margin.\n\nBy 2028, ROI is expected to remain positive and rise to a 67% contribution margin, or $722 billion return.\n\n\u201cThat leads us to the conclusion that GenAI\u2019s return profile is not meaningfully different from the gross margins of today's software and Internet solutions,\u201d says Brian Nowak, who leads U.S. Internet Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nCall Centers Showing Benefits of GenAI\n\nSavings from labor are likely to become a major validation of the efficacy of GenAI in the near term.\n\nCustomer call centers are one example: They\u2019ve been significantly reducing the need for the intervention of a human operator with the application of GenAI.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s evidence of savings of real dollars. That's what's going to incite a lot more adoption of GenAI,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cBreakthrough technologies will continue to emerge over the next three years, and they will open up opportunities not just to create efficiencies within existing processes, but to completely rewrite business processes.\u201d\n\nHardware Spending Keeps Growing\n\nDeveloping hardware for GenAI innovation has been a bottleneck in this technology cycle. An AI model that is 10% smarter might require five times more hardware, according to Joe Moore, Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cYou're looking at a really dramatic increase in the amount of hardware,\u201d says Moore. \u201cHardware companies are focused on how to deliver that so that it doesn't become prohibitively expensive.\u201d\n\nMoore notes that, despite the recent development of some AI models with smaller amounts of hardware, major companies continue to increase their spending plans.\n\nGenAI Semiconductor spending is forecasted to reach $280 billion in 2028, from $115 billion in 2024, and is well supported by this level of GenAI returns.\n\nSpending on hardware, networking and memory for GenAI is likely to almost triple to $276 billion in 2028, from $98 billion in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe've heard from most of the big spenders in the market that they\u2019re continuing to scale up,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cThis is not a bubble. This is investment that's driven by these areas of economic benefit that our software and internet teams are seeing.\u201d",

(NYSE:T), spoke today at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference where he provided an update to shareholders.\n\nAT&T remains on track to achieve its 2025 consolidated financial guidance and deliver on its multi-year outlook\n\nAT&T remains on track to meet all of the 2025 and multi-year financial and operational guidance shared during its fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call and at its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day. As previously disclosed, the Company will report 2025 free cash flow and Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV.\n\nAT&T expects its multi-year strategic plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target.\n\nThe Company expects to return $40 billion+ of financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027.\n\nOf the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board previously authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization.\n\nThe plan also contemplates approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases.\n\nThe Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025 and maintain leverage within this range through 2027.\n\nAT&T remains focused on growing durable converged relationships with high-quality 5G & fiber customers\n\nAT&T's multi-year strategic growth plan will substantially advance its progress on becoming the best connectivity provider in America.\n\nAs a result of the investment-led strategy announced at its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. While building the network of the future, AT&T is increasing its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner.\n\nIn Mobility, the Company continues to expect full-year wireless service growth in the higher end of the 2% to 3% range and Mobility EBITDA growth in the higher end of the 3% to 4% range. As previously stated, AT&T's 2025 guidance anticipates a healthy wireless market with further normalization of net adds and overall activity levels.\n\nAdditionally, customers reaching the end of their device promotions returned to a more normalized level on a seasonal basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. Postpaid phone net additions in January were impacted by this normalization, typical seasonality and the timing of promotional offers. The Company is pleased with the customer response to the recent launch of AT&T Guarantee and offers introduced over the past several weeks and expects this solid performance to continue for the remainder of the quarter.\n\nIn Consumer Wireline, the Company continues to expect full-year consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens and Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth in the high-single to low-double-digit range. AT&T Fiber penetration rates continue to exceed initial business case assumptions with net adds varying from quarter to quarter based primarily on the pace of new fiber locations passed, seasonality and marketplace dynamics.\n\nIn Business Wireline, the Company continues to expect full-year Business Wireline EBITDA to decline in the mid-teens range primarily due to continued industry-wide secular declines in legacy services.\n\nConference details and more are available on the AT&T Investor Relations website\n\nFull conference details are posted on the AT&T Investor Relations website, including a replay of the webcast.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks poised for big moves.\n\nLast month, President Xi Jinping held a rare meeting with some of the biggest names in China\u2019s technology sector, urging them to \u201cshow their talent\u201d and believe in the power of China\u2019s model and market.\n\nFollowing this guidance, tech leaders in China are raising billions and betting on the AI race. In the latest news, Chinese artificial intelligence startup Zhipu AI has raised more than 1 billion yuan ($137.22 million) in fresh funding, only months after securing a 3 billion yuan investment.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now\n\nAccording to Zhipu AI, state-backed Hangzhou City Investment Group Industrial Fund and Shangcheng Capital are among the investors in the round. The move comes amid intense competition in China\u2019s AI sector, particularly after DeepSeek emerged with its AI models, claiming to match Western competitors\u2019 capabilities at lower costs.\n\nIn another news article, Chinese smartphone maker Honor reported that it will spend $10 billion over the next five years on developing AI for its devices. This comes as the former Huawei unit prepares for a public listing, its CEO James Li has revealed.\n\nThe company no longer wants to be merely a smartphone company. Rather, Li said in a speech at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show in Barcelona that it is now aiming to develop a system of AI-powered PCs, tablets and wearables.\n\nSimilar to Zhipu AI, Honor\u2019s announcement comes amid a boom in Chinese AI investment after DeepSeek emerged with its acclaimed cheaper and efficient AI models. Back in August, Reuters had also reported how Honor has been receiving a high level of support from the Shenzhen local government in terms of research and development funding, tax breaks and support in expanding overseas.\n\nPresident Xi has been stressing continuity in China\u2019s economic development strategy. However, he believes that its private business had \u201cbroad prospects and great promise\u201d to create wealth and opportunity. Sure enough, it seems as if his efforts and vision are rapidly coming to fruition.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

For instance, the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey shows bears outweigh bulls ~60% to 20%. Not only is it rare that bears outweigh bulls, but it is very rare that they outweigh them by this magnitude.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cCNN Fear & Greed Index\u201d is at its most fearful level since last summer. \u201cExtreme Fear\u201d readings have coincided with significant market bottoms over the past few years.\n\nIn addition to the extreme sentiment indicators, bulls can find solace in the fact that several bull market lows have occurred in the month of March in recent years.\n\nTrump Announces Crypto Reserve\n\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve, sending prices soaring. In a \u201cTruth Social\u201d post, Trump named Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as the cryptocurrencies that would be added to the reserve. Investors will get more details when Trump hosts the first-ever White House crypto summit on Thursday, March 7th. Crypto-related stocks such as Coinbase, MicroStrategy and the iShares Bitcoin ETF were very strong in early trading Monday.\n\nTesla \u201cTop Pick\u201d Status Reinstated at Morgan Stanley\n\nThus far, 2025 has not been kind to Tesla investors.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has plunged more than 20% to start the year, is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index, and is the worst-performing \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stock. However, the tide may finally be ready to turn for the bulls. Tesla shares are retesting the confluence zone.\n\nThis morning, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jones, one of the top analysts who track Tesla, reiterated his bullish stance on the leading EV-maker, saying:\n\n\u201cAs AI moves from the digital world (bits and bytes) to the physical world (atoms and photons), we expect to see TSLA\u2019s TAM aperture further expand to broader domains, many of which are still not included in buy-side or sell-side financial models for the company.\u201d\n\nWhile the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI, where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nLike Jones, I believe bears are putting to much emphasis on the lagging legacy EV auto business, while failing to account for the company\u2019s gigantic lead in real-world AI and other emerging businesses. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted about future Tesla EPS growth reaching 1,000% in 5 years, saying:\n\n\u201cIt will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1,000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.\u201d\n\nRead here why Tesla is exhibiting parallels to its 2020 multi-bag move.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "Tesla shares can make a major recovery after a rough start to the year, boosted by its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Adam Jonas named Tesla his new top pick in U.S. autos, highlighting the embattled electric vehicle maker's opportunity in autonomy and robotics as the catalyst for its growth moving forward, rather than its cars. He has an overweight rating on the stock, and his $430 price target implies about 46.8% potential upside for Tesla shares. \"TSLA FY25 deliveries could potentially decline YoY, creating an attractive entry point to our preferred embodied AI name,\" Jonas said in a Sunday note to clients. \"Tesla's YTD auto deliveries have been mostly below expectations, but not particularly narrative changing. Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Jonas added. Jonas' call comes after a tough run for Tesla shares, which have plunged more than 27% this year and are down more than 40% from an all-time high reached in December. That pullback comes as investors fear CEO Elon Musk gets more involved in Washington, potentially taking his attention away from the automaker and alienating customers. Tesla sales across Europe fell 45% last month, while rival electric vehicle makers saw a spike in demand, adding further concern to the stock's growth story. Humanoid robots are still not in the firm's base or bull case for Tesla stock, even though Jonas believes they hold a potential multidecade, trillion-dollar opportunity largely and that the adoption curve of \"non-auto expressions of embodied AI,\" such as humanoids, could accelerate faster than that for autonomous cars. But humanoids are now \"becoming serious enough to move the stock,\" Jonas said in the note, adding that every 1% of the U.S. labor force that can be captured by Tesla's Optimus robot is worth about $100 per Tesla share. \"While autos still matter, we see embodied AI as the driver for upside to our $800 bull case,\" he continued, citing a target suggests shares could see a whopping 173% potential gain. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla stock performance. Beyond in robotics and autonomous technologies, Jonas expects Tesla to see further growth in its energy storage portfolio. \"We believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,\" he added. Tesla shares popped 2% after Jonas' call. Overall, analysts are split on the automaker. LSEG data shows 24 of 53 analysts have a buy or strong buy rating. However, another 17 rate it a hold, while 12 have an underperform or sell rating.",

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nTesla's favorability score among Democrats and Republicans is shifting, according to a fresh analyst note from Stifel that keeps a $474 share price and a Buy rating on the stock. Stifel's note follows trepidation among investors about its CEO Elon Musk's proximity to and role in the Trump administration. The stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value year-to-date, but the investment bank believes that Musk's proximity can help the firm with unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) and help it generate long-term value. Stifel was joined by Morgan Stanley, which maintained its Overweight rating and $430 share price target and Overweight rating and reinstated the stock as a top pick.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Tesla Bull Case Lists Down Price Target As $800\n\nTesla's stock has failed to perform in 2025 mostly due to delivery slippages that have spooked investors. Data shows that Tesla's January sales fell by a whopping 59% in Germany and dipped by 26% in France, in a trend that is attributed to Musk's rhetoric against the continent.\n\nStifel's investor note outlines that in the US, Tesla's 'favorability' is shifting between Democrats and Republicans. It shares that \"Democrat's view on TSLA, which is now reach all-time lows, while Republicans willingness to Buy a Tesla has risen sharply.\"\n\nThe investment bank also notes headwinds to Tesla's short term sales. While Stifel admits that these headwinds place the firm's \"short-term delivery forecasts at risk,\" it adds that \"there are arguably other factors at work as well (e.g., timing of new Model Y).\"\n\nStifel outlines that its $474 Tesla share price target is based on \"a sum-of-the-parts valuation\" which includes the firm's assisted driving platform dubbed full self driving (FSD) and its autonomous taxi, the Robotaxi.\n\n\"We reiterate our view that the regulatory path to unsupervised FSD (a key to Robotaxi) is likely easier with Musk's influence,\" believes the investment bank.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Adam Jonas, who is one of the most bullish Tesla voices on Wall Street, is more forthcoming in his brief comments for Tesla. Jonas maintains his firm's Overweight rating and $430 share price target for Tesla and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.\n\nJonas outlines that \"TSLA shares are down nearly 30% YTD on a clear buyers' strike,\" but adds that his bank is reinstating the firm as a 'Top Pick' among car manufacturer stocks in America. While Morgan Stanley's price target has a \">50% upside,\" Jonas adds that his firm's bull case price target of $800 can unlock significant value for investors.\n\nHowever, like Stifel, Jonas also admits that Tesla can face short-term headwinds. \"TSLA FY25 deliveries could potentially decline YoY,\" he notes, but believes that these can create \"an attractive entry point to our preferred embodied AI name.\"\n\nJonas' optimism comes as Wedush's Dan Ives speculates that Tesla can reach a $2 trillion valuation. Tesla's affordable EV and Musk's multitasking can help the firm over the longer term, believes the analyst. Like Morgan Stanley, Ives is also optimistic about Tesla's AI potential and initiatives such as the Cybercab and humanoid robots.",

            "content": "India\u2019s equity market is in a bright spot despite ongoing corrections, and this may well be an \u2018opportunistic time\u2019 to invest in stocks, Morgan Stanley India managing director Ridham Desai said on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking at event, Desai said shifting consumption patterns, rising energy usage and increasing consumer borrowing will drive India\u2019s growth in coming decades, which bodes well for the stock markets.\n\nDesai pointed out that in India\u2019s income pyramid, a significant portion of the population remains at the bottom with very basic consumption levels. \u201cBut there\u2019s a major transition happening in this pyramid,\u201d he said, adding that the number of middle-class families will rise to 170 million in the next 10 years, from 70 million at present. The number of rich families, currently around 5 million, will grow to 25 million over the same period.\n\n\u201cBy the way, 20 million households will move into the rich category. The world has never seen this happen in a 10-year time frame,\u201d he said. Desai noted that these consumers will drive demand for high-end products such as iPhones, luxury cars and premium travel, which is why global companies are eager to establish their presence in India. \u201cApple has already experienced this over the last two years \u2013 all of Apple\u2019s incremental revenue growth has come from just one country, and that\u2019s India.\u201d\n\nAccording to Desai, higher energy consumption will be another factor driving India\u2019s growth story. \u201cHistorically, we have been a very poor energy-consuming country. That\u2019s changing now,\u201d he said. India\u2019s per capita daily energy consumption, currently at 850 watt, is expected to rise to 2,000 watt by the end of the next decade. \u201cWe need to invest significantly more in energy production, and there will be a number of applications created both upstream and downstream.\u201d\n\nDesai also highlighted a shift in borrowing trends, noting that younger Indians are increasingly living on \u201cborrowed money\u201d, which will fuel a lending boom. He pointed out that in the US, private debt is three times the GDP, while in China, it is 2.5 times the annual output. \u201cPrivate debt in India is only about 75% of our GDP, but we will get there.\u201d\n\nHe also highlighted government and regulatory interventions that have strengthened India\u2019s macro economy, making it more resilient to global headwinds. He credited fiscal consolidation as a key driver of macroeconomic stability. \u201cAll major economies run on a primary deficit, meaning they borrow to pay interest,\u201d Desai said, adding that at India\u2019s current pace of fiscal consolidation, it may achieve a primary balance by 2028. \u201cThis means that by 2028, India will be the only major country not borrowing to pay interest.\u201d",

            "content": "The US currency extended gains on Friday in the aftermath of a heated exchange between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, leading to the collapse of a peace agreement with Russia and a potential deal on critical minerals. In an interview after the Oval Office bustup, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that tariffs are likely to generate substantial revenue.\n\nLast week drove home the peril of going short the dollar in the current environment. The greenback surged on Thursday, paring its February decline, after Trump said that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would take effect March 4. He also said he would impose an additional 10% tax on Chinese imports.\n\nThe world\u2019s primary reserve currency is now almost 2% below the post-election peak it reached before Trump\u2019s inauguration, amid a risk-on wave that also boosted stocks and Treasury yields.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can send the dollar much higher, because it\u2019s really expensive,\u201d said Kit Juckes, head of currency strategy at SocGen in London. \u201cBut can he send it lower? He absolutely can, if he damages the US economy.\u201d\n\nThe result is that market expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts have intensified, diminishing the greenback\u2019s appeal. And the aura of US economic exceptionalism that underpinned the dollar\u2019s 7.1% surge last quarter is dimming as investors ponder Trump\u2019s domestic and foreign policies, that include efforts to slash federal expenses and broke a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThey\u2019re looking past the daily gyrations sparked by tariff announcements, and as they see it, the narrative around the greenback is only darkening. Instead of deriving support from the prospect that import levies could reignite inflation and keep interest rates elevated, there\u2019s now concern that all the uncertainty around tariffs risks undermining an economy that already shows signs of cooling.\n\nThe expanding chorus of greenback bears includes asset managers Invesco and Columbia Threadneedle and hedge fund Mount Lucas Management. On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale are warning clients that going long the dollar is an overcrowded trade that may not hold up.\n\nListen to the Here\u2019s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats once again lifted the dollar last week, but a growing group of investors is betting against the greenback amid signs the US economy is cooling and on concern a trade war will weaken it further.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStill, the renewed focus on European defense could end up buoying the region\u2019s currencies against the greenback. The euro strengthened in early Asia trading Monday as European leaders gathered to discuss defense spending hikes and the securing of Ukraine after any potential US-brokered ceasefire. The Polish zloty and Romanian leu also rose along with Scandinavian peers on expectations further spending could bolster growth in the region.\n\n\u201cBeyond its geopolitical impact, this initiative provides reassurance to markets by reducing uncertainty and reinforcing investor confidence,\u201d said Eli Mizrahi, managing partner of Targa 5 Advisors, in Geneva. \u201cA strong and lasting security framework for Ukraine can help support economic resilience and long-term stability in Europe.\u201d\n\nFading Enthusiasm\n\nBack at home, headlines on tariffs have tended to help the dollar because generally speaking they make imports more costly, potentially hurting demand for those goods and reducing the need for the currencies to buy them.\n\nAt the same time, investors got a reminder last week of the headwinds the US economy is facing, as pending home sales slumped to a record low and jobless claims rose to the highest this year, partly due to job-cut announcements at federal agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s that backdrop that has bears convinced they\u2019re leaning in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor a period of time the market priced only the positive side\u201d of the administration\u2019s policies, said David Aspell, co-chief investment officer at Mount Lucas, which has $1.7 billion under management. \u201cYou also need to fully price things that they\u2019re trying to do that are going to be growth-negative.\u201d\n\nThe fund is short the dollar versus peers including the pound and the Mexican peso as the post-election enthusiasm over US growth fades.\n\nInvesco, meanwhile, flipped to underweight the dollar from overweight a few weeks ago on better-than-forecast data out of Europe.\n\nAt Columbia Threadneedle, Ed Al-Hussainy says he\u2019s been shorting the dollar against emerging-market currencies since December. When bullish-dollar positioning increased after the Fed signaled it would slow its easing, his thought was that he may not be able to get much more out of the trade. The rates strategist said he plans to keep the short position for at least six months.\n\nThe US currency\u2019s pullback from its recent peak is reminding Morgan Stanley strategists of the start of Trump\u2019s first term in 2017. Back then, the currency slumped after he took office, reversing a rally that followed his November 2016 election win.\n\nBonds Too\n\nThe shift in sentiment is rippling through the Treasury market too. Traders have driven two-year yields to the lowest since October as expectations build for deeper Fed easing.\n\nA break lower in yields on additional signs of economic weakness is \u201cthe dollar bear case,\u201d said George Catrambone, head of fixed income at DWS Americas. \u201cFor a meaningful decline in the dollar you need to see the market price in more cuts, but it will ultimately also depend on what other central banks are doing.\u201d\n\nFor now, traders see around nearly 0.70 percentage points of Fed rate reductions by year-end, compared with about 0.85 percentage points for the European Central Bank.\n\nThat differential helps explain why the market, overall, still has a bias toward greenback strength. In futures, for example, speculators such as hedge funds are still leaning toward dollar gains even after trimming bullish bets to the lowest since late October.\n\nBut the great unknown, of course, is how tariffs will play out.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists expect more dollar gains should sweeping levies ultimately come to pass, and they said in a Wednesday note that the market was underpricing that risk. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley, argued last week that the dollar\u2019s major peers have become less sensitive to tariff announcements in recent weeks, which could extend the dollar\u2019s slide.\n\nInvestors, for their part, don\u2019t seem to see tariff-fueled turbulence ending any time soon.\n\n\u201cVolatility is likely to increase, but it is not clear to me that the US dollar comes out winning,\u201d said Alessio de Longis at Invesco.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nEconomic data: March 3: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI; construction spending; ISM manufacturing and prices paid; new orders and employment March 5: MBA mortgage applications; ADP employment change; S&P Global US services and composite PMIs; factory and durable goods orders; ISM Services index; Federal Reserve Beige Book March 6: Trade balance; initial and continuing jobless claims; wholesale inventories March 7: Change in nonfarm payrolls; unemployment rate; average hourly earnings\n\nFed calendar: March 3: St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem March 4: New York Fed President John Williams March 6: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic; Fed Governor Christopher Waller; Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker March 7: Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks on the economic outlook; Williams; Fed Governor Michelle Bowman; Fed Governor Adriana Kugler March 8: Fed blackout period begins\n\nAuction calendar: March 3: 13-, 26-week bills March 4: 6-week bills, 12-day CMB March 5: 17-week bills March 6: 4-, 8-week bills\n\n\n\n--With assistance from Michael Mackenzie, Greg Ritchie and Ruth Carson.\n\n(Updates with more on European currencies)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale are warning clients that going long the dollar is an overcrowded trade that may not hold up.They're looking past the daily gyrations sparked by tariff announcements, and as they see it, the narrative around the greenback is only darkening. Instead of deriving support from the prospect that import levies could reignite inflation and keep interest rates elevated, there's now concern that all the uncertainty around tariffs risks undermining an economy that already shows signs of cooling.The result is that market expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts have intensified, diminishing the greenback's appeal. And the aura of US economic exceptionalism that underpinned the dollar's 7.1% surge last quarter is dimming as investors ponder Trump's domestic and foreign policies, that include efforts to slash federal expenses and broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\"I don't think he can send the dollar much higher, because it's really expensive,\" said Kit Juckes, head of currency strategy at SocGen in London. \"But can he send it lower? He absolutely can, if he damages the US economy.\"Headlines on tariffs have tended to help the dollar because generally speaking they make imports more costly, potentially hurting demand for those goods and reducing the need for the currencies to buy them.At the same time, investors got a reminder last week of the headwinds the economy is facing, as pending home sales slumped to a record low and jobless claims rose to the highest this year, partly due to job cuts at federal agencies. It's that backdrop that has bears convinced they're leaning in the right direction.",

The government upwardly revised its growth forecast for FY25, per which, the Indian economy is now projected to grow 6.5 per cent in the fiscal year ending on March 31.\n\nUpasana Chachra, Chief India Economist, Morgan Stanley, said, \u201cThis was a tad above our (6 per cent), but in line with consensus (6.2 per cent) expectations. The internals suggest that the uptick in GDP was led primarily by strength in both private consumption (supported by a buoyant rural economy) and government consumption (pickup in government spending).\u201d\n\nWhile private consumption grew 6.9 per cent YoY, government consumption rose to a five quarter high of 8.3 per cent YoY. Gross capital formation, on the other hand, remained largely steady at previous-quarter levels at 5.7 per cent YoY. Further, net exports too contributed positively to GDP as growth in exports outpaced growth in imports. For 2025, the second advance estimates pegs growth a tad higher at 6.5 per cent YoY vs 6.4 per cent as per first advance estimates and MSe at 6.3 per cent.\n\nSupply side growth\n\nGross Value Added or GVA advanced to 6.2 per cent in Q3FY25 from 5.8 per cent in the previous quarter, in line with expectations, led by broad-based growth across sectors. The agriculture sector grew 5.6 per cent YoY in Q3FY25, highest since Sep-23, against the backdrop of a strong monsoon that supported the summer and winter crops. Within industry, manufacturing activity and electricity, gas & consumption grew while construction activity moderated from last quarter. Across services, the growth was led by an improving momentum in trade, hotel, transport and communication services, supported by the holiday season; while others remained steady at previous quarter levels. Core GVA edged up to 5.8 per cent YoY in Q3FY25 from 5.6 per cent in Q2FY25.\n\nOn an annual basis, GVA growth for FY25 was revised up to 8.6 per cent (from 7.2 per cent) and GDP growth was revised to 9.2 per cent (from 8 per cent).\n\nGrowth recovery to continue\n\n\u201cThe GDP print for QE Dec-24 reaffirms our view that growth is in recovery mode, after having bottomed out in QE Sep-24. The high frequency data for January/February suggests a mixed trend with gradual signs of recovery. The confluence of a favourable fiscal policy that supports both capex and consumption, easing monetary policy across all its levers \u2013 i.e., rates, liquidity and regulations and robust services exports \u2013 that augur well for the job market outlook are likely to aid the growth momentum,\u201d Morgan Stanley said. The brokerage firm forecasted FY26 growth to be at around 6.3 per cent.\n\nWhat to watch out for?\n\nIn terms of key monitorables going forward, Morgan Stanley said that economists and experts will watch trends in 1) government spending across revenue and capital expenditure; 2) domestic liquidity and financial conditions; and 3) external environment in the context of trade and tariff developments and Fed\u2019s policy.\n\nWhile the government expenditure was muted during the first two quarters of the fiscal year due to general elections, it surged to Rs 2.7 lakh crore, posting about a 30 per cent increase in comparison to the average of the first two quarters. The Economic Survey document stated that the capital expenditure of the government for FY25 has been budgeted at about 3.3 times of the capex of FY20. \u201cIn Q1FY25, the constraints on new approvals and spending during the general elections, coupled with heavy monsoon in many regions, affected the progress of the infrastructure spending. Between July and November 2024, the pace of capex has picked up,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, recently announced OMO purchase calendar (alongside doing OMO buys on screen), a long-dated VRR and a USDINR buy/sell swap to address domestic liquidity conditions and smooth INR volatility. In its December 2024 MPC meeting, the central bank had also announced a 50 basis point (bps) cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 4 per cent, aimed at injecting Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system in two tranches.\n\nFurther, commending RBI spending dollars heavily in the forex market to defend Indian rupee from falling sharply in the last few months, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had said that these actions to defend rupee and injecting durable liquidity to the banking system are steps in the right direction. The intervention by the central bank in the forex market increased after the Indian rupee started falling sharply due to factors like sluggish growth, widening trade deficit, rising crude oil prices, and surge in the dollar index.\n\nLastly, India is facing heightened uncertainty globally as the Donald Trump-led US administration is planning to transition to reciprocal tariffs and away from standardised practices. India and many other economies are reeling under the threat of US reciprocal tariffs that will be levied not just based on tariffs imposed by partner countries, but also the VAT, exchange rate deviation from market value and non-tariff barriers.\n\nEarlier, Goldman Sachs had stated that the potential impact of the US tariffs on India\u2019s GDP will vary between 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points.",

Morgan Stanley expects Aditya Birla Capital share price to outperform Nifty 50 and Sensex in another 60 days. It has maintained its Overweight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 235. This implies over 50% upside for the share price from current levels.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Aditya Birla Capital to benefit from new RBI norms\n\nAccording to the report by Morgan Stanley, Aditya Birla Capital is very well set to benefit from RBI\u2019s new regulatory guidelines regarding reducing risk weight for bank loans to NBFCs and microfinance. Also, the company is a play on improving unsecured credit.\n\n\u201cThe current price implies the NBFC at 0.8x P/BV (Mar-26 BV). Our March 2026 price target of Rs 235 (54% upside) is based on 1.5x FY27 P/B for the NBFC. We see a good entry point with a high margin of safety and upside potential,\u201d said Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe estimate that there is about an 80%+ (or \u201chighly likely\u201d) probability for the scenario.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley say sector sentiment to improve\n\nMoving on to the big picture, the brokerage firm expects the sector sentiment to uplift due to easing following industry-supportive measures and commentary by the new RBI Governor.\n\nThe report states that better-than-expected asset quality, credit cost outcomes, faster-than-expected ROE improvement, and concerns around unsecured loans abate a key risk to ABC.\n\nAditya Birla Capital\u2019s performance in Q3\n\nAditya Birla Capital posted a 4% year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 708 crore in the third quarter of the current financial year, as against Rs 736 crore a year ago. The consolidated revenue for the reporting quarter rose 10% YoY to Rs 10,949 crore in Q3 FY25.\n\nIt\u2019s NBFC unit, Aditya Birla Finance, reported a net interest income of Rs 1,734 crore, up 5% YoY. However, its net interest margin declined to 6% in Q3 FY25 from 6.88% in the same period a year ago.\n\nAditya Birla Capital stock performance\n\nAditya Birla Capital\u2019s share price has risen 2.3% in the past five trading days. The stock has fallen over 9% in the last one month and 31% in the past six months. The share price of Aditya Birla has fallen 15% in the last one year.\n\nTo compare, the benchmark index, the Nifty 50 has fallen 2% in the past five sessions. The index has fallen 5.3% in the last one month and 12.5% in the last six months. The index return has been flat at 0.65% in the past one year.",

At the event, that means connecting with our clients in meaningful ways, creating memorable moments for golf fans and supporting initiatives that make a positive impact in our communities.\n\nMaking a Difference Together\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s ongoing partnership with THE PLAYERS Championship has been a cornerstone of our community engagement efforts, reflecting the Firm\u2019s core values of integrity, teamwork, and giving back. Launched in 2017, our annual Eagles for Impact program has contributed $5,000 for every eagle or double eagle made during the tournament, totaling nearly $2 million in donations to charities nationwide, including youth development organization First Tee. These efforts demonstrate our deep commitment to nurturing the next generation of athletes and leaders, as well as our belief in the positive influence that sports can have on young people.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite elements of being an ambassador for Morgan Stanley is our shared commitment to opening doors and providing education opportunities for kids,\u201d said Brand Ambassador and 11-time PGA TOUR champion Justin Rose. \u201cAs a player, great golf shots are even more rewarding when they are in support of driving positive change in the game and our community.\u201d\n\nIn 2024 alone, Eagles for Impact provided critical funding and resources to help First Tee train 107 coaches from 69 chapters across the country. These leaders then delivered over 32,000 program hours mentoring more than 35,000 participants, helping young people develop their golfing abilities while building life skills such as inner strength, self-confidence and resilience.\n\nTurning Forward Thinking Into Progress\n\nThis year, we\u2019re excited to introduce a new platform in partnership with the PGA TOUR: the AI Course Setup Tool Presented by Morgan Stanley. This innovative tool provides Rules Officials with historical data and renderings at their fingertips, helping them determine course setup \u2014 including pin and tee box locations \u2014 each day of THE PLAYERS Championship. This new resource will enhance the efficiency of the tournament and demonstrates our commitment to forward-thinking and excellence in all aspects of our partnership. At Morgan Stanley, we believe in pairing the power of technology and human expertise to lead with exceptional ideas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be back at THE PLAYERS Championship this year, bringing innovation to the course and taking the client, player and fan experience to new heights. Over the past decade, we have focused on creating a legacy of forward-thinking together with the PGA TOUR, and we look forward to seeing the tangible effect the AI Course Setup Tool Presented by Morgan Stanley will have on the green here at THE PLAYERS and beyond,\u201d said Alice Milligan, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nElevating The Experience at TPC Sawgrass and Beyond\n\nTogether with the PGA TOUR, we share a commitment to excellence, which includes creating a premium and memorable fan experience at THE PLAYERS Championship. During the tournament, Morgan Stanley will offer our clients and prospects behind-the-ropes access and host several exclusive events, such as meet & greets with PGA TOUR players and legends, including Justin Rose and World Golf Hall of Famer Davis Love III.\n\nAll attending THE PLAYERS Championship are encouraged to swing by the immersive, open-air Morgan Stanley Fan Experience Tent near the 18th hole fairway, track player eagles with us and try to make their own at our putting bays for a chance to win exclusive prizes.\n\nTo further connect with our clients\u2019 passion around golf, we\u2019ve produced two impactful television commercials. The first spot features Justin Rose, highlighting how his incredible golf journey reflects the perseverance and dedication Morgan Stanley provides for our clients. Our second spot \u2013 new in 2025 \u2013 showcases our partnership with First Tee, where coaches inspire young leaders and help them build essential life skills through the game of golf, reinforcing our commitment to empowering future generations.\n\nAs a Proud Partner of The PLAYERS Championship for a decade now, Morgan Stanley\u2019s commitment goes far beyond the realm of golf. It\u2019s about enriching the communities in which we live and work and delivering the best of our Firm to every client. We\u2019re eager to continue this journey and make a meaningful difference, both on and off the course.\n\nMorgan Stanley is not affiliated with THE PLAYERS\u00ae, the PGA or First Tee.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Morgan Stanley.

            "content": "Voya Financial 's management team is undertaking a turnaround that seems to be steering the ship in the right direction, according to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley analyst Bob Jian Huang upgraded shares of the New York-based asset manager to overweight from equal weight, and lifted his 12-month price target 14% to $87 from $76. The move reversed an August downgrade of Voya to equal weight from overweight on concerns about the longer-term profitability of Voya's health solutions business. Shares of Voya have added less than 4% over the past 12 months, but Huang's updated price forecast implies a potential upside of more than 23%. The stock also yields 2.55%, according to FactSet data. VOYA 1Y mountain VOYA 1Y chart The analyst attributed Voya's underperformance, in part, to the asset manager's 2024 full-year earnings miss. \"The stock is currently trading below historical average, but is much less capital intensive,\" Huang wrote. \"We believe the current valuation overly penalizes execution risks and does not fully reflect Voya's potential.\" The stock trades at a discount, \"[d]espite the fact that Voya has improved its EPS growth, ROE and capital intensity profile vs. pre-COVID,\" Morgan Stanley said. Huang noted that since the 2024 miss, Voya's management has actively taken strategic steps to improve performance via new pricing and improved risk selection, setting up an attractive growth profile for the company in 2026 and beyond. Voya now expects core business growth within its wealth solutions and investment management segment, and recent acquisitions should ultimately help improve excess capital generation next year versus 2024 numbers. \"The turnaround should improve the overall prospect of the company, and improve the overall earnings potential,\" Huang argued. \"We have confidence in management's ability to navigate integrations, investments, and segment improvements, which should uplift capital generation.\"",

            "content": "English Professor, Mildred Antenor, recently took her Business Writing class to a special Black History Month event at Morgan Stanley: Morgan Stanley Fireside Chat with Ruth Simmons \u2013 Empowerment Through Education.\n\nSimmons, the first Black woman to serve as President of an Ivy League University, shared insights from her book, Up Home, detailing her non-idyllic journey and the hard work required to reach her level of success. During the 45-minute discussion, she spoke about her upbringing, the lessons her parents instilled in her and how she gradually recognized her own path to leadership by seeing other women lead. She emphasized the importance of self-improvement, reflection and embracing diverse perspectives.\n\nProfessor Antenor\u2019s goal for the approximately 15 students in attendance was to help them develop their networking and communication skills. In preparation for the event, Professor Antenor guided her students through the process of designing and printing professional business cards and provided key networking tools to help them make meaningful connections. She emphasized the importance of confidence, active listening and effective communication to ensure they presented their best selves. She challenged each student to meet at least two or three new people and later reflect on their experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that every student take advantage of these networking opportunities on and off campus. Not only does it teach students about the business world in a very real and practical way but, when students put their best feet forward, it\u2019s an affirmative light on Seton Hall and what we\u2019re doing at the University. What was especially gratifying for me was the clarity that I noticed with my students after they attended the Morgan Stanley fireside chat. It was evident that they were able to connect what we\u2019ve discussed in the classroom to what was happening at the event.\"\n\nThe experience offered students an invaluable lesson on leadership, resilience and the power of education\u2014principles that Simmons has championed throughout her historic career.\n\nCategories: Education",

The building was completed in 1990 and serves as Morgan Stanley\u2019s global headquarters. The property is located between West 47th and 48th Streets.\n\nRecent photographs show the new glass curtain wall is almost fully installed across three sides of the podium. The steel superstructure remains exposed in a few sections where work is still wrapping up, and the framework for the new LED displays has begun assembly.

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "January 27, 2025, marked a watershed date for the tech world.\n\nThat was when DeepSeek, a relatively new Chinese startup, announced that it was able to develop an AI model at a fraction of the cost relative to estimates of major players in the industry.\n\nDeepSeek said it spent only $5.6 million to power an AI model with capabilities similar to those of products developed by more famous rivals. It was a marked contrast to the major companies in the tech world that had been planning investments of hundreds of millions, if not billions, on their own AI models.\n\n\u201cDriving new cost efficiencies and innovation is important in any tech cycle,\u201d says Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. Internet analyst Brian Nowak. \u201cThe market\u2019s strong reaction to the news was based on the fact that this breakthrough came from a company out of China that a lot of people didn\u2019t know about. But it\u2019s actually a good sign for the next three to five years of the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\n\nSince then, DeepSeek has begun rapidly integrating into multiple enterprises and sectors, such as data centers and telecom. Companies in industries such as automotive and financial services have adopted these advancements as well. It is also seeing accelerated adoption by consumers, given its very low cost and users\u2019 ability to download a simple version of the model in PCs and smartphones.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research analysts are watching the most significant shifts following the DeepSeek breakthrough, the potential overreactions and, most important, the opportunities that can arise from that event.\n\n1. The AI Market Is Splitting\n\nShawn Kim, who heads the Asia Technology research team for Morgan Stanley Research, says it\u2019s no longer the case that only a few companies would be able to afford powerful chips and heavy infrastructure to efficiently develop AI.\n\n\u201cThe AI market appears increasingly bifurcated,\u201d Kim says. \u201cOne segment remains a premium for entities willing to pay substantially to be the first, but for the rest, AI is a cost center, and everyone wants cheaper tokens.\u201d\n\nThe premium segment, he notes, is focused on using data and supercomputers that would lead to existential developments, such as the replacement of workers by AI. By contrast, the low-cost AI market, which became more visible after DeepSeek\u2019s announcement, features affordable entry costs, with AI models converging and commoditizing very quickly. That\u2019s good news for the consumers of AI, but it is going to be more difficult for AI providers to make money in that segment.\n\nKim notes there\u2019s also a third possibility in this new AI economic structure: a market in which large tech companies will likely offer AI for free so that people stay on their platforms longer.\n\n2. Investors Question AI Spending\n\nGiven the progress that DeepSeek made with a relatively low budget, investors are scrutinizing companies\u2019 AI investments, while corporate leaders question whether it\u2019s really necessary to spend billions of dollars to reach their AI goals.\n\nBut recent earnings reports and calls show that, so far, the major tech companies are sticking to their aggressive plans for capital expenditures (CapEx).\n\nFor Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Head of Research Product for the Americas & Head of Global Sustainability Research, DeepSeek hasn\u2019t changed the view on AI infrastructure growth. He expects announcements of big data centers and training facilities to keep coming, especially because the demand for AI is expected to increase.\n\n\u201cThere has been steady progress in terms of efficiencies, and DeepSeek represents an improvement in that regard,\u201d Byrd says. \u201cThis happens in every technology revolution: We see continuing cost reductions and then dramatic increases in demand for the product.\u201d\n\nBefore the DeepSeek event, a Morgan Stanley Research survey of chief information officers showed an uptick in IT budget growth expectations for 2025. The survey, conducted between October and December, pointed to AI/machine learning as the main priority for CIOs.\n\n3. AI Drives Clean Energy Demand\n\nAs analysts expect companies to maintain CapEx plans for AI infrastructure, that infrastructure will have enormous energy needs\u2014and Morgan Stanley Research still expects that demand to drive investments in clean energy.\n\nAndrew Percoco, Head of North America Clean Tech at Morgan Stanley, says the outlook for power demand associated with AI in the U.S. hasn\u2019t changed as a result of the DeepSeek announcement. He notes there is still a strong need to develop more renewables, including solar and wind, to power AI data centers.\n\n\u201cOverall, it was a scary moment in the market for the AI narrative,\u201d Percoco says. \u201cBut I think investors have found it as an opportunity to re-engage in some of these stories.\u201d\n\nByrd says multiple different sources of energy, such as nuclear and natural gas, will continue to be in demand to power AI data centers.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the magnitude of power needs, we\u2019re going to see everything from tiny 20 MW projects to multi-thousand MW data-center projects. We still believe that nuclear very much fits the purpose,\u201d Byrd says. \u201cWe do expect to see quite a few announcements of data centers that can be linked to natural gas, as well as nuclear deals and bitcoin-conversion deals.\u201d\n\n4. Humanoids Advance in China\n\nAn important lesson from the DeepSeek event is that China is moving very aggressively in data collection. Among other impacts, this will boost its development of humanoid robots \u2013 AI \u201cbrains\u201d trained on vast sets of real and simulated robotic data to help them understand natural language, learn from and imitate human action, and perceive their dynamic environments.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s research suggests China continues to show the most impressive progress in humanoid robotics, with startups benefitting from established supply chains, local adoption opportunities and strong support from the national government.\n\nElectric vehicles with autonomous capabilities, which require similar technologies as humanoids, are also evolving quickly in China. \u201cIf you can solve autonomous cars, you can solve autonomous anything, whether it\u2019s drones, aviation, humanoids and everything else in between,\u201d says Adam Jonas, Head of Global Autos & Shared Mobility Research.\n\n5. Governments Weight Action\n\nThe DeepSeek event was also a wake-up call for Western nations.\n\n\u201cSome investors think, rather dismissively, that the Western world will dominate all aspects of AI because it has access to superior computing, and China does not,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cDeepSeek is a symbol of what can be done when a centrally planned government puts very high priority on achieving dominance or leadership in rapidly moving AI-enabled technologies.\u201d\n\nJonas notes that it\u2019s important to watch very closely what China is doing on the AI front because it affects not just U.S. tech companies\u2019 ability to compete, but even more importantly, government policies that can be supportive of the private sector.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley and Capital One appear to be among the latest banks to de-emphasize mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion in their annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nThis year\u2019s annual filing from Morgan Stanley, posted Friday, does not feature the subheading \u201cDiversity and Inclusion,\u201d where the report from a year ago did.\n\nBoth versions, in the introduction to the bank\u2019s \u201cHuman Capital\u201d section, feature the sentence: \u201cTo facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Morgan Stanley a diverse and inclusive workplace with a strong culture and opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their career.\u201d\n\nBut where the February 2024 document contained a paragraph that calls attention to the bank\u2019s Institute for Inclusion, the 2025 filing\u2019s comparable paragraph begins with a mention of meritocracy \u2013 a buzzword of sorts amid the Trump-era crackdown on DEI. The title of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to end what he terms \u201cillegal\u201d DEI favors instead \u201cmerit-based opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeritocracy is at the heart of Morgan Stanley\u2019s talent development,\u201d the bank wrote in Friday\u2019s filing. \u201cWe believe a workforce that represents the societies in which we live and work, and our global client base, is integral to Morgan Stanley\u2019s continued success.\u201d\n\nIt does, however, tout that Morgan Stanley \u201cbelieve[s] that an inclusive workplace is in the best interests of our employees and clients.\u201d By comparison, last year\u2019s DEI paragraph begins: \u201cWe believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is important to Morgan Stanley\u2019s continued success and our ability to serve our clients.\u201d\n\nBoth versions contain a breakdown of representation indicating that 40% of the bank\u2019s employees are women and 35% of its U.S. workforce is ethnically diverse. Meanwhile, 29% of Morgan Stanley\u2019s officers are women, and 28% of U.S. officers are ethnically diverse, the bank said.\n\nIn Capital One\u2019s case, the entire section labeled \u201cDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\u201d in 2024\u2019s filing is absent from the 2025 version, filed Thursday.\n\nFurther, while both years\u2019 filings stress that \u201cpay equity is an important element of our pay philosophy,\u201d the statement, in 2024\u2019s filing that Capital One pays women \u201c100% of what men are paid\u201d and U.S.-based racially and ethnically diverse associates \u201c100% of what white associates are paid\u201d \u2013 according to the bank\u2019s own analysis of aggregated adjusted pay gap results \u2013 does not appear in Thursday\u2019s.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Capital One are hardly the only banks to adjust their DEI language in the wake of the power shift in Washington.\n\nCiti on Thursday told its employees that, amid pressure from the Trump administration, it is dropping \u201caspirational representation goals,\u201d except where required by local laws, according to a memo posted on the company\u2019s website. The bank is also scrapping a policy that mandates diverse rosters of candidates for job interviews, it said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that we\u2019re living in an environment where things are changing quickly,\u201d CEO Jane Fraser wrote in the memo. \u201cThe recent changes in U.S. federal government policy, including new requirements that apply to all federal contractors, call for changes to some of the global strategies and programs we\u2019ve used to attract and support colleagues from various backgrounds.\u201d\n\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s annual regulatory filing Feb. 14, the bank said it \u201chas been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions\u201d it\u2019s taken \u201cwith respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).\u201d\n\nThe bank did, however, assert \u201cthat its long-term growth and success depend on its ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees and foster an inclusive work environment.\u201d\n\nBut JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this month said the bank would reduce spending on some DEI efforts, not due to the White House\u2019s orders but because he views them as wasteful, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cI was never a firm believer in bias training,\u201d Dimon said at a company town hall, according to Bloomberg. \u201cI saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid sh-t, and it really pissed me off.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan, in its 2024 filing, highlighted its \u201cglobal Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence\u201d that \u201csupport its diversity, equity and inclusion strategies through initiatives such as career coaching and mentorship.\u201d Further, a table breaking down the bank\u2019s proportion of diverse workers that was titled \u201cDiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d last year was labeled \u201cWorkforce composition\u201d in the Feb. 14 filing.",

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley\u2019s CIO and Chief U.S. Equity Strategist. Today on the podcast I\u2019ll be discussing new headwinds for growth and what that means for equities.\n\nIt's Monday, Feb 24th at 11:30am in New York.\n\nSo let\u2019s get after it.\n\nUntil this past Friday\u2019s sharp sell off in stocks, the correlation between bond yields and stocks had been in negative territory since December. This inverse correlation strengthened further into year-end as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield definitively breached 4.5 per cent on the upside for the first time since April of 2024. In November, we had identified this as an important yield threshold for stock valuations. This view was based on prior rate sensitivity equities showed in April of 2024 and the fall of 2023 as the 10-year yield pushed above this same level. In our view, the equity market has been signaling that yields above this point have a higher likelihood of weighing on growth. Supporting our view, interest rate sensitive companies like homebuilders have underperformed materially. This is why we have consistently recommended the quality factor and industries that are less vulnerable to these headwinds.\n\nIn our year ahead outlook, we suggested the first half of 2025 would be choppier for stocks than what we experienced last fall. We cited several reasons including the upside in yields and a stronger U.S. dollar. Since rates broke above 4.5 per cent in mid-December, the S&P 500 has made no progress. Specifically, the 6,100 resistance level that we identified in the fall has proven to be formidable for the time being. In addition to higher rates, softer growth prospects alongside a less dovish Fed are also holding back many stocks. As we have also discussed, falling rates won\u2019t help if it\u2019s accompanied by falling growth expectations as Friday\u2019s sharp selloff in the face of lower rates illustrated.\n\nBeyond rates and a stronger US dollar, there are several other reasons why growth expectations are coming down. First, the immediate policy changes from the new administration, led by immigration enforcement and tariffs, are likely to weigh on growth while providing little relief on inflation in the short term. Second, the Dept of Govt Efficiency, or DOGE, is off to an aggressive start and this is another headwind to growth, initially.\n\nThird, there appears to have been a modest pull-forward of goods demand at the end of last year ahead of the tariffs, and that impulse may now be fading. Fourth, consumers are still feeling the affordability pinch of higher rates and elevated price levels which weighed on last month's retail sales data. Finally, difficult comparisons, broader awareness of Deep Seek, and the debate around AI [CapEx] deceleration are weighing on the earnings revisions of some of the largest companies in the major indices.\n\nAll of these items are causing some investors to consider cheaper foreign stocks for the first time in quite a while \u2013 with China and Europe doing the best. In the case of China, it\u2019s mostly related to the news around DeepSeek and perhaps stimulus for the consumer finally arriving this year. The European rally is predicated on hopes for peace in Ukraine and the German election results that may lead to the loosening of fiscal constraints. Of the two, China appears to have more legs to the story, in my opinion.\n\nOur Equity Strategy in the U.S. remains the same. We see limited upside at the index level in the first half of the year but plenty of opportunity at the stock, sector and factor levels. We continue to favor Financials, Software over Semiconductors, Media/Entertainment and Consumer Services over Goods. We also maintain an overriding penchant for quality across all size cohorts.\n\nThanks for listening. If you enjoy the podcast, leave us a review wherever you listen, and share Thoughts on the Market with a friend or colleague today.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Private equity firm Advent is exploring options including a possible initial public offering for Argentina-based payments company Prisma Medios de Pago at a valuation of as much as $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPrisma is working with Morgan Stanley on its review, which could also include a potential sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Advent could look to float about 30% of Prisma in a US listing this year, they said.\n\nAn IPO would take advantage of heightened market demand for Argentine assets, the people said. The deliberations by Advent and Prisma are ongoing and they might decide against pursuing an IPO or another option, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Advent, Prisma and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nAdvent bought a majority stake in Prisma in 2019 in a transaction valuing the company at $1.42 billion. In 2022, it acquired the remaining shares for about $360 million.\n\nPrisma is one of Argentina\u2019s biggest processors of credit and debit cards, as well as instant payments. It processes payments for cards such as Mastercard, American Express, Cabal and UnionPay.\n\nBefore Advent bought it, Prisma was controlled by 14 banks. They were forced to sell the company as part of a plan by former President Mauricio Macri\u2019s government to end verticalization in the sector.\n\n--With assistance from Maggie Eastland.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley has shifted its stance to a more optimistic view on the Chinese stock market. Laura Wang, the firm's Chief Equity Strategist for China, highlighted that despite significant gains in A-shares and Hong Kong stocks since late January, foreign investors have not fully engaged in this rally, leaving substantial room for increased allocation.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's analysis, the recent market rally has been largely driven by \"southbound trading,\" which involves mainland Chinese funds flowing into the Hong Kong market through Stock Connect programs. This year alone, about $25 billion has entered Hong Kong. However, active and passive funds based in the U.S. or Europe have yet to participate significantly, indicating a large pool of potential foreign investment remains untapped.\n\nSeveral factors are enhancing the attractiveness of the Chinese market. Easing geopolitical tensions have injected confidence, while breakthroughs in technological innovation, particularly highlighted during a recent private enterprise forum, have boosted long-term growth potential. These rapid changes suggest that many investors are still under-allocated in the Chinese market, presenting opportunities for increased foreign investment.\n\nOn February 20, Laura Wang's team expressed a bullish outlook, predicting a 4% rise in the MSCI China Index. This shift marks a significant turnaround from Morgan Stanley's previous cautious stance, suggesting a fundamental change in global investors' attitudes towards China.\n\nAdditionally, recent technological advancements and significant capital expenditure plans by Alibaba signal a resurgence of \"animal spirits\" in the tech sector, according to Morgan Stanley's Chief Economist for China, Xing Ziqiang. The focus on emerging technologies like AI and robotics underscores a shift in China's economic development priorities, positioning the tech industry as a new growth engine.",

            "content": "Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) has faced struggles in recent years, with manufacturing delays and competitors\u2019 superior products chipping away at its receding market share. Meanwhile, internal turmoil \u2013 marked by the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger last December \u2013 has signaled a loss of direction. As a result, the stock has plunged ~43% over the past year.\n\nHowever, more recently the shares have been trimming those losses, gaining ground on account of rumors there might be a savior \u2013 or even saviors \u2013 at the gate.\n\nThe rumor mill has been in full swing with multiple reports about possible partnerships between TSMC and Intel, with the U.S. federal government also involved. Several outlets said discussions were in the early stages with reports suggesting TSMC might take a minority stake in a joint venture and transfer tech to Intel, while others indicated TSMC could acquire a majority stake in some or all of Intel\u2019s manufacturing assets. It\u2019s not only the manufacturing assets that are drawing attention; some reports speculated that Broadcom might be interested in Intel\u2019s design and product assets.\n\nThat said, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore makes the point that none of those involved have commented on these reports. On the other hand, the 5-star analyst notes that TSMC stated in its 2Q24 earnings call that it was not interested in joint ventures in the U.S. and reaffirmed in the 3Q24 earnings call that it had no plans to acquire Intel\u2019s fabs. Furthermore, a Reuters report suggested that the White House probably won\u2019t support foreign ownership of Intel\u2019s manufacturing facilities.\n\n\u201cSo there is quite a bit of uncertainty here, and we would not draw any conclusions about what may happen,\u201d Moore went on to say.\n\nIn any case, Moore says the structure of the deal would be crucial in determining whether the outcome is favorable or unfavorable.\n\n\u201cWe believe the value here is the product business, and we would prefer whatever fab outcome puts the product business into the best position to succeed, whether that is IDM 2.0 (the Gelsinger strategy), IDM 1.0 (essentially the Bob Swan strategy, using the fabs to support the product roadmap and any premium priced nationally sensitive foundry, without trying to compete economically with TSMC) or pure fabless,\u201d Moore opined.\n\nBottom line, the analyst rates Intel shares as an Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral), along with a $25 price target, suggesting the stock is currently fully valued. (To watch Moore\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street\u2019s average target is actually a little lower; at $22.79, the figure factors in a one-year slide of 8%. Most, like Moore, remain on the sidelines for now; based on 27 Holds, 5 Sells and just 1 Buy, the consensus view is that this stock is a Hold.

From culinary chefs to veterans to financial professionals, the heroes came from all walks of life. In honor of the lives lost on 9/11, we honor 13 heroes who must never be forgotten.\n\n1. Moira Smith, NYPD\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of Daily News\n\nSmith was the only female officer among the 23 NYPD cops who died on 9/11. She led countless injured people from the twin towers. But, in the end, died with so many other heroes in the effort to rescue more.\n\n2. Benjamin Clark, chef, former Marine\n\nThis former Marine and chef at the Fiduciary Trust Company is credited with saving hundreds of lives, making sure that everyone on the 96th floor safely exited the building. He then paused on the 78th floor to assist a woman in a wheelchair. He perished when the building collapsed.\n\n3. Danny Lewin, internet entrepreneur, former Israeli Army Special Forces\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of Akamai Technologies\n\nLewin, an American-Israeli, was aboard the American Airlines Flight 11 plane out of Boston headed for Los Angeles when it was hijacked by the terrorists. He was a veteran of the Special Forces of the Israeli Army, fluent in Arabic, and therefore; knew exactly what the terrorists plans were. He tried to single-handedly stop the terrorists and was stabbed to death aboard the plane.\n\n4. Leonard Hatton FBI, former Marine, volunteer firefighter\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of ny1.com\n\nSpecial Agent Hatton was on his way to work in the New York Division office when he saw smoke and fire coming from the North Tower of the WTC. He rushed down to the towers to join New York City firefighters in the evacuation effort. He was inside the building when it collapsed.\n\n5. William Rodriguez, WTC maintenance worker\n\nPhoto courtesy of vivelohoy.com\n\nRodriguez was in the basement of the North Tower when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the tower. Having keys to all emergency exits, Rodriguez is credited with bravely leading firefighters up the stairs, unlocking doors as they climbed, helping to save hundreds of people.\n\n6. Welles Crowther, equity trader, former volunteer firefighter\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of huffingtonpost.com\n\nCrowther\u2019s former training as a volunteer firefighter must have kicked in, as he saved as many as 18 lives while assisting the FDNY. He ultimately perished when he entered the building one last time before it collapsed. ESPN produced this fantastic documentary about this brave young man years later:\n\n7. Rick Rescorla, Vietnam veteran, Morgan Stanley security\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of thisiscornwall.co.uk\n\nRescorla, an expert disaster planner, and meticulous in his preparation, was credited in saving the lives of 2,687 Morgan Stanley employees, plus 250 office visitors. When he safely had them outside, he went back in to save more. He was one of only 13 Morgan Stanley employees who died on that day.\n\n8. Thomas Burnett, president of Medical Device Company\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of mirror.co.uk\n\nOn Sept. 11, Burnett was on United Airlines Flight 93. After the plane was hijacked, he called his wife and found out about the attacks on the World Trade Center. He and a small group of other passengers formed a plan to regain the plane. The plane ultimately crashed in a rural area of Pennsylvania, but it is believed that Burnett and the other men probably saved that plane from its intended target of the White House or Capitol Building.\n\n9. Officer John W. Perry, NYPD\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of theagitator.com\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 11, Officer Perry was filing his retirement papers at the precinct to then pursue his plan to become a medical malpractice lawyer. After hearing about the attacks, Perry ran several blocks to the World Trade Center to help in the rescue. Upon arriving, Perry helped a woman who had fainted, and then quickly ran into the South Tower right before it collapsed.\n\n10. Ronald Bucca, N.Y. fire marshal, Army Special Forces\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of thedailybeast.com via Getty\n\nBucca\u2019s body was found in the rubble of the south tower. He must have placed his turnout coat protectively around several civilians, for it was later found still wrapped around them.\n\n11 & 12. Jason Thomas, Marine, and Dave Karnes, former Marine\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of tusconcitizen.com/stripes.com\n\nKarnes and Thomas rushed to the scene of the WTC shortly after the attack to help find any survivors.

The rescue dogs\n\nPhoto/Courtesy of Barcroft Media\n\nMore than 300 dogs were used in the city\u2019s rescue and recovery operation to search for survivors and find human remains. These dogs, like the many who helped in the recovery effort, were exposed to the physical hazards of Ground Zero, including sharp debris and unhealthy air.\n\nThis article, originally published in 2014, has been updated with an added video and new information.",

Photo : Twitter\n\nControversial rapper Kanye West seemed to suggest in a post on X on Saturday that he is trying to launch a meme coin . West, who now goes by the name Ye, said that he is having trouble getting his CZ number. Based on an exchange that Kanye West had with the co-founder of the blockchain company Binance on X, it seems that plans are on a roll for West to launch a coin on Binance - the Chinese blockchain platform.\n\n\"Wait, Why all these n----- H------ J--- & f-----\" won't gimme CZ number,\" West wrote on X. To which the Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who also served as the company's former CEO, replied saying, \"DM'ed you.\"\n\nThe post is the latest in the rapper's social media activity, hinting towards the launch of a $YZY token. On February 22, the 47-year-old wrote on X, \"I\u2019m launching next week, all current ones are fake.\" The statement fueled speculation of an official cryptocurrency tied to his Yeezy brand. According to CoinDesk, $YZY will be the official currency for Yeezy's website, and fans will be able to purchase the brand products directly using the token. $YZY launch was originally slated for Thursday, February 20, but it was delayed.\n\nThe potential launch of $YZY will mark a reversal of Kanye's earlier stance on cryptocurrency. On February 9, he tweeted, \"I\u2019m not doing a coin. I only do things I\u2019m passionate and knowledgeable about. Coins prey on the fans with hype.\"",

Morgan Stanley projects that by 2035, 24 million Americans, or 7% of the population, will be using these medications.\n\nBut that estimate may be too low. GLP-1 medications are proving remarkably effective beyond weight loss, showing promise in treating substance abuse and even psychological disorders. These early signals suggest the impact could extend far beyond a healthier bag of chips. They could spark a broader health revolution.\n\nDavid Blanchett, head of retirement research at PGIM , believes these medications could, subsequently and profoundly, change how we plan for retirement: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have more of these advances in the future, that result in increasing lifespans in retirement. It\u2019s not really possible to know what these are, but the implications for retirement are somewhat staggering.\u201d\n\nWith healthier adults living longer, the future of retirement could be rewritten entirely.\n\nSo, what could that future look like?\n\nGLP-1 drugs and fewer doctor visits -\u2014 and bills\n\nThe cost of health care looms large for retirees. Fidelity estimates that the average retiree today will spend $165,000 on medical expenses. Rising costs are driven by longer lifespans and chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and arthritis.\n\nHere\u2019s where GLP-1 drugs could shift the equation. \u201cIf GLP-1 medications can effectively reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases, retirees may indeed experience lower health care costs,\u201d says Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford , Obesity Medicine Physician and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, research indicates GLP-1 drugs may help prevent a range of serious conditions, lowering the risk of stroke, kidney disease and even neurodegenerative diseases we\u2019ve thought practically incurable, like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s .\n\nIn fact, new findings link GLP-1 use to reduced dementia symptoms . It\u2019s a breakthrough that could dramatically ease financial and emotional burdens, with dementia care costs averaging more than $28,000 annually, much of which is assumed by family caregivers.\n\nThe potential benefits extend beyond health care savings. \u201cThis could allow more disposable income to be spent on travel, hobbies and other activities, enhancing quality of life,\u201d adds Dr. Stanford.\n\nIn short, a retirement defined by more living than just surviving.\n\nMore retirees on the go\n\nAge naturally slows us down , with slower metabolism, muscle loss and inactivity as common culprits. That\u2019s why retirement is often described in three stages: the Go-Go years, the Slow-Go years and the No-Go years. It\u2019s during the Go-Go years \u2014 those early, active retirement days \u2014 that people travel and pursue long-awaited adventures.\n\nBut GLP-1 drugs could help rewrite that narrative. The future of retirement may be more \u201cgo\u201d than \u201cslow.\u201d By mitigating the long-term effects of chronic diseases, these medications could help retirees remain active well into their later years.\n\nAccording to a PwC study , over half of users said they made healthier food choices, and about a third reported less binge eating and drinking. Most kept or increased their exercise routines, signaling a stronger commitment to a healthier lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIf retirees can be healthier for longer, they may want to do more things, for longer, than we\u2019re seeing today from retirees,\u201d Blanchett says.\n\nThis shift aligns with changing attitudes. Surveys show that younger generations increasingly desire a more \u201cactive\u201d retirement . Currently, the top activity for older adults is watching TV. So, imagine a future where retirees are too busy hiking trails, exploring cities or picking up new hobbies to binge-watch Netflix.\n\nHowever, healthier bodies could mean longer Go-Go years but also more spending on travel, leisure, and experiences.\n\nBlanchett warns of financial implications: \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think most Americans will live to age 100, longer lifespans are increasingly possible. This complicates retirement planning, forcing each person to have to deal with a variety of idiosyncratic risks, perhaps where the most notable is longevity risk .\u201d\n\nYes, a more active retirement could mean more spending, but here\u2019s the kicker: GLP-1 drugs could reduce one of the biggest obstacles to financial security: the health problems that force people into early retirement .\n\nLonger careers, larger savings\n\nFewer than one in four retirees feel confident they can maintain a comfortable lifestyle throughout retirement, according to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies . Many regret not saving more or starting sooner \u2013 two-thirds wish they had saved more consistently, and half wish they had started investing earlier.\n\nWhile GLP-1 drugs can\u2019t rewind time (not that we know of, yet), they could help people stay healthier and work longer, providing a crucial opportunity to catch up on savings. Health problems are the leading cause of early retirement. More than half of respondents in an EBRI survey retired earlier than planned, citing health problems or disabilities as the top reason.\n\n\u201cWith better health management, individuals may be able to extend their working years, contributing to increased workforce participation among older adults,\u201d says Dr. Stanford.\n\nThe financial upside of working longer is clear. \u201cDelayed retirement is one of the most powerful things people can do to improve their retirement situation,\u201d says Blanchett. \u201cIt gives you more time to save for retirement, more time for assets to grow, the ability to delay claiming Social Security benefits and one less year of retirement spending to fund.\u201d\n\nFor instance, consider catch-up contributions. Starting at age 50, workers can contribute extra amounts to retirement plans, and recent legislation now allows even larger \u201csuper\u201d catch-up contributions for those aged 60 to 63.\n\nEven short delays can make a big difference. Research shows that postponing retirement by just three to six months can have the same financial benefit as saving an additional percentage point of earnings annually for 30 years.\n\nThe concept of a fixed retirement age may fade altogether. With healthier, longer lives, retirement could become more of a flexible transition than a hard stop.\n\nRetire on, retire off\n\nWithout the looming burden of poor health, the path from career to retirement could become far less linear.\n\nThe traditional \u201cwork for 30 years, then retire\u201d model was already evolving before GLP-1 drugs entered the conversation. A growing trend among younger workers is taking extended sabbaticals \u2014 short career breaks to recharge or explore new passions before returning to work.\n\nGen Z, in particular, is embracing this shift, favoring shorter, more frequent career pauses over one permanent retirement. According to HR platform Gusto , more workers are embracing these micro-retirements, reflecting a shift in attitudes toward productivity and well-being.\n\nWith healthier lifespans on the horizon, these career pauses may become even more common. \u201cImproved health could lead to a trend where individuals who had retired due to health issues might choose to return to work,\u201d says Dr. Stanford.\n\nEntrepreneurship research further illustrates how retirement could evolve. An MIT study analyzing millions of U.S. companies found that the highest success rates in entrepreneurship come from founders in middle age and beyond, with the average age of a successful startup rounder being Is 45 years old. This underscores that career pivots and reinventions are not only possible but often highly rewarding later in life.\n\nIn this redefined future, retirement becomes less of a final chapter and more of an ongoing, flexible journey \u2014 a chance to step in and out of work, fueled by health and choice rather than necessity.\n\nToo good to be true? Why you may not want to adjust your retirement plan just yet\n\nWhile GLP-1 drugs offer promising benefits, they come with notable drawbacks. One major issue: 50-75% of people stop using them within a year. Cost is the leading factor.\n\nWith prices in the hundreds of dollars monthly, \u201cthey are expensive, particularly in the US, compared to other countries with national insurance, such as Canada and the UK.\u201d Dr. Stanford notes.\n\nSide effects also cause concern, with users reporting nausea, gastrointestinal issues and sleep disturbances. Rare cases of eye complications , including conditions linked to blindness, have surfaced.\n\nThe effects may even extend beyond the body. \u201cSignificant weight loss can alter social dynamics and relationships,\u201d says Dr. Stanford. \u201cSome individuals may experience changes in self-esteem and social interactions. Open communication and support systems are important to help navigate these changes.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of sustainability. What happens when people stop taking the drugs? Many revert to old habits, losing their progress.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that while GLP-1s may help, they aren\u2019t a silver bullet. Of course, there are proven, often cost-free ways to achieve many of the same benefits: regular exercise, a balanced diet, sufficient sleep and strong social connections. Though less flashy than a prescription, these habits are powerful drivers of long-term health and well-being. Recent research, however, indicates that these measures may not be enough to control obesity in some cases and that obesity is not driven by a lack of willpower but by a disease process.\n\nStill, the buzz around GLP-1 drugs continues to build, fueled by study after study showcasing their potential. Whether they spark a health \u2014 and retirement \u2014 revolution or fade like a fleeting trend, one thing is certain: they already have more staying power than Crystal Clear Pepsi.",

The company is seeking to suspend collection proceedings and early maturity of the debt for a period of 180 days.\n\nThe decision to file came after the company received requests for collection of a debt of R$3 million from Houlihan Lokey, who was Seacrest\u2019s financial advisor. In addition, there are financial disputes with essential suppliers, such as Petrobras \u2013 the Brazilian company managed to overturn the injunction that prevented it from collecting an invoice of US$ 70 million.\n\nIn the case of Houlihan, the dispute is not with the former client, but with the new shareholders, creditors who took over the company in January and were precisely the counterparty with whom the financial advisor was renegotiating. Once in possession of the company, the creditors blocked payment for the service. \u201cAfter becoming shareholders, the banks refused to pay the suppliers involved in the renegotiation,\u201d says a source.\n\nMeanwhile, Petrobras, the company\u2019s largest creditor, is collecting a debt related to the outstanding installments from the sale of fields in Esp\u00edrito Santo. Seacrest claims that it does not have the financial means to cover such expenses and that this could accelerate other debts of the group.\n\nAt the end of December, the company filed a lawsuit with the Court of Justice of the State of Rio de Janeiro (TJ-RJ) alleging a breach of contract by Petrobras. According to Seacrest, the state-owned company had not carried out repairs to underwater pipelines, which was included in the purchase and sale agreement for the onshore fields, which Petrobras disputes.\n\nThe creditors who took over the company this year executed a debt of US$ 300 million and changed the company\u2019s management. The amount referred to financing contracted with a syndicate of banks, coordinated by Morgan Stanley, for the purchase of the Norte Capixaba field. The banks transferred the shares as collateral to Gerib\u00e1, which took over the business. On February 19, the company also announced the conversion of US$28.7 million in bonds into shares.\n\nSeacrest is a Norwegian company, headquartered in Bermuda and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway. Bankruptcy request includes the subsidiaries Seacrest Petr\u00f3leo Norte Capixaba and Seacrest Petr\u00f3leo Cricar\u00e9 Bermuda, as well as the foreign-based company Seacrest Urugay.\n\nThe group was founded in 2019 and made transactions with Petrobras for Norte Capixaba and Cricar\u00e9 in 2021 and 2023. The company had an ambitious drilling program of 300 wells in northern Esp\u00edrito Santo, with the goal of tripling its production by 2025. However, with the increase in operating costs and the drop in oil prices, the company saw its profit margins shrink.\n\nThe group also mentions in the petition, signed by the TWK law firm, that the increase in interest rates, political instability and lack of regulatory predictability have affected the investment environment in the oil and gas market, reducing the interest of foreign partners and directly impacting the raising of new resources. As the financial situation worsened, Seacrest began to delay payments to suppliers and the payment of bonds issued abroad.\n\nIn the third quarter, Seacrest produced 6.8 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/day) and has approximately 300 direct employees and more than a thousand indirect employees at the Cricar\u00e9 Hub, Polo Norte Capixaba and Terminal Norte Capixaba.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

I'm Seth Carpenter, Morgan Stanley's Global Chief Economist, and today I'm going to talk about downside risks to the U.S. economy, especially from tariffs.\n\nIt's Thursday, February 20th at 10am in New York.\n\nOnce again, tariffs are dominating headlines. The prospect of reciprocal tariffs is yet one more risk to our baseline forecast for the year. We have consistently said that the inflationary risk of tariffs gets its due attention in markets but the adverse growth implications that's an underappreciated risk.\n\nBut we, like many other forecasters, were surprised to the upside in 2023 and 2024. So maybe we should ask, are there some upside risks that we're missing?\n\nThe obvious upside risk to growth is a gain in productivity, and frequent readers of Morgan Stanley Research will know that we are bullish on AI. Indeed, the level of productivity is higher now than it was pre-COVID, and there is some tentative estimate that could point to faster growth for productivity as well.\n\nOf course, a cyclically tight labor market probably contributes and there could be some measurement error. But gains from AI do appear to be happening faster than in prior tech cycles. So, we can't rule very much out. In our year ahead outlook, we penciled in about a-tenth percentage point of extra productivity growth this year from AI. And there is also a bit of a boost to GDP from AI CapEx spending.\n\nOther upside risks, though, they're less clear. We don't have any boost in our GDP forecast from deregulation. And that view, I will say, is contrary to a lot of views in the market. Deregulation will likely boost profits for some sectors but probably will do very little to boost overall growth. Put differently, it helps the bottom line far more than it helps the top line. A notable exception here is probably the energy sector, especially natural gas.\n\nOur baseline view on tariffs has been that tariffs on China will ramp up substantially over the year, while other tariffs will either not happen or be fleeting, being part of, say, broader negotiations. The news flow so far this year can't reject that baseline, but recently the discussion of broad reciprocal tariffs means that the risk is clearly rising.\n\nBut even in our baseline, we think the growth effects are underestimated. Somewhere in the neighborhood of two-thirds of imports from China are capital goods or inputs into U.S. manufacturing. The tariffs imposed before on China led to a sharp deterioration in industrial production. That slump went through the second half of 2018 and into and all the way through 2019 as a drag on the broader economy. Just as important, there was not a subsequent resurgence in industrial output.\n\nPart of the undergraduate textbook argument for tariffs is to have more produced at home. That channel works in a two-economy model. But it doesn't work in the real world.\n\nNow, the prospect of reciprocal tariffs broadens this downside risk. Free trade has divided production functions around the world, but it's also driven large trade imbalances, and it is precisely these imbalances that are at the center of the new administration's focus on tariffs. China, Canada, Mexico \u2013 they do stand out because of their imbalances in terms of trade with the U.S., but the underlying driving force is quite varied. More importantly, those imbalances were built over decades, so undoing them quickly is going to be disruptive, at least in the short run.\n\nThe prospect of reciprocity globally forces us as well to widen the lens. The risks aren't just for the U.S., but around the world. For Latin America and Asia in particular, key economies have higher tariff supply to U.S. goods than vice versa.\n\nSo, we can't ignore the potential global effects of a reciprocal tariff.\n\nUltimately, though, we are retaining our baseline view that only tariffs on China will prove to be durable and that the delayed implementation we've seen so far is consistent with that view. Nevertheless, the broad risks are clear.\n\nThanks for listening. And if you enjoy the podcast, help us make it even more valuable to you.

            "content": "Morgan Stanley Wealth Management announced this week that advisors now have full access to what has been named the AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, built from OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 large language model.\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management in March announced it was only \u201cone of a handful\u201d of organizations receiving early access to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. The news coincided with OpenAI\u2019s announcement that it was releasing the next iteration of its wildly popular GPT-3 artificial intelligence model. At the time, GPT-4 was still not widely available, and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management was \u201cthe only strategic client in wealth management\u201d able to use it, according to the company.\n\nWith the tool, Morgan Stanley advisors can ask questions and receive answers incorporating the firm's internal data. Links to source documents are also provided.\n\nThe company stated the main types of questions advisors have asked the tool during testing were research-based (including the outlook on federal rate hikes), administrative (like how to open an IRA for a client) and specialized knowledge that\u2019s outside the regular scope of an advisor (such as how to help a client prepare for marriage).\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management has other ongoing AI projects as well, including a focus on advisor workflow and client and prospect communications.\n\nRelated:Morningstar Launches Enterprise Analytics Platforms and API For Mo Chatbot\n\nMany firms have been at work on similar projects over the last year with some having launched specifically for independent advisors, SIFA for example, while others were meant for asset managers or large enterprises, which would include Portrait Analytics, Toggle, Alkymi, or Cognicor, among others (such as Morningstar).\n\nDPL Financial Partners Acquires AnnuityFix\n\nInsurance management platform provider DPL Financial Partners announced Wednesday it acquired AnnuityFix and its affiliated broker/dealer, Johnstone Brokerage Services.\n\nDPL Financial appointed AnnuityFix\u2019s founder, Grant Johnstone, as chief compliance officer and chief legal officer. The firm\u2019s employees will join DPL.\n\nThe acquisition will be finalized pending regulatory approval and terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nIt is hoped that the acquisition will \"enhance\" and \"create expanded capacity\" for DPL\u2019s Breakaway Accelerator program, which launched in late 2022. That program helps financial advisors to transition their legacy annuity business to a fee-based business model, with the goal of enabling many to go completely independent, according to DPL. The program provides advisors transitioning to a fee-only model with the ability to evaluate each client\u2019s annuity holdings to determine whether it is beneficial for them to exchange them for one of the commission-free products on the DPL platform.\n\nRelated:A Q&A with Vinay Nair, Founder of TIFIN\n\nDPL is a membership organization and fees are determined by a firm\u2019s AUM. More than 3,500 RIA firms currently have access to DPL's insurance marketplace. DPL also partnered with SS&C Advent/Black Diamond in August of 2021 to launch an insurance marketplace.\n\nSMArtX Advisory Solutions To Launch SMArtY Platform With Russell Investments\u2019 Model Portfolios\n\nSMArtX Advisory Solutions announced a collaboration with Russell Investments as the inaugural asset management firm to offer its investment strategies through the new SMArtY platform announced in July.\n\nThe slimmed-down version of the SMArtX platform, called SMartY, is a free managed account platform for advisory firms that is sponsored by product providers. While it has not yet launched (expected for Sept. 28), advisors can sign up on a waitlist.\n\nUnder the hood, advisors will find award-winning managed accounts technology tools, including asset allocation and a new portfolio construction tool (UMAi), as well as intra-day trading (SMArtX has integrations with eight custodians), tax transition and harvesting, billing services and access to \u201csome of the world's largest and most reputable asset managers' models,\u201d according to the firm. SMArtY will provide client account reporting down to the sleeve level, performance reporting, as well as sleeve-level reconciliation when it launches.\n\nSMArtX closed a Series D funding round in May 2022, with a $30 million investment from Morningstar Investment Management, the unit of Morningstar that provides discretionary investment management and advisory services. That investment followed a November 2021 announcement that Morningstar would begin using SMArtX\u2019s unified managed account technology to power its turnkey asset management platform (and still does).",

            "content": "Bank stocks struggled today as investors grew more concerned about the economy and the strength of consumers. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.22%), the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, fell 4.5%. Shares of investment banks and asset managers Goldman Sachs (GS 3.16%) and Morgan Stanley (MS 3.28%) also fell 3.9% and 4.5%, respectively.\n\nInvestors aren't ready for a recession\n\nThe stock market and the consumer have proven extraordinarily resilient over the last few years, despite high inflation and the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates over 530 basis points (5.3%) in a relatively short period. Although inflation is not at the Federal Reserve's 2% preferred target and some worry that it might revert higher, investors have largely shaken off these concerns this year.\n\nThe threat of a slowdown in the economy or a recession has not been in focus with a strong labor market and economy that seems bulletproof, but signs of a potential recession have rattled the market on a few occasions over the last few years.\n\nThat seems to be the culprit behind today's market's sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up 500 points. Consumer retail giant Walmart (NYSE: WMT), often viewed as a proxy for how people feel about spending, reported earnings this morning along with timid guidance that left investors questioning whether consumer spending may be at or close to a peak. Consumer spending contributes over two-thirds of gross domestic product, so a slowdown can lead to a slowdown in the economy.",

            "content": "James Egan: Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Jim Egan, co-head of Securitized Products Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nJay Bacow: And I'm Jay Bacow, the other co-head of Securitized Products Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nToday, a look at the latest trends in the mortgage and housing market.\n\nIt's Wednesday, February 19th, at 11am in New York.\n\nNow, Jim, there's been a lot of headlines to kick off the year. How is the housing market looking here? Mortgage rates are about 80 basis points higher than the local lows in September. That can't be helping affordability very much.\n\nJames Egan: No, it is not helping affordability. But let's zoom out a little bit here when talking about affordability. The monthly payment on the medium-priced home had fallen about $225 from the fourth quarter of 2023 to local troughs in September. About a 10 percent decrease. Since that low, the payment has increased about $150; so, it's given back most of its gains.\n\nImportantly, affordability is a three-pronged equation. It's not just that payment. Home prices, mortgage rates, and incomes. And incomes are up about 5 percent over the past year. So, affordability has improved more than those numbers would suggest, but those improvements have certainly been muted as a result of this recent rate move.\n\nJay Bacow: Alright. Affordability is up, then it\u2019s down. It\u2019s wrong, then it\u2019s right. It sounds like a Katy Perry song. So, how have home sales evolved through this rollercoaster?\n\nJames Egan: Well, you and I came on this podcast several times last year to talk about the fact that home sales volumes weren't really increasing despite the improvement in affordability. One point that we made over and over again was that it normally takes 9 to 12 months for sales volumes to increase when you get this kind of affordability improvement. And that would make the fourth quarter of 2024 the potential inflection point that we were looking for. And despite this move in mortgage rates, that does appear to have been the case. Existing home sales had a very strong finish to last year. And in the fourth quarter, they were up 8 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2023. That's the first year-over-year increase since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nJay Bacow: All right. So that's pretty meaningful. And if looking backward, home sales seem to be inflecting, what does that mean for 2025?\n\nJames Egan: So, there's a number of different considerations there. For one thing, supply \u2013 the number of homes that are actually for sale \u2013 is still very tight, but it is increasing. It may sound a little too simplistic, but there do need to be homes for sale for homes to sell, and listings have reacted faster than sales. That strong fourth quarter in existing home sales that I just mentioned, that brought total sales volumes for the year to 1 percent above their 2023 levels. For sale inventory finished the year up 14 percent.\n\nJay Bacow: Alright, that makes sense. So, more people are willing to sell their home, which means there's a little bit more transaction volume. But is that good for home prices?\n\nJames Egan: Not exactly. And it is those higher listings and our expectation that listings are going to continue to climb that's been the main factor behind our call for home price growth to continue to slow. Ultimately, we think that you see home sales up in the context of about 5 percent in 2025 versus 2024.\n\nOur leading indicators of demand have softened, a little, in December and January, which may be a result of this sharp increase in rates. But ultimately, when we look at turnover in the housing market, and we're talking about existing sales as a share of the outstanding homes in the U.S. housing market, we think that we're kind of at the basement right now. If we're wrong in our sales volume call, I would think it's more likely that there are more sales than we think. Not less.\n\nJay Bacow: Let me ask you another easy question. How far would rates have to fall to really incentivize more supply and/or demand in the housing market?\n\nJames Egan: That's the $45 trillion question. We think the current housing market presents a fascinating case study in behavioral economics. Even if mortgage rates were to decline to 4.5 percent, only 35 percent of people would be in the money. And that's still over 200 basis points from where we are today.\n\nThat being said, we think it's unlikely that mortgage rates need to fall all the way to that level to unlock the housing market. While the lack of any historical precedent makes it difficult for us to identify a specific threshold at which activity could increase meaningfully, we recently turned to Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise to conduct a consumer pulse survey to get a better sense of how people were feeling about their housing options.\n\nJay Bacow: I like data. How are those people feeling?\n\nJames Egan: All right, so 31 percent of people anticipate buying a home over the next two years, and almost half are considering buying over the next five. Interestingly, only 21 percent are considering selling their home over the next two years. In other words, perceived demand is about 50 percent greater than marginal supply, at least in the immediate future, which we think could be a representation of that lock-in effect.\n\nCurrent homeowners\u2019 expectations of near-term listings are depressed because of how low their mortgage rate is. But we did ask: What if mortgage rates were to fall from 6.8 percent today to 5. 5 percent? In that world, 85 to 90 percent of the people planning to buy a home in the next two years stated that they would be more likely to execute on that purchase.\n\nSo, we think it's safe to say that a decline in mortgage rates could accelerate purchase decisions. But Jay, are we going to see that decline?\n\nJay Bacow: Well, our interest rate strategists do think that rates are going to rally from here. They've updated their 10-year forecast to expect the tenure note ends 2025 at 4 percent. If the tenure note's at 4 percent, mortgage rate should come down from here, but not to that 4.5 percent, or probably even that 5.5 percent level that you quoted. You know, honestly, you don't really want to stay, you don't really want to go. We're probably talking about like a 6 percent mortgage rate. Not quite that level.\n\nBut Jim, this is a national level, a national mortgage rate, and housing markets about location and location and location. Are there geographical nuances to your forecast?\n\nJames Egan: People all over the country are asking, should they stay or should they go now, and that answer is different depending on where you live, right? If you look at the top 100 MSAs in the country, 8 of the top 11 markets showing the largest increases in inventory over the past year can be found in Florida.\n\nSo, we would expect Florida to be a little bit softer than our national numbers. On the other hand, inventory growth has been most subdued in the Northeast and the Midwest, with several markets continuing to see inventory declines.\n\nJay Bacow: All right, well selfishly, as somebody that lives in the Northeast, I am a little bit happy to hear that. But otherwise, Jim, it's always a pleasure listening to you.\n\nJames Egan: Pleasure talking to you too, Jay. Thanks for listening, and if you enjoy this podcast, please leave us a review wherever you listen and share Thoughts on the Market with a friend or colleague today.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nJay Bacow: So, Jim, the lock-in effect is: You don\u2019t really want to stay. No. But you don\u2019t really want to go.\n\nJames Egan: That is exactly; that is perfect! Wow. That is the whole issue with the housing market.",

            "content": "Patricia Hurtado\n\nMorgan Stanley was sued by its former head of diversity for allegedly discriminating against Black women who work at the bank.\n\nMarilyn Booker, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1994 and became its first global head of diversity, claims in her lawsuit that senior \u201cWhite male-centric leadership\u201d refused to adopt her plan to address racial bias at the firm and instead terminated her in December.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, comes as Wall Street and corporate America are facing tough questions about their commitment to diversity in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd\u2019s death at police hands.\n\nBooker opened her 47-page complaint by describing Morgan Stanley\u2019s response to Floyd\u2019s death, including a large contribution to the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund and the promotion of two Black women to senior leadership committees. She noted that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman had described the present moment as a \u201cturning point in race relations.\u201d\n\nBut she cast the bank\u2019s recent statements and actions as hypocritical in light of its alleged past conduct. \u201cClearly, Black lives did not matter at Morgan Stanley,\u201d she said.\n\nMorgan Stanley didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelated:Edward Jones Outlines Steps to Address Racism\n\nOnly 2.2% of Morgan Stanley\u2019s U.S. executives are Black, according to company data. That number hasn\u2019t budged for the last three years.\n\nBooker seeks a judgment that bars the bank from discriminating against her and other Black women at the firm and asks for unspecified damages.\n\n\u2018Lip Service\u2019\n\nBooker, most recently a managing director at the bank, said she repeatedly voiced her concerns about \u201cirrefutable and appalling patterns\u201d in the firm\u2019s hiring, retention and lack of advancement of Black employees. But she claims Morgan Stanley only paid \u201clip service\u201d to these issues.\n\n\u201cTirelessly, but to no avail, Ms. Booker tried to force Morgan Stanley\u2019s leadership, including Gorman, to address the systemic racial discrimination rampant at the Firm,\u201d she said.\n\nMorgan Stanley instead hamstrung her efforts by steadily decreasing her budget year over year, according to the complaint, \u201ceven though her budget would not amount to a drop in the bucket for Morgan Stanley when compared to the money it threw at other initiatives and the massive revenue the firm generated.\u201d\n\nShe claims 14 Black managing directors, out of only a few dozen at Morgan Stanley, left between 2017 and 2019, but the bank made no effort to retain them. Gorman\u2019s attitude, she said, was: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then leave.\u201d\n\nRelated:Advisors Fear Backlash For Speaking Out\n\nThere was marked contrast with how White managing directors who threatened to leave were treated, she alleges.\n\n\u2018Good Riddance\u2019\n\n\u201cFor Black MDs departing Morgan Stanley, the sentiment at the firm was \u2018good riddance\u2019 and \u2018glad to see you go,\u2019 rather than, \u2018why are they leaving us?\u2019 or \u2018how could we do better?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn contrast, when White MDs left or sought to leave, the Firm made significant efforts to retain them.\u201d\n\nBooker also alleges that throughout her tenure, Morgan Stanley exploited her as a \u201ctoken response and symbol of its purported commitment to diversity,\u201d having her make public appearances on its behalf, including a 2008 appearance before Congress.\n\nMorgan Stanley isn\u2019t alone on Wall Street in its underrepresentation of African Americans. Of the more than 80 people now listed on the elite executive teams atop the six largest U.S. banks, only one is Black: Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. In 2018, JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay $24 million to settle a discrimination suit brought by Black financial advisers.\n\nIn the wake of the Floyd protests, Gorman announced that a commitment to diversity and inclusion would become one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s five core values. He also named Carol Greene-Vincent, the bank\u2019s global audit head, to its operating committee, the most senior leadership board, and current diversity head Susan Reid to the management committee.\n\nAccording to Booker, prior to Greene-Vincent\u2019s promotion, 14 of the firm\u2019s 16 operating committee members were White and 14 were men.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story:\n\nPatricia Hurtado in Federal Court in Manhattan at [email protected];\n\nSridhar Natarajan in New York at [email protected]\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story:\n\nDavid Glovin at [email protected]\n\nAnthony Lin",

Based on consensus forward P/E estimates.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nDiversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and may therefore be less that what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks.In general, equities securities\u2019 values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small- and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risks). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nThe indexes are unmanaged and do not include any expenses, fees or sales charges.

            "content": "Key Takeaways Morgan Stanley analysts said Walmart's profit margins have been overlooked as drivers of money that can be reinvested, unlocking momentum for the retailer's \"flywheel\" strategy, driven in part by Walmart's e-commerce and financial services operations.\n\nIts price target is just a bit above the Street's consensus near $109\u2014but it sees an opportunity for the shares to reach $150 in a best-case scenario.\n\nStill, some analysts say Walmart shares don't have much room to grow ahead of the retailer's scheduled earnings release on Thursday. Bank of America analysts say the company may face \"tough comparisons\" with its peers after a strong upward run.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts think Walmart (WMT) shares are nearing a top. One research team thinks the retailer's strong profit margins could help them keep climbing.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t appreciate how much momentum Walmart\u2019s strategy has, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a Tuesday note, saying that the company has the profit margins to invest in robots and other technology to drive efficiencies in its e-commerce businesses, for example.\n\nMorgan Stanley gave the retailer a price target of $115\u2014about 10% above Wednesday\u2019s $104 closing price\u2013ahead of the company\u2019s scheduled earnings release tomorrow morning. But its analysts' bull case sees the shares rising above $150, which would mark a higher level than any of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently predict.\n\n\u201cAs Walmart+ membership continues to grow, the [first-party and third-party] e-commerce businesses stand to benefit, which yields greater data insights and \u2018shots on goal\u2019 for Retail Media, which fuels more profit and reinvestment in [Walmart's] core value proposition both in grocery and in general merchandise,\u201d the note said. \u201cThis flywheel has never been stronger.\u201d\n\nOther Analysts See More Limited Upside\n\nWalmart shares are trading near a 20-year high and are \u201cunlikely to see meaningful multiple expansion beyond current levels,\u201d Bank of America analysts wrote last week. \u201cTough comparisons/high expectations for [Walmart] going forward could limit potential for upward stock price momentum relative to peers.\u201d\n\nBank of America maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Walmart, as did nearly all of the other analysts who follow Walmart and are polled by Visible Alpha. The analysts\u2019 average consensus price target per Visible Alpha is around $109.\n\nAnalysts broadly expect Walmart to announce roughly $180.4 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion in net income\u2014the latter of which would be up more than 6% year-over-year, according to Visible Alpha. For the full fiscal year, they\u2019re anticipating revenue of $680.9 billion and a roughly 12% jump in net income to $20.1 billion.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Formula One\u2019s rising popularity in the US has drawn an investment from a top-performing Morgan Stanley fund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKristian Heugh, manager of the $14.6 billion Global Opportunity Fund, opened a position in F1 owner Liberty Media Corp. in the third quarter of last year. His 34-stock portfolio outran 92% of peers in 2024 with a 27% return, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe racing series, which held a glitzy launch event for the 2025 season in London on Tuesday evening, is probably \u201cone of the most unique assets in the world,\u201d Heugh said in an interview. \u201cIt has a lot of growth in viewership, especially in the US, and it\u2019s far outpacing other marquee sports that may have seen viewership declines in some cases.\u201d\n\nLong seen as a posh European motorsport, F1 has made inroads in the US in recent years, helped in-part by a hit Netflix series. Las Vegas hosted its first F1 grand prix in 40 years in 2023, drawing about 300,000 people. Three races are planned in the US this year, including one in Miami.\n\nAn average of 1.1 million viewers watched races on ESPN and ABC platforms last year, just short of the 2022 record but more than double the viewership from 2018, according to ESPN data.\n\nShares of Liberty Media were up about 2% in late New York trading on Wednesday, heading back toward this month\u2019s record high, which followed a 47% rally in 2024. The firm is planning to spin off Quint, which offers ticket and hospitality packages to sports and entertainment events. It\u2019s also buying the motorcycle racing league MotoGP World Championship for $3.8 billion, though the deal is facing an in-depth probe from the European Union.\n\nApart from a still under-monetized US market, the F1 brand holds other appeals to Heugh. With more than 80% of revenue locked in multiyear contracts, the business benefits from \u201ctremendous visibility,\u201d he said. He also sees rising competition among streaming platforms boosting the value of sports rights.\n\nOne potential risk to F1 is automakers\u2019 increased focus on electric vehicles. Formula E, a decade-old electric racing series, features manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar and Nissan.\n\nBut the technology for electric racing performance over long distances isn\u2019t quite there yet, Heugh said. A new hybrid system next year and F1\u2019s pledge to reach net zero carbon by 2030 should also reassure sustainability focused fans, he said.",

            "content": "2. Private Credit in Demand from Borrowers and Investors\n\nIn 2025, issuers and investors will likely continue to drive private credit\u2019s growth. Compared to public syndicated loans, private credit is attractive to some borrowers for its tailored and more flexible structures and to investors for enhanced returns, diversification and the ability to deploy capital in scale. Private credit assets under management may reach $2.8 trillion by 2028, which would double 2022\u2019s asset level, according to Preqin.4\n\n\n\nMorgan Stanley helps companies choose the right market based on their borrowing needs and investor interest. \u201cWe spot situations and quickly identify whether the public/syndicated or private markets will offer the best execution for our clients,\u201d Shah says.\n\nSome issuers have been raising debt in private markets to help refinance their existing loans. In October 2024, Morgan Stanley helped Canadian gaming company Gateway Casinos & Entertainment raise $1.3 billion of private debt to refinance its loans and issue a dividend to shareholders. In March 2024, Morgan Stanley also helped Rockefeller Capital Management raise $850 million of debt in private markets to refinance its loans.\n\n3. Wave of Capital Spending on AI and Energy\n\nAs enterprise and consumer demand for artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow, companies need to raise capital to invest in data centers and energy infrastructure. Capital markets will play a crucial role in facilitating these developments, through solutions that include private credit and tax equity, in which investors provide capital to a project in exchange for its tax benefits.\n\nCompanies are using tax equity as a source of funding for U.S. projects in sectors such as renewable energy, which can receive tax credits from the U.S. government for advancing environmental objectives. In July 2024, Morgan Stanley served as sole lead provider of tax equity for Intersect Power\u2019s $837 million in financing that included construction debt, tax equity and term debt financing to build battery energy storage systems in Texas.5\n\nAmong private credit issuances in the energy space, Morgan Stanley worked with Tennessee Valley Authority in October 2024 to raise $720 million of financing through secured Holdco notes (which offer collateral protection to lenders) to help finance a new facility with natural gas-driven combustion turbine generators. \u201cDeals like these highlight the capital needs for the significant growth in power demand,\u201d Shah says.",

            "content": "U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) is pounding the table on Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company Tuya (TUYA), urging investors to buy the stock ahead of earnings on Feb. 26.\n\nHeading into the company\u2019s print, Morgan Stanley reiterated its Buy-equivalent overweight rating on TUYA stock and raised its price target on the shares to $3 from $2.30. In a note to clients, the bank said that \u201cstrong revenue growth momentum\u201d is likely to continue at Tuya, adding \u201cwe think it leaves significant room for the share price to catch up with value.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley added that Tuya, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, is a great way for investors to gain exposure to China\u2019s fast-growing AI sector. Tuya is both an AI and Internet of Things (IoT) platform as a service (PaaS) provider that was founded in 2014. The company provides a cloud platform that developers can use to create and manage AI and IoT technologies.\n\nHot Stock\n\nWhile still little known outside of China, Tuya\u2019s stock has been on fire this year following the emergence of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, which is as powerful as any created by western tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) but made for a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe launch of DeepSeek has forced analysts and investors to re-evaluate China\u2019s AI capabilities and begin funneling capital to Chinese companies involved in the sector. Consequently, Tuya\u2019s stock has been on fire, rising 67% so far this year. Yet, Tuya remains both a small-cap and penny stock with a market capitalization of only $1.80 billion.\n\nMorgan Stanley says investors would be smart to grab TUYA stock before the next leg higher that\u2019s likely to follow the company\u2019s upcoming financial results, and as Tuya becomes a leading player in Chinese AI.\n\nIs TUYA Stock a Buy?\n\nGiven its status as a micro-cap stock, most Wall Street firms do not offer ratings or price targets on TUYA stock. So instead, we\u2019ll look at its three-month performance. As one can see in the chart below, Tuya\u2019s share price has gained 89% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

The investment bank said that it expects Nvidia\u2019s shares to move to the upside following its upcoming financial results.\n\nDifficult Start to 2025\n\nAfter enjoying a blistering rally for much of last year, NVDA stock has gotten off to a rocky start in 2025. So far this year, Nvidia\u2019s shares have barely budged (up 0.39%). The stock endured a big selloff following the emergence of Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app DeepSeek, which raised concerns about future demand for Nvidia\u2019s microchips and processors.\n\nHowever, NVDA stock has recovered in recent weeks, having gained 6% in the past five trading sessions to get back to breakeven on the year. Morgan Stanley said that it still views Nvidia as a best-in-class stock worth owning. \u201cWe believe that NVIDIA should trade at a premium given its higher probability of upward revisions in the near term,\u201d wrote the Wall Street firm in its outlook heading into earnings.\n\nNVDA stock has doubled over the past 12 months.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock currently has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 40 Wall Street analysts.

MSTR, formerly MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and CEO, Michael Saylor. The following week CNBC reported that GameStop is likely to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nSaylor has positioned Strategy as a treasury or a levered play on Bitcoin as it purchases BTC by issuing 0% convertible debt and preferred shares STRK. GME\u2019s Cohen is likely to follow in MSTR\u2019s path and possibly purchase other coins too.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff criticized GameStop\u2018s potential Bitcoin investment as a \u201cHail Mary\u201d move by a company lacking a \u201cviable business plan\u201d. He argues that Bitcoin is even more overvalued than GameStop stock, and compared the move to Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin treasury strategy.\n\nGameStop, a company with no viable business plan, has thrown another Hail Mary by announcing that it might use its cash to buy Bitcoin.

While Nvidia\u2019s stock has seen a modest move in 2025 (up 3.4%), strong business fundamentals, improved Blackwell supply visibility, and robust customer demand support Morgan Stanley\u2019s premium valuation thesis.\n\nThe semiconductor giant\u2019s $3.4 trillion market cap and recent 7% stock rebound reflect its continued dominance in AI chip technology, with Morgan Stanley expecting upward earnings revisions in coming months.\n\nNvidia\u2018s (NVDA) upcoming earnings report on February 26 has caught the attention of Wall Street powerhouse Morgan Stanley (MS), with the investment bank taking a decidedly bullish stance on the semiconductor giant\u2019s prospects. Despite recent market turbulence, Morgan Stanley\u2019s five-star analyst Joseph Moore sees significant upside potential, maintaining a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating and setting a $152 price target for NVDA stock.\n\nThe semiconductor titan, now boasting a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, has faced its share of challenges in early 2025. A notable selloff was triggered by the emergence of Chinese AI application DeepSeek, which sparked investor concerns about potential competition and its impact on Nvidia\u2019s chip demand. However, the stock has demonstrated remarkable resilience, rebounding with a 7% gain over the last five Nas trading sessions to neutralize earlier losses.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s optimistic outlook stems from several key factors that paint a compelling picture for Nvidia\u2019s near-term prospects. The bank points to strengthening business fundamentals and increasing visibility into the supply of Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s next-generation AI chip architecture. Perhaps most significantly, customer appetite for Nvidia\u2019s products remains robust, suggesting sustained demand despite competitive pressures.\n\nThe investment bank\u2019s confidence in Nvidia extends beyond immediate earnings expectations. Morgan Stanley argues that Nvidia deserves to trade at a premium valuation, citing the company\u2019s higher probability of upward earnings revisions in the coming months. This perspective suggests that current market concerns about longer-term risks may be overshadowing the company\u2019s strong underlying business momentum.\n\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s stock has seen a modest 3.4% gain in 2025, this comes after an exceptional rally last year, suggesting a natural pause in momentum. The current consolidation phase could be setting the stage for the next leg up, particularly if the upcoming earnings report validates Morgan Stanley\u2019s optimistic outlook.\n\nThe semiconductor industry\u2019s critical role in advancing artificial intelligence capabilities continues to position Nvidia at the forefront of technological innovation. Despite emerging competitors like DeepSeek, Nvidia\u2019s established ecosystem and technological leadership in AI acceleration provide significant competitive advantages that could drive sustained growth in the quarters ahead.\n\nAs investors await Nvidia\u2019s earnings announcement after the market close on February 26, Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis suggests that the current stock price of $138.48 may represent an attractive entry point for those looking to capitalize on the company\u2019s continued dominance in the AI chip market.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial, investment, or trading advice.

            "content": "Like every year and for now eight consecutive times, Swiss watch industry consultancy firm LuxeConsult and financial institution Morgan Stanley have worked together to bring their annual report of the Swiss watch industry, and the estimated revenues of the top 50 brands. While the 2023 report showed records for the market, it also indicated the potential slow-down of sales for 2024, with macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds and demand uncertainties in the US, Europe and mostly China. Well, not only this has been confirmed by the export statistics for the past years, but the new annual report of Morgan Stanley makes sure that all know that the watch industry isn\u2019t at its best anymore \u2013 well, there are exceptions to this rule, as the hegemony of Rolex is still undisputed. Some brands, on the other hand, have had and will have difficult times ahead.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, according to the Swiss Federation of the Watch Industry (FHS), exports of Swiss watches in 2024 were down 3%, something you could see as a consolidation after record years in 2022 and 2023, or maybe the beginning of a recession for the entire industry. While the FHS give a wide image of the entire industry, the yearly report done by Oliver M\u00fcller/LuxeConsult and Morgan Stanley \u2013 known to be pretty accurate and well-researched \u2013 brings a more detailed image per brand and segment. But as a whole, first, \u201cthe market contracted in 2024, after three years of a post-Covid rebound\u201d indicates the report. What strikes most, however, is the polarization of the market, with the big players hardly suffering or even continuing to grow, while multiple second-tier brands reported strong decline in sales \u2013 \u201cthe largest brands generally gaining further market share (a development common to nearly all sub-segments of the luxury goods sector),\u201d says the report. It is also clear that the higher-end segment of the market is performing better than the mid-range and low-end markers, as \u201cwatches with a retail price tag exceeding CHF 50,000 accounted for 33.5% of the total value of Swiss watch exports but for an impressive 84% of the growth in 2024.\u201d\n\nBelow, for the sake of comparison, the top 50 brands in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAd \u2013 Scroll to continue with article\n\nAs we can see from these charts, there are clear winners (only 11 brands out of 50 with estimated growth) and many brands impacted by the slow-down of the luxury market. First, not only the combined estimated turnover of the top 50 brands has contracted over the course of 2024 \u2013 from 36,127 billion CHF to 35,258 billion CHF \u2013 but what impresses is the number of units sold, which moves from close to 16 million units to now a tad over 13 million units. This indicates that the average price of the watches has grown drastically over the year.\n\nNow if we look in detail, Morgan Stanley\u2019s report confirms a trend it already evoked in the past; polarization. We can see that the leading privately owned brands (Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille) are still growing in this challenging environment, while all three listed groups lost market share \u2013 LVMH and Richemont, but mostly the Swatch Group, which reported sales down 14.6% in 2024, are reporting a decline of (estimated) sales. On the other hand, Rolex is still the largest watch brand by some margin, with an estimated turnover breaking the 10.5 billion CHF barrier (an additional 500 million CHF compared to 2023).\n\nThe so-called \u201cBig Four\u201d (Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille) are \u201ccapturing an impressive aggregated 47% market share. The acceleration of the long-term trend for the four largest privately owned Swiss watch brands (is demonstrated by) a very impressive increase of +1,020 bps from 36.8%\u201d compared to 2019,\u201d according to the report. Rolex, even though its growth is less drastic than in 2023, \u201cfurther expanded its dominant position (\u2026), no other luxury brand can claim such a dominant position in its respective sector.\u201d The same can\u2019t be said about its sister brand Tudor, losing traction and recording a difficult year according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s estimates.\n\nThe second on the podium, Cartier (owned by Richemont), consolidated its position and the report indicates a similar trend for jewellers/watchmakers, as \u201cbrands Cartier, Bulgari and Van Cleef performed the best, gaining market share.\u201d Omega, which closes the podium, follows the trend of the Swatch Group (yet in less dramatic proportions than some sister brands). As other important trends, LuxeConsult and Morgan Stanley indicate that larger independent watchmakers/brands continued to grow in 2024, after a spectacular rise in the previous years \u2013 this is true for FP Journe, H. Moser & Cie or MB&F, which has just entered the report.\n\nHowever, the concentration of the market is undeniable, with now \u201cfour groups accounting for over three-quarters of the Swiss watch industry\u2019s sales,\u201d namely Swatch, Rolex group (the brand Rolex alone accounts for 32% of the market), Richemont and Patek Philippe, while LVMH is now positioned 5th with a market share of just under 6%.\n\nFor more details, visit Morgan Stanley and LuxeConsult.

The company\u2019s creation resulted from the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which required banks to separate their commercial banking and investment banking operations.\n\nAmong those affected by the legislation was J.P. Morgan & Co., one of the most prominent and influential banking institutions in the United States, known for financing major industries and stabilizing financial markets. J.P. Morgan chose to focus on commercial banking, leaving its investment banking business to Henry Morgan\u2014J.P. Morgan\u2019s grandson\u2014and Harold Stanley. Together, they established Morgan Stanley as a dedicated investment bank whose customers included corporations, governments, and financial institutions.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s business divisions\n\nMorgan Stanley is organized into three primary divisions that offer specific services geared toward customers\u2019 needs.\n\nInstitutional securities. This business unit serves corporations, governments, financial institutions, and high-net-worth customers.\n\nAlso included in this business unit are corporate lending and credit products, institutional investments, and institutional research.\n\nWealth management. This division\u2019s products and services are geared toward individuals, small to midsize businesses, and large institutions. They include:\n\nMarket-making activities in fixed-income securities\n\nBrokerage and investment advisory services\n\nFinancial and wealth planning services\n\nInsurance and annuity products\n\nCredit and other lending products\n\nRetirement plan services\n\nBanking\n\nInvestment management. This unit works with institutions such as government entities, corporations, pension funds, foundations, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies. Individuals can purchase products and services through financial advisors, brokers, or other third-party distributors.\n\nThe division provides traditional asset management products, including equity, fixed income, liquidity, managed futures, and alternatives. It also oversees merchant banking and real estate investing.\n\nMilestones in Morgan Stanley\u2019s evolution\n\nMorgan Stanley opened for business on September 16, 1935, following the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act (also known as the Banking Act) in 1933, which required J.P. Morgan & Co. to separate its commercial and investment banking operations. As an independent firm, Morgan Stanley quickly made its mark, advising on initial public offerings and private placements of securities worth $1.1 billion in its first year\u2014a substantial figure at the time.\n\nBy 1942, Morgan Stanley had become a member of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), solidifying its status as a leading investment bank.\n\nIn the 1960s Morgan Stanley was among the first financial institutions to develop a computer model for complex financial analysis. The company opened its first international office in Paris in 1967.\n\nThe 1970s were a period of rapid growth for Morgan Stanley. From 1972 to 1977, the company established its sales and trading, research, investment management, real estate, and private wealth management businesses.\n\nThe financial institution expanded geographically in the 1980s by establishing an international business division focused on the unique needs of customers in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Morgan Stanley became a public company in 1986, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol MS.\n\nThe company opened its first of four global information centers in 2000. Initially focused on trade settlements, these centers have expanded their services to include research, data analysis, and risk management.",

            "content": "Analysts at Morgan Stanley said there's still plenty of overweight-rated stocks to buy ahead of earnings as the reporting season wraps up. The firm says it's sticking with stocks like Nvidia heading into quarterly reports. Other stocks Morgan Stanley likes include: EQT , Arista Networks and Tuya. Arista Networks Analyst Meta Marshall is standing by shares of the networking stock ahead of earnings on Tuesday. \"[The] company has beaten revenue by ~300-400bps over the last 3-4 years, about in line with buyside expectations into the quarter,\" she wrote. Still, Marshall said the fourth-quarter results are not likely to move the needle. \"Further multiple expansion\" is on hold until the company shows a meaningful amount of new customers, she added. The company does, however, having an underappreciated opportunity in the data center space. \"Our checks were incrementally more positive on networking this quarter, with data center an area of focus and expectations of gradual improvement throughout the year,\" she said. Arista shares are up 61% over the last year. EQT Buy any dip in shares of the hydrocarbon exploration company, according to analyst Devin McDermott. \"The pullback creates an attractive entry point, with valuations now more compelling,\" he wrote in a recent note. EQT remains a top pick at the firm ahead of earnings on Wednesday. The stock has risen more than 60% over the past 12 months, and is already up 16% year to date. McDermott said the stock's recent choppiness is due to concerns around DeepSeek's AI model, which has the potential to lessen power demand. The firm acknowledged that those concerns may persist, but says it still sees a buying opportunity. \"Rising power consumption is a source of longer-term gas demand upside, but LNG [liquified natural gas] is a much larger near-term growth driver,\" he wrote. \"We continue to prefer gas over oil exposure within E & Ps and recommend buying the gas pullback,\" he went on to say. Tuya Tuya shares are up a whopping 66% this year, but the firm says the China internet of things and AI company has plenty more room to run. The firm reiterated its overweight rating in a recent note clients, saying there is \"strong revenue growth momentum\" that's likely to continue. However, analyst Yang Liu said there's a \"mismatch between fundamentals and share price,\" urging investors to remain calm. \"We think it leaves significant room for the share price to catch up with value,\" she added. The firm acknowledged some tariff risk, but says there's too many other positive catalysts to ignore right now. Liu also raised her price target to $3 from $2.30 with fourth-quarter earnings on deck on Feb. 26, which is the same day Nvidia reports its results. \"The robust top-line growth is likely to be sustained by strong overseas IoT demand and Tuya's market share gains,\" she in her quarterly preview. Nvidia \"While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build, customer desire to spend is clearly on display. ... .We believe that NVIDIA should trade at a premium given its higher probability of upward revisions in the near term.\" EQT \"We continue to prefer gas over oil exposure within E & Ps and recommend buying the gas pullback. ... .The pullback creates an attractive entry point, with valuations now more compelling. ... .Rising power consumption is a source of longer-term gas demand upside, but LNG [liquified natural gas] is a much larger near-term growth driver.\" Arista \"Company has beaten revenue by ~300-400bps over the last 3-4 years, about inline with buyside expectations into the quarter. ... .Further multiple expansion likely requires news of additional material customers or advancement on paused trials. ... .Our checks were incrementally more positive on networking this quarter, with data center an area of focus and expectations of gradual improvement throughout the year.\" Tuya \"We reiterate our OW rating & raise our PT to factor in sustained strong revenue growth driven by overseas IoT & good cost control. ... .The robust top-line growth is likely to be sustained by strong overseas IoT demand & Tuya's market share gains. ... .Strong revenue growth momentum to be sustained. ... .Mismatch between fundamentals & share price. ... .We think it leaves significant room for the share price to catch up with value.\"",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now In this article, we are going to take a look at where Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stands against other best financial sector dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks have led the market, delivering one of the strongest performances among all sectors. While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market\u2019s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025.\n\nThe US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now\n\nFinancial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 5.9% gain.\n\nAnother key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test\u2019s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year.\n\nThe financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector.

From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

He expresses concern over signs of market euphoria, particularly when unprofitable tech and biotech sectors lead market gains without fundamental backing, suggesting this could signal the market\u2019s peak.\n\nSlimmon points out that while there\u2019s still significant money on the sidelines, the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts will influence how quickly the market moves into a potentially dangerous euphoric phase, advocating for a cautious approach to the current market dynamics.\n\nIn a recent segment on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019, Andrew Slimmon, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, shared his insights on the current state of the stock market, suggesting that we are in the later stages of a classic bull market cycle. Slimmon explained that following a 25% correction in 2022, the market saw a significant buying opportunity, though many investors initially sat on the sidelines, deterred by the allure of 5% risk-free returns from money markets. However, as we\u2019ve moved into the third year, there\u2019s a noticeable shift to an optimism phase, with substantial flows into equities, particularly from retail investors, indicating a change in investor sentiment.\n\nSlimmon highlighted that despite the high levels of U.S. stock ownership, there remains a significant amount of money\u2014$8 trillion in money markets\u2014waiting on the sidelines, which could potentially fuel further market growth. Yet, his concern grows as he observes signs of market behavior transitioning towards euphoria, a phase typically preceding market downturns. He pointed to the recent performance of unprofitable tech and biotech sectors as examples of this shift, suggesting that when market movements lose correlation with fundamentals, it\u2019s a red flag.\n\nWhile the fear and greed index currently sits at a neutral level, Slimmon\u2019s worry is compounded by the lack of significant IPO excitement and the recent performance of publicly traded private equity stocks, which he attributes to the Federal Reserve\u2019s slower-than-expected rate cuts. He posits that a more gradual approach to rate adjustments might extend the bull market\u2019s life but also warns that aggressive cuts could hasten the arrival of the euphoric stage, potentially leading to a quicker market peak. His analysis underscores a cautious optimism, advising investors to watch what people do with their money rather than what they say, as real investment flows provide clearer signals of market health and direction.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson has suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, could play a pivotal role in revitalizing the US economy. This comes amid ongoing discussions about government spending and economic growth.\n\nWhat Happened: Wilson said in a CNBC interview that the bank\u2019s optimistic outlook involves a reduction in government size, which could lead to increased unemployment and prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\n\nWilson noted that DOGE has already pinpointed tens of billions in government waste.\n\nHe believes that achieving a balanced federal budget could spur market growth in 2025, similar to the economic boost following President Clinton\u2019s 1994 budget cuts.\n\n\u201cProbably the most underestimated part of the administration is DOGE. I think there's a lot of skepticism on this, but the reality is that's possibly the most bullish thing that could happen,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed that while specific budget cuts aren\u2019t necessary, slowing expenditure growth is vital. The U.S. national debt stands at $36.2 trillion, having risen by nearly $2.1 trillion in the past year.\n\n\u201cWe just need to freeze spending, we don't really need to cut a lot of spending,\" Wilson added.\n\nWhy It Matters: The recent decision by President Donald Trump to halt penny production reflects DOGE\u2019s influence on fiscal policies. This move followed Musk\u2019s department highlighting the inefficiency of penny production, which cost taxpayers $179 million in 2023.\n\nMoreover, Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious target to cut federal spending by $4 billion daily by 2026 could lead to a 30% reduction in government spending, excluding interest and Social Security benefits.\n\nThis initiative involves notable Silicon Valley figures, including Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen and Uber Technologies Inc. co-founder Travis Kalanick.\n\nAdditionally, Musk has advocated for implementing blockchain technology within the Treasury Department to address payment irregularities, underscoring his commitment to efficiency and transparency.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock",

Now, her investment firm has been ordered to pay her $843,000, according to a copy of her complaint seen by AdvisorHub and a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration awarded this week.\n\nBarron's reports that Morgan Stanley was found liable for negligence by the arbitration panel for allowing the victim, Marjorie Kessler, to make two \"large and unusual\" withdrawals from her accounts. In the complaint, Kessler claimed that her brokerage advisors should have noted how \"uncharacteristic\" her requests were and that they didn't take \"reasonable\" steps to provide a \"trusted contact\" for the account, as required by oversight rules.\n\nRelated: Bravo's Andy Cohen Lost 'A Lot of Money' to a Highly Sophisticated Scam \u2014 Here's How to Avoid Becoming a Victim Yourself\n\nThe scam involved multiple criminals who pretended to be technical support staffers, employees at the bank, and even government workers. Kessler was told, among other things, that she was the victim of identity theft and would face having her assets frozen. The fraudsters convinced her to make two major withdrawals and convert them into cash, gold bars, and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe transactions were placed in July and August 2023, less than two weeks apart, and totaled about one-third of her assets at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn response to the complaint, Morgan Stanley claimed Kessler is \"incredibly sharp\" and has been managing her money by herself for almost 20 years. The firm says she lied to her advisor, saying she was purchasing two condos, one for herself and one for her newly divorced daughter.\n\nIn response to the payment order, Morgan Stanley said in a statement they \"sympathize with Ms. Kessler as the victim of a third-party fraud\" but noted that \"this fraud did not occur at Morgan Stanley.\"\n\nRelated: If Your Bank Is Calling, Don't Answer. It's Probably a Scam.\n\n\"The firm should not be held responsible for her losses as Ms. Kessler made misstatements to her financial advisor about the purpose of the transfers, and authorized them to be sent to a third-party bank account held in her name,\" the statement said.\n\nKessler's lawyer Lloyd Schwed, meanwhile, said that Morgan Stanley \"ignored multiple red flags\" and regular oversight, per Barron's.\n\n\"Morgan Stanley is just trying to explain away its negligence in believing a preposterous story that a 75-year-old widow suddenly needed to borrow more than $2 million in a span of eight days to buy not one but two homes,\" Schwed said.\n\nRelated: AI Cloning Hoax Can Copy Your Voice in 3 Seconds\u2014and It's Emptying Bank Accounts.

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nCustom AI-focused ASICs are increasingly being billed as NVIDIA's Achilles heel, capable of bringing down the entire demand-related edifice that NVIDIA has painstakingly built by leveraging its strength in the GPU arena. Yet, Morgan Stanley Research now thinks that ASICs pose no threat to NVIDIA's broader success story.\n\nMorgan Stanley: Despite ASICs, Nvidia will continue to maintain a dominant market share. The ASIC category is neither superior nor inferior to commercial GPUs\u2014it is simply another means to achieve the same result. Over the past six months, momentum in the AI sector has clearly\u2026 \u2014 Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 14, 2025\n\nTo wit, Morgan Stanley Research has now penned an exhaustive note on the evolving GPU vs. ASIC paradigm, arguing that NVIDIA faces no material threat to its dominant position in the market.\n\nThe research arm of the Wall Street titan concedes at the outset that \"momentum in the AI sector has clearly shifted toward custom silicon,\" and so has the market, with NVIDIA currently commanding a ~$3 trillion market capitalization on the back of $32 billion in quarterly revenues, while Broadcom (AVGO) now supports a $1.1 trillion market cap on just $3.2 billion in quarterly revenues.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research then notes that the development budget of a given ASIC is generally less than $1 billion, and often much lower. In contrast, NVIDIA spends an insane amount of money to deliver an immaculate product:\n\n\"... NVIDIA will invest approximately $16 billion in R&D this year alone. With that funding, NVIDIA can maintain a 4\u20135\u2011year development cycle by running three design teams sequentially\u2014each with an 18\u201324\u2011month architectural cadence\u2014delivering innovation over a five\u2011year span. In addition, they invest billions in interconnect technologies to boost rack\u2011scale and cluster\u2011scale performance...\"\n\nOf course, custom ASIC's such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are much more customizable. However, Morgan Stanley argues that the \"largest AI training and inference clusters are not currently highly customized,\" and NVIDIA continues to optimize its GPUs for transformer models. Going forward, Morgan Stanley thinks that the greatest utility for highly customized ASICs will lie in \"legacy workloads.\"\n\nYet, some might argue that the cost factor is the biggest draw for customized ASICs, which can cost as little as $3,000 while NVIDIA's H100 is priced at $20,000.\n\nHere though, Morgan Stanley argues that there are hidden costs that should be taken into account. For instance, the cluster cost for ASICs is often materially higher as they employ the much more expensive optical connect technology, while NVIDIA's 72\u2011GPU NVLINK domain leverages the much cheaper copper-based technology.\n\nMoreover, with its unmatched buying power, NVIDIA can easily secure preferential rates for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. The Wall Street titan goes on to note:\n\n\"The same applies to CoWoS; because many ASICs use smaller dies with larger stacks, the CoWoS cost can be higher than that of NVIDIA. Of course, NVIDIA\u2019s wafer costs might be higher due to reticle\u2011limited dies, but overall, Nvidia delivers exceptional value.\"\n\nNext, Morgan Stanley argues that 'software developer hours' should also be incorporated in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for ASICs, where NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) SDK is at a distinct advantage and provides for a much more efficient software development experience.\n\nMorgan Stanley then goes on to assert that \"NVIDIA and AMD will outperform ASIC competitors [this year] \u2014 especially in the second half of the year.\"\n\n\"The scale of AMD\u2019s investments across the ecosystem tends to far exceed that of ASIC vendors. This year, AMD has completed two acquisitions of AI software assets. One of these\u2014the acquisition of ZT Systems\u2014involved acquiring a major server ODM, divesting the ODM business while retaining key engineering talent related to rack\u2011 and cluster\u2011scale computing. Once in possession of such assets, AMD can deploy them across multiple cloud environments, which drives third\u2011party support and accelerates ecosystem development. Can ASIC designers within the cloud replicate this?\"\n\nNext, Morgan Stanley Research notes that in 2024, commercial silicon controlled 90 percent of the market, led by NVIDIA's $98 billion in chip-based revenue (on a provisional basis since the GPU manufacturer has yet to announce its earnings for the last quarter) and trailed by AMD at $5 billion. In contrast, custom ASICs controlled only 10 percent of the market in 2024, led by Broadcom with $8 billion in revenue, and trailed by Alchip and Marvel whose combined revenue amounted to only ~$2 billion.\n\nIn what is a critical prediction, Morgan Stanley then declares:\n\n\"We expect the 90% share for commercial products to increase slightly this year.\"\n\nTo bolster this prediction, the Wall Street behemoth notes that Broadcom is overly reliant on Google's TPU to drive sales. Yet, in 2025, NVIDIA \"will grow 50 \u2013 100% more than TPU.\"\n\nSimilarly, Marvel is increasingly reliant on Amazon's Trainium ASIC. While Amazon is all set to double its ASIC purchases to ~$4 billion this year, it is also expected to \"more than double\" its purchases from NVIDIA.\n\nTherefore, Morgan Stanley thinks that NVIDIA's \"revenue momentum in the second half [of 2025] will be significantly stronger than the builds from ASIC or AMD.\"\n\nBeyond 2026, ASIC growth can explode, with Broadcom's own SAM analysis predicting that \"Google, Meta, and Bytedance could each achieve between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue in the 2027 fiscal year with clusters numbering in the millions.\"\n\nNonetheless, Morgan Stanley thinks that \"the total addressable market (TAM) for AI ASICs would grow from $12 billion in 2024 to $30 billion in 2027\u2014a figure considerably lower than what is being discounted in the market now.\"\n\nTowards the end, the investment bank notes:",

            "content": "Index Definitions\n\nFor index, indicator and survey definitions referenced in this report please visit the following:\n\nhttps://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-investmentsolutions/wmir-definitions\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe majority of $25 and $1000 par preferred securities are \u201ccallable\u201d meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.\n\nSome $25 or $1000 par preferred securities are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional \u2018dividend paying\u2019 perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period \u2013 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.\n\nInterest on municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax; however, some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Also, municipal bonds acquired in the secondary market at a discount may be subject to the market discount tax provisions, and therefore could give rise to taxable income. Typically, state tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s state of residence and, if applicable, local tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s city of residence. The tax-exempt status of municipal securities may be changed by legislative process, which could affect their value and marketability\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. Investing in currency involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nCompanies paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time.\n\nInvesting in commodities entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.\n\nPhysical precious metals are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) provides certain protection for customers\u2019 cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm\u2019s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers\u2019 assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias. You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.\n\nRebalancing does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets. There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy. Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.\n\nThe indices are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley and six other banks sold $4.74 billion of X Holdings Corp. debt, allowing the lenders to finally rid themselves of the bulk of their exposure to the financing they arranged for Elon Musk\u2019s 2022 purchase of the social-media platform.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Wall Street bank had been marketing a $3 billion portion but decided to increase the offering after meeting with strong appetite from investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter who weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Demand was such that buyers paid face value for the 9.5% debt due 2029, the people said.\n\nThe latest transaction is the third sale of X debt in the span of less than a month, a frenetic period that marks an extraordinary turn of fortune for banks that had been stuck with $13 billion of debt from Musk\u2019s controversial $44 billion buyout of the platform formerly known as Twitter. The billionaire\u2019s relationship with President Donald Trump, X\u2019s improved finances and its stake in artificial intelligence project xAI all combined to help win over investors who had spurned banks\u2019 attempts to offload the borrowings for more than two years.\n\nThe first sale \u2014 a $1 billion loan that served as a test of the market \u2014 priced in a range of 90-to-95 cents on the dollar. That was quickly followed by a sale of $5.5 billion in debt for 97 cents on the dollar. After Thursday\u2019s offering, banks are now holding a mere $1.3 billion in remaining X debt to be sold.\n\nBanks typically sell debt into the market immediately after financing a buyout, but investors balked at the idea in this case, concerned about the price Musk had paid and that his changes to content-moderation policies would drive away advertisers. At one point, the market valued the debt at just 60 cents on the dollar.\n\nMore recently, investors have taken comfort in signs that X\u2019s revenue from subscriptions and advertising is growing. For instance, its adjusted revenue spiked to $312 million in December, up 40% from a year earlier and up 21% from the prior month, some of the people said. Those newly shared monthly figures back up material Morgan Stanley had touted in prior marketing efforts, which also included the company\u2019s stake in xAI.\n\nA representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while a representative for X didn\u2019t respond to a request seeking comment.",

This decision underscores the firm\u2019s confidence in his leadership and its strong financial performance.\n\nSince Pick took over as CEO on January 1, 2024, Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock has surged 68%, reflecting investor optimism under his leadership. Adding to the momentum, the bank reported strong Q4 earnings results on January 16, with both revenue and profit exceeding Wall Street estimates. Further, Morgan Stanley reported a 47% jump in annual profits, reaching $13.4 billion in 2024.\n\nLooking back on the year, Pick called FY24 one of the \u201cstrongest years in the firm\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nPick\u2019s Majority Bonus Is Tied to Long-Term Performance\n\nThe bank\u2019s regulatory filing reveals that Pick\u2019s $34 million compensation package includes a $1 million base salary, with the remainder tied to performance-based incentives. Notably, 75% of his bonus will be deferred over three years and remains subject to cancellation. Also, his entire deferred bonus will be granted in the form of equity awards, aligning his earnings with shareholder interests.\n\nMorgan Stanley justified the pay package by citing Pick\u2019s \u201coutstanding performance,\u201d the successful leadership transition, and the firm\u2019s exceptional financial results. The compensation committee emphasized that these factors played a crucial role in determining his 2024 earnings.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Top Bosses See Pay Raises\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s decision aligns with a broader trend among major U.S. banks, which have been rewarding their top executives with hefty pay packages. Bank of America (BAC) recently announced a raise for CEO Brian Moynihan, bringing his total compensation to $35 million for 2024. Meanwhile, JPMorgan (JPM) boosted CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s pay to $39 million, matching Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon\u2019s compensation.\n\nThese compensation hikes reflect the financial sector\u2019s strong performance and the value placed on leadership stability.\n\nIs MS a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on MS stock, based on five Buys and 10 Holds. The average MS price target of $143.50 implies almost 5% upside from current levels.\n\nSee more MS analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Index Definitions\n\nFor index, indicator and survey definitions referenced in this report please visit the following:\n\nhttps://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-investmentsolutions/wmir-definitions\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe majority of $25 and $1000 par preferred securities are \u201ccallable\u201d meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.\n\nSome $25 or $1000 par preferred securities are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional \u2018dividend paying\u2019 perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period \u2013 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risksThese risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nAsset-backed securities generally decrease in value as a result of interest rate increases, but may benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates, principally because of prepayments.\n\nInvesting in commodities entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.\n\nPhysical precious metals are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) provides certain protection for customers\u2019 cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm\u2019s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers\u2019 assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias. You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.\n\nRebalancing does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets. There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy. Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.\n\nThe indices are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted.

This sale would increase that amount to $9.5 billion, leaving the banks with only another $3 billion slug on their books.\n\nThe sales mark a surprising turnaround for what had long been seen as an ill-fated financing of Musk\u2019s 2022 takeover of the platform previously known as Twitter Inc. Banks typically sell debt into the market immediately after such a buyout, but investors balked at the idea, concerned about the price Musk had paid and that his changes to content-moderation policies would drive away advertisers.\n\nBut the billionaire\u2019s close ties to President Donald Trump, including an advisory role, swiftly changed perceptions about X\u2019s prospects. Investors expect Musk\u2019s position in the administration to help his business interests, even as his aggressive government cost-cutting efforts have sown upheaval in Washington.\n\nMorgan Stanley first tested investor appetite with a $1 billion loan sale that priced in a range of 90-to-95 cents on the dollar. It quickly followed up with a sale that was initially meant to be $3 billion but received strong demand after a full-blown marketing effort that included a meeting with top X executives. The bank scaled up the size to $5.5 billion and was able to sell it for 97 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe Financial Times earlier reported some parts of the sale details.\n\nMorgan Stanley advised Musk on the purchase, led the financing and sales and also held the largest chunk of X debt. Other holders include Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., BNP Paribas SA, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA.\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Arroyo and Gowri Gurumurthy.",

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I\u2019m Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief Asia Economist.\n\nToday I\u2019ll be taking a look at the Indian economy amidst escalating trade tensions in Asia and around the globe.\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday, March 13, at 2 PM in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nOver the last few months, investors have been skeptical about India\u2019s growth narrative. Investors \u2013 like us \u2013 have been caught off-guard by the surprising recent slowdown in India\u2019s growth. With the benefit of hindsight, we can very clearly attribute the slowdown to\n\nan unexpected double tightening of fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nBut India seems to be on its way to recovery. Green shoots are already emerging in recent data. And we believe the recovery will continue to firm up over the coming months. What makes us so confident in our outlook for India?\n\nWe see several key factors behind this trend:\n\nFirst, fiscal policy\u2019s turning supportive for growth again. The government has been ramping up capital expenditure for infrastructure projects like roads and railways, with growth accelerating markedly in recent months. They have also cut income tax for households which will be effective from April 2025.\n\nSecond, monetary policy easing across rates, liquidity, and the regulatory front. With CPI inflation recently printing at just 3.6% which is below target, we believe the central bank will continue to pursue easy monetary policy.\n\nAnd third, moderation in food inflation will mean real household incomes will be lifted.\n\nFinally, the strength in services exports. Services exports include IT services, and increasingly business services. In fact, post-covid India\u2019s had very strong growth in business services exports. And the key reason for that is, post-covid, I think businesses have come to realize that if you can work from home, you can work from Bangalore. India's services exports have nearly doubled since December 2020, outpacing the 40% rise in goods exports over the same period. This has resulted in services exports reaching $410 billion on an annualized basis in January, almost equal to the $430 billion of goods exports. Moreover, India continues to gain market share in services exports, which now account for 4.5% of the global total, up from 4% in 2020.\n\nTo be sure there are some risks. India does face reciprocal tariff risks due to its large trade surplus with the US and high tariff rates that India imposes select imports from the US. But we believe that by September-October this year, India can reach a trade deal with the US.\n\nIn any case, India's goods exports-to-GDP ratio is the lowest in the region. And even if global trade slows down due to tariff uncertainties, India's economy won't be as severely affected. In fact, it could potentially outperform the other economies in the region.\n\nThanks for listening. If you enjoy the show, please leave us a review wherever you listen and share Thoughts on the Market with a friend or colleague today.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley and Raymond James executives expressed optimism at industry conferences Tuesday about their firms' ability to gather new assets after slowing down a bit in 2024.\n\nSpeaking at the Bank of America Securities Financial Services Conference in Miami Beach, Florida, Morgan Stanley co-president Andy Saperstein said the dip seen in his firm's net new assets last year obscured just how strong its growth prospects remain. Morgan Stanley reported last month that its net new assets \u2014 a measure of asset collections irrespective of market ups and downs \u2014 was down by nearly 11% in 2024 to $252 billion.\n\nSaperstein, the head of Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management unit, said the decline was really the result of greater outflows rather than a significant slowdown in inflows. In fact, he said, Morgan Stanley's asset inflows last year were roughly equal to what they were in 2021, when the firm reported a record of $437.8 billion in net new assets.\n\nIt's just that in 2024, clients took a lot more money out, he said.\n\n\"The 2024 net result was lower not because our ability to drive growth was weaker, but because outflows were also elevated,\" Saperstein said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nMorgan Stanley stresses quality over quantity as net new assets dip\n\nRaymond James joins trend of dropping quarterly headcounts\n\nDynasty brings over $6.4B RIA from Raymond James\n\nMorgan Stanley attracts assets even with AML scrutiny\n\nSaperstein in part blamed high interest rates, which prompted many investors to use their money to pay off debts. Other clients were simply spending more to keep pace with inflation.\n\n\"There were some idiosyncratic reasons why in 2024 there was elevated outflows that wouldn't be concerning,\" Saperstein said. \"It's part of the environment. It's part of life.\"\n\nRaymond James building NNA by recruiting from wirehouses\n\nMeanwhile at the UBS Financial Services Conference in Key Biscayne, Florida, Raymond James President Paul Shoukry likewise expressed a lack of anxiety about his firm's slowdown in asset collections. Raymond James' wealth division, called its Private Client Group, brought in $14 billion in its fiscal first quarter , running from September to December. If that pace were kept up for the next three quarters, Raymond James would see its assets under management increase by 4% for the entire year.\n\nShoukry, who's scheduled to step into the CEO position at Raymond James later this month, acknowledged that figure was below historic averages for his firm. He said one way he and his colleagues plan to raise it back up is through recruitment.\n\nRaymond James has seen particular success drawing advisors from Wall Street fixtures like Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"Eighty percent of our advisors across all channels are coming from primarily the larger wirehouses,\" Shoukry said. \"Our goal is to go to those advisors and sell them on the Raymond James culture and the Raymond James platform, the solutions, the technology, the fact that they will enjoy their work life much better at Raymond James and they will at their current place or another option and how they want to affiliate.\"\n\nLike many firms, Raymond James seeks to appeal to advisors by giving them many options for how they can run their business. In 2021, Raymond James started a registered investment advisory unit that lets advisors operate on a fee-only model, charging clients a simple set rate on the assets they have under management.\n\nShoukry said many of the wealth managers moving over to the RIA channel were already affiliated with Raymond James in a different way. One goal is to start recruiting to it more from external sources.\n\n\"I think at our annual investor day, we said it's about 50% of the assets came from the outside and 50% are internal transitions,\" Shoukry said. \"And our goal is, over time, to have that percentage be higher new growth from competitors.\"\n\n\n\nPrivate equity a complicating factor\n\nShoukry said Raymond James could also try to achieve growth by acquiring other firms. But one complicating factor is competition from the private-equity aggregators that have been buying up practices left and right in recent years and often driving up prices.\n\n\"There's been cases, even recently, where certain private equity firms just made the deal too uneconomic for us,\" he said.\n\nPrivate equity firms have also complicated matters by taking stakes in offices of supervisory jurisdiction \u2014 essentially large advisory practices \u2014 affiliated with Raymond James. At least two of those private-equity backed OSJs have left in recent years, taking large amounts of assets with them.\n\nSteward Partners, a New York-based firm, officially severed its brokerage relationship with Raymond James in May 2022, removing $25 billion in client assets. That was followed in September of that year with Tampa, Florida-based Concurrent Advisors' decision to take $12.7 billion in client assets and 145 financial advisors from Raymond James' broker-dealer and custodial channels.\n\nShoukry said private equity owners often come in with a promise that they intend merely to provide capital and not interfere in management.\n\n\"As we all know, that typically changes,\" he said. \"And over time, sometimes sooner rather than later, we start seeing that disruption and the misalignment of objectives and priorities. And so sometimes it's us going our separate ways. Sometimes it's the firm going their separate ways, just because, again, if the alignment is not there, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to stay with us, or for us to have them stay with us either.\"\n\n\n\nWhy the emphasis on NNA\n\nAs many firms have ceased reporting advisor headcounts as a measure of their recruiting success, more have turned to net new assets as the most meaningful numbers. At Morgan Stanley, net new assets took on particular prominence when former CEO James Gorman set the firm a goal of eventually having $10 trillion under management. Morgan Stanley has made steady progress toward that benchmark even as its net asset hauls have fluctuated from year to year.\n\nAfter 2021's bumper haul, Morgan Stanley's asset haul fell to $89 billion in 2022, then rose to $282 billion in 2023 before coming down to $252 billion last year. Yet, even with all the ups and downs, Morgan Stanley managed to increase its assets total by $1.3 trillion in 2024, ending the year with $7.9 trillion in AUM for its wealth and investment management units.\n\nSaperstein said he's never been more bullish about the firm's prospects for organic growth \u2014 meaning gains not tied to market fluctuations.\n\n\"Whether any given year or quarter is higher or lower than the previous one, that's actually not how we think about the business, and that's not how you should think about the business,\" Saperstein said. \"The right way to think about it is: Do we have an engine that's driving meaningful organic growth over a long period of time? And is that engine continuing to grow stronger?\"\n\n\n\nMining assets at the workplace\n\nMorgan Stanley executives often like to compare the firm's wealth management business to a funnel that brings clients in through self-directed investing accounts on its E-Trade brokerage platform and moves them into full advisory relationships as their assets and needs grow. Another key entryway to the funnel is the Morgan Stanley at Work unit , which helps firms manage equity-compensation plans and other employment benefits.\n\nEmployees of those firms are often in need of wealth management services, and Morgan Stanley at Work was able to forge more than 1 million new client relationships last year, Saperstein said. So far, he said, the unit has brought in more than $300 billion in net new assets and now boasts 19 million client relationships.\n\nSaperstein said the ability to mine business in other parts of the firm makes Morgan Stanley a particularly appealing place to build a wealth management practice.\n\n\"You can absolutely grow faster at Morgan Stanley than you can anywhere else,\" he said. \"Our FAs are delivering much more to their clients by tapping into those resources and the special services and the technology that we offer. And that's why you see the best FAs migrating towards our firm.\"\n\nSaperstein also discussed Morgan Stanley's other long-held goal of eventually having a 30% operating margin \u2014 meaning the percentage of revenue left over after expenses are subtracted. That margin was at 27.5% at the end of 2024.\n\nSaperstein said Morgan Stanley most likely could have already hit 30% if that had been its sole goal . But it's also putting money back into its business, which inevitably eats away at profit margins.\n\n\"We're investing now to make sure that we're growing in the future,\" he said. \"That's investing in support for advisors, that's investing in technology, including AI.\"",

This investment will allow the Company to recapitalize its balance sheet, to lower its annual cash debt service, and to provide liquidity and increase operating flexibility to fund growth initiatives. The Company\u2019s successful renegotiation of its Senior Secured Credit Facility provides a lower interest rate on the remaining balance.\n\nThis investment will accelerate the Company\u2019s effort to optimize its capital structure as it continues to explore accretive, strategic solutions with its insurance carrier partners and to grow its rapidly expanding healthcare services business.\n\nAdditionally, SelectQuote is appointing Chris Wolfe of Bain Capital and Srdjan Vukovic of Newlight Partners to the Board of Directors, each bringing over 20 years of investing and healthcare sector experience to the Company. SelectQuote anticipates Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Vukovic will join the Board upon the closing of the transaction, expected to be on February 28, 2025.\n\nSelectQuote CEO Tim Danker commented, \u201cThis strategic investment provides the financing we need to capitalize on the robust growth opportunities we foresee in both the senior health insurance and healthcare services marketplaces. While we have more work to do, this deal, on the heels of our 2024 receivables securitization, marks the second meaningful milestone toward our ultimate goal of refinancing the business and significantly deleveraging the balance sheet.\u201d\n\nMr. Danker continued, \u201cWe look forward to benefitting from Chris\u2019s and Srdjan\u2019s valuable growth-oriented healthcare expertise to help augment the Company\u2019s mission to drive long-term value creation.\u201d\n\nMr. Wolfe is a Managing Director at Bain Capital Insurance, the dedicated insurance investing unit of Bain Capital.

            "content": "For the second time in as many months, Morgan Stanley claimed a victory in its fight to deny deferred compensation to advisors who left for rival firms.\n\nA three-member Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel decided last week to deny roughly $1.2 million to Jeffrey Zapoleon, who said he was still owed after leaving Morgan Stanley for Wells Fargo in 2019. Zapoleon, now at Rockefeller Financial, is just one among many brokers arguing in FINRA arbitration that they can't be denied so-called deferred compensation just because they've decided to change firms.\n\nThe victory comes after Morgan Stanley last month beat back claims brought initially by seven former advisors who had left for other firms.\n\nMorgan Stanley and other wealth managers often use deferred compensation as an incentive to reward advisors who stick around for set periods of time. But various claimants have instead argued the payments are akin to pension benefits protected by federal law.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThey left Morgan Stanley. Now these advisors want their deferred comp\n\nMorgan Stanley prevails in latest deferred comp dispute\n\nJudge strikes Morgan Stanley another blow on deferred comp\n\nFight over deferred comp comes to Merrill's door\n\nReversing trend, Morgan Stanley beats ex-advisors' deferred comp claims\n\nMorgan Stanley has begun to turn the tide in its disputes over deferred comp. Before its win last month, it had scored a victory in June against eight former brokers seeking $854,636 in deferred comp.\n\nLast April , Morgan Stanley saw a different outcome \u2014 it was ordered by an arbitration panel to pay more than $3 million claimed by seven advisors who left. Likewise, two months later it was told to pay $1.1 million to a pair of ex-advisors.\n\n\"We are gratified that after fully evaluating all the evidence, the panel reached the correct conclusion based on the facts and the law: Morgan Stanley awards deferred compensation to financial advisors during their employment to reward them for retention and good guardianship,\" a Morgan Stanley spokesperson said. \"That is not a pension plan.\"\n\nAs is usual in FINRA arbitration cases, the three-member panel that handed down a decision last week over Zapoleon's claims didn't go into its reasons. Many claimants seeking deferred comp have grounded arguments in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which provides legal protections for retirement benefits.\n\nJudge Paul Gardephe, of the U.S. district court in New York, seemed to add weight to those contentions in a ruling in November finding that Morgan Stanley's deferred comp polices in fact do fall under ERISA. But court opinions aren't binding precedents in FINRA arbitration cases.",

            "content": "Four ways to help employees build wealth and loyalty\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The perspectives expressed in this commentary are the author\u2019s alone. The following is a paid thought leadership piece from The Plaza Group at Morgan Stanley.\n\nYour employees want to build their wealth and be better employees. Here\u2019s how your equity program can help them get there.\n\nEvery organization wants to find the right combination of employee benefits that help increase workers\u2019 motivation, loyalty and performance. A well-designed equity compensation plan can be a critical piece of that puzzle. Workers who participate in equity plans have the opportunity to build wealth and feel more engaged at work. That can translate to better job performance and greater commitment to the organization.\n\nHowever, you can\u2019t simply create an equity compensation program and hope for the best. We consulted with Professor William G. Castellano, PhD, chair of the Rutgers University Human Resources Management Department, about how organizations can boost equity participation and employee share ownership. Here are four ideas he shared for building a program that helps employees build wealth and manage financial risks:\n\nUse equity to enhance \u2014 not substitute for \u2014 existing pay\n\nEmployers should use equity compensation to enhance existing wages, rather than substitute for salary. When wages are at or above market levels and employers offer equity compensation as an additional benefit, workers are likely to view it as a \u201cgift\u201d on top of their salary\u2014and they tend to reciprocate with higher effort and cooperation at work, Castellano says.\n\nOn the other hand, offering equity in lieu of market wages can have the opposite effect: Employees feel less motivated and less committed. They may also feel less secure about their financial situation, as their fixed wages are effectively reduced and more of their wealth is tied to company performance, a variable that can be hard to predict or fully control.\n\nOffer both short- and long-term rewards\n\nWhen employees view the equity they receive as part of their compensation, as opposed to a longer term benefit, it can lead to short-term decision-making. For example, they may be more likely to cash out their vested shares to fund short-term income needs, which can be a detriment to their long-term savings goals such as funding their retirement.\n\nTo limit this possibility, consider providing a short-term profit- or gain-sharing program alongside long term equity compensation. Longer equity vesting periods, for example, can encourage employees to accumulate equity over an extended timeframe and help them keep their focus on the organization\u2019s long-term results, not just its short-term performance.\n\nKeep your equity and retirement programs separate\n\nJust as it\u2019s important for employers not to substitute wages for equity participation, it is equally important not to substitute retirement benefits for equity rewards. Having a separate and diversified retirement portfolio, in addition to equity, can help reduce the risk to employees that their wealth is overly concentrated in too few assets that can fluctuate in value.\n\nUsing equity to instead supplement retirement benefits can help employees feel more secure in the idea that they have a wider financial safety net, if one of their investments falters. And when employees feel more secure, they are more likely to participate in equity programs and feel higher levels of job satisfaction, motivation and company loyalty, notes Castellano.\n\nProvide equity under favorable conditions\n\nFor publicly traded companies, employees are of course free to buy their company\u2019s stock on the open market with their own savings. However, Castellano notes that when employees instead receive shares as grants from their employer, or have the opportunity to purchase shares at a discount through stock purchase plans, they tend to perceive these holdings more as long-term investments. That perception can help employees work toward their own long-term savings goals and stay focused on the company\u2019s long-term financial health.\n\nHelp your employees focus on the future\n\nAny organization seeking to boost equity participation and employee share ownership today needs to consider how they can structure their equity programs to achieve these ends. Focusing on strategies that help workers accumulate wealth and manage financial risks can ultimately be a win-win, helping employees focus more on both their financial future and the long-run success of their organization.\n\nDr. Bill Castellano is not an employee of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.

According to Forbes, 64% of businesses believe that AI can help increase productivity \u2014 though many workers are afraid that its rising prevalence in the workplace could reduce the number of available jobs.\n\nIn late January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi asked a variety of economic leaders for their perspectives on AI\u2019s place in the workforce \u2014 and they shared their wide-ranging takes on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\nHere are some of the highlights.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Ted Pick: AI can't replace the human component\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO and chairman Ted Pick sees AI as a tool to take care of routine tasks, such as taking notes. But ultimately, it will not replace the human aspect that makes many businesses thrive.\n\n\u201cYes, the AI is super important,\" he said on Opening Bid. \"It brings a ton of efficiency to the cost structure and [is] disruptive to the mainframe and that type of thing. You don't need to write your notes because someone will spit it out. 20 hours of certain note debriefs is taken down by 80% ... [but] we still need the human orderly. That's never going to change.\u201d\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nWhile AI may make certain day-to-day tasks easier to complete, he insisted that much of his business is relationship-driven.\n\n\u201cWe talk about rigor, humility, and partnership, and if you don't have a timeline of a relationship, nobody's going to be all that impressed,\u201d Pick said. \u201cYou worry about the little details. You may be off \u2014 you get a question wrong, you give advice [that] is not quite right \u2014 but you correct [it]. And you're focused on that client over time.\u201d\n\nNasdaq's Adena Friedman: Humans will delegate 'boring' work to AI\n\nNasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also felt that AI\u2019s biggest pull is going to be its ability to take care of more mundane tasks.\n\n\u201cAI can write those reports,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you give them the facts and the AI can write the report. That just is a massive time savings. Same with other regulatory reporting. So there's a lot \u2026 where the technology can be used to take out a lot of very boring, rote work.\u201d\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nShe also predicted that AI will be a particularly useful tool in curating recommendations for an individual\u2019s investment portfolio and answering client questions.\n\n\u201cAI [will continue] to drive interesting ways to engage with investors using algorithm AI to make predictive decisions,\u201d she said.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 6 months ago during his show on July 29, 2024, and examine whether he was right or wrong about those stocks.\n\nBack then, Cramer was talking about the \u201cgreat broadening\u201d which he described as the event where every stock was rallying except for the large cap stocks. He said:\n\n\u201cThis market is not experiencing a small cap rally, it\u2019s experiencing a rally in everything else but the tech titans.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that many small-cap stocks were being bought indiscriminately through index funds like the Russell 2000, the S&P Small Cap 600, and the S&P Mid Cap 400.\n\n\u201cThe big institutions don\u2019t have time to examine all these different small-cap stocks, they just buy the index itself as an entity because it\u2019s still historically cheap, even after this rally.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the essence of the broadening\u2014some real treasures and some real trash getting scooped up together. He then explained:\n\n\u201cThe treasure being companies that do better when interest rates go down like when the Fed starts cutting.\u201d\n\nUnlike the cash-rich tech giants that don\u2019t need lower interest rates, small caps benefit tremendously from falling rates. That\u2019s why investors were selling their big-tech winners from earlier in the year and cycling into cheaper small-cap stocks.\n\nJim Cramer was particularly enthusiastic about this narrative back then and said that investors should \u201ccelebrate the market\u2019s good breadth\u201d.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 29, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 29th, 2024, market close to February 4th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from July 29, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Paramount Global is a multinational company that operates in various entertainment industries, including media production, entertainment, streaming technology and content development. The company is headquartered in New York City, New York. The company has multiple classes of stock, with the major difference in its Class B stock being that it is a non-voting stock class.\n\nParamount Global was founded in 2019 in a merger between Viacom and CBS Corporation. The company was initially founded under the name ViacomCBS but changed its name the day after the Q4 presentation in 2022. Key highlights of the company include its strong brand recognition, a diverse range of businesses and ability to generate significant cash flow and profits across multiple industries and countries.\n\nRobert M. Bakish became CEO of Paramount Global immediately after the merger of the two original companies, Viacom and CBS. He joined Viacom in 1997 as the Vice President of Planning and Development. Bakish was later transferred to Viacom's subsidiary MTV Networks as the Chief Operating Officer of Advertising and Sales.\n\nOther notable members of the Paramount Global team include Alex Berkett, the Chief Corporate Development and Strategy Officer, who, like Robert Bakish, came from Viacom and was appointed to his position after the merger. Also notable is George Cheeks, the Chief Content Officer with a development history at over ten significant networks in the television industry.\n\nOver the past few years, Paramount Global has delivered mixed financial performance, with consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins and a balance sheet consistent with industry peers. The company's profit margins have remained stable over the past few years, with an average net margin of 3.66% since the merger.\n\n\n\nParamount Global has also maintained a strong balance sheet, with total assets adequately more than total liabilities keeping the company's debt levels manageable. Paramount Global is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio in line with the industry average.\n\n\n\nThe company's price-to-book ratio is slightly higher than the industry average. The company's valuation metrics suggest that it is fairly valued relative to its peers in the industry. Paramount Globals' stock performance has been mixed, which is to be expected from a company primarily focusing on the volatile streaming entertainment industry.\n\nParamount Global operates in several different entertainment industry sectors, giving it a degree of diversification and resilience against industry-specific risks. However, Paramount Global's primary focus is streaming internet entertainment, an emerging and volatile industry sector.\n\nThe media and entertainment industry is one of the company's largest businesses, and it is highly competitive and constantly evolving. Paramount Global's strong brand recognition, extensive content library and deep relationships with distributors and advertisers give it a competitive advantage. In Q2 of 2022, Warren Buffet revealed a $2.6 billion investment in Paramount Global, contributing to its continued growth.\n\nParamount Global has several growth opportunities in the years ahead, including new product launches, acquisitions and expansions into new markets and countries. The company is focused on expanding its content library and developing new digital platforms and distribution channels in the media and entertainment space.\n\n\n\nThe company recently launched a new streaming service called Paramount Plus, which has been well-received by consumers and has the potential to drive significant revenue growth in the years ahead. In the technology space, Paramount Global is focused on investing in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.\n\nWhile Paramount Global has significant growth opportunities, the company also faces many risks and challenges. One of the company's most significant risks is changing consumer preferences in media and entertainment. As consumers increasingly shift towards streaming services and digital content, Paramount Global must keep its finger on the pulse of consumer trends and expectations.\n\nParamount Global is subject to rapid technological change and intense competition in the technology space. The company will need to continue investing in research and development and stay ahead of the curve to maintain its competitive advantage.",

Its top three holdings, according to the fund's website, are Royalty Pharma, Oscar Health and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and its mission statement is to target \"quality small cap companies, trading at a discount with favorable growth prospects.\"\n\nAccording to Rosenbluth, the ETF \"takes a focus on companies with high quality, strong free cash flow generation, but it has a growth filter to it.\" He added the filter sets a high bar when it comes to which small caps ultimately make the cut.\n\nThe VictoryShares Small Cap Free Cash ETF is up almost 10% over the past year while the Russell 2000, which tracks the group, is up about 17%.\n\nBy CNBC \"ETF Edge\" Staff\n\nDisclaimer",

            "content": "Enphase Energy, Inc. is a US-based technology company focused on the solar power industry. It was founded in 2006 by Martin Fornage and partner Raghu Belur after inspiration from Fornage. The company\u2019s goal is to help residential consumers harness the sun for daily use and provide the ability to sell excess production back to the grid.\n\nMr. Fornage noticed a low-performance problem with a solar array at his ranch. The array was linked to a central inverter, as most are still to this day which poses a problem. When linked together, the DC current generated by an array of solar panels is limited to the weakest output. To solve this issue, Fornage and the company will develop proprietary microinverters and install one on the back of each panel of an array, an arrangement that increases output and total efficiency. The solar inverter is important because solar panels generate DC current which is not compatible with the electric grid, it converts the DC to AC and is a necessary component of all solar power generating facilities.\n\nThe company launched its first product, the M175, following a capital raise in 2007. The follow-up product, the M190, sold about 400,000 units in its first year alone and helped the company secure 13% of the residential market share by 2010. Enphase went public in 2012 and then decided to enter the battery-storage industry as well. The company will continue growing through 2020, releasing new products and entering new markets. By the end of 2020, Enphase has 48% of the US residential inverter market which is more than 70% of the world microinverter market but less than 2% of the total inverter market.\n\nThe post-2020 period is focused on new acquisitions and building out an SaaS network for home power generation and storage. By the end of 2022, the company had sold more than 50 million inverters, expanding its offerings and deepening its penetration. Part of the strategy is to branch out into services, including microinverter solutions for small businesses.\n\nToday, Enphase Energy operates through a network of subsidiaries. The company is in business designing and developing solar power and alternative energy solutions for the residential market. It manufactures and sells semiconductor-based home energy solutions including microinverters, batteries, solar leads and software solutions to help operate and maintain the systems. Total revenue in 2021 topped $1.38 billion.\n\nAmong the many products now offered are EV charging stations. The Clipper Creek subsidiary is the leader in home EV charging solutions and will install a model best suited for each consumer's make and model vehicle. Chargers are compatible with all models sold in the US and come with a 25-foot charging cable for ultimate flexibility.\n\nEnphase is helping to accelerate the shift to solar power by making solar power generation and storage more accessible and affordable for residential consumers. The future of renewable energy is broad networks of micro-generating facilities, such as homes and small businesses, that are backed up by battery storage capacity.",

I\u2019m Vishy Tirupattur, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief Fixed Income Strategist. Today I\u2019ll be talking about the macro implications of the DeepSeek development.\n\nIt's Friday February 7th at 9 am, and I\u2019m on the road in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nRecently we learned that DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has developed two open-source large language models \u2013 LLMs \u2013 that can perform at levels comparable to models from American counterparts at a substantially lower cost. This news set off shockwaves in the equity markets that wiped out nearly a trillion dollars in the market cap of listed US technology companies on January 27. While the market has recouped some of these losses, their magnitude raises questions for investors about AI. My equity research colleagues have addressed a range of stock-specific issues in their work. Today we step back and consider the broader implications for the economy in terms of productivity growth and investment spending on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst thing. While this is an important milestone and a significant development in the evolution of LLMs, it doesn\u2019t come entirely as a shock. The history of computing is replete with examples of dramatic efficiency gains. The DeepSeek development is precisely that \u2013 a dramatic efficiency improvement which, in our view, drives incremental demand for AI. Rapid declines in the cost of computing during the 1990s provide a useful parallel to what we are seeing now. As Michael Gapen, our US chief economist, has noted, the investment boom during the 1990s was really driven by the pace at which firms replaced depreciated capital and a sharp and persistent decline in the price of computing capital relative to the price of output. If efficiency gains from DeepSeek reflect a similar phenomenon, we may be seeing early signs [that] the cost of AI capital is coming down \u2013 and coming down rapidly. In turn, that should support the outlook for business spending pertaining to AI.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have heard a lot of reference to the Jevons paradox \u2013 which really dates from 1865 \u2013 and it states that as technological advancements reduce the cost of using a resource, the overall demand for the resource increases, causing the total resource consumption to rise. In other words, cheaper and more ubiquitous technology will increase its consumption. This enables AI to transition from innovators to more generalized adoption and opens the door for faster LLM-enabled product innovation. That means wider and faster consumer and enterprise adoption. Over time, this should result in greater increases in productivity and faster realization of AI\u2019s transformational promise.\n\nFrom a micro perspective, our equity research colleagues, who are experts in covering stocks in these sectors, come to a very similar conclusion. They think it\u2019s unlikely that the DeepSeek development will meaningfully reduce CapEx related to AI infrastructure. From a macroeconomic perspective, there is a good case to be made for higher business spending related to AI, as well as productivity growth from AI.\n\nObviously, it is still early days, and we will see leaders and laggards at the stock level. But the economy as a whole we think will emerge as a winner. DeepSeek illustrates the potential for efficiency gains, which in turn foster greater competition and drive wider adoption of AI. With that premise, we remain constructive on AI\u2019s transformational promise.\n\nSurvey Outro:\n\nThanks for listening. If you enjoy the podcast, help us make it even more valuable to you.

And although Goldmanites haven\u2019t gotten any of the top jobs in the White House, there are plenty of other positions left. In particular, jobs focused on banking regulation \u2014 like those in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may be filled with staffers from Goldman. Another source notes that John Rogers, who serves on Goldman\u2019s board, previously advised First Lady Melania Trump on staffing after the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley has emerged as a top advisor to key administration figures, like Elon Musk, and sent important names to DC.\n\nLast week, star banker Michael Grimes \u2014 who worked with Elon Musk on the Twitter deal \u2014 left Morgan Stanley for a high level job in the Commerce Department. He joins former co-worker Anthony Armstrong, who took a high-level role at the Office of Personnel Management.\n\n3 Insiders blame the erosion of talent for fewer Goldman employees entering government. REUTERS\n\n\u201cMorgan Stanley will now get any deal that are vaguely government related now \u2026 I bet Grimes funnels everything there,\u201d another Goldman source added. The source joked the company\u2019s new nickname could be \u201cMor-gov Stanley.\u201d\n\nStill, the amount of business for all banks is expected to surge thanks to an uptick in dealmaking across the board amid deregulation. Goldman declined to comment.",

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I\u2019m Qianlei Fan, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Hong Kong/China Transportation Analyst. Chinese airlines are at a once-in-a-decade inflection point, and today I\u2019ll break down the elements of this turnaround story.\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday, Feb 6th at 10am in Hong Kong.\n\nLast week, hundreds of millions of people across Asia gathered to celebrate the lunar new year with their families. I was one of them, and took a flight back to my hometown Nanjing. Airports were jam-packed for days, with air travel expected to exceed 90 million trips.\n\nIt\u2019s all indicative of Chinese airlines making a comeback after a seven-year run of underperformance. In fact, we believe Airlines will be one of the first industries to emerge from China's deflationary pressures this year. And this has implications for the country's broader economy.\n\nAlthough COVID impacted Airlines globally, other regions have since recovered. In China, the earnings recovery is just beginning. Since 2018, Chinese Airlines have experienced demand hits from the trade tension, currency depreciation, COVID-19, and post-COVID macro headwinds.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since Chinese borders lifted restrictions and air travelers are returning in force. Excess capacity has now been digested. Slower deliveries of aircrafts continue to limit supply, and it is more difficult for airlines to get new aircraft and increase their available seats. Passenger load factors will continue to strengthen this year, which means the airlines are running close to full capacity. This will increase Airlines' pricing power within the next 6 to 12 months, feeding through to earnings.\n\nIf we put that in a global context, China\u2019s airlines industry handled around 700 million passengers in 2024, 8 per cent of global air passengers; but that 700 million passengers only account for half of China\u2019s population. In the US, air passenger numbers can be three times its population.\n\nChinese airlines have just reached break-even in the past year, while many of their global peers have already generated robust profits. Chinese Airlines\u2019 earnings and valuations have lagged global peers in both absolute and relative terms. But now, with a turnaround coming into view, Chinese Airlines have a longer runway for stronger earnings growth and share price performance than global peers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the August 2024 turnaround in US airlines offers several key takeaways for China. US Airlines\u2019 share prices recovered last year, following a long period of underperformance post COVID. The wait before the inflection was long, but share prices moved up quickly once the turning point was reached, and valuation expanded ahead of earnings recovery. Big US airlines outperformed smaller players during the most recent rally. We think all these are relevant to the Chinese Airlines story.\n\nIf we look at earnings \u2013 Chinese Big Three airlines reached breakeven in 2024, making a small profit in 2025, and that profit will double in 2026. But that\u2019s not yet the peak of the cycle; peak cycle earnings could again double the 2026 level, probably in 2027 to 2028. That\u2019s the reason why we think Chinese airlines are on the path to doubling share prices.\n\nTo sum up, Chinese Airlines represent a once-in-a-decade opportunity for investors. With strengthened passenger load factors and a positive demand outlook, coupled with significant potential for earnings growth, this industry looks ready for takeoff.\n\nThanks for listening.

            "content": "The recent DeepSeek-fueled sell-off in technology stocks has made Nvidia shares ripe for the picking, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Joseph Moore reiterated Nvidia as a top pick and repeated an overweight rating on the stock in a Thursday note to clients. His $152 price target on the dominant maker of artificial intelligence chips indicates roughly 22% potential upside ahead for the stock, based on Wednesday's close. \"While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build [and] customer desire to spend is clearly on display,\" Moore wrote. \"We remain very optimistic on how the balance of the year plays out.\" Nvidia shares have soared nearly 85% over the past year but took a hit after the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which used less-efficient Nvidia chips to create an AI model that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT, but at a fraction of the cost American tech hyperscalers are committing to the AI race. DeepSeek bought 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, first released in 2020, and two generations prior to Nvidia's current Blackwell chip, before the A100s were restricted for sale in China in late 2023, according to the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center . The tech sell-off on Jan. 27 led Nvidia to plunge 17%, losing a record amount of market value in one day of any company in history. Nvidia, which will post earnings on Feb. 26, is now down more than 6% this year. NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia stock performance over past year. According to Moore, DeepSeek creates some headwinds around export controls and longer-term AI investment, but near-term catalysts in the form of Blackwell and Hopper chip solutions for Nvidia remain intact. Demand remains strong for Blackwell and \"very promising\" signals for future demand came in CoreWeave's Tuesday announcement that it brought Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 instances to its platform, making it the first cloud service provider to make Blackwell generally available, Moore said. The analyst is also sticking by Nvidia as capital spending commentary from the company's largest customers reaffirmed their AI investment plans. Nvidia's cloud customers, for example, remain committed to buying more graphics processing units in an effort to boost revenue, he said. \"For the investments that are not generating revenue today there remains an ongoing commitment to advancing the state of the art,\" Moore said. \"Many of the architects of the largest [Artificial General Intelligence] clusters have reiterated a commitment to scaling out large training clusters with no indication that DeepSeek changes that momentum,\" the analyst added. Looking ahead, Moore believes the biggest long-term catalyst for Nvidia goes beyond AI training and taps into the company's leadership in the inference market, particularly as inference tasks become more complex. Inference refers to a process where a trained AI model applies its knowledge to new data and can make predictions or decisions based on that data. \"We remain convinced that Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of long inference workloads,\" he said.",

Its mission is to foster a more equitable and sustainable investment landscape. Applications to join the 2025 MSISVL cohort are open now through March 14.\n\nInclusivity meets sustainability\n\nOne example of MSISVL\u2019s impact is Sortile, a tech startup transforming textile recycling. Constanza Gomez, co-founder and CEO of Sortile, highlighted the value of the experience.\n\n\u201cIncredible people,\u201d she told POCIT. \u201cWe have gotten access to incredible mentors that have helped us from strategy to communication to fundraising.\u201d\n\nSortile, founded by Constanza Gomez and Augustina Mir at Columbia University, began as a research tool for studying textile sortation and collection. With guidance and mentorship from MSISVL, Sortile pivoted to creating AI-driven sorting systems that divert textiles from landfills, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.\n\nReflecting on their progress, Gomez shared, \u201cWe pivoted a week before starting the Lab. In the months since then, we\u2019ve been able to launch our pivot and scale it, going from a single business to over five off-takers and contracted volume of over 100 tons.\u201d\n\nConstanza Gomez (Courtesy)\n\nParticipating in the program helped Gomez\u2019s business scale and improve. With access to Morgan Stanley\u2019s tailored resources designed to meet each startup\u2019s unique needs, Sortile has used this support to drive further innovation in the sustainability market.\n\nA legacy of impact\n\nMSISVL builds on the success of the Inclusive Ventures Lab and Sustainable Solutions Collaborative, which together have distributed over $30 million in capital to over 100 startups and organizations in the last seven years.\n\nThis commitment to fostering inclusivity and sustainability is strengthened by Morgan Stanley\u2019s integrated approach, which combines expertise with a deep understanding of the unique needs of early-stage organizations.\n\nBy connecting entrepreneurs with resources, mentorship, and strategic guidance, MSISVL ensures that participants have the tools necessary to scale their ideas and create lasting impact.\n\nThis is especially true for Seke Ballard, the founder and CEO of Beta Financial Services, who credits Morgan Stanley with giving him a \u201csales mentality.\u201d BetaScore, Ballard\u2019s advanced credit scoring platform, uses AI and unique data sources to improve small businesses\u2019 access to capital.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, our vision for BetaScore was to go beyond traditional small business credit scoring,\u201d he says. \u201cOur objective was to build a next-generation small business intelligence engine that provides a 360-degree view of a business\u2019s financial health and operational performance, all powered by an AI agent designed to provide each user with insights tailored to their objective. My team had the vision and technical expertise to build BetaScore, but we had little experience selling an entirely new product category. Nothing like BetaScore exists.\u201d\n\nSeke Ballard (Courtesy)\n\nWith direction from MSISVL, Ballard has refined his business practices. Reflecting on the growth, he shared, \u201cMorgan Stanley helped us think very deeply about product positioning, identifying the ideal customer profile, building a repeatable sales motion and achieving product market fit. These may all sound like buzzwords\u2013and to some degree they are\u2013but the principles at work are critical to selling the product and creating value for our shareholders, particularly for a category-defining product such as BetaScore.\u201d\n\nOvercoming barriers\n\nWith its focus on accessibility and sustainability, MSISVL equips the next generation of changemakers to lead the way toward a more inclusive and sustainable future.\n\n\u201cI would recommend applying to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Lab because it is the best value for the equity.\u201d Ballard shared. \u201cAt the risk of being reductive, most accelerators give you a little bit of cash and some technical resources in exchange for equity. Morgan Stanley really excels in the technical resources, whether it is executive coaching, sales coaching, or capital raising coaching; we received white-glove, 1:1 support on the priorities most important to my company.\u201d\n\nMSISVL is designed to support founders who have faced barriers to accessing capital or are driving sustainability solutions. It seeks early-stage startups that are technology-driven or technology-enabled, are positioned in the Seed to Series A funding stage, and have launched a product with demonstrated market traction.\n\n\u201cWe create a custom and curated approach for each founder by connecting various parts of Morgan Stanley to deliver a truly unique program,\u201d shares LaToya Wilson, Global Co-Head of Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Group.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to scale your impact and contribute to building a brighter future, MSISVL could be your next step.\n\nMSISVL is accepting applications now through March 14. Apply today.\n\nThis article is sponsored by Morgan Stanley Inclusive & Sustainable Ventures Lab.\n\nFeature image credit: LaToya Wilson",

            "content": "\u201cWhile we believe most states are on solid footing, there are several critical factors looming that will have long-term implications for creditworthiness and ability to respond to shifting market dynamics,\u201d said Craig Brandon, co-head of Municipal Investing for MSIM. \u201cUnfunded pension liabilities and increasing Medicaid costs continue to challenge state budgets, and natural disasters continue to have an outsized impact not only on budgets but also future planning. Additionally, out-migration and demographic shifts are two issues that warrant close examination.\u201d\n\nThe report reveals that state debt generally remains low as many states curtailed borrowing after the Great Recession and experienced increasing state gross domestic product (GDP). Rainy day fund balances, a strong indicator of how prepared each state is for recessions and economic downturns, are at all-time highs with the median at 13% of expenditures in 2024 while projections indicate a potential increase to 15% in 2025. However, five states have less in reserves now than they did in 2007.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how states rank from a credit standpoint influences portfolio decisions,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cWith a new presidential administration and uncertainty related to the potential extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this analysis pinpoints areas of strength and deficiencies, and helps us identify which are positioned to address policy changes, demographic shifts and unforeseen events that tap into state agencies and budgets and leverage infrastructure resources.\u201d\n\nKey findings:\n\nDebt and unfunded pension burdens largely declined due to GDP growth, investment returns and pension reforms. However, overall pension liabilities remain large despite many states over-contributing to their plans in recent years.\n\nMost budgets are well-positioned to address debt, pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) expenses, however these expenses could crowd out other spending initiatives if paid in full.\n\nPuerto Rico remains a significant outlier; its 59% liabilities-to-GDP ratio is nearly double that of any other state.\n\nMedicaid costs play a significant role in budgets and dwarf other fixed-cost spending; this is particularly acute for Colorado, Missouri, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Kentucky.\n\nOnly one quarter have better funded pensions now than they did in 2018, which means less well-funded pensions states have less flexibility for other necessary spending.\n\nDeveloped by the municipal research team, this comprehensive report details what the team sees as the biggest issues facing the 50 states and Puerto Rico and ranks them based on their creditworthiness, ability to pay back obligations, and overall financial health. The report leverages a proprietary ratings methodology that is based on both quantitative factors like overall state wealth, financial performance and outstanding debt as well as qualitative analysis, including projected budget shortfalls or surpluses, track records of meeting budget projections, and pension reform initiatives.\n\nRead the full State of the States Report.\n\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management and its advisory affiliates have more than 1,400 investment professionals around the world and $1.7 trillion in assets under management or supervision as of December 31, 2024. www.morganstanley.com/im.\n\nMore Kentucky business news here.",

The landlord, a partnership of Morgan Stanley and an affiliate of Crown Acquisitions, is behind on loan payments, Crain\u2019s reported.\n\nThe entirety of the property\u2019s 16,000 square feet is occupied by Gap, which took the space in 2015 for $263 per square foot on an annual basis. The lease included escalations of 3 percent annually until its expiration in 2030.\n\nWhile there\u2019s still five years to go until that lease comes due, Gap already appears unlikely to renew its deal, according to KBRA.

A month later, Gap declared in public filings that it would stop paying rent on shuttered stores, leading to a dispute with the landlords.\n\nDuring the summer, Gap sued to block a lease termination at the property, arguing it had already terminated the lease earlier because the pandemic had \u201ccompletely frustrated\u201d the retail lease. The retailer argued it was entitled to a refund for a prorated portion of the rent and expenses paid that March, as the store closed roughly halfway through the month.\n\nOwnership ultimately won the legal battle, forcing Gap to pony up the overdue rent.\n\n\u2014 Holden Walter-Warner",

            "content": "Index Definitions\n\nFor index, indicator and survey definitions referenced in this report please visit the following:\n\nhttps://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-investmentsolutions/wmir-definitions\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe majority of $25 and $1000 par preferred securities are \u201ccallable\u201d meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.\n\nSome $25 or $1000 par preferred securities are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional \u2018dividend paying\u2019 perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period \u2013 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. Investing in currency involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nCompanies paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time.\n\nInvesting in commodities entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.\n\nPhysical precious metals are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) provides certain protection for customers\u2019 cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm\u2019s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers\u2019 assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG.

With a strong reputation in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and capital raising, it serves a broad client base, including corporations, governments, and individual investors.\n\nThe financial titan has outpaced the broader market over the past year. MS shares have climbed 56.7% over the past year and 8.8% in 2025, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 21.8% gains over the past year and 2.7% rally on a YTD basis.\n\nNarrowing the focus, Morgan Stanley has also outpaced the SPDR S&P Capital Markets ETF\u2019s (KCE) 42% gains over the past year and 4.6% return in 2025.\n\nOn Jan. 16, MS shares jumped 4% after releasing its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 earnings report. It reported a record annual revenue of $61.8 billion and its investment banking revenue surged 35%, driven by robust M&A activity and stock sales, with the largest pipeline in seven years signaling continued growth in 2025.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect Morgan Stanley\u2019s adjusted EPS to rise 7.2% year-over-year EPS to $8.52. Moreover, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates in the past four quarters.\n\nMS stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of the 23 analysts covering the stock, six recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one appoints a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and 16 advise \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nThis configuration has been fairly stable over the past months.\n\nOn Jan. 20, UBS Group AG (UBS) raised Morgan Stanley's price target to $140 from $130, maintaining a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating. UBS highlighted strength in both the Wealth Management and Investment Banking businesses, with stabilized net interest income and an improving IPO outlook. Although net new assets were slow in Q4, UBS expects them to rebound while loan growth remains strong. The firm also sees positive momentum for Morgan Stanley\u2019s net new assets from its robust stock plan business.\n\nThe mean price target of $138.95 suggests a 1.6% upside from current price levels. The Street-high target of $156 represents a premium of 14%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Furthermore, the State of the States Analysis indicates a stable credit outlook for most states with many planning for budget cuts of approximately 6% in the next fiscal year.\n\nCommenting on the report\u2019s finding, Craig Brandon, co-head of Municipal Investing for MSIM, said: \u201cWhile we believe most states are on solid footing, there are several critical factors looming that will have long-term implications for states\u2019 creditworthiness and ability to respond to shifting market dynamics. Unfunded pension liabilities and increasing Medicaid costs continue to challenge state budgets, while natural disasters continue to have an outsized impact not only on budgets but also future planning. Additionally, out-migration and demographic shifts are two issues that warrant close examination.\u201d\n\nThe States of the States Report reveals that state debt generally remains low as many states curtailed borrowing after the Great Recession and experienced increasing state gross domestic product (GDP). Rainy day fund balances, a strong indicator of how prepared each state is for recessions and economic downturns, are at all-time highs with the median state at 13% of expenditures in 2024 while projections indicate a potential increase to 15% in 2025. However, five states have less in reserves now than they did in 2007.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how states rank from a credit standpoint influences portfolio decisions,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cWith a new Presidential Administration and uncertainty related to the potential extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this analysis pinpoints areas of strength and deficiencies, and helps us identify which states are positioned to address policy changes, demographic shifts and unforeseen events that tap into state agencies and budgets and leverage infrastructure resources.\u201d\n\nKey findings:\n\nDebt and unfunded pension burdens largely declined due to GDP growth, investment returns and pension reforms. However, overall pension liabilities remain large despite many states over-contributing to their plans in recent years.\n\nMost state budgets are well-positioned to address debt, pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) expenses, however these expenses could crowd out other spending initiatives if paid in full.\n\nPuerto Rico remains a significant outlier; its 59% liabilities-to-GDP ratio is nearly double that of any other state.\n\nremains a significant outlier; its liabilities-to-GDP ratio is nearly double that of any other state. Medicaid costs play a significant role in state budgets and dwarf other fixed-cost spending; this is particularly acute for Colorado , Missouri , Arizona , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Kentucky .\n\n, , , , and . Only one quarter of states have better funded pensions now than they did in 2018, which means less well-funded pensions states have less flexibility for other necessary spending.\n\nDeveloped by the municipal research team, this comprehensive report details what the team sees as the biggest issues facing the 50 states and Puerto Rico and ranks the states based on their creditworthiness, ability to pay back obligations, and overall financial health.

Due reported last year that there were more billionaires than ever, with Musk\u2019s net worth sitting at a massive $195 billion.\n\nNow lenders such as Morgan Stanley and others, such as Bank of America and Barclays are cashing on Musk\u2019s newfound place at the side of returning President Trump.\n\nX loan sales increased by banks\n\nMusk borrowed a host of funds to acquire the now-flailing social media platform for $44 billion. The banks involved had looked to offset the loans after Musk posted less-than-favorable comments that resulted in companies like Coca-Cola and Disney bidding farewell to the bird.\n\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg report, these banks are now looking to increase the amount of loans sold. Initially, they had forecast around $3 billion worth of loans to be put up for sale, but now that figure is sitting at a healthy $5.5 billion of loans.\n\nAccording to sources, the banks had been worried about a considerable loan loss as the probe loomed large from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDue reported that the investigating SEC parties had initially pressured Musk on multiple attempts to uncover the truth about the deal behind the 2022 social media platform sale.\n\nAn SEC statement said the \u201ctestimony subpoena to Musk relates to an ongoing investigation by the SEC regarding, among other things, potential violations of various provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with (a) Musk\u2019s 2022 purchases of Twitter, Inc. (\u201cTwitter\u201d) stock, and (b) Musk\u2019s 2022 statements and SEC filings relating to Twitter.

They help with storage and inventory management, picking, packing, and sorting, and they transport packages to the fulfillment center's loading dock, where they are then sent to customers.\n\nSince 2022 Amazon has introduced six new models. They include a fully autonomous mobile robot called Proteus, three types of robotic arms, and a containerized storage system called Sequoia. Amazon also has robots that can create custom packaging based on an item's specific dimensions.\n\nAmazon opened its first \"next-generation\" fulfillment center, incorporating all of its latest robots, in Shreveport, Louisiana, in September. The company has said it expects to see a 25% improvement in fulfillment costs during peak periods at the Shreveport warehouse.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts estimated that if 30% to 40% of Amazon orders in the US were fulfilled through next-gen warehouses by 2030, the company could save as much as $10 billion a year.\n\nThey noted, however, that fully scaling robotics would take time.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect AMZN to continue to expand its warehouse network (to support growth) while also upgrading the footprint toward next-gen robotics in new builds and retrofits,\" they wrote. \"The question of how quickly Amazon shifts volumes to robotics enabled warehouses will likely come down to reasonable and improving paces of build/retrofit (current new robotics plants still take 1-2 years) balanced with not wanting to cause near-term disruption to AMZN's retail service.\"\n\nNext-gen fulfillment centers are significantly more expensive to develop than Amazon's traditional fulfillment centers. The analysts cited news reports that say the robotic-powered warehouses cost about $450 million to develop, compared with $200 million for traditional development and $100 million to retrofit an older warehouse with robotics.\n\n\"We estimate AMZN will have $60bn of net cash as of year-end '24 and will generate ~$150bn of aggregate free cash flow in '25/'26,\" they wrote. \"As such, investment capital is unlikely to be a constraint to how quickly AMZN shifts to next-gen robotics...which means if they can build and shift without service disruption they likely will do it.\"\n\nThe analysts also said that if Amazon invested further in bringing robots to sorting centers and in scaling the technology internationally, it could see more savings.",

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nDeepSeek's recent AI-related breakthrough was supposed to have a tangible impact on NVIDIA's top-line metric, as per a previous analysis by Morgan Stanley. Yet, as hyperscalers maintain their CapEx projections, that doomsday scenario remains only a remote possibility for now. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff-heavy policy toolkit is currently playing havoc with TSMC's pricing strategy.\n\nFor the benefit of those who might not be aware, China-based DeepSeek recently shocked the global tech sector with its breakthrough R1 model, which is able to more than compete with OpenAI's o1 model but with just around 1/50th of the typical costs associated with training a complex LLM. However, a new analysis has since then postulated that DeepSeek's CapEx might have been as high as $1.6 billion, entailing operating costs of as much as $944 million.\n\nRegardless of the specifics, DeepSeek's R1 model has unleashed a renewed focus on efficiency to the possible detriment of NVIDIA.\n\nMorgan Stanley Securities pointed out that as Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditure growth slows and its comments on model efficiency improvements negatively impact the supply chain, the shipment forecast for NVIDIA\u2019s GB200 NVL 72 this year has been significantly revised downward from\u2026 \u2014 Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 4, 2025\n\nDuring the DeepSeek-induced industry-wide panic, Morgan Stanley had cited a potential pivot towards greater efficiency on the part of Microsoft, and the corresponding scaling back of the hyperscaler's capital expenditure growth, to reduce its own forecast for NVIDIA\u2019s GB200 NVL 72 shipments this year from 30,000 - 35,000 to just 20,000 - 25,000 units.\n\nMorgan Stanley had also noted at the time that the annual growth rate of cloud-based CapEx might slow to \"single-digit percentages\" by Q4'25.\n\nNo slowdown in FY25 Capex from the Mag7, even with recent DeepSeek AI developments in China:$MSFT: $80B$GOOGL: $75B$META: $65B$TSLA: $10B \u2014 Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) February 5, 2025\n\nHowever, this doomsday scenario is now unlikely to materialize as Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Tesla have continued to project elevated CapEx for 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, it is not just inter-industry competition that is affecting the narrative around the semiconductor sphere at the moment. Macro policies are having an equally disruptive impact.\n\nLook no further than TSMC, which might be on the receiving end of President Trump's love affair with tariffs as soon as the 18th of February, when chip tariffs are expected to go into effect.\n\nAs a refresher, President Trump announced his intention at the end of January to place tariffs on all semiconductors and pharmaceutical products from Taiwan. The move is intended to push TSMC towards localizing more of its production within the US.\n\nNow, according to a Taiwan-based publication, President Trump's chip tariffs might force TSMC to raise its price quotation for advanced processes from the originally planned 5 - 10 percent to over 15 percent now.\n\nNote:",

That implies the index dropping as much as 8% or rising just over 1% over the next several months.\n\nIt's an outcome that will largely be driven by risks stemming from Trump's policies, Wilson said in a recent episode on Morgan Stanley's \"Thoughts on the Market\" podcast.\n\n\"Tariffs were always on the agenda, as was immigration enforcement, both of which are growth negative in the short-term,\" Wilson said. \"In my view, investors simply got complacent about these risks and are now dealing with them in real time.\"\n\nInvestors have been bullish on the outlook for higher growth as a result of Trump's policies. The president's plan to cut taxes, for instance, was thought to potentially boost earnings growth in the S&P 500 for the next two years, according to a projection from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBut it'll take time for those policies to have a positive effect on the market, Wilson said.\n\n\"This also fits with our view that the first half of the year was likely to be tougher for stocks as equity-negative policies could be implemented immediately before the equity-positive policies like before equity-positive policies like de-regulation, tax extensions and reduced government spending had time to play out,\" he said.\n\nTrump's tariff plan also came into clearer focus in recent days, when the president said announced a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. Both tariff plans have been delayed for at least a month, though the announcement seems to have brought concerns about higher inflation, higher rates, and lower growth back to the surface.\n\nTariffs on Canada and Mexico could lower earnings per share for S&P 500 companies by 2%-3%, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs.

            "content": "There are still more questions than answers surrounding DeepSeek. For example, Morgan Stanley & Co. analysts cast doubt on DeepSeek\u2019s claims to have developed its model for $6 million, and without high-end semiconductors. That said, they expect DeepSeek to be \u201ca viable competitor,\u201d although they don\u2019t necessarily think it will dramatically alter the spending behavior in the AI space. They also remain positive on AI semiconductors, noting \u201cthe underlying demand for NVIDIA Blackwell\u2014and other AI products\u2014remains very strong.\u201d1\n\nThe tariff story is also likely in early innings. In the wake of President Trump\u2019s inauguration last month, Morgan Stanley & Co. analysts discussed the possibility that trade policy uncertainty\u2014that is, potential tariffs\u2014could contribute to volatility in the financial markets.2 That possibility became a reality on the final day of January. But it remains to be seen whether the announced tariffs are a non-negotiable policy or a bargaining tactic.\n\nThe S&P 500 outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in January, but trailed the MSCI Developed Markets Index by nearly two percentage points.\n\n\u201cTech\u201d had a bit of a split personality last month. The tech-centric communication services sector was the strongest S&P 500 sector\u2014by far\u2014but the S&P tech sector proper was the weakest, weighed down by the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off in semiconductors.\n\nBond yields ended January slightly lower after surging early in the month. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.8% on January 14\u2014its highest level since November 2023\u2014before pulling back to end the month down 0.02% at 4.55%.",

The firm downgraded the steel stock to equal weight from overweight on Monday, alongside a $39 per share price target. Morgan Stanley's forecast implies nearly 6% upside from Friday's close. Analyst Carlos De Alba said U.S. Steel stock is currently trading right around its target valuation for the company, which leaves little room to run moving forward. \"However, we no longer see meaningful upside to our standalone price target. While a deal with Nippon \u2014 or another party \u2014 may still happen, which is reflected in our $55/[share] bull case, we continue to set our price target on a standalone basis,\" the analyst said. More broadly, De Alba said he expects steel prices to rise due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, but added that those price rises could be kept in check by sluggish demand. The White House over the weekend announced levies on imports from Mexico, China and Canada. The move sparked a global market sell-off. Analysts are mostly positive on the stock.

(TDG)\n\nTransDigm designs and manufactures original aircraft parts sold to manufacturers. The company also produces aftermarket replacement parts sold to commercial and military aircraft operators. In recent years, TransDigm has announced several significant buyouts, including acquiring SEI Industries, Raptor Scientific and the components and subsystems business of Communications & Power Industries. Analyst Kristine Liwag says TransDigm's pricing environment is positive, the commercial aircraft aftermarket is strong and the company has the financial flexibility for further capital deployment. In addition, Liwag says recent acquisitions could boost fiscal 2025 earnings. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $1,575 price target for TDG stock, which closed at $1,367.20 on Feb. 28.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corp. (GD)\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a diversified aerospace and defense company that produces a wide range of products, including Gulfstream jets, Abrams tanks and nuclear submarines. The majority of the company's revenue comes from the U.S. government, particularly its large contracts with the Department of Defense. Liwag says General Dynamics' 2025 guidance came up short of expectations, but the company's Gulfstream G700 headwinds are finally in the rear view mirror. She says new ammunition production capacity will help boost General Dynamics' Combat segment margins in 2025. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $315 price target for GD stock, which closed at $252.60 on Feb. 28.\n\n\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)\n\nNorthrop Grumman is one of the world's largest weapons and military technology producers. Liwag says demand for airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance will help drive Northrop's international revenue growth in the double digit percentage range in 2025. She says missile sales and C2 aircraft sales will also support the international business, which typically accounts for between 12% and 13% or total revenue. Liwag says Northrop is also restructuring its Defense Systems business to focus on missiles and missile defense capabilities, which are in high demand internationally. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $580 price target for NOC stock, which closed at $461.74 on Feb. 28.\n\nHowmet Aerospace Inc. (HWM)\n\nHowmet Aerospace manufactures lightweight metal products, specializing in jet engine components, titanium structural parts, aerospace fastening systems and forged wheels. The company also provides defense solutions to its military partners, such as precision machining, integrated program management and metals expertise. Liwag says Howmet is a high quality aerospace supplier that will benefit from ongoing demand growth for spare engine parts. The company also produces industrial gas turbine components to meet booming power demand from artificial intelligence applications. Finally, Liwag says Howmet's 2025 financial guidance is likely conservative. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $155 price target for HWM stock, which closed at $136.60 on Feb. 28.\n\nAxon Enterprise Inc. (AXON)\n\nAxon Enterprise is a law enforcement hardware and technology solutions provider. In addition to supplying body-worn cameras and other hardware to law enforcement and military customers, Axon also provides training and cloud-based software services such as digital evidence management. Analyst Meta Marshall says Axon is generating impressive growth in both cloud and services revenue and overall annual recurring revenue. Marshall says the 25% to 30% sales growths rate Axon has generated in recent quarters could be sustainable as software accounts for a larger portion of total revenue. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $700 price target for AXON stock, which closed at $528.45 on Feb. 28.\n\nCurtiss-Wright provides specialized solutions, engineered products and other services primarily to the aerospace and defense markets. The company's Defense Electronics segment includes products such as commercial off-the-shelf embedded computing board-level modules, integrated subsystems and data acquisition and flight test instrumentation equipment. Liwag says Curtiss-Wright's 2025 guidance suggests the company is on track to hit the three-year financial targets management laid out at its 2024 investor day event. Those targets include greater than 5% annual organic revenue growth and above 10% annual earnings per share growth. Morgan Stanley has an \"overweight\" rating and $405 price target for CW stock, which closed at $321.66 on Feb. 28.\n\nEmbraer SA (ERJ)",

            "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley has issued a fresh investment note for TSMC's Taiwan shares. TSMC's shares dipped by 5.7% in Taiwan today as markets reacted to the prospect of tariffs against the firm's products imported into the US. In its note, Morgan Stanley kept a NT$1,388 share price target for TSMC and stressed that while the tariffs will impact the firm's short-term performance, TSMC's competitive advantages will ensure that it attracts most of the world's chip orders.\n\nTSMC's Competitive Advantages Can Help It Counter Impact Of Tariffs Over Long Term, Says Morgan Stanley\n\nAs per a report in the Taiwanese press, Morgan Stanley believes that the tariffs can impact TSMC's long-term profits and its gross margins. The Taiwanese firm's stock closed down 5.7% in the Taiwanese exchange earlier today, and the bank adds that until further clarity on the measures is available from the US and Taiwanese governments, TSMC's short term performance can take a hit.\n\nOver the long term, the investment bank believes that TSMC's manufacturing process advantages can help it sustain against most of the impact. TSMC's 3-nanometer manufacturing technology is among the most advanced chip manufacturing technologies in the world, and the firm also benefits from stable production yields when compared to others, such as Samsung.\n\nYields refer to the number of usable chips per wafer, and the cost of any defective items is borne by the manufacturer, which contributes to lower margins.\n\nTSMC's competitive advantages mean that despite the tariffs, the firm will continue to hold a high market share in the advanced chip manufacturing market, believes Morgan Stanley. The bank shares that alongside the advanced manufacturing processes, the long term growth driven by AI demand and low valuation mean that investors will focus on TSMC's profit margins instead.\n\nSetting up mega foundries and developing the latest chip manufacturing technologies takes decades of investment. This lends firms such as TSMC considerable advantages that translate into high barriers to entry for any rivals seeking to set up shop.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley analyst adds that TSMC's US customers will account for 60% to 70% of its revenue this year. He also notes that previous statements by TSMC's management have indicated that customers will bear any burden of tariffs instead of chip manufacturers. Therefore, any higher prices from the tariffs could change the pricing and, by effect, the demand dynamics in the technology industry.\n\nAnother hot-button topic has been the potential cancelation of subsidies to TSMC to set up advanced chip manufacturing facilities in the US. On this front, Morgan Stanley shares that the subsidies account for only 10% of TSMC\"s US capital expenditure. As a result, the impact on TSMC's profit margin will be less than 0.5% as TSMC's depreciation expense accounts for 40% to 50% of the firm's sales costs.",

A financial holding company, Morgan Stanley provides a full range of financial services to clients around the world.\n\nMorgan Stanley was formed in 1935 as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall separated commercial and investment banking in a way that forced the then-largest bank J.P. Morgan & Co to split into two groups. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to retain the commercial side of the business while partners Henry S. Morga, grandson of J.P., and Harold Stanley took the investment end. In its first year, Morgan Stanley did 24% of the IPO business and maintains a lion\u2019s share of the market to this day.\n\nThe original company existed and grew through acquisitions until 1987 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. The new Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co existed for 14 years until 2001 when the name was shortened back to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank is credited in part with both beginning and ending the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The Process Driven Trading unit lost $300 million in one day due to a short-squeeze that popped the bubble in the housing market. After teetering on the brink of failure Morgan Stanley agreed to become a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve, a key factor in the original decision to split from parent J.P. Morgan & Co. Ironically when given the chance, present-day J.P. Morgan refused to buy Morgan Stanley but that was for the better.\n\nToday, Morgan Stanley operates through three segments via offices in 41 countries and employs more than 75,000 people. Revenue in 2021 topped $49 billion and total assets topped $1.15 trillion.\n\nThe operating segments are Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management segments. The Institutional Securities segment is by far the largest and most profitable. It offers a range of services and products for businesses, institutions, and entities that include capital raising, strategic advisory, underwriting, advice on M&A, restructuring, and real estate. The Wealth Management segment provides brokerage and investment advisory services for individuals and employers. The services include brokerage, financial planning, company stock-plan administration, insurance, mortgage loans, lines of credit, and retirement planning. The Investment Management segment provides investment products to a range of institutions, organizations, corporations, and governments.",

            "content": "After a challenging year where M&A activity in the Middle East and North Africa took a tumble, Morgan Stanley forecasts 2025 will witness a significant \u201cstructural upswing\u201d in transaction volume and value size, bolstered by policy shifts and regulatory reforms in the region.\n\nThe investment bank, which ranked as the leading M&A financial advisor in MENA last year according to a new LSEG report, served as advisors on nine deals in 2024 at a combined value of $31.8 billion, followed by Rothschild & Co. and Goldman Sachs rounding up the top three at $22.7 billion and $19.54 billion, respectively.\n\nAccording to LSEG data, last year saw a total of 1,111 M&A transactions with exposure to the MENA region, accounting to a total of $75 billion in value. While this indicated a 4% drop compared to 2023, the number of deals increased by 1%.\n\nPatrick Delivanis, Regional Co-Head of MENA Morgan Stanley, summed up the bank\u2019s 2024 roster: \u201cIf you look at three of the larger transactions that we were involved in, they each had different characteristics\u2026. One characteristic was the larger MENA corporates looking to invest and deploy capital internationally, another was the outward investment of a sovereign wealth fund into Asia, in turn securing the inward development of manufacturing facilities into the country, and finally the inward investment to the region by a global asset manager in the form of an acquisition of a GCC-based company.\u201d\n\nThe LSEG \u2018Investment Banking Activity in MENA 2024\u2019 report listed state-oil giant Adnoc\u2019s $17.6 billion takeover offer for German chemicals company Covestro as the biggest deal of last year, for which Morgan Stanley was an advisor.\n\nOther high-profile MENA deals the bank was involved with in 2024 included advising Alat, the Saudi Public Investment Fund unit, in its $2 billion investment in Lenovo, followed by the acquisition of the Dubai-based payments provider Network International by Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nThe changing investment landscape in the region is key to driving more M&A transactions, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\u201cIt is because of these policy shifts and regulatory reforms that investors are attracted to the MENA markets,\u201d said Abdulaziz Alajaji, Regional Co-Head of MENA Morgan Stanley. \u201cInternational investors are seeing greater opportunities, and this makes it easier for them to deploy capital because they are able to exit and recycle their capital on clearer terms.\n\n\u201cThe regulations allowing exits from investment, whether through a trade sale or IPO, are key contributors to this uptick in activity as the ability to IPO is easier and more consistent with an international approach because the region is well regarded and seen as a good place to do business.\u201d\n\nDelivanis said that while most of transactions, have been concentrated in Saudi and the UAE, \u201cthere is a healthy broader market across the GCC with an increase in activity in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman.\u201d\n\nDeployment of capital\n\nLSEG data further revealed that inbound deals involving a non-MENA acquiror increased 49% in value to a three-year high of $14.2 billion, while MENA outbound M&A transactions totalled $40.2 billion, indicating a 3% decline from year ago levels.\n\nAccording to Alajaji, MENA has traditionally been perceived as an exporter of capital. \u201cWhat has changed over the past few years is that MENA is also very much open to and promoting inbound investment. This makes the region unique in many respects from a global capital flow point of view; in addition, the pace of social reform\u2026 makes investors more comfortable.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmore active\u201d sectors Delivanis highlighted include healthcare, technology, space, Artificial Intelligence as well as those where the region will typically enjoy a competitive advantage such as in trade and logistics, energy, and chemicals.\n\nThe LSEG report noted industrials as the most active sector, accounting for 27% of MENA target M&A om 2024, followed by materials and the financial sector.\n\nRoad ahead\n\nDespite shifting global dynamics, fluctuating interest rates, and a Donald Trump US Presidency expected to pose challenges to the MENA landscape, Morgan Stanley maintains a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWe recently established our regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia, established an office in ADGM to complement our long-standing presence in Dubai, and strengthened our team in Qatar with a new country head,\u201d said Aljaji, calling 2025 a year where the bank sees itself \u201cinvesting in the region\u201d in light of a \u201cstructural upswing in transaction volumes and value size.\u201d\n\nOn a macro level, Delivanis added that growth in MENA is expected to continue in the near-term with opportunities in the global energy transition and evidence of global clients investing in the region.\n\n(Reporting by Bindu Rai, editing by Seban Scaria)\n\nbindu.rai@lseg.com",

We will remain watchful of income tax collection growth, which the government expects to be 14.4 per cent, given the income tax cuts and execution of capex spending to meet the targets,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe report pointed out that the Budget has balanced needs to support growth and continue with fiscal consolidation. As such, the Budget targets a lower fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP for F2026 even as it reduced income taxes to support consumption, especially for middle income tax payers, and expanded capex growth, mainly through a boost in grants to states for capex creation.\n\n\u201cIndeed, as per the Finance Minister, direct tax changes should lead to a 1.0 per cent revenue loss of Rs 1 lakh crore (0.3 per cent of GDP), which should help support consumption,\u201d the Morgan Stanley report said.\n\nOn the spending side, the mix remains tilted to capex, with effective capex (direct capex plus grants in aid of creation of capital assets) seen growing at 17.4 per cent in F2026BE vs. 5.3 per cent of F2025RE.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Budget to support growth recovery through measures to promote consumption and increase effective capex spending, which will likely lead to a more broad-based recovery, while at the same time continued consolidation should help macro stability remain in check,\u201d the report observed.\n\nThe simultaneous boost to consumption and capex has to be sweet for equities, especially in the context of continuing and better-than-anticipated fiscal consolidation (projected primary deficit: 0.8 per cent).\n\nThe plethora of announcements around easing of India's tax regime, including permanent establishment rules, GIFT city clarifications, extension of exemptions to sovereign funds, and changes to tax deduction and collection at source could improve FDI and private investment sentiment, according to the report.\n\n\u201cA new tax code is coming this week, as per the Budget, which could reveal a more liberal tax environment. We are overweight Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Technology, and underweight other sectors,\u201d the report added.",

The bank projects a 200 basis-point rate reduction this month, with the overnight deposit rate reaching 17.25 percent by year-end\u2014marking a total decrease of 1,000 basis points from current levels.\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley acknowledges positive signs of economic stability, ongoing inflationary risks and government fiscal policies remain key variables shaping Egypt\u2019s economic outlook in 2024.",

A reliable source of domestic risk capital also contributes to the capital expenditure\n\nInfrastructure spending, restructuring GST rates, direct tax reforms, more free trade agreements, and focus on energy transition are other areas that will contribute to India's macro stability, said Morgan Stanley in its note.\n\nAs far as interest rates are concerned, Morgan Stanley expects a shallow cycle of 50 basis points with the rate cuts starting from February. It expects two consecutive rate cuts of 25 bps each.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is now committed to durable liquidity. Regulatory tightening may loosen in the weeks ahead, according to the brokerage. Initial issuance in the Indian markets is running at about 1.3 per cent of GDP versus the previous peak of over 3.5 per cent and set to rise further, Morgan Stanley said in the note.\n\nThe base case estimate also entails robust domestic growth, no recession in the US and benign oil prices. \"We use a modest reduction in interest rates and positive liquidity environment as the base case for monetary policy. We do not anticipate a bunching of issuances, and the retail bid keeps its nose ahead of the supply,\" Morgan Stanley said.",

Its closest trading partners are also among the top sources of steel and aluminum imports, News.Az reports, citing Bloomberg.\n\nUS consumption of steel totaled about 93 million tons in 2023, according to data from the US Geological Survey, with net imports accounting for 13% of that demand.\n\nLast year, Canada, Brazil and Mexico were the nation\u2019s top three sources of imported steel, according to US Commerce Department data.\n\nThe US steel industry is coming off its worst year since Trump\u2019s first term in office. Domestic steel mills say a renewed uptick in imports is hurting profits and production.\n\nWhen it comes to aluminum, a higher-value metal than steel, the US consumed about 4 million tons in 2023, with net imports accounting for 44% of that total. Canada was the source of 56% of aluminum imports, according to research from Morgan Stanley.\n\nTrump has said tariffs can help US companies ramp up domestic production. For metals, at least, building new capacity won\u2019t come quickly, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cConstructing and ramping up new smelters/mills can take three or more years,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts Carlos De Alba and Justin Ferrer said in a report this week. \u201cHence, any import tariffs applied to metals or mined products are likely to result in higher domestic prices for local buyers of these materials.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that copper tariffs will take a little bit longer to implement than those for aluminum and steel. The US is again a net importer of copper, with foreign supplies accounting for about 36% of domestic refined demand in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. More than a third of total copper imports came from Canada and Mexico.\n\nNews.Az",

            "content": "Over the past year, many Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe insider, James Gorman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$21m worth of shares at a price of US$105 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$140, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 26% of James Gorman's stake.\n\nInsiders in Morgan Stanley didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNYSE:MS Insider Trading Volume January 31st 2025\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nMorgan Stanley Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Morgan Stanley. In total, insiders dumped US$17m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Morgan Stanley\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Morgan Stanley insiders own about US$444m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.",

            "content": "Apple's latest earnings have impressed some investment advisors, with Morgan Stanley inching its Apple stock price target up to $275 mostly because of the long-term strength of Services.\n\nWhile Apple's iPhone sales came in at a bit over $600 million dollars short of the year-ago quarter, there was enough good news in the report for a firm generally bullish on AAPL to increase its price target.\n\nIn a note seen by AppleInsider, investment firm Morgan Stanley has hiked its price target for AAPL to $275. This is a boost over just a week ago, where the firm had a $273 target, it now has a $275 goal.\n\nThe investment firm was impressed by Apple's vague forecasts for the next quarter. Specifically, the note points out Apple's positive prediction of low double-digits Services expansion year-over-year.\n\nAnd, it got that installed base update that it wanted to see. As part of Morgan Stanley's estimates for services earnings on January 22, Morgan Stanley assumed an active product user base of 2.3 billion devices, implying that the iPhone replacement cycle is at about 4.6 years.\n\nWhat was reported was 2.35 billion devices in use, which was apparently enough to satisfy the analysts. According to the firm, this implies a 7% year-over-year growth, with 150 million new devices added over the last year.\n\nOf these 150 million devices, the firm believes that there are about 1.42 billion iPhones in service, just a bit ahead of what was predicted. This implies about 90 million iPhones added to the user base per year.\n\nThis has an interesting impact on average revenue per user, according to the firm. Hardware revenue is down about 8% per user, with Services revenue increasing 5% year-over-year.\n\nAverage spending per user is a big opportunity for Apple. As it stands, each Apple user spends on the average about $28 per month, between amortized hardware and services purchases. This is in contrast to a $71 cable bill per month, and an average cost of $60 for internet access.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects this number to grow to at least $42 in the next decade.\n\nOther factors cited in the slight AAPL target increase include Apple probably taking advantage of NAND and DRAM commodity pricing decreases to stock up for future savings. The note doesn't appear to be that concerned about the impacts of a strengthening dollar as a giant headwind against Apple's earnings in the current quarter.\n\nMorgan Stanley echoes Apple's opinion on Apple Intelligence driving sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook directly said that iPhone sales were impacted by availability of Apple Intelligence, with both the iPhone 16 performing better than the iPhone 15 in the year-ago quarter, and the firm agrees.\n\nFurthermore, the note states that iOS 18.4 in April is an \"important catalyst\" looking forward for iPhone sales. That update is expected to have the upgraded Siri, and support for multiple more languages, therefore expanding the demand for the iPhone in the newly-supported countries.\n\nHowever, while the note doesn't point this out, it's not clear when Apple Intelligence will launch in China \u2014 Apple's largest market outside of the US. And, neither Tim Cook nor Morgan Stanley have any real comment on tariffs by the Trump administration that may or may not materialize, or impact Apple in any real way.\n\nCook skillfully managed to convince the first Trump administration to make changes to levied tariffs, so Apple wasn't directly impacted by them. It's also clear that Apple's CEO is taking steps to have a good relationship with President Trump, even now in the early days of the second term.\n\nThe price target increase on Friday is the firm's \"base case.\" A more bullish scenario that Morgan Stanley points out is a possible acceleration in iPhone replacement cycle, with a shift to the higher-end.\n\nThe bear case would require consumer spending to weaken more than expected, with a deceleration in Services spending by users.",

Rates in the 4%-4.5% window are ideal, as they support corporate earnings while managing inflation pressures in the economy, he said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday.\n\n\"We're right at it, right now as we speak,\" Wilson told the outlet. \"I mean, that's kind of the line in the sand where if rates go higher, even if growth is better, that's going to restrain multiples. So what we really need is sort of that sweet spot between 4%, 4.5%, where growth is not falling off a cliff, the Fed is doing their thing.\"\n\nThe central bank opted to keep interest rates level at the conclusion of its policy meeting this week \u2014 a move that seemed to defy the wishes of President Trump, who has said that interest rates are \"far too high.\" He said he would demand rates be lowered immediately in an address to the World Economic Forum last week.\n\nBut the Fed has already eased rates substantially, Wilson noted, with central bankers dialing back the target range of the Fed funds rate a full percentage point in 2024.\n\nMarkets, meanwhile, are eying potential inflationary pressures stemming from some of Trump's policies, like his push to levy steep tariffs on US imports. Bond yields spiked in the weeks leading up to Trump's inauguration, a sign that investors are weighing inflation risks and pricing in higher interest rates in the future.\n\n\"I'm not sure that pausing is really all the bad for stocks in the short term,\" Wilson added of the Fed decision.\n\nOther Wall Street forecasters have suggested that the Fed has little room to cut rates further, given the strength of the US economy. Even as borrowing costs stay elevated, real GDP grew at a solid 2.3% clip in the fourth quarter, according to advanced estimates from the Commerce Department.\n\nThe job market also remains on solid footing. The economy added 256,000 jobs in December, well above the expected 164,000.\n\nOn Friday, personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred measure, showed prices rose 2.6% year-over-year in December, accelerating from the prior month's 2.4% pace.\n\n\"Q4 GDP data reveal why the fed needed to cut the funds rate, why they do not need to cut it further,\" Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at TS Lombard, wrote in a note on Thursday. \"The first round messaging from any GDP report is its implication for current quarter growth. In this regard, with the 100BP cut in financing costs in Q4, the message is continued growth.\"\n\n\"With still stubborn inflation and a very strong economy and labor market, as the Federal Reserve suggested on Wednesday, more time is needed to allow inflation to settle down before the Fed can cut rates again,\" Clark Bellin, the chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, said.\n\nInvestors have also pushed out their expectations for another rate cut. Markets don't see another 25 basis-point cut happening until June, with a 47% chance that rates will be a quarter-point lower by then, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",

As for earnings, the marketed Ebitda is roughly flat from that time before Musk jumped in, but contains a variety of adjustments that help boost the numbers, the people said. While that might not merit the lofty $44 billion valuation Musk slapped on the business, it\u2019s enough to draw interest of secured creditors.\n\nThat\u2019s paving the way for the bank and other lenders to start offloading what has been a blight on their balance sheets for the better part of three years. Buyout loans that had been receiving bids for roughly 60 cents on the dollar are now being shopped at or above 95 cents, according to people familiar with the Morgan Stanley-led sales process.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s pitch includes results that show an adjusted version of X\u2019s 2024 profits, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, at roughly $1.2 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The financials also reflect X getting a bump from election-related buzz, posting about $400 million in Ebitda on $710 million of revenue in the last three months of the year \u2014 both higher than the two preceding quarters.\n\nHelped by Musk\u2019s singular relationship with President Donald Trump and the tech mogul\u2019s newfound proximity to the White House, Morgan Stanley is discovering that investors are drawn to the debt of the company now called X as it leads banks in marketing a $3 billion offering. Potential buyers who already got a peek at X\u2019s financials are seeing signs of a rebound. And as an added bonus, investors will gain exposure to the company\u2019s stake in Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence project, xAI.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Just a few months ago, Morgan Stanley was stuck with billions of dollars of unloved debt tied to Elon Musk\u2019s controversial 2022 buyout of social-media platform Twitter Inc. It took one election and a billionaire bromance to flip the script.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne note of caution highlighted by investors in X\u2019s financials relates to its revenue and earnings from \u201crelated parties\u201d outside of X\u2019s core social-media platform, said some of the people. And restructuring expenses from Musk\u2019s decision to lay off a huge portion of X\u2019s staff, as well as investments, will be added back into results. Investors will also see that X has $400 million worth of cash on its balance sheet \u2014 a sharp decline from the $1.4 billion it had in 2022, people familiar said.\n\nUltimately, even if X\u2019s core figures paint a mixed picture, buyers may not care because of the exuberance around Musk, the people said.\n\nThe transaction follows a $1 billion sale of X debt the banks recently completed between 90-to-95 cents on the dollar as a test of market appetite. And it\u2019s a welcome turn in fortune for Morgan Stanley, which advised Musk on his 2022 purchase of Twitter and led seven banks that arranged $13 billion in debt financing for the deal.\n\nThe underwriting group had planned to resell the debt to investors, who would take on the risks associated with it. Instead, the banks were met with a buyers\u2019 strike, and had to slash the value of their holdings as X\u2019s business deteriorated, largely due to a series of jarring business decisions by Musk. Interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve only made things worse.\n\nTo be sure, the banks that underwrote the leveraged buyout have earned about $3 billion of interest on the X debt since 2022, according to Bloomberg calculations, far exceeding any paper losses. But the situation hasn\u2019t been ideal. Banks typically try to market corporate loans they\u2019ve underwritten to investors as soon as possible to free up their balance sheets. So-called hung debt is considered a black eye.\n\nNow, though, events are transpiring to make X debt more appealing to investors. Musk, a zealous Trump supporter, is now a consultant to the new administration and investors expect that relationship with the president to boost his business interests.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been portraying X\u2019s $6 billion stake in xAI as an advantage for debtholders. The idea is not only that the business could flourish, and therefore help X, but that they could have a claim on that xAI stake if things go awry.\n\nDespite some of the offbeat maneuvers, there seems to be no shortage of investors wanting a chance to own a piece of X, and therefore the Musk empire. After news broke last week about the $1 billion loan sale, Morgan Stanley got a swell of inquiries, some of the people said.\n\nLofty Yield\n\nThe $3 billion of debt on sale now matures in 2029 will pay interest of 6.5 percentage points above the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate. That amounts to a lofty yield of roughly 12%. The price reflects the risk of buying debt of a company that is not currently assessed by credit ratings agencies and whose leverage ratio is roughly 10 times earnings.\n\nThe latest marketing efforts probably won\u2019t be the last as banks seek to offload X exposure. The current offering is safer than other, unsecured portions that lenders also have on their books. It is far less certain that they will sell riskier pieces anywhere close to face value, if it can be done at all.\n\nHung debt is unusual in itself, but the ups and downs of the Twitter-turned-X deal are almost unheard of \u2014 including what might possibly become a profitable resolution for Wall Street bankers who only a few months ago were staring down a much different outcome.\n\nLooking at the full picture of their fees, interest income and proposed valuations for loan sales, the banks will almost certainly earn a profit on the X transaction, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert.\n\n\u201cThey have certainly recovered more than 100 cents on the dollar,\u201d he said.\n\n--With assistance from Jeannine Amodeo, Aaron Weinman, Gillian Tan and Paula Seligson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Some Morgan Stanley ( ) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Co-President, Daniel Simkowitz, recently sold a substantial US$5.0m worth of stock at a price of US$137 per share. However, that sale only accounted for 7.9% of their holding, so arguably it doesn't say much about their conviction.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan Stanley\n\nThe insider, James Gorman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$21m worth of shares at a price of US$105 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$139, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of James Gorman's holding.\n\nMorgan Stanley insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nDoes Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$444m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Morgan Stanley Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Morgan Stanley makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

            "content": "A Morgan Stanley advisor is taking the firm to court over millions in income he says he's lost amid anti-money laundering concerns.\n\nRodney Halvorson contends in a petition filed on Monday in California state court that he moved to Morgan Stanley from Bank of America's Merrill in 2022 with the understanding that he would be able to bring along his two most prominent clients, a father and son who are Mexican citizens. But rather than the smooth transfer he said he was promised, his clients were greeted with a five-month-long Morgan Stanley investigation into more than 30 years of their business dealings.\n\nHalvorson contends that Morgan Stanley executives initially told him it would be fairly easy to move the clients over, but he was later informed that Morgan Stanley could not maintain their accounts. His petition states their accounts made up roughly 60% of his business and that losing them has cost him more than $6 million in income and bonuses.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nMorgan Stanley attracts assets even with AML scrutiny\n\nMorgan Stanley stresses quality over quantity as net new assets dip\n\nEx-Morgan Stanley broker owes $7.4M on promissory note\n\nMorgan Stanley loses restraining order battle with ex-broker\n\nHalvorson's lawyer, Brandon Reif of the Reif Law Group in Beverly Hills, California, said he thinks Morgan Stanley is trying to tread very carefully with international clients following revelations that various federal agencies were questioning its safeguards against money laundering. The trouble, Reif said, was that Halvorson was repeatedly encouraged by Morgan Stanley employees to believe that moving his Merrill accounts over would be easy.\n\n\"But then they had to look good in the eyes of the Department of Justice and the eyes of other government agencies,\" Reif said. \"That's why they did this, not because they wanted to stop handling this international business.\"\n\nA Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment on the case, which was first reported on by the industry publication FinancialAdvisorIQ.\n\n\n\nRegulatory scrutiny on international accounts\n\nFederal regulators have been trying to pull wealth managers to the forefront in their attempts to fight international money laundering. In August, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network adopted a rule bringing registered investment advisors under the same anti-money-laundering requirements that now apply to banks and broker-dealers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has separately proposed a rule that would require RIAs to collect identifying information for any possible new clients and check it against official lists of undesirable actors.\n\nAmong large Wall Street fixtures, Morgan Stanley has come in for particular questioning over whether it's doing enough to combat money laundering. The Wall Street Journal reported in April 2024 that the SEC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were looking into possible weaknesses in the firm's anti-money-laundering policies. That was followed up with an article in November detailing some of Morgan Stanley's allegedly light-handed dealings with possibly dodgy overseas clients.\n\nThe scrutiny comes as Morgan Stanley has set itself the massive goal of eventually having $10 trillion in assets under management. Reporting earlier this month that the firm had reached $7.9 trillion in AUM by the end of 2024, executives expressed confidence in their ability to continue gathering assets, even amid regulatory inquiries.\n\n\n\nClient relationship 'beyond repair'\n\nAlong with Morgan Stanley, Halvorson's petition names Gregory Laetsch, managing director and market executive for the firm's Los Angeles offices, as a respondent. It was Laetsch, according to the filing, who repeatedly encouraged Halvorson to believe that there would be few obstacles to moving his clients over from Merrill.\n\nLaetsch, the petition states, assured Halvorson that Morgan Stanley would merely follow industry standard \"due diligence\" practices when considering bringing on an international client.\n\n\"Laetsch represented to Halvorson that if BOA was satisfied with the legitimacy of his clients' business, he could not see how [Morgan Stanley] would not be equally satisfied,\" according to the petition.\n\nHalvorson joined Morgan Stanley on May 6, 2022, and was quickly afterward able to arrange a transfer of accounts for one of his prominent clients \u2014 the son. The father, though, was involved in business dealings that necessitated a delay, according to the petition. When, months later, he tried to arrange a transfer again, he instead unwittingly set off the investigation into his clients by Morgan Stanley's anti-money-laundering and enhanced due diligence groups, the petition states.\n\nHalvorson worked closely over the ensuing months to help Morgan Stanley vet his clients and clear up any possible misgivings. In the end, though, he was informed the firm could not accept their business and that the son would have to remove the accounts he had already transferred over, according to the petition.\n\nHalvorson contends that Morgan Stanley knew or should have known that its internal policies were under suspicion and that the resulting scrutiny would pose obstacles to bringing on international clients.\n\n\"Rather, [Morgan Stanley] continued to keep Halvorson and his best clients unaware of the situation internally at [Morgan Stanley] that caused [Morgan Stanley] to enhance its due diligence and either abandon or retreat from its international business focus in Mexico and other international markets,\" according to the petition. On Aug. 7, 2023, Halvorson sent Laetsch an email saying his clients had vowed never to work with Morgan Stanley again and complaining that a client relationship he had \"spent the last 10 years cultivating was irreparably damaged.\"\n\n\"It's quite rare in this business that you get to be a part of one's family to the depth of wives getting to know each other,\" he wrote. \"Weddings, special celebrations, both my wife and I attended them all. This was no ordinary relationship; it was special and now I fear it is beyond repair.\"\n\nThe email said the clients had $17 million to transfer from Merrill and $22 million they were going to realize through a business sale in September. They also, according to the email, were planning \"liquidity events\" yielding in excess of $100 million in the next few years.\n\nIn the end, according to the petition, Merrill helped broker the sale of the business for $22 million. Had Halvorson known of the heightened scrutiny of international clients, the petition states, he never would have considered coming to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\nFeeling stuck and seeking compensation\n\nHalvorson had been at Morgan Stanley once before, working there for seven years before joining Bank of America in 2006. His petition says he was looking forward to returning, in part because his own son (not named in the legal filing) was then working as a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.\n\nNow, according to the petition, Halvorson, who's 67, feels bound to his new firm. As part of the incentives to join Morgan Stanley, he accepted a recruiting loan that he would have to pay back should he choose to go elsewhere. That loan has $300,000 in outstanding debt left on it, an amount that would result in \"financial ruin\" if Halvorson had to pay it, according to the petition. Morgan Stanley has been among the most aggressive firms in pursuing advisors who leave early before fulfilling the terms of these promissory loan notes.\n\nHalvorson contends that other advisors who lost international clients after moving over were offered compensation. When he voiced concerns, he instead was greeted with retaliation, according to the petition, and he saw his payout rate fall to 20% from 44% after he failed to meet revenue goals set under the assumption he would be able to move his most valuable clients over.\n\nHalvorson's petition seeks to have the case taken up by an arbitration panel administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which has jurisdiction in disputes between brokerages and registered representatives. Reif said he filed in state court first to make Halvorson's complaints public and decrease the chances that Morgan Stanley would try to retaliate. He also wants to encourage witnesses to Morgan Stanley's alleged misrepresentations to come forward.\n\nThe petition alleges negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, retaliation, age discrimination and unfair business practice, among other violations. It seeks not only $6 million in lost income and bonuses but also treble damages, attorney's fees, prejudgment interest and punitive and exemplary damages.\n\n\"Morgan Stanley had the opportunity to fix the Rod Halvorson situation before the lawsuit was filed, but it chose to use retaliation tactics to harm him,\" Reif said.",

The most senior notes will repay investors pro rata, while the mezzanine and subordinate classes repay sequentially, according to KBRA.\n\nA class and mezzanine notes pay a fixed rate, and the B1 classes are variable, KBRA said. After closing, the notes pay on the 25th day or each month, with a final maturity date of Nov. 25, 2064, according to KBRA.\n\nThe collateral pool contains 939 first-lien loans paying fixed and adjustable rates to the pool. They are fully amortizing, financing a range of properties from single-family homes to two- and four-unit residences. They have an average balance of $401,165, and moderate leverage of an original weighted average (WA) loan-to-value ratio of 70.8%. The loan count was significantly higher than several Morgan Stanley pools, going back to the MSRM 2024-NQM3, according to KBRA.\n\nLike other pools of securitized mortgages located in the Los Angeles County area, any loans that exhibited material damage from the fires were removed before closing. In any case, S&P estimated that the exposure to those loans came to 5.07% by pool balance.\n\nWhere the exposure is significant is to property-focused investor loans underwritten to a debt service ratio driven by rental incomes. They make up 46.56% of the pool balance, S&P said.\n\nIn another collateral feature, the A1A, A1B, A2 and A3 certificates have step-up interest rates. This is the sum of the fixed coupon at closing and 1.0%, depending on the pool's net weighted average coupon. S&P thinks this step-up feature could motivate the majority holder of outstanding XS certificates to exercise the option to clean up the transaction.\n\nKBRA's assigns AAA to the A1 through A1B notes; AA+ to the A2 notes; A to the A3 class; BBB to the M1s; BB to the B1s; BBB- to the B1A notes; BB to the B1B notes; and B to the B2 notes.\n\nS&P gives AAA to the three A1 classes; AA- to the A2 notes; A- to the A3 class; and BBB- to the M1 tranche.\n\n",

            "content": "Among sell-side analysts on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley is one of the most well-known. The company\u2019s large investment banking business, which generated $6.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, contributes to the scope of its equity coverage. Below, I'll detail three stocks that are among the \u201cTop Picks\u201d of Morgan Stanley analysts. All return and implied upside figures use prices as of the Jan. 27 close.\n\nGet Robinhood Markets alerts: Sign Up\n\nSeagate: More Data Means More Storage\n\nFirst up is Seagate Technologies NASDAQ: STX. Morgan Stanley's price target for the hardware company currently stands at $129. This implies that shares of Seagate could rise 25% in order to reach that level. Seagate is a leading manufacturer of hard disk drives (HDDs). This is where computers store files. HDDs can store lots of data at a lower price than solid-state drives (SSDs). Their disadvantage is that they are slower than SSDs, making them ideal for storing data that doesn\u2019t need to be frequently accessed. This includes things like record retention, video, and data backups.\n\nSeagate Technology Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$121.56\n\n37.48% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 19 Analyst Ratings Current Price $88.42 High Forecast $160.00 Average Forecast $121.56 Low Forecast $68.00 Seagate Technology Stock Forecast Details\n\nSeagate\u2019s fiscal Q2 2025 earnings release resulted in Morgan Stanley raising expectations for the stock. The firm beat estimates on adjusted earnings per share significantly. Much of the bull case for Seagate centers around the idea of data storage becoming increasingly important. The firm\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, William Mosely, highlighted this in the context of AI. He noted in the earnings call that \u201cHDDs play a crucial role in housing the massive data sets required for training AI models.\" They store data when advanced chips don\u2019t need to actively process it.\n\nThe firm\u2019s HDD revenue increased 57% from the prior year. Mass capacity devices now make up 87% of the firm\u2019s HDD sales, up 10% from fiscal Q2 2024. This indicates increasing adoption from large customers who need to store huge amounts of data. It will be interesting to see if analysts change their view on the firm, given news surrounding DeepSeek AI that sent AI-driven stocks plummeting.\n\nRobinhood: Trump Helps This Crypto Trading Platform\n\nMorgan Stanley recently added Robinhood Markets NASDAQ: HOOD to the company\u2019s \u201cFinancials\u2019 Finest\u201d list. Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the stock to $64 per share on Jan. 17. This implies upside in the stock of 34%. Robinhood shares have gone on a tear as of late, up over 75% in the past three months. However, analysts believe that upside remains due to the freshly in-office Trump administration. Many believe the new administration will favor cryptocurrency more than Biden's.\n\nRobinhood Markets Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$61.31\n\n58.14% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 17 Analyst Ratings Current Price $38.77 High Forecast $90.00 Average Forecast $61.31 Low Forecast $29.00 Robinhood Markets Stock Forecast Details\n\nAbout 48% of Trump's corporate election contributions came from crypto firms. This shows strong support for his policies from the industry. Additionally, a Trump executive order titled \u201cStrengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology\" looks to forward many interests of the crypto community.\n\nTransaction fees from crypto trading make up a significant portion of Robinhood\u2019s revenue. It generated $311 million from this stream over the past four quarters. A friendlier stance on crypto could boost prices and trading. This would raise Robinhood's revenue. There is also significant room for the company to continue growing internationally and in products like retirement accounts.\n\nAtlassian: Cloud Migration, Gen AI Tools, Low Market Penetration\n\nLast up is Atlassian NASDAQ: TEAM. Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on the tech stock and a price target of $315. This target implies just under 18% upside in the company\u2019s shares. Atlassian makes workplace productivity software that helps businesses increase collaboration between employees.\n\nAtlassian Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$319.71\n\n46.84% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 24 Analyst Ratings Current Price $217.74 High Forecast $380.00 Average Forecast $319.71 Low Forecast $200.00 Atlassian Stock Forecast Details\n\nBullishness stems from the company\u2019s new product, Rovo, as well as its customer migration from its data center deployment to the cloud. Rovo is Atlassian\u2019s new Gen AI tool, which the company hopes will be a significant growth driver. It lets users search for info in Atlassian and third-party apps. They can also chat with a bot that uses company-specific info.\n\nIf the company can get more customers to access its software over the cloud rather than using on-premise hardware, there are several benefits. First off, implementing new features and products becomes easier. This can increase the company\u2019s ability to cross-sell, leading to higher growth. It could also lead to higher margins, as it can increase the economies of scale in its cloud segment, leading to lower costs per customer. Data center deployment still makes up 67% of revenue, meaning there is still much room for migration to the cloud.\n\nAdditionally, Atlassian is less than 7% penetrated in the $67 billion market it is targeting, suggesting significant room for growth.\n\nBefore you consider Robinhood Markets, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Robinhood Markets wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Robinhood Markets currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

That appeared to shift concerns about the Fed being \u201cbehind the curve\u201d\u2014that is, not cutting rates quickly enough to prevent the economy from slipping into recession\u2014to concerns that the Fed risked reigniting inflation if they cut too aggressively.\n\nSince the November election, markets have faced uncertainty about how aggressively the White House would pursue tariffs, and whether its policies could trigger another inflation surge. While the Colombian tariff episode earlier this week did little to clarify the issue,1 it was a reminder of what Morgan Stanley & Co. analysts described as the potential for trade-policy uncertainty to contribute to volatility in the financial markets.2\n\nWhile inflation hasn\u2019t been hot in recent months, it\u2019s been \u201cstickier\u201d than expected.

            "content": "We recently published an article titled These 29 AI Electricity, Infrastructure Stocks Are Crashing Due to DeepSeek News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors are pulling back from the artificial intelligence trade. Previously, a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory highlighted that US data centers are expected to use 6.7% to 12% of all power by 2028. However, one artificial intelligence startup has upended these estimates, leaving investors wondering whether the anticipated surge in power demand and data center expansion still holds.\n\nEnergy, infrastructure, and real-estate stocks were tanking on Monday, even though they were known to be less crowded alternatives to stocks such as Nvidia. Monday\u2019s broad-market selloff has revealed how a vast number of energy-related companies have been banking on the AI boom and the anticipated power surge it was expected to bring.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\n\u201cThe share price drop yesterday demonstrated that many energy infrastructure companies got carried away in the momentum of the AI story last year\u201d. -Talon Custer, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nDeepSeek, an artificial intelligence startup from China, caused a frenzy in the AI world after launching its latest AI models. The company claims that these models built are at par or better than industry-leading models in the United States. They require fewer chips and are made at a fraction of the cost. All of these updates are now threatening to upset the technology world. Once the best-performing securities over the past 18 months, US electricity providers are now one of the hardest hit sectors with investors reevaluating their outlooks toward artificial intelligence and the magnitude of money that they are spending.\n\nWhile many analysts, such as those at Citigroup, assert that DeepSeek\u2019s large-language model had \u201cprompted investor inquiries around the cost of compute\u201d. Yet many others such as Bernstein doubt that the DeepSeek model was actually built with the acclaimed $6 million figure. They deem that the market reaction on Monday was \u201coverblown\u201d. Nevertheless, investors are concerned that the wider adoption of models, such as those by DeepSeek, could result in lesser demand for electricity and also require a smaller power build-out.\n\n\u201cIf proven true, the efficiencies used within DeepSeek\u2019s open-source model can be applied by the hyperscalers to their models, which would result in a more moderated demand\u201d. -Analysts with Evercore ISI said in a note, as reported by Reuters.\n\nDeepSeek AI is also threatening the dominance of current leaders in the artificial intelligence world. This could potentially slow down the deployment of their data centers. However, an energy economist at the University of Houston noted that the wider adoption of AI could be positive news. This is because this adoption would in turn result in a surge in power demand. This is why he views the power stocks sell-off as short-lived and short-sighted.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, if DeepSeek turns out to be what everybody wants, and they sell to U.S. companies, and the U.S. companies change their algorithms to adopt to it, it just means a greater, faster broader development\u201d. \u2013 Ed Hirs, energy economist at the University of Houston.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by screening out the worst-performing stocks from Friday\u2019s close (24th January) to Tuesday\u2019s close (28th January). These stocks were then ranked in ascending order of their declines.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nShare Price Decline: (10.23%)\n\nNRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) operates as an energy and home services company in the United States and Canada. DeepSeek\u2019s entry into the market has also impacted NRG Energy, whose stock has plunged more than 10%. Investors sold off shares of power utilities which previously hiked on hopes of a demand surge from power-hungry AI-driven data centers. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley maintained a \u201cHold\u201d on the stock on Monday, January 27, with a price target of $86.00.\n\nOverall NRG ranks 22nd on our list of the AI stocks crashing due to DeepSeek news. While we acknowledge the potential of NRG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NRG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Andrew Sheets: Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Andrew Sheets, Head of Corporate Credit Research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nJenna Gianelli: I\u2019m Jenna Gianelli, Head of Retail Consumer Credit, here at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAndrew Sheets: And today on this episode, we're going to discuss the outlook for the retail and consumer sectors.\n\nIt\u2019s Wednesday, Jan 29th at 9 am in New York.\n\nSo, Jenna, it's great to talk with you, and it's really great to talk about the retail and consumer sectors heading into 2025, because it's such an important part of the investor debate. On the one hand, a lot of economic data in the U.S. seems strong, including a very low unemployment rate. And yet, we\u2019re also hearing a lot about cost-of-living pressures on consumers, lower consumer confidence, and investor concern that the consumer is just not going to be able to hold up in this higher rate environment. And then you can layer on uncertainty from the new administration. Will we see tariffs? How large will they be? And how will retailers, which often import a lot of their goods, handle those changes?\n\nSo, maybe just kind of starting off at a 40, 000-foot view, how are you thinking about consumer dynamics going into 2025?\n\nJenna Gianelli: Of course. So, I think that that choppy consumer demand environment is actually one of the strongest pillars of our more cautious view, going into next year. How the sector, performed last year was not in tandem with kind of what the macro headlines suggested. The macro headlines were quite positive, and the consumer was, you know, seemingly strong. But there was a lot going on under the hood when you looked at different dichotomies, right? So, if you looked at the high-end versus the low-end, if you looked at goods versus services. And then within, you know, certain categories, there were categories that were, you know, really quite strong based on what the consumer was prioritizing \u2013 goods, essentials, personal care, beauty, right? And then there were others that they really shied away from.\n\nSo, I think what we're going to see in 2025 is quite a bit more of that. When we think that the high-end will continue to be resilient, that pressure on the low-income consumer will continue. But actually moderate potentially as into [20]25, as we think about lower interest rates, potentially, you know, lesser immigration and so less competition for jobs at the lower income level. So maybe even some tailwinds, but it's really an alleviation of pressure and easier compares. But we do expect overall some deceleration, right? Because we had a lot of pent-up demand, especially on the high-end.\n\nSo, we are expecting services, demand to slow, in 2025 and goods actually to hold up relatively well. So, we really are focused on what's going on at the individual category level and the different types of consumers that we're looking at.\n\nAndrew Sheets: And as you think about some of those, you know, subcategories that you, you cover, maybe just a minute on a couple that you think will perform the best over this year and some that you think might face the biggest challenges.\n\nJenna Gianelli: There are some that have been under relative pressure, in [20]23 and [20]24 where we might actually see some, you know, relief. Now, depending on the direction of rates in the housing market, we could see and expect to see an uptick in bigger ticket spending, durables, home related, that have been under, you know, some pressure.\n\nAnd also, you know, categories where, you know, the consumer, they're arguably discretionary. But maybe they pulled back because there was a big surge in demand just post-COVID. Pet in our universe is actually one example of those, where it's been a bit depressed and we actually expect to see, you know, some recovery into next year; also tied to housing right as new house formation starts.\n\nSo, but again, a lot of that is predicated on the, you know, housing direction of rates and some of these other macro factors. I'd say, irrespective of the more macro influences, we do still expect that essentials \u2013 grocery, and certain categories like a beauty, pockets of apparel and brands, right? It really comes down to the brands, the brand heat, the brand relevance. If it's relevant to the consumer, they're going to spend on it. And so, that's where we really focus on the micro level; our picks of which brands are resonating, which categories are resonating. Which is, those are some of the, you know, the few that we're expecting, either a recovery in or still, you know, relative, outperformance.\n\nI'd say on the laggard side, which is probably the next piece of that question. I mean, look, there's still a lot of secular headwinds at play. And so, you know, from a department store perspective outside of event risk or idiosyncratic risk, we're still generally expecting department stores and kind of traditional specialty apparel, mall-based, with not a lot of channel diversification to still generally underperform and see similar trends they've seen the last few years.\n\nAndrew Sheets: So, Jenna, your sector is sitting at the center of this kind of very interesting economic debate over how healthy the consumer really is. And, you know, it's also sitting at the center of the policy debate because tariffs are a dynamic that could dramatically affect retailers depending on how large they are and how they're implemented.\n\nSo how do you think about tariff risk? And can you give some sense of how you think about exposure of your sector to those dynamics?\n\nJenna Gianelli: So, tariffs and policy risk and the uncertainty, is one of the big reasons. And when we think about, you know, retail \u2013 and particularly discretionary retail \u2013 why we're more cautious on the space into [20]25. Tariffs is the biggest piece of that. The degrees of exposure across our universe, varying degrees to a very wide range, right? So, we have some that are minimal, you know, let's say 5 per cent out of, you know, China sourcing some up to 70 per cent out of China sourcing. And then you layer in, well, what about goods from Canada and Mexico and what if there's a universal tariff?\n\nAnd so, the range of outcomes, is, you know, so significant. And so, what we are advocating to investors is that we go in with the expectation that tariffs are a \u2013 an uncertain, but certain threat, right? And not completely minimizing them within a portfolio but reducing the ones that do tend to have those higher, you know, exposures.\n\nI'd say the range from when we stress tested the earnings headwinds potential. I mean, it was anything from call it down 10 per cent EBITDA to down 60-70 per cent EBITDA in the most draconian scenarios. And so, I think taking a very prudent approach, assuming that there will be some level of tariffs phased in, you know; if we look back to the 2018 timeframe \u2013 different sets of goods, different times, different rates and go from there.\n\nAndrew Sheets: So, Jenna, we've talked about the economy. We've talked about some of the policy and tariff risk potentially impacting consumer and retail. You know, a third really key strategic theme for us is more corporate activity, more M&A. And again, I think this is where your sector is so interesting because you were already kind of in the center of some of these debates, last year with corporate activity.\n\nSo, can you talk a little bit about how you see that? And again, you also have this interesting dynamic that some of the targets of M&A activity in your sector were some of the businesses that were kind of struggling, that were kind of seen as some of these laggards. And so how does that just represent different investor views of their prospects? How do you think people should think about that going forward?\n\nJenna Gianelli: So, look, I think M&A could have positive risk for 2025 and also negative risk for some of our companies. And it really depends, at least from a credit perspective, how we think about some of their indentures and bond language and likelihood of pro forma capital structures.\n\nBut I think without getting, you know, too deep into that, our expectation is that M&A will increase. We know that there is private equity capital on the sidelines to the extent that rates, even if we're in a little bit of a higher for longer, if the expectation is that we do on the year [20]25 in a slightly lower regime, at least we have some stability or visibility on the rate front. Which should, you know, spur more corporate activity.\n\nAnd then also, I think, look, just equity valuations, right? I mean, our universe, particularly when you think about \u2013 the size of the equity check that you need to come in at and the valuations are a bit cheaper because across our universe, we did see some underperformance last year.\n\nSo, I think those are the kind of main drivers of why we'll see the activity pick up on the underperforming pieces of the space. There are still pockets of value that I think private equity sponsors are seeing. The ones that have come up most notably are real estate, right? And, you know, we saw\u2026\n\nAndrew Sheets: Because these retailers often own a large\u2026\n\nJenna Gianelli: Many of the department stores own a significant amount of their real estate. 20, 20, 40, 50 per cent depending on your, you know, assumptions and how you value this real estate. But even with conservative LTV assumptions, there is lending capability here. And I think so that's, you know, one piece of it, those that have multi-banner assets that appeal to different consumer cohorts, that have maybe a solid private label portfolio.\n\nWhen you think about intellectual property, there are real assets, for certain retailers. And so, I think that's what, you know, private equity historically has seen as the play. Now, how that manifests throughout the space? You know, from an LBO perspective; I do still think that getting a really large LBO for a traditional, you know, mature type of retailer could be challenging, but there are creative ways to get these deals done.\n\nAnd again, I think because of what we have is some legacy indentures, traditional, more investment grade style capital structures, there might be flexibility to approach, you know, LBOs in a more creative way \u2013 without having to access the capital markets in such a big way as maybe you would traditionally think.\n\nAndrew Sheets: And so, this would be examples of private equity firms coming in, doing an LBO or a leveraged buyout where you can actually almost take advantage of the borrowing that company has already done in the market\u2026\n\nJenna Gianelli: Yes. Keep the debt outstanding.\n\nAndrew Sheets: At attractive levels.\n\nJenna Gianelli: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nAndrew Sheets: So, Jenna, it's so great to talk to you. Well, it's always great to talk to you, but it's so great to talk to you now because I do think, you know, as we, we look into 2025, I think there's always a lot of focus on, you know, the direction of markets, you know. Will rates go up or down? Will equities go up or down? But I think what's so clear talking to you about your sector is that there are all these themes that are really about dispersion. That we see, you know, really different trends by the type of consumer segment and sub segment; that we see very different trends by how exposed companies are to tariffs, right? You mentioned anything from, your earnings could be down 10 per cent to 60 per cent. And, you know, very different dynamics, you know, winners and losers from M&A.\n\nAnd so, I do think it just highlights that this is a year where, from the strategy side, we think spreads are kind of more range bound. But there does seem to be a lot of dispersion within the sector. And there seems like, well, there's going to be plenty that's going to keep you busy.\n\nJenna Gianelli: I hope so.\n\nAndrew Sheets: Great. Jenna, thanks for taking the time to talk.\n\nJena Gianelli: Thank you, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Sheets: Great. And thanks for listening.

            "content": "Surging US stock markets, in particular the outperformance of the Magnificent 7, over the past two years has raised questions about whether investors should even bother looking elsewhere.\n\nThe S&P 500 has gained 25.02% and 26.29% in the past two years respectively, marking one of the largest two-year gains in US stock market history.\n\nYet, having seen such stellar returns, asset allocators have begun to express caution. Most asset managers in their annual outlooks have said that they expect returns from the main index to be in the single digits this year, reflecting higher economic growth but a backdrop of increasing concerns.\n\nThese concerns were expressed in a recent note from Goldman Sachs, which pointed to three main factors which could act as a drag on stock market returns this year.\n\nFirstly, most of the good economic news around taxation and deregulation from the incoming Trump administration has already been priced in and stock markets are therefore vulnerable to a correction if this disappoints.\n\nSecondly, high valuations are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman Sachs notes that other markets are much cheaper relative to the US and their valuations are broadly in line with long-term averages.\n\nThirdly, the degree of concentration in US markets is unprecedented with the five biggest stocks accounting for roughly a quarter of the index.\n\nThe US bank also noted that rising bond yields, with the 10-year Yreasury yield having climbed above 4.5%, could weigh on equities if they rise further.\n\nAgainst this background, Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, chose the BNY Mellon Global Leaders fund and the Morgan Stanley Global Brands fund for this week\u2019s head-to-head article.\n\nBNY Investments Morgan Stanley Size $167.6m $20.8bn Inception 2016 2000 Managers Charlie Macquaker, Jane Henderson, Roy Leckie William Lock, Anton Kryachok, Isabelle Mast, Marte Borhaug, Bruno Paulson, Alex Gabriele, Marcus Watson, Nic Sochovsk, Richard Perrott Three-year cumulative return 16.18% 17.98% Three-year annualised return 5.59% 6.33% Three-year annualised alpha -1.08% 0.75% Three-year annualised volatility 17.62 14.64 Three-year information ratio -0.11 -0.01 FE Crown fund rating ** ** OCF (retail share class) 1.63% 1.84% Source: FE Fundinfo (Data in US dollars, 27 January 2025)\n\nInvestment approach\n\nThe BNY Investments fund, which is managed by Walter Scott, is a high conviction, quality growth strategy, which invests in approximately 25 companies. The team focuses on companies with strong balance sheets, high rates of internal wealth generation and the ability to grow earnings over the long term, notes McDermott.\n\nThere are four stages to its stock selection process, comprising research, analysis by the regional team, the \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019 analysis, which challenges the key elements of a potential investment such as size, structure and cyclicality, and the final phase, which involves convincing the firm\u2019s top executives.\n\nTurnover is around 20% with the team targeting growth over seven to 10 years. The strategy has a healthy exposure to emerging markets, accounting for around 11.9% of its total investments compared with an average of 2.7% for the MSCI World index.\n\nMeanwhile, the Morgan Stanley fund invests in quality companies with defendable and visible future earnings. It is also very concentrated with between 20 to 40 holdings. The managers look for companies benefiting from economies of scale and leading market distribution.\n\nEvery stock will also have to yield at least 1% in order to show commitment to minority shareholders. Stocks in the Morgan Stanley fund are bought with a four-year outlook, meaning turnover is around 25%, though positions will be topped and tailed, depending on their performance and attractiveness, notes McDermott.\n\nIn contrast to the BNY Investments fund, the Morgan Stanley fund has the vast majority of its assets in developed markets due to its conviction on the higher levels of governance and liquidity there. On a sector basis, the BNY Investments fund is more exposed to technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary, while the Morgan Stanley fund has greater exposure to financials and consumer staples.\n\nFund characteristics\n\nSector allocation:\n\nBNY Investments Morgan Stanley Information Technology 30.8% Information Technology 22.4% Healthcare 21.6% Financials 21.6% Industrials 15.3% Consumer Staples 18.3% Consumer Discretionary 12.1% Industrials 12% Financials 9.1% Consumer Discretionary 5.7% Communication Services 5.2% Communication Services 2.5% Consumer Staples 3.6% Cash 2.2% Source: Fund factsheets, January 2025\n\nTop 5 holdings:\n\nBNY Investments Weighting Morgan Stanley Weighting Mastercard 5.4% Microsoft Corp 7.6% Taiwan Semiconductor 5.3% SAP 6.8% Alphabet 5.2% Visa 6.4% Automatic Data Processing 4.7% Accenture 4.1% Microsoft Corp 4.7% Aon 4% Source: Fund factsheets, January 2025\n\nPerformance\n\nBoth funds have underperformed the MSCI World index during the past five years, although that is unsurprising given the outperformance of a narrow list of US tech stocks during the past 18 months to two years.\n\n\u201cI would have no major concerns for either on performance; both are not pure growth plays, they target quality, long-term growth and this explains the slight lag on the MSCI World benchmark, which is dominated by those tech players at the top of the market,\u201d said McDermott.\n\nDiscrete calendar year performance\n\nFund YTD* 2024 2023 2022 2021 BNY Investments 4.54% 6.11% 21.88% -21.96% 19.42% Morgan Stanley 3.85% 9.04% 16.44% -17.38% 22.3% Source: FE Fundinfo. Annual returns in US dollars. *1 January 2025 \u2013 27 January 2025\n\nManager review\n\nThe BNY Investments fund is helmed by Roy Leckie, Jane Henderson and Charlie Macquaker, all of whom have been with the business for roughly three decades.\n\nThey are supported by three research teams for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and the US, comprising six members each, many of whom have been in the business for more than 10 years.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley fund is led by a nine person investment team with William Lock having oversight. He previously worked in Credit Suisse First Boston\u2019s Corporate Finance Group and as a management consultant at Arthur D. Little.\n\nThe other investment managers are managing directors Bruno Paulson, Nic Sochovsky, Marcus Watson and Alex Gabriele; executive directors Richard Perrott, Isabelle Mast and Anton Kryachok; and head of ESG Marte Borhaug.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, McDermott notes that both funds focus on quality growth investing, although the BNY Investments fund has greater exposure to growth stocks out of the two, while its focus on emerging markets also distinguishes it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Morgan Stanley fund is slightly higher conviction, while he also notes that its 10-year return of 143% is hard to beat.\n\n\u201cIf forced, I\u2019d probably just side with the Morgan Stanley fund, but the focus on emerging markets makes the BNY Investments portfolio a good alternative for those looking for access to a truly global portfolio,\u201d he said.",

Texas has been one of the most active states in anti-ESG initiatives, with actions including having several asset managers placed on a list for potential divestment for allegedly \u201cboycotting\u201d energy companies, and more recently launching a multi-state lawsuit against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, accusing the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate energy markets.\n\nIn the weeks following the election, each of the firms targeted by the new letter announced withdrawals from climate-focused investment and finance coalitions, including the Net-Zero Banking Association (NZBA) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative.\n\nWhile the letter states that the AGs \u201capplaud you for terminating your relationships\u201d with the NZBA, NZAM and climate-focused engagement network Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), the AGs added that \u201cwe still want answers\u201d to decisions made by the firms while they were members of the groups, and accused the firms of potential legal violations through their support for net zero-focused shareholder resolutions and engagement practices.\n\nThe letter added that statements made by some of the firms reiterating their net zero commitments after leaving the groups \u201craise serious concerns as to whether your exodus is an optics-only effort.\u201d\n\nThe letter also warns the firms of potential legal actions related to their DEI policies, including \u201cdiscriminatory employment quotas,\u201d such as BlackRock\u2019s use of DEI goals in employee performance reviews and bonus considerations, \u201cdiscriminatory board quotas,\u201d citing BlackRock\u2019s proxy voting guideline that encourages large companies to have boards with \u201cat least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group\u201d as an example, and \u201cdiscriminatory supplier quotas,\u201d such as Goldman Sachs\u2019 goal to \u201cspend a cumulative $1.5 billion with small and diverse vendors between 2023 and 2025.\u201d\n\nThe letter includes a series of questions for each firm regarding their ESG and DEI policies, requesting responses within 45 days as an \u201copportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,\u201d and to \u201cdemonstrate whether violations have occurred, whether they will continue, and the necessity of enforcement actions to vindicate federal or State laws.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released alongside the letter, Texas AG Paxton said:\n\n\u201cBanks and financial institutions are finally starting to realize that the ESG and DEI policies pushed by radical activist groups are bad for consumers and potentially violate the law. Unlawful race- and sex-based quotas and so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 schemes will not be allowed to stand and I will continue to urge these organizations to uphold the legal obligations they owe to consumers and investors. Any institution found to be violating the law will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nClick here to access the letter.",

Tesla's advancements in AI and supercomputing set it up to grow in applications such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and humanoid robots, said the firm.\n\nIncreasing demand for passive optical data to build digital twins of the physical world is central to the firm's analysis & is required for training foundational AI models. As AI applications emerge, there is an anticipated rush to acquire computing infrastructure for training and simulation globally with AI.\n\nThat's in addition to China's growing progress in embodied AI, according to Morgan Stanley, aided by government initiatives and mass production capabilities. It comes with a unique challenge to Tesla as China has been competing in its autonomous tech, which could affect Tesla's operations in this region.\n\nTesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle (EV) market, and the company said that the U.S.'s leadership in the autonomous sphere may rest on its acceptance of electric mobility. As geopolitical competition in the AI and robotics sectors intensifies and Tesla's valuation propels beyond EV cars, the future market valuation for Tesla could spread beyond EVs.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

A financial holding company, Morgan Stanley provides a full range of financial services to clients around the world.\n\nMorgan Stanley was formed in 1935 as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall separated commercial and investment banking in a way that forced the then-largest bank J.P. Morgan & Co to split into two groups. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to retain the commercial side of the business while partners Henry S. Morga, grandson of J.P., and Harold Stanley took the investment end. In its first year, Morgan Stanley did 24% of the IPO business and maintains a lion\u2019s share of the market to this day.\n\nThe original company existed and grew through acquisitions until 1987 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. The new Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co existed for 14 years until 2001 when the name was shortened back to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank is credited in part with both beginning and ending the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The Process Driven Trading unit lost $300 million in one day due to a short-squeeze that popped the bubble in the housing market. After teetering on the brink of failure Morgan Stanley agreed to become a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve, a key factor in the original decision to split from parent J.P. Morgan & Co. Ironically when given the chance, present-day J.P. Morgan refused to buy Morgan Stanley but that was for the better.\n\nToday, Morgan Stanley operates through three segments via offices in 41 countries and employs more than 75,000 people. Revenue in 2021 topped $49 billion and total assets topped $1.15 trillion.\n\nThe operating segments are Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management segments. The Institutional Securities segment is by far the largest and most profitable. It offers a range of services and products for businesses, institutions, and entities that include capital raising, strategic advisory, underwriting, advice on M&A, restructuring, and real estate. The Wealth Management segment provides brokerage and investment advisory services for individuals and employers. The services include brokerage, financial planning, company stock-plan administration, insurance, mortgage loans, lines of credit, and retirement planning. The Investment Management segment provides investment products to a range of institutions, organizations, corporations, and governments.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off.

Banks expect to get 90 to 95 cents on the dollar, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported preparations for the sale.\n\nMusk denied the journal report as \"false,\" posting on X that the newspaper was \"lying.\" The journal cited a January email to X staff in which Musk said finances remained problematic but pointed to the growing power and influence the company had. Musk said in his X post that he had \"sent no such email.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley and others, such as Bank of America and Barclays, lent Musk money to complete his $44 billion buyout of X, then known as Twitter, in 2022.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks typically sell such loans to investors soon after a deal is done, but lenders have faced difficulties in offloading the debt in the case of X.\n\nMusk's sweeping changes to the platform, including laying off many people who had worked to moderate content, and one of his posts on X, scared away advertisers and hit revenues. That reduced the value of the debt, as the risk of default increased.\n\nReuters reported in November that Musk's political ascendancy and proximity to President Donald Trump had banks pondering over the improved prospects of the social media platform, helping them in selling the debt without having to take a massive loss on the deal.\n\nAttempts to sell the debt in late 2022 attracted bids which would have seen banks taking as much as a 20% loss on the face value of the debt, sources said at the time.\n\nOther banks in the consortium that helped finance the deal include Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Mizuho and Societe Generale.",

Morgan Stanley said it is still committed to helping the world transition to net zero, according to Reuters, and that goal \"remains unchanged.\"\n\n\"We aim to contribute to real-economy decarbonization by providing our clients with the advice and capital required to transform business models and reduce carbon intensity,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nUnifying hundreds of global financial institutions to make positive changes for the good of the environment was a landmark achievement in the fight to lower harmful carbon pollution.\n\nBut recently, U.S. banks have faced pressure to align with politicians and play nice with the fossil fuel industry. This pressure is primarily coming from Republican politicians who receive a lot of financial backing from fossil fuel companies and in light of the new Donald Trump presidential term.\n\nOnly three U.S. banks appear to be left in the coalition: Amalgamated Bank, Areti Bank, and Climate First Bank.\n\nWhat's being done about it?\n\nMorgan Stanley still has climate targets and plans to hit them, according to its website: \"Climate change is one of the most complex issues of our time, presenting both risks and opportunities for commerce, government, and civil society. As a global financial services firm, Morgan Stanley has an important role to play in helping to direct capital toward low-carbon solutions and achieve real-economy decarbonization.\"\n\nBut without the oversight and accountability from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the bank's detailed climate statements and commitments could ring hollow. Too many major corporations have followed a similar playbook by setting lofty climate goals and eventually failing or abandoning them altogether.\n\nThis greenwashed approach taken by companies is a dangerous and irresponsible strategy that can harm the planet and, ultimately, their business.

A financial holding company, Morgan Stanley provides a full range of financial services to clients around the world.\n\nMorgan Stanley was formed in 1935 as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall separated commercial and investment banking in a way that forced the then-largest bank J.P. Morgan & Co to split into two groups. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to retain the commercial side of the business while partners Henry S. Morga, grandson of J.P., and Harold Stanley took the investment end. In its first year, Morgan Stanley did 24% of the IPO business and maintains a lion\u2019s share of the market to this day.\n\nThe original company existed and grew through acquisitions until 1987 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. The new Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co existed for 14 years until 2001 when the name was shortened back to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank is credited in part with both beginning and ending the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The Process Driven Trading unit lost $300 million in one day due to a short-squeeze that popped the bubble in the housing market. After teetering on the brink of failure Morgan Stanley agreed to become a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve, a key factor in the original decision to split from parent J.P. Morgan & Co. Ironically when given the chance, present-day J.P. Morgan refused to buy Morgan Stanley but that was for the better.\n\nToday, Morgan Stanley operates through three segments via offices in 41 countries and employs more than 75,000 people. Revenue in 2021 topped $49 billion and total assets topped $1.15 trillion.\n\nThe operating segments are Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management segments. The Institutional Securities segment is by far the largest and most profitable. It offers a range of services and products for businesses, institutions, and entities that include capital raising, strategic advisory, underwriting, advice on M&A, restructuring, and real estate. The Wealth Management segment provides brokerage and investment advisory services for individuals and employers. The services include brokerage, financial planning, company stock-plan administration, insurance, mortgage loans, lines of credit, and retirement planning. The Investment Management segment provides investment products to a range of institutions, organizations, corporations, and governments.",

Morgan Stanley bankers have reportedly reached out to investors ahead of a planned sale next week.Citing sources familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that the banks expect to recover 90 to 95 cents on the dollar.The publication initially disclosed details of the sale preparations.The report noted that to successfully sell the debt, bankers will need to persuade investors that the company\u2019s financial situation has stabilised. Musk\u2019s recent rise in influence and his alliance with President Trump appear to have shifted the narrative around X\u2019s prospects, it added.Investors have reportedly been approaching the banks, expressing interest in purchasing the company\u2019s debt due to a belief that its financial performance is improving, a source familiar with the matter told WSJ.Reportedly, in a January email to employees, Musk highlighted the company\u2019s increasing influence and power but acknowledged ongoing financial challenges.\u201cOur user growth is stagnant, revenue is unimpressive, and we\u2019re barely breaking even,\u201d he reportedly said in the email.However, Musk has denied the report, calling it \u201cfalse\u201d in a post on X, accusing the newspaper of \u201clying.\u201d\u201cThis report is false. I sent no such email. WSJ is lying,\u201d Musk said.Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Barclays were among the institutions that lent Musk funds to facilitate his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022.Typically, banks sell loans to investors shortly after a deal closes, however, offloading X-related debt has proven challenging. Musk's significant restructuring of the platform, which included widespread layoffs of moderation staff and controversial posts that alienated advertisers, resulted in declining revenues. This, in turn, diminished the debt\u2019s value due to heightened default risk.",

Morgan Stanley has notched a 17% gain.\n\nInvestors have a dinner plate to choose from to explain the bullishness.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) put forth a host of high-profile rules and saw yawning supervisory authority. Trump is expected to roll back a lot of that authority to free up the banks.\n\nMeanwhile, the pick-up in deal activity could help fuel the lucrative M&A departments of the big banks. Additionally, an increase in M&As could support broader market valuations and bank trading businesses.\n\nLastly, banks affected by the so-called Basel III endgame may be less so \u2014 paving the way for capital to be deployed to increase dividends and buy back shares.\n\nWhile the optimism has helped push up bank valuations, the sector itself had a bang-up fourth quarter, and CEOs at the major firms voiced optimism on the outlook for sales and profits.\n\nFourth quarter results for big banks like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), and Citi (C) were powered by bumper sales in investment banking and trading businesses.\n\nMorgan Stanley put up one of the strongest showings in its bread-and-butter businesses.\n\nInvestment banking and equity revenues surged 25% and 51%, respectively, year over year.

I'm Michelle Weaver, U.S. Thematic and Equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMichael Cyprys: I'm Mike Cyprys, Head of U.S. Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges Research.\n\nRyan Kenny: And I'm Ryan Kenney, U.S. Mid-Cap Advisors Analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMichelle Weaver: In this episode of our special miniseries covering Big Debates, we'll focus on the improving M&A and IPO landscape and whether retail investing can sustain in 2025.\n\nIt's Thursday, January 23rd at 10am in New York.\n\n2023 saw the lowest level of global M&A activity in at least 30 years. But we've started to see activity pick up in 2024. Mike, what have been the key drivers behind this resurgence, and where are we now?\n\nMichael Cyprys: Look, I think it's been a combination of factors in the context of a lot of pent-up activity and a growing urge to transact after a very subdued period of, you know, call it four- to six quarters of quite limited activity. Key drivers as we see it ranging from equity markets that have expanded across much of the world, low levels of equity volatility. broad financing, availability with meaningful issuance as you look across investment grade and high yield bond markets, tight credit spreads, interest rates stabilizing in [20]24, and then the Fed began to cut.\n\nSo, liquidity pretty robust, all of that helping reduce bid-ask spreads. In terms of where we are now, post election, think there's just a lot of excitement here around a new administration; where we could see some changes around the antitrust environment that can be helpful, as we think about unlocking greater M&A activity across sponsors as well as strategics, and helping improve corporate confidence.\n\nBut look, the recent rout of market could delay some of the transactional activity uplift. But we view that as more of a timing impact, and we are quite positive here in [20]25 as we think about scope for continued surge of activity.\n\nMichelle Weaver: We've seen rates rising pretty substantially since December. Does that throw a wrench into this at all, or do you think we see more stabilization there?\n\nMichael Cyprys: I think it could be a little bit of a slowdown, right? That would be the risk here, but as we think about the path for moving forward, I do think that there are a lot of factors that can be very helpful in terms of driving a continued pickup in activity, which we're going to talk about -- and why that will be the case.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Great. And you mentioned financial sponsors earlier, I want to drill down there a little more. What do you think would get sponsor activity to pick up more meaningfully?\n\nMichael Cyprys: Well, as I think about it, activity is already starting to pick up clearly across strategics as well as sponsors. On the sponsor side, it's been lagging a bit relative to strategics. We think both of which will build, and Ryan will get to that on the strategic side. As we think about the sponsors -- they're sitting with $4 trillion of capital to put to work that's been sitting on the sidelines where you just haven't seen as much activity over the past couple of years.\n\nOverall activity in [20]24 was probably call it maybe around 20 per cent below peak levels, and this is burning a hole in the pockets of both sponsors as well as their clients. And so, we see a growing urge to transact here, which gets to some of your earlier questions there too.\n\nSo why is that? Well, the return clock is ticking; the lack of deployment is hurting returns within funds. Some of this dry powder also expires by the end of [20]25; and so if it's not yet deployed, then sponsors won't get some of the performance fee economics that come through to them on that capital. So that's all, all on the deployment side.\n\nAs we think about the realization or exit side, we think that's probably going to lag, but we'd still expect, a steady build through this year. Today sponsors are sitting on call it around $10 trillion of portfolio of investments that are in the ground, and they haven't really provided much in the way of liquidity back to their customers, the LPs and the funds. And so, this is putting a little bit of a strain not only on the client relationships that want more money back from their private investments that haven't received it, but it's also one of the causes of what has been a little bit of a challenging fundraising backdrop across private equity funds.\n\nHence if sponsors can return more capital to their clients, that can be helpful in terms of healing the overall fundraising backdrop. So, look, putting all that together, we expect an expanding pace of transactional deal activity across the sponsors from both the buy side as well as the sell side in terms of our activity.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And Ryan, how about IPOs? Have they been part of a similar trend?\n\nRyan Kenny: Yes, definitely. So, with IPOs, we're also expecting a significant resurgence off of a low base. So just to put some numbers on it. In 2024, announced M&A volumes relative to nominal GDP, we're around 40 per cent below three-decade averages; equity capital markets [ECM] or ECM was even more muted, 50 per cent below three decade averages. And the leading indicators for ECM are very similar to the leading indicators for M&A. You want a strong equity market, relatively low volatility so that companies have the confidence to go public and so that deals can price well. And those conditions are really starting to materialize already in 2024; and we saw a few big IPOs price well last year, and launch well. The fourth quarter also looks strong. We saw a significant acceleration in industry ECM activity in October, November, December. 4Q volumes tracking up over 50 per cent year-over-year.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Let's dig a little deeper into potential policies from the incoming Trump administration. What are your expectations around antitrust regulation and its impact on M&A?\n\nRyan Kenny: So, Trump has announced his appointments to the FTC and to the DOJ antitrust division. And our expectation is a return to normal. And that's coming off of what was a more onerous and not-clear environment under Biden. The Biden administration's approach was to disincentivize M&A; and they did that by defining M&A market concentration in novel ways -- looking at things like labor markets, and looking at how competitiveness is defined in new ways. And these new ways of defining concentration decrease the clarity of whether a specific deal would be challenged.\n\nSo, from a CEO and board perspective, you don't want to waste the time of your management team and your board going through a deal that might not go through; in addition to the risk of prolonging the deal, and the risk of higher legal expenses during the process. So now that we're returning more towards normal, that's our expectation. We expect there will still be some deals like a challenge, but it will operate under more historical norms and so that really checks the box of getting CEO confidence up to transact more.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And I know that dynamic you\u2019re talking about with market concentration created quite a big drag on large M&A deals and large-cap M& A. Do you think we could start to see that come back as well?\n\nRyan Kenny: Yeah, expect large-cap deals to rebound even more than small-cap deals. When we started to see the activity pick up in 2024, it was led by more mid-cap corporates. And now we expect to see large deals return in force at a time when financial sponsors, like what Mike was just talking about, coming back in force at the same time -- which drives up the animal spirits when all parts of the M&A market are returning at the same time.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And what are some other catalysts beyond the political side that investors should watch in 2025 around capital markets developments?\n\nRyan Kenny: So, I categorize it as macro catalysts and structural catalysts The macro catalysts are clarity on tariff and immigration policies, how that will impact GDP. Clarity on the interest rate path. And look you don't need more rate cuts to get this market moving; you can still have a significant increase, even if there are no more rate cuts this year.\n\nBut narrowing the range of outcomes is important. And I think we're already there, where maybe we get no cuts this year. Maybe we get two cuts. It's a much tighter environment than where we were over the last few years. And so that helps narrow the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers.\n\nStructural catalysts that are really critical this cycle are the need for AI capabilities. Innovation in tech, innovation in biotech healthcare, the energy transition, reshoring and exploring your geographic footprint in a multipolar world -- are all really critical when you evaluate the types of companies that a board would want to acquire.\n\nMichelle Weaver: What\u2019s your outlook for 2025? And then even beyond that when it comes to both M&A and IPO activity?\n\nRyan Kenny: So, in 2025, we see a strong rebound in both ECM and M&A. ECM volumes in our base case, we expect to roughly double off of a low base. M&A announcements, we expect up over 50 per cent year-over-year in 2025. And importantly, that's our base case. Even in our bear case, we model an increase in both ECM and M& A volumes, given we're coming off of such low levels.\n\nWe've had three years of light activity and pent-up demand, and pipelines have already begun to build. When we look forward beyond 2025, we think this is the beginning of a multi-year capital markets growth cycle -- with bigger deal sizes and more deal count than average, driven by three years of pent-up demand and an economy that's a third larger than 2021, which was the last time we had a capital markets cycle.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And then Mike, what does this rebound in capital markets activity, including M&A and IPOs means specifically for retail investing?\n\nMichael Cyprys: Overall, a supportive macro backdrop with a rebound in capital markets activity, we think should be helpful in terms of bringing more investors into the markets, including retail investors. Whether it's from corporate actions and IPOs, it helps in terms of more stocks to trade; also helps in terms of revising animal spirits.\n\nI think that's all helpful in terms of supporting engagement across both single stock volumes and equity markets as well as options. So, all of that together, we were expecting greater investor engagement here in [20]25. And confidence as well can help boost not just trading volumes but also margin lending and securities lending. And so, all of that can be helpful as we think about our forecast for our retail brokerage coverage group.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Mike, Ryan, thank you for taking the time to talk.

All three are partnering with crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s negative stance also slowed down the adoption of tokenization, particularly with the SEC\u2019s accounting bulletin SAB 121 making it hard for banks to provide custody for cryptocurrencies or tokenized securities.

Ad Disclosure\n\nThe recent appointment of Ted Pick as CEO of Morgan Stanley has sparked fresh discussions in the finance sector on his openness to exploring crypto. The banking giant is giving serious thought to getting into the digital currency industry, which shows that traditional finance is starting to see digital assets differently.\n\nRegulatory Collaboration At The Core\n\nPick pointed out in a recent appearance to the World Economic Forum in Davos the bank\u2019s dedication to cooperation with US authorities. Any venture into cryptocurrency, he underlined, should be handled carefully and in line with current laws.\n\n\u201cFor us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors,\u201d Pick said during a CNBC interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin.\n\nMorgan Stanley has long cooperated with regulators, but in this case, it is the navigation of the labyrinthine rules of Bitcoin and digital assets that is being put under scrutiny. The bank is keen on balancing its desire for innovation with its reputation for a robust risk management system.\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO says bank will work with U.S. regulators on offering crypto My thoughts, I feel for those who still see crypto as Monopoly money. They still haven\u2019t grasped the transformative potential of WEB3 protocols in decentralized finance. It\u2019s not just about\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8GQ49mg3P6 \u2014 Angelica Salda\u00f1a S.T.B.\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 (@AngelofYHVH) January 23, 2025\n\nResponding To The Changing Financial Landscape\n\nPick\u2019s remarks underline how crucial digital resources are becoming for the global banking system. From specialized investments to mainstream financial tools, cryptocurrencies have evolved and major entities such as Morgan Stanley have to carefully study their approach.\n\nThe bank\u2019s investigation on digital currency products shows its will to stay competitive. To satisfy growing customer demand, several financial institutions are starting to include digital asset services. The arrival of Morgan Stanley into this market could open the path for more general acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the conventional banking theater.\n\nCaution Regarding Innovation\n\nEven with all that euphoria, Pick emphasized caution. As he put it, Morgan Stanley is in no hurry to wade into crypto without thinking carefully. The bank said that it will make sure whatever services it offers shall uphold and support the principles of reliability and trust which it has always upheld.\n\nThis conservative approach reflects the challenges traditional financial institutions face in dealing with an industry known for volatility and unpredictability of regulation. Additionally, it also reflects Morgan Stanley\u2019s desire to enter this world in a logical yet deliberate way.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Morgan Stanley And Cryptocurrency?\n\nThe financial industry is watching closely as Morgan Stanley explores its crypto strategy. While the bank has yet to announce specific offerings, its interest in the sector is a significant development.\n\nBy pledging to work with authorities and move cautiously, Morgan Stanley may have established a pattern for how conventional banks view cryptocurrencies.\n\nPick\u2019s statements reflect the start of a potential change for the time being as the institution gets ready to engage in the evolving financial scene while it remains dedicated to its customers.\n\nFeatured image from CNN, chart from TradingView",

Shalett also said she's cautious due to a \"radical valuation dispersion\" between the U.S. and the rest of the world's assets that creates a tough headwind for domestic markets. Shalett's view comes as the S & P 500 reached a new all-time high on Wednesday , its first since early December, as investors continue to ride a wave of optimism following Trump's inauguration. Since his election win in November, Wall Street has hoped that Trump's return would unleash looser regulations that would create a wave of deal making and aid financial sector profits. But Shalett's team views the S & P 500 as \"both excessively concentrated and expensive.\" She suggests that investors consider pairing investments in domestic stocks and bonds with equities outside of the U.S., specifically in Japan, Europe and emerging markets. Rather than an overconcentration in U.S. stocks, Shalett pointed to credit and spread products, energy infrastructure master limited partnerships (MLPs), residential real estate investment trusts, market-neutral and absolute-return hedge fund strategies and high dividend stocks as investment alternatives that could boost returns.",

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe majority of $25 and $1000 par preferred securities are \u201ccallable\u201d meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.\n\nSome $25 or $1000 par preferred securities are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional \u2018dividend paying\u2019 perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period \u2013 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. Investing in currency involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nREITs investing risks are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate: property value fluctuations, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions.\n\nMaster Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs carry interest rate risk and may underperform in a rising interest rate environment.\n\nCompanies paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Technology stocks may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk.

            "content": "Investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) backed the U.S.-based chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) after activist hedge fund Starboard Value acquired a stake last week. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded QRVO stock from Hold to Buy, raising the price target from $90 to $106. The new target indicates a potential upside of over 20% in the share price. Qorvo shares jumped 4% after the upgrade, taking their year-to-date gain to over 25%.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Starboard Stake\n\nMoore highlighted that the involvement of Starboard could signal a fresh trajectory for Qorvo\u2019s earnings recovery. He further emphasized that considering Starboard\u2019s successful history with semiconductor companies and its past involvement with Qorvo, there\u2019s potential to create substantial value through a strategic shift in the company\u2019s direction.\n\nIn a regulatory filing last week, Qorvo disclosed that Starboard holds 7.29 million shares, representing a 7.7% stake in the company.\n\nNotably, Starboard Value, led by Jeffrey Smith, is known for advocating change at companies like Pfizer (PFE), Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp (NWSA), and business software giant Salesforce (CRM).\n\nMorgan Stanley Predicts Earnings Growth\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts that Qorvo\u2019s EPS will reach $9.63 if the company focuses on its core radio frequency technology expertise, rather than pursuing its previous diversification strategy.\n\nMoore suggested that the company could also enhance its earnings by aligning its expenses in its core radio frequency business. Additionally, Moore believes there\u2019s potential for Qorvo to grow its revenue, however, his expectation of increased EPS is not based on overly optimistic assumptions about the company\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nMoore\u2019s Ranking on TipRanks\n\nMoore is a five-star-rated analyst on TipRanks, ranking 355 out of over 9,200 analysts. With a 57% success rate, he has delivered an average return of 13.4% per rating.\n\nTipRanks ranks financial experts by success rate, average return, and statistical significance, helping users monitor top analysts\u2019 performance on stocks to uncover new investment opportunities.\n\nIs Qorvo a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nAs per the consensus rating on TipRanks, QRVO stock has a Hold rating, supported by a total of 19 recommendations. It includes 15 Holds, two Buys, and two Sells. The Qorvo share forecast is $85.07, which is 3% below the current price level.\n\nSee more QRVO analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

A financial holding company, Morgan Stanley provides a full range of financial services to clients around the world.\n\nMorgan Stanley was formed in 1935 as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall separated commercial and investment banking in a way that forced the then-largest bank J.P. Morgan & Co to split into two groups. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to retain the commercial side of the business while partners Henry S. Morga, grandson of J.P., and Harold Stanley took the investment end. In its first year, Morgan Stanley did 24% of the IPO business and maintains a lion\u2019s share of the market to this day.\n\nThe original company existed and grew through acquisitions until 1987 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. The new Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co existed for 14 years until 2001 when the name was shortened back to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank is credited in part with both beginning and ending the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The Process Driven Trading unit lost $300 million in one day due to a short-squeeze that popped the bubble in the housing market. After teetering on the brink of failure Morgan Stanley agreed to become a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve, a key factor in the original decision to split from parent J.P. Morgan & Co. Ironically when given the chance, present-day J.P. Morgan refused to buy Morgan Stanley but that was for the better.\n\nToday, Morgan Stanley operates through three segments via offices in 41 countries and employs more than 75,000 people. Revenue in 2021 topped $49 billion and total assets topped $1.15 trillion.\n\nThe operating segments are Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management segments. The Institutional Securities segment is by far the largest and most profitable. It offers a range of services and products for businesses, institutions, and entities that include capital raising, strategic advisory, underwriting, advice on M&A, restructuring, and real estate. The Wealth Management segment provides brokerage and investment advisory services for individuals and employers. The services include brokerage, financial planning, company stock-plan administration, insurance, mortgage loans, lines of credit, and retirement planning. The Investment Management segment provides investment products to a range of institutions, organizations, corporations, and governments.",

            "content": "Seagate Technology (STX) stock edged higher Tuesday following its fiscal second quarter earning reports, tacking onto gains from the regular session. Seagate's December quarter sales and earnings exceeded expectations, though its March quarter sales forecast came in slightly lighter than projected.\n\nSeagate, the world's largest manufacturer of hard-disk drives, said that it earned an adjusted $2.03 per share on sales of $2.33 billion for the December-ended quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet projected the -based company would post adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share on sales of $2.32 billion.\n\nFor the same period a year earlier, Seagate posted adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share on sales of $1.56 billion.\n\nFor the current quarter, Seagate guided for sales of $2.10 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.70 at the midpoint of its given ranges. Prior to the company posting its results, analysts were projecting Seagate would earn $1.70 per share on sales of $2.19 billion for the March quarter, according to FactSet.\n\n\"Seagate ended calendar 2024 on a strong note as we grew revenue, gross margin and non-GAAP EPS successively in each quarter of the year,\" Seagate Chief Executive Dave Mosley said in a news release. \"Our results demonstrate structural improvements in the business and our focus on value capture in an improving demand environment, highlighted by decade-high gross margin performance exiting the December quarter.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Seagate stock rose more than 1% to 103 in after hours trading. Shares slipped by as much as 4% immediately following the report before bouncing back.\n\nSeagate Named Top Pick At Morgan Stanley\n\nMeanwhile, Seagate stock gained 3.7% in regular trading Tuesday. That was after Morgan Stanley analysts named Seagate their \"top pick\" among IT hardware stocks by analysts at Morgan Stanley, replacing Apple (AAPL).\n\nIn a client note published before Seagate's earnings results, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said he is taking a \"contrarian view\" in elevating Seagate to top pick. Shares of Seagate slumped nearly 20% in the final months of the 2024. The company gave lower-than-expected core profit guidance during its previous earnings report in October. Shares fell further in December after Seagate notified investors of a delay in ramping up production.\n\n\"We have gained more comfort in (the) HDD (hard-disk drive) cycle persisting, which alongside transitory near-term supply issues, can create a June quarter revenue snapback,\" Woodring wrote. Wall Street estimates for Seagate's gross margin are also \"too conservative\" in Morgan Stanley's view, the note added.\n\nWoodring also reiterated a positive overweight rating but lowered his price target for STX stock to 129, from 133, to account for changes in the analyst's financial model for Seagate. His overall thesis is that the company will benefit from \"accelerating data growth, which drives storage demand in the cloud and on-premise.\"\n\nThat upside was enough to push Apple aside as the analyst's top pick.\n\n\"We want to be clear that we are still overweight (on) Apple with an unchanged $273 price target, and remain believers in our thesis for an accelerating device replacement cycle, structurally stronger gross margins, and consistent services growth,\" Woodring wrote. \"However, we believe that the prospects for STX outperformance over the next 3-6 months are higher than for AAPL (along with greater upside to our STX price target), even after Apple's recent underperformance, which is why we now make STX our Top Pick within our IT Hardware coverage.\"\n\nSeagate Stock In Consolidation Pattern\n\nEven with the late slump, 2024 contributed to a rebound for Seagate stock after a deep slump. The stock struggled in 2022 and for the first half of 2023, amid a hard drive supply glut and slowing demand from PC makers.\n\nDemand from data centers and excitement about AI helped the stock rally back to double its value from a low-point at the end of 2022.\n\nSeagate stock is trading within a consolidation pattern with a buy point of 115.32, according to MarketSurge. The potential entry represents a three-year-high that Seagate stock reached on Oct. 15.\n\nSeagate's recent slump has dragged down its IBD Composite Rating to 65 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nWhile Seagate's earnings rebound give it an EPS Rating of 81 out of 99, its slump late last year has dragged down its Relative Strength rating. Seagate's Relative Strength Rating is 46 out of 99. The RS Rating means that Seagate has outperformed 46% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nThe order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will \"accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy\u201d.\n\nAccording to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an \"appropriate share\" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States\u201d.\n\nSeveral known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector.\n\n\u201cSo what you get with the Biden administration today is \u2014 at least from a signaling perspective \u2014 on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward\u201d.\n\nAccording to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses \u2014 national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy.\n\nAI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the \u201cEconomic Blueprint\u201d, it said that \"Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI\" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage.",

            "content": "The board of Morgan Stanley ( ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.925 per share on the 14th of February. This takes the annual payment to 2.7% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Based on the last payment, Morgan Stanley's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 27.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 43% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nMorgan Stanley Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.20 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.70. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 34% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Morgan Stanley has been growing its earnings per share at 8.6% a year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.\n\nOur Thoughts On Morgan Stanley's Dividend\n\nOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Morgan Stanley will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

First, we would like to acknowledge our colleagues, clients, shareholders, friends, and family in Los Angeles. Our hearts go out to all those impacted and dealing with the horrific devastation from the wildfires. We\u2019re grateful to all the firefighters and first responders, we are thinking of you. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve been faced with two central themes. One, the end of financial repression, namely the passing of the era of ultra-low interest rates and the reemergence of inflation. And two, the end of the end of history with the resumption of geopolitical uncertainty. These paradigm shifts juxtaposed against renewed investor and corporate confidence, present opportunities to support clients with exceptional advice and market access.\n\nMorgan Stanley is well positioned to execute against these opportunities. The firm\u2019s consistent execution is demonstrated by the cadence of top-line and bottom-line in 2024. Revenues across the four quarters of $15.1 billion, $15.0 billion, $15.4 billion, and $16.2 billion, and earnings per share of $2.02, $1.82, $1.88 and $2.22. The fourth quarter was a top-line record with the highest earnings per share in over 15 years, capping-off one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s strongest years. For the full year, the firm delivered a return on tangible of 19% and earnings per share of $7.95, making significant progress toward our long-term goals. The results reflect consistent durable earnings across the firm, evidencing that Morgan Stanley can deliver during this period of continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nAs we do every January, let\u2019s begin with our 2025 strategic update entitled Four Pillars of Morgan Stanley: The Integrated Firm. The slides can be found on our website. On Slide 3, we introduce the four pillars of Morgan Stanley to support our integrated firm, strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth. Strategy is about consistently serving our clients and raising, managing, and allocating capital. Culture is about rigor, humility, and partnership. Financial strength is about strong capital and liquidity alongside durable earnings and growth is about smart strategic investments across the firm, which generate new opportunities to capture client share. The investment thesis for Morgan Stanley rests on our ability to deliver the integrated firm supported by these four pillars.\n\nSlide 4. First, to reiterate, Morgan Stanley\u2019s clear strategy to raise, manage, and allocate capital for corporations, individuals, asset managers, and asset owners around the world. In the past year, our engagement advice across the full range of institutional and individual clients drove results. Slide 5. Morgan Stanley culture is defined by rigor, humility, and partnership. The leadership group on the operating and management committees have an average tenure at the firm of more than 20 years, many of them across business segments and regions. More broadly, our leadership body of 2,312 Managing Directors, 173 of whom we recently promoted to the partnership have been with Morgan Stanley for an average of 15 years. 30% of our Managing Directors have been at the firm for two decades.\n\nOur partnership is defined by Morgan Stanley leaders who embody this homegrown culture, joined by acquisition and lateral talent who bring an incremental skill set to the platform. Morgan Stanley\u2019s culture of first-class business in a first-class way forged over many years of trial and success is a competitive advantage and will contribute to the success of the integrated firm. Slide 6 highlights our position of financial strength, the third pillar of the integrated firm, and is the output of a clearly defined strategy and a tightly knit culture. Our consistently strong capital position over recent years is a standout. In 2024, we accreted over $5.5 billion of CET1, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We will continue to prudently grow the dividend, continue to invest in each of our three businesses and across our infrastructure, and continue to opportunistically repurchase the stock.\n\nIn 2024, we effectively deployed capital to support clients and translated that into earnings growth. High capital levels protect us in challenging climates and sustain us for long-term growth. Slide 7 brings us to the fourth pillar of the strategy, revenue and earnings growth. Earnings expansion in 2024 reflects a return on multiyear investment to support clients. We will continue to invest heavily across the firm, in our talent, our clients, in e-trade and in parametric, in our bank, across resiliency in technology and infrastructure, and in the development of the integrated firm. In the past year, expense growth was tempered by our focus on rolling off initial integration spend and taking opportunities to consolidate our real estate footprint.\n\nInvestments for growth will continue to be supported by ongoing disciplined prioritization of our expense base. Slide 8. The last six years shows step function change in the firm\u2019s growth across our businesses. In the Wealth and Investment Management segments, combined revenues have grown from $20 billion to $34 billion and total client assets have nearly tripled to $7.9 trillion. This growth has been achieved both by way of acquisition and through organic execution. You will also note that institutional securities wallet share has grown by nearly a 100 basis points. These results reflect not only constructive markets, but also a sharpened focus on key client relationships and an expanded coverage of corporates and asset managers. Morgan Stanley scale positions us over the long-term to deliver growth in each of our three business segments.\n\nWe win both through an expanding denominator of global securities, banking, wealth, and investment management activity and by increasing our numerator as in our wallet share in each segment. In short, we seek to gain durable share in the secular growth businesses in which we participate. Slide 9, goes a level deeper into institutional securities. First, the growth in institutional securities has been both broad based and crucially is global. It is important that we are relevant in all the major regions around the world. Amidst geopolitical and interest rate uncertainty, each region grew revenues by roughly 20% in 2024. These results follow multiple years of investment in talent and leadership, as well as efficient and disciplined RWA growth.\n\nIn 2024, we saw institutional securities deliver an operating margin of 31% and revenue growth that was significantly higher than our RWA growth. We are in a leadership position and can offer trusted advice and market access into the investment banking new issue and M&A cycle, which just lies ahead. Slide 10. In Wealth Management, investments in our self-directed and workplace channels drive our differentiated client acquisition funnel. Today, with our expanded offering, we reach over 19 million relationships and have added net new assets of over $250 billion in each of the past two years on track to delivering $10 trillion plus of total client assets. An important indicator of Wealth Management momentum is fee-based flows, which reached an exceptional $123 billion in 2024.\n\nDelivering on new relationships and net new asset growth creates opportunities for our team of world class financial advisors to tap into the integrated firm for their clients. Slide 11 highlights the breadth and tenure of wealth management\u2019s client relationships as 60% of advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have an average duration of 20 years. We retain 99% of our clients reflecting their enduring trust in Morgan Stanley. The slide illustrates our multichannel model, which continues to drive new assets to the platform. 30% of our advisor-led assets are associated with clients who have a Morgan Stanley relationship of less than 10 years and 10% of advisor-led assets are with clients of less than two years. The client acquisition funnel supports durable growth, namely as clients mature with our financial advisors, they become the foundation for the continued growth of recurring fee-based revenues.\n\nSlide 12. In Investment Management, we continue to focus on the secular growth areas of customization and alternatives. Our industry leading parametric platform, inclusive of overlay has grown to $575 billion. In alternatives, our investable assets have more than doubled in size to $240 billion. Investments in these secular growth areas have brought more balance to our investment management business and supported fee-based revenues. Additionally, the integrated firm, particularly the relationship with wealth management continues to benefit the investment management platform with the enhancement of retail oriented distribution offerings and additional product capabilities. Slide 13. An area of investment is in the incremental growth of our U.S. banks.\n\nSince 2018, the firm has significantly grown deposit balances and continues to source deposits from wealth management clients with an expanded product offering. On the asset side, we will continue to grow our wealth management lending capability by covering clients holistically as their financial needs evolve. In addition, we will continue to utilize the bank platform to support growth in eligible institutional businesses. As we continue to grow our capabilities across the integrated firm, we are well-positioned to provide a full suite of solutions to our clients. Slide 14. A dividend that is aligned to the growth of fee-based earnings has been a leading priority. Our durable results demonstrate consistent execution of our strategy, and we have raised our quarterly dividend by $0.075 for three years in a row to $0.925 per share.\n\nSlide 15. As you\u2019ve heard us discuss during the past year, the integrated firm brings together our world class wealth and investment management franchises with our world class institutional securities franchise. We are consistently strengthening the pillars underlying the integrated firm to deliver on our strategic goals. Across the integrated firm, Morgan Stanley is relevant to our clients, spanning from the advice dispensed and corporate boardrooms to our financial wellness programs for that company\u2019s employees. We are also the premier holistic partner to asset managers partnering with them to grow their businesses and to generate alpha. We can deliver institutional capabilities to our clients alongside sophisticated wealth management advice and distribution in an integrated service model.\n\nAnd in so doing, be mindful of potential conflicts. To open 2025, we have formalized the integrated firm by positioning leadership talent at the center of client coverage, integrated data, risk management, and infrastructure to drive growth as we serve more clients across their full suite of needs. This effort will be led by Mandell Crawley, a three decade Morgan Stanley executive and a member of our operating committee. Together with Co-Presidents Dan Simkowitz and Andy Saperstein, the integrated firm organization is aligned to scale client opportunities across Morgan Stanley. Slide 16. The Morgan Stanley investment thesis is robust. In 2024, we deliver top-line and bottom-line strength and consistency. The full year results are strong relative to our long-term firmwide goals.\n\nWe ended 2024 with total client assets at $7.9 trillion, wealth management pre-tax margins of 27%, a firm efficiency ratio of 71%, and a return on tangible of 19%. Of note, we added a new goal to achieve durable wallet share gains in institutional securities. The additional metric for institutional securities is an appropriate reflection of the expected contribution of this business segment to the firm\u2019s growth narrative. The key word is durable. There will always be market and business cycles in each of these businesses. Morgan Stanley\u2019s trusted relationships over the very long-term lead to superior results. Against the four pillars of strategy, culture, financial strength, and growth, delivering the integrated firm is foundational to durable earnings growth and 20% returns through the cycle.\n\nThank you. Now Sharon, will review our fourth quarter and annual results, then together we will take your questions.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $61.8 billion in 2024 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $16.2 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 18.8%, and EPS was $7.95. For the fourth quarter, ROTCE was 20.2%, and EPS was $2.22. The full year efficiency ratio was 71.1%. Improved efficiency not only demonstrates our ability to grow revenues, but also to prioritize our controllable spend. Occupancy and equipment costs held flat, benefiting from the prior year\u2019s consolidation of our real estate footprint. During 2024, we took real estate charges of $62 million, which impacted full year EPS by $0.03. Professional services declined year-over-year, aided by the roll off of integration related expenses and discipline across project spend.\n\nThese savings helped self-fund investments across infrastructure to support growth such as expanding data center capacity, renovations, and technology modernization efforts. Self-funding investments remains a priority. In the short run, similarly sized additional modernization efforts focused on decommissioning legacy technologies may result in higher amortization costs. This alongside business enabled innovation and process optimization with AI should support the firm\u2019s future efficiency path. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities delivered very strong annual results across business and regions, demonstrating the high quality breadth and depth of our world class global franchise. Full year revenues of $28.1 billion included our highest reported equity revenues and the highest results across combined equity and fixed income markets.\n\nThe strong annual performance showcases our global footprint and our ability to capture client share amidst an increasingly constructive backdrop. Fourth quarter revenues were $7.3 billion as markets remained active, bucking the typical seasonal slowdown. We supported clients throughout the quarter and ended the year with momentum. Investment banking revenues were $6.2 billion for the full year, reflecting growth across regions and products. 2024 commenced with strong debt underwriting activity, followed by M&A announcements that picked up in the second half, and ended with increased equity underwriting activity as the IPO market posted its highest volumes since 2021. Fourth quarter investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. Results were largely driven by accelerating strength in equity underwriting as follow-on and IPO issuance saw meaningful improvements across \u2014 over the comparison period.\n\nWe also saw corporates and sponsors take advantage of constructive markets in the quarter. Advisory revenues improved year-over-year on higher completed M&A transactions. Looking ahead to 2025, our M&A pipelines are healthy and diversified, outpacing recent years. Financial sponsors are joining corporates to drive activity, evaluating exit opportunities for long held assets. CEO and boardroom confidence continues to improve as valuations stabilize and financing markets remain strong. Our business is well positioned for a strong continued rebound in deal making activity. Turning to equity. We continue to be a global leader in this business, evidenced by record full year revenues of $12.2 billion. These results reflect year-over-year growth across regions with record performance out of Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a global footprint.\n\nFull year results were supported by increased prime brokerage balances and our agility as we navigated the market well. Revenues were $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Following the U.S. elections, clients re-risk quickly, given shifting market dynamics. Additionally, third quarter strength in Asia carried into the fourth quarter with renewed investor interest across the region. Prime brokerage revenues were a record for the business as clients remained engaged and balances rose to peak levels. Cash results increased year-over-year, consistent with higher levels of client engagement and volumes. Derivative results increased versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter on the back of higher activity across a variety of products, in line with improved risk appetite from clients.\n\nFixed income revenues were $8.4 billion for the full year, driven by consistent quarterly performance across the businesses. The full year results demonstrate our multiyear efforts to recenter our fixed income business around the integrated firm, improved trading performance, growth in durable lending revenues, and servicing corporate and sponsor relationships all contributed to results. Quarterly revenues were $1.9 billion, driven by credit products and commodities. Micro revenues were above historical quarterly averages. Results were driven by securitized products, which benefited from higher loan balances and an increase in securitization activity. Macro performance was relatively flat versus the prior fourth quarter. Commodity revenues improved year-over-year.\n\nResults were led by our North America power and gas business, where structured opportunities for corporate clients leveraged the integrated firm. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. For the full year, ISG provisions were $202 million and $78 million for the quarter. The quarterly provision was driven by portfolio growth and a build in a handful of individual assessments. For the full year, ISG net charge-offs were $210 million. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $62 million, primarily related to several commercial real estate loans, which were largely provisioned for in prior quarters. Turning to Wealth Management. 2024 was a strong year for wealth management. Full year highlights include records, revenues of $28.4 billion, pre-tax profit of $7.7 billion, and a reported margin of 27.2%.\n\nThe strength of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel continues to set us apart. Fee-based flows were $123 billion, exceeding $100 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Clients continue to seek Morgan Stanley\u2019s advice, supporting our thesis that as assets move through the funnel, incremental revenue growth and margin expansion will follow. For the fourth quarter, revenues were $7.5 billion and the reported PBT margin was 27.5%. DCP and real estate related charges negatively impacted the quarterly margin by approximately 140 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter set a new record of $4.4 billion, showcasing the progress we have made to durable fee-based revenues. With each quarter this year, asset management revenues saw sequential improvement, powered by constructive markets and consistently strong fee-based flows.\n\nFourth quarter fee-based flows were $35 billion. Importantly, over the last two years, we have seen an increase in the number and the pace of assets migrating from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. We remain an industry leader in organic growth. Net new assets for the quarter were $57 billion. Full year NNA of $252 billion represents approximately 5% annual growth of beginning period assets. This year, our advisor-led channel drove the results, benefiting from both existing clients and new clients coming to the firm. Transactional revenues for the quarter were $1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues represent the highest level of activity we have seen since the peak in 2021. Higher retail engagement in equity-related products and demand for alternative products supported results.\n\nThese revenues will continue to benefit from the breadth and the depth of our growing alternatives platform. Bank lending balances were $160 billion. Loan growth of $4 billion was driven by securities based lending, where we saw demand for new lines and a decline in the pace of paydowns. Total deposits increased 3% sequentially to $370 billion, driven by higher sweep balances. End-of-period sweep deposits have increased for two consecutive quarters, supporting the view that as rate dynamics change and markets turn to be more constructive, sweep balances will be increasingly transactional in nature. While clients deployed more sweep cash in the rising markets, particularly in December, balances held strong as clients showed less rate sensitivity with their transactional cash.\n\nNet interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher sweeps. Looking ahead into 2025, the combination of a more stable deposit mix, higher lending balances, and the rate outlook suggests that first quarter NII should not fluctuate materially from our fourth quarter results. We are intently focused on driving additional growth across channels. In our advisor-led channel, our effectiveness in deepening relationships is evidenced by our consistently strong fee-based flows. In Workplace, our recently announced partnership with Carta, puts us at the center of new client stock plan opportunities as private companies consider going public. And in self-directed, the number of active traders on the E*TRADE platform grew, ending the year at levels higher than 2022.\n\nMoving to Investment Management. The business reported annual revenues of $5.9 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.6 billion. Our AUM reached a new peak at year-end of $1.7 trillion, supported by market gains and net inflows. Long-term net inflows were $4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by continued demand for our fixed income strategies and parametric customized portfolios. This brings 2024 long-term net inflows to $18 billion. Within Alternatives and Solutions, Parametric remains a key differentiator for MSIM. Growth of the brand will be supported by investments in technology, ongoing education for retail clients on the benefits of customization, and tailored solutions for asset managers. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $67 billion on the back of strong fund performance and seasonality, some of which may reverse in the first quarter.\n\nFourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.6 billion increased 11% versus the prior year, driven by higher average AUM. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase sequentially. Quarterly performance based income and other revenues were $88 million. Gains were concentrated in infrastructure, U.S. private equity, and private credit. In parallel with Wealth Management MSIM is helping to deliver our asset-led strategy. Our efforts to build a business that is well diversified and focused on secular growth areas, as well as global opportunities gives us confidence to drive incremental growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion.\n\nOver the course of 2024, we demonstrated velocity of resources. Standardized RWAs declined sequentially to $473 billion, driven by year-end seasonality and market dynamics. Lower RWAs at period end have already begun to reverse as we enter a new calendar year. During the year, we accreted over $5.5 billion of common equity Tier 1 capital and our standardized CET1 ratio ended the year at 15.9%. For the full year, we bought back $3.3 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. The quarterly tax rate was 24.1%, reflecting the level and the mix of earnings. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be approximately 24%, and consistent with prior years we expect some quarterly volatility. As we look ahead into 2025, our franchise is well positioned for growth, exiting the year with momentum across all of our businesses with a strong capital position to invest in our clients and our businesses.\n\nWe enter the year with record asset levels, healthy and diversified pipelines, an engaged and institutional retail client base, and a strong global brand. We are focused on disciplined execution as we progress towards our goals. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Follow Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services.

[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\n\nGlenn Schorr: Hey, thanks very much.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Glenn. How are you doing? Glenn, how are you?\n\nGlenn Schorr: All right. Appreciate it. Where to begin \u2014 I guess, let\u2019s talk about trade. There is a lot of upside in trading. We\u2019ve all seen great trading environments and this certainly was a good one. But I wonder if you could just try to parse out, how you think about great trading environment versus what your words are, just more durable the higher client balances, the record PB, the share gains, and how are you going to measure the success of those durable gains? I\u2019m just trying to separate your actions versus the environment. You\u2019ve certainly been performing really well. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick: I appreciate that. The focus on institutional securities over the last number of years is of course to deliver to key clients, the whole product set across what \u2014 as you know, we called at one point about five, six years ago, I think it was in 2018, the integrated investment bank. And that was the bringing together of folks in equities, fixed-income, capital markets, and investment banking, minding obviously all the walls between them, but having folks mobilize across those divisions, across the regions and really understand what life is like to sit in the shoes of folks in different divisions. And as you know in this business, you don\u2019t actually know what that feels like unless you\u2019re in that business, so we had leaders moving around.\n\nAnd six years later now with ISG under Dan Simkowitz\u2019s leadership, we\u2019re able to \u2014 in an environment that is friendly to a lot of the businesses because now we have a real corporate finance activity. We have real interest rates and you have effectively two way markets in lots of places around the world with respect to central bank activity, with respect to buyers and sellers of assets. And of course, if you\u2019re well organized, you can prosecute that in an orthodoxical way. We have during this period under leadership of Sharon in the office of CFO been quite prudent on the deployment of those risk weighted assets through our Chief Risk Officer, Charles Smith, how do those risk weighted assets and GAAP balance sheet get deployed to clients?\n\nOne mistake, Glenn, is you can lose the forest of the trees and not think about all the client touchpoints across the integrated firm, we\u2019re calling it or you can actually lose sight of the real drivers of what makes that client valuable to the institution. And now we\u2019ve had six, seven years of really focusing on that and preparing ourselves for the ability to expand our wallet at a time where we believe the denominator is growing as well. It\u2019s a little trickier to try to expand the numerator, your wallet when the denominator is not moving as was the case with zero interest rates because you are effectively not a price maker and you are potentially going to be taking some concentrated risk. But here now with the cycle having transitioned, we were able to lean in first across our sweet spot, which is equities to have not just prime brokerage, but the cash equities and derivatives businesses really start to generate above cost of capital ROEs. So the entire basket of equities offering to our clients, but then in fixed income, which has been extraordinarily stable in what is intrinsically an unstable business given the very different businesses of commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and credit.\n\nOn the leadership there Hallik and Horder have done a brilliant job, really running a durable business with a lot of annuitized revenue around well considered financing, structuring, lending businesses that look quite like the businesses we have in classic underwriting such that when we now go into this investment banking cycle where we do think there is going to be an acceleration of classic primary and secondary offerings we\u2019re already doing business that looks like that inside of sales and trading, our lending businesses, client advice, and of course, there is real collegiality across the investment bank. The last piece of this is what we\u2019ve been waiting for, which are M&A tickets, which as you know are the top of the waterfall, the highest margin product that then have multiplier effect through the whole organization and that has begun.\n\nThe pipeline is very strong, depending on how you measure it, the strongest it\u2019s been in five years to 10 years, maybe even longer, and we are excited about pushing that through to the rest of the investment bank. What I\u2019ve said and I would repeat here too, just to give a lengthy answer, Glenn, is that on ISG wallet share, we are clear that we want those share gains to be durable, which is why we didn\u2019t go with quantification. We want those gains to be ones that are not gains by reaching concentration risk, counterparty risk, but the clients know we are serious about bringing ISG to the fore and that the integrated firm now is bringing together these world class wealth and investment management businesses with our investment bank. And the proof is in the pudding, this past year 100 basis point gain, plus or minus in the investment bank to roughly a 15% wallet in a growing denominator.\n\nAnd as you can tell, given we\u2019ve been quite disciplined on RWA growth against that and you see the operating leverage in the income statement, it\u2019s fair to say the institution at large is very exciting.\n\nGlenn Schorr: That was a very full answer. I really appreciate it. I\u2019ll cede my follow-up to the group. Thanks.\n\nTed Pick: Thanks, Glenn.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Ebrahim.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess, maybe just \u2014 I know this is \u2014 you\u2019ve addressed this in prior calls, but as we think about just investments in systems as it pertains to AML, BSA on the wealth management side. If you don\u2019t mind addressing where the firm stands there today in terms of sort of meeting all the highest standards from a regulatory compliance standpoint. And I think the essence of my question is, as we think about the growth opportunity in terms of international wealth, do you need to sort of get your ducks lined up on the AML, BSA front in order to pursue those more aggressively or actively? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you for the question. I think that the, the way I would answer your question is more fulsome than just specifically looking at one particular sector. The point that I would underscore is the results themselves in this business speak for themselves. In terms of the investment, the ability to attract clients, both existing assets as well as new clients across the wealth management platform. So that\u2019s the first point that I would make. Second point that I would make is that over the course of the \u2014 not just the last year, but really multiple years, we\u2019ve been investing in all of our processes and our systems in order to engage and make sure that we have a robust infrastructure in order to be allowed to grow broadly and meet all of our growth objectives.\n\nAnd that has to do with everything that I mentioned across the technology side, across better understanding our data, better servicing our clients in terms of investment dollars and in terms of the underlying infrastructure. So what we\u2019re trying to do and what we\u2019ve been actively pursuing is making sure that across the firm, not just specific to wealth, we can service and look and impact all of our clients. And moreover, you can see that very well in terms of our ability to actually continue to attract assets, we\u2019ll be making all of the necessarily investments to continue to be world class, both across people and our technology.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you. And I guess, a separate question, Slide 13 with regards to the investment into the bank. Just remind us in terms of the \u2014 where we stand in terms of the integration of the bank. And as we think about \u2014 with some of your peers where the bank and the wealth businesses probably are fully integrated, are we there yet? And then, what\u2019s the opportunity when you think about just deposit growth from your wealth management clients that you can bring onboard?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: We\u2019re definitely not there yet. We still have a lot of \u2014 to do when we think about the bank. I\u2019ve always, both internally and for those \u2014 for many externally have felt that the bank itself is an incredible growth engine across the institution. If you look at our bank, we obviously started our bank much later than many of the peers that we now compete with from a commercial bank perspective. We have a very different deposit mix than others. And what\u2019s so interesting our deposit mix is that over 70% of our deposits come from our wealth management clients. Now there is \u2014 that\u2019s currently, as you know, is largely coming from sweeps and for savings accounts. There is much more that we can do when we think about the deposit franchise itself, and then we can talk a little bit also about the other side of the balance sheet.\n\nBut we\u2019re investing in those deposit opportunities. Remember, we didn\u2019t really have bank rails until we bought E*TRADE. That was part of the value proposition of acquiring E*TRADE and working with those bank rails to offer real checking accounts and continue to have a savings account offering. Moreover, as you think about the work we\u2019re doing to invest the banking products within Workplace, you now have different ways to manage cash and cash alternatives for the actual underlying employees, as Ted talked about from an integrated firm perspective. So there is much more that we can do with servicing and growing that deposit base over time. As you think about the lending side and you think about where we are, we continue to see opportunities to help our wealth clients as they expand their lending needs and we better understand their portfolios.\n\nMoreover, just holistically, as Ted mentioned in the slide, there are places where we are still working to move eligible ISG assets onto the bank. That should help institutional securities as you think about the actual funding profile associated with those assets. So there are many places that when you look overall at the integrated firm, the bank plays an important role in making sure we have the ability to see that grow.\n\nTed Pick: Yeah, Ebrahim. I\u2019ll tag on to that. Deposit side, we\u2019re going to service clients across all three channels in wealth, the FA channel, the everyday transaction offering of cash plus type of offering in E*TRADE. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on checking accounts with competitive rates, integrating products into the client journey as they move along with E*TRADE to potentially a classic FA. And then as you know, we\u2019ve been really banging the drum on workplace where we can partner with companies to reach employees. And on the loan side, as Sharon said, we\u2019ve been growing loans steadily. The loans number in wealth, as you know, was about $80 million in the fourth quarter of \u201918, that\u2019s doubled to $160 million. We grew that every quarter in \u201924.\n\nWe\u2019re a bank. We lend and we have to do that in the context of deepening relationships. We lend to about 16% of our households and the best-in-class peers are higher. They\u2019re 50% higher, mid-20s. So there\u2019s \u2014 as Sharon has said, there is real opportunity. And then in ISG, where we\u2019ve been growing the lending capability there too, up about 15% year-over-year. So there is real focus on this and upside. But there is also been, I think back to the concept of owning Morgan Stanley as a durable instrument that we are growing both deposits and loans in a smart way over the next five years, 10 years, you can expect these numbers to continue to move higher.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Brennan.\n\nBrennan Hawken: Hey, Ted. Good morning. How are you?\n\nTed Pick: Good.\n\nBrennan Hawken: Would love to follow up on that \u2014 some of that last discussion and talk about the loan growth because it seems like loan growth was \u2014 the trends were better than certainly many were expecting last year. And it feels like given the expectation for capital markets reopening, improving risk appetites, we should continue to see that building momentum. Could you talk a little bit below the surface around what you\u2019re seeing on the loan side? You spoke to it at a really high level before, but I\u2019d just love to drill down and hear what you\u2019re seeing more recently. And then where do you stand from a capability perspective, do you guys need to continue to build that out or do you feel like you\u2019re fully ramped from a competitive perspective?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Thanks, Brennan. I\u2019ll take that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as you alluded to, what we saw, if you remember over the last \u2014 since really interest rates when they began to rise, we saw a decline in the use of the SBL product. And we often actually saw an increase in paydowns. What\u2019s changed over the last \u2013 particularly, we noted it this quarter is, we\u2019ve seen that pace of paydowns decline and then, we\u2019ve actually seen an increased use of the lines. The important part there is, as you know probably better than anyone else is that, that product is one that is often generally used in periods of time by our clients when you actually see markets rise. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we also begin to see it from a tax perspective as we enter the second part of the quarter.\n\nIn terms of capabilities, excuse me, \u2014 in terms of capabilities, I think we have the capabilities, there is clearly places you can still look from a tailored perspective. There is still capabilities when you think about the assets that we can move from an eligible perspective from the ISG side onto the bank. So it\u2019s a different portion of the question in terms of what we\u2019re doing from a legal entity perspective. But overall, I think we\u2019re very happy with what we have from the wealth management perspective and it\u2019s really about seeing the change in environment that should help the dynamics as we move forward to see that increase in loan growth.\n\nTed Pick: And I think integrated firm matters here because there is the ability for us now in our risk committee sessions to look at tailored lending as a form of sophisticated structured product that has some institutional qualities to it. So it\u2019s not so much the classic bifurcation of division-by-division, but more of a firm lens across what the commitments are at a time when we should see acceleration in both of the major sides of the house.\n\nBrennan Hawken: That\u2019s interesting when thinking about utilizing the balance sheet. Thanks for that. I\u2019m really sort of happy to ask this next question because of the focus on cash in the past year or so, and now I don\u2019t have to worry about drawing Sharon\u2019s ire when I ask about that. It seems like we\u2019re likely to have a pivot like, around cash trends. Like, we\u2019ve got stability and even a little growth in the sweep. And when you think about prior easing cycles, what has \u2014 how long has it taken before we see some of the recycling out of those yield oriented cash equivalents like CDs and money funds, which tend to be thinner margin into more market-oriented products that are higher margin? How should we be thinking about that timeline? Thanks.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Brennan, it might be the first time in two years that I\u2019m excited to answer a sweeps question. I am really encouraged by the signs that we see on the underlying sweep dynamic. It often actually plays to the fact that there is a lot that our clients can do and a lot that our clients are interested in right now. You see that in the transactional level of activity and all of the underlying trends as it relates to sweeps are actually playing out in that increase in transactional. So if I can just break it down, what we see, right, we look at sweeps and we look at the underlying sweeps in multiple different layers. So how do you think about where the sweeps are going to products that are under one year? How do you look at sweeps in terms of products over one year in terms of fixed income and how do you look at sweeps going in and out of market?\n\nWhat you saw this particular quarter, which I found to be quite encouraging and fascinating in terms of the sentiment of the retail investor actually changing is that we saw a really strong increase of the flows moving from sweeps into market. So it\u2019s not as though they aren\u2019t using that cash to invest. They\u2019re just using that cash to look at it more transactionally to go into market and asset level products. That\u2019s point number one. Point number two is, you begin to see the fixed income products that were over one year mature and just sit there. So it\u2019s as though when you think about what is the retail client doing, they\u2019re waiting, they\u2019re getting those assets, they\u2019re letting it mature and it\u2019s just sitting in some sort of sweep product until they want to deploy those assets into the market.\n\nThe final point is, you\u2019re just seeing less activity go into various types of cash alternatives. And in my mind, that just means that this cash, now that rates has come down, markets are going up, it feels to be somewhat more normalized. It\u2019s acting transactional, which is what we had always assumed there would be some level of transactional cash. And to your point, as that rate differential goes down and it\u2019s no longer \u2014 you can earn 5% from a cash product. There are places and decisions of what individuals want to do with that cash, they\u2019re letting it sit and they\u2019re using it to eventually invest in markets. And what you\u2019re seeing is that, that is actually taking place in the transactional line item.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Mike.\n\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, Ted, last quarter you were pretty built-up on the markets and some of that\u2019s playing out. But to how much are your backlogs up? Is our backlog a record? I\u2019m not hearing record backlogs anymore here, up, but not record. I\u2019m just wondering, how much you can monetize the backlogs that were in place in some cases, I guess, one, two, or three years ago?\n\nTed Pick: Yeah. Depending on how you measure it, whether volume or unit, number of units or sort of add value, you see pipelines in the M&A product that are the highest in seven years. So that is really encouraging. Now, some of this will be dependent on how things roll out in the first couple of months of the incoming administration and how things feel on a cross-border basis. But the pent-up activity that we\u2019re seeing is starting to release. You had saw some announcements going into the end of the year. You saw some very large capital raises that took place where enormous capacity was filled for great names over a weekend or over a 24 hour period. And that \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen that since really 2020 and that was a totally different interest rate and backdrop context.\n\nSo there is clearly demand even discussions for IPO potential, not just as an option versus selling to another sponsor or selling to a corporate, but in fact, a real option. So I am \u2014 you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been bullish on this. It has taken some time and I think we will have some unpredictability around regulation in one jurisdiction versus another. But I think the demand to \u2014 for some corporates to get bigger, to purify their businesses, given the deglobalization effect, given climate, given interest rate transition, they have things to do. And then again, the sponsors, they are looking to harvest some of these assets given where prices are and that sort of mismatch of expectations versus the reality of what the market is willing to pay for good companies, I think that\u2019s really starting to come together.\n\nAnd I would also say that the \u2014 within the investment banking cylinder, i.e., M&A versus ECM versus DCM, that sub \u2014 those sublines, as you know, have rotated over the last four, six quarters. A couple of quarters ago, it was a great ECM quarter. This past quarter was a DCM quarter, that also is healthy. It suggests the people in the treasury or CFO\u2019s office of large corporate clients are looking at all the toggles. So it is an activity-based business and I think \u201925 as we move through the year, if we continue to have reasonably constructive markets and reasonably predictable interest rates and reasonable sort of geopolitical backdrop, I think we are going to see increasing activity as the year goes on.\n\nMike Mayo: So you said the best backlog in seven years was that for mergers or all investment bank?\n\nTed Pick: Largely the M&A number, Mike. Globally.\n\nMike Mayo: Okay. So yeah, that\u2019s a \u2014 I guess, that would be a lagging driver to the whole capital markets theme. And for you guys, when you think of a multiplier\u2026\n\nTed Pick: Yes. By the way, yes. Yes, on that, Mike. Exactly as you\u2019ve been saying all along, that is the last piece. And there have been periods where it\u2019s sort of frustrating, stuff gets discussed at a sort of free Board approval level and then there\u2019s some unpredictability and it gets tabled. But the sort of the inventory around stuff that is idea flow that is a near announcement, that piece of it is increasing and it may not result ultimately in a merger ticket. It may actually turn into the company being carved out and taken public. But I think what we are increasingly confident about, again if the market and the economy holds up and those are \u2014 those are ifs, but if they do, then you\u2019re going to see the entire corporate finance cylinder really kick into something that maybe looks like mid-90s activity classic corporate finance.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Operator, can you hear us? We can move on to the next question.\n\nOperator: Steven, your line is now open. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Steven. Thanks, and good morning.\n\nSteven Chubak: Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Sharon.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Good morning.\n\nSteven Chubak: So, one is that \u2014 wanted to ask on the 30% wealth management margin target. Just taking a step back, you\u2019re already running at 29% on a core basis. Sharon, you cited a number of headwinds in the coming year, whether it\u2019s just NII inflecting AUM growth, capital markets fee tailwinds. I\u2019m just trying to understand what would preclude you from getting to that goal this year. And why isn\u2019t the longer-term aspiration something north of 30 just given significant operating leverage in this model at scale?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: So I\u2019ll take that, Steve. I just juxtaposed this call to where we were a year ago and a lot of the conversations, obviously, as you think about the change in the rate environment, but then also very importantly, the change in the asset management fee revenues. That has been a very large contributor to the point that you\u2019re making where we\u2019ve seen the fee-based increase, we\u2019ve seen the AUM and then we\u2019ve seen the revenues. But I don\u2019t want to lose sight of the fact that we\u2019re investing in this business and that investment is very important. We\u2019ve always said over the course of the last five years, we can get to 30%, but we don\u2019t want to starve the business. We want to do it in a durable manner. And we want to make sure that we are able to invest specifically in the places that might be margin dilutive.\n\nThose are workplace. There are different parts of marketing and investment in the sales cycle as you think about self-directed. Putting money towards the top of the funnel, putting money towards technology that actually helps match places where you have the top of the funnel into the advisor-led channel. All of that\u2019s working. So the last thing one would want to do is, put a target out there, see a change in dynamics associated with all of a sudden markets go down or there is some shock that we\u2019re unaware of, you\u2019re unable to meet those targets and you pull back investments, that\u2019s not how we want to run this. As Ted said in his prepared remarks, the word across this entire \u2014 these scripts is durable. We\u2019re looking for durable margins. We\u2019re looking for durable growth.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for durable returns. All of that comes into play as we think about the actual investment in the business over time.\n\nTed Pick: Yeah. And what I would add to that is, the extraordinary performance of \u2014 well, you just look at the fact that revenues grew by 8% year-over-year, but PBT grew by 19%. So that is \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of progress against larger numbers that we are excited to see and a full contribution to the firm outcome.\n\nSteven Chubak: No. That\u2019s great to hear. Just one quick follow-up, Sharon. You referenced the recently announced partnership with Carta. And I was hoping to double-click into some of the tangible financial benefits from leveraging that partnership. Just given the number of planned participants, it\u2019s been pretty stagnant over the last few quarters, but certainly feels as though this could be a potential accelerant, maybe help reinvigorate growth within that channel.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. So let me just first \u2014 I\u2019ll take the second part of your question first because there is some stuff to unpack when you actually look at the underlying participants. We have talked about and we\u2019ve seen \u2014 we will see a transition from some of the stock sale plants that we have sold and announced both in Europe and in Asia, that are associated with the actual participants. So I just want to be clear that \u2014 there are other underlying factors in there. The other point that I would mention is, we have not been in a cycle in which \u2014 especially over the last two years that you\u2019ve seen a lot of monetization events. And so you have changes really in the workforce dynamics for many of these companies where you might have seen headcount reductions, you might have seen acquisitions in which some of those stock plan participants decline.\n\nI don\u2019t want you to read into that as though there is not investment or it\u2019s not growing because we continue to meet win mandates and we continue to have expanded corporate relationships. So that\u2019s important as we talk about where are we investing. We are investing and we\u2019re seeing progress as we continue to have greater breadth of corporates that we service within the United States in particular. Now as it relates to Carta and I\u2019m glad you mentioned and asked the question is that\u2019s a really exciting partnership, especially, as the capital market cycle turns. So as you\u2019re likely aware, Carta does service the private companies in particular. And what we have now done and the relationship that we announced at the end of last year was that we have an exclusive partnership with Carta, which means that they will refer those private \u2014 different stock plans or different corporate companies to Morgan Stanley as they move into going public.\n\nIt\u2019s really exciting for many reasons, not just the opportunities on the wealth side, but also as Ted talked a lot about is the integrated firm. So there is a lot of places to build out those relationships as those companies are going through that transition. Moreover, what we are committed to doing as we go through that transition is to make sure that it\u2019s a seamless experience for those clients. As you know, we already do service individually some of those private companies. As they move public, they\u2019ll have that seamless experience both from a Carta referral perspective and even what we see that\u2019s currently on the books.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Christian.\n\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, Ted and Sharon. Maybe on Wealth Management organic growth, first of all. So if I look at flows over the last three years, total flows have been somewhat short of that sort of $1 trillion target and have been at the lower end of your 5% to 7% organic growth target. So maybe just talk through how you think about the ability to accelerate organic growth going forward and then maybe confidence level in that $1 trillion target?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: So what I would like to note here is, this is a really I think in the environment that we\u2019ve been in the last two years, I think, this is a remarkable outcome. Especially, if you look and you compare it to our peer set and anyone who\u2019s been able to actually aggregate assets were best-in-class. And a lot of that best-in-class has to do with the fact that \u2014 and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, the vast majority of the assets, the new assets that we\u2019re seeing over the course of this last year has been on the advisor-led channel. And we\u2019ve talked about some of the headwinds that are going from a cyclical perspective that I think are beginning to abate. And those have been spending of money, you\u2019re necessarily \u2014 not necessarily seeing as much money in motion and you aren\u2019t seeing monetization events from workplace corporates.\n\nSo you add the self-directed channel, you\u2019re not necessarily seeing as much money coming in. From the workplace side, you\u2019re not necessarily seeing monetization events. So people aren\u2019t getting that cash, you\u2019re not seeing companies going public. Those things are beginning to turn. And so this \u2014 these results were really led from the advisor-led channel from new clients and existing clients, new clients being really important. And so, I think that there is a lot of opportunity there in terms of the 5% to 7%.\n\nTed Pick: Yeah. What I\u2019d add to that, Christian, is sort of a big picture answer and a little picture answer. My little picture answer would be just taking a look again at Slide 9, fee-based flows. That is the \u2014 that\u2019s sort of the core of the funnel. And we\u2019ve been talking about that every quarter, and Jed Finn running well very much has been focused on that too. And you see that the number just continues to move. $109 billion last year or two years ago, $123 billion in 2024. So fee-based flows, that\u2019s kind of the ultimate outcome. And you see that we are seeing this incremental activity now in the self-directed product from clients who they kind of \u2014 have the kind of experience that we talk about when they make their way to a financial advisor, it could prove very sticky.\n\nMy big picture observation though would be, one, and I know you know this, but by way of sort of a reminder, just given what\u2019s happened in the market over the last year of when we did this call a year ago, the combined assets for wealth and investment management stood at $6.6 trillion. And as you know, we said we\u2019re going to get to $10 trillion and we\u2019re going to keep going. And in a year, we\u2019ve gone from $6.6 trillion to $7.9 trillion. So that is a $1.3 trillion in a year. Now, of course, we\u2019ve had the kind of markets that are \u2014 take asset prices higher, but that I think speaks for itself in terms of our ability to continue to stay on what really is what I would have folks paying attention to, which is just this commitment to get to $10 trillion.\n\nAnd whether that takes X years or X plus one year or X plus two years, we want to get the kind of assets that ultimately work their way through the funnel and you say, well, what\u2019s the KPI there? And I\u2019d say, the KPI there is going back to Slide 9, which is are we increasing the TAM of relationships and are we doing that across the financial advisory of lever through workplace and through self-directed? Are we doing it all three? The answer is, yes. Are we seeing enough net new assets that it\u2019s actually material and clearly at $250 per annum, that is a material number? And then how are we doing on that which you can model on a multiple \u2014 a nice multiple on, which is fee-based flows, and there it is on the right. So I\u2019m less wrapped around the axle on whether we are at 700 or 800 versus $1.23 trillion in a given three year period and more focused on sort of the composition of the funnel and that the assets are growing materially, but that ultimately we are translating that across a broader number of clients, again, $19 million plus and that ultimately, at least for some of them translates into financial advisory fee-based flows and that\u2019s the right side.\n\nSo that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it, Christian, in the context now of the integrated firm.\n\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Very fair. Thanks for the full answer. Maybe another quick one here on just comp leverage, very strong expense, especially in ISG comp. And I\u2019m sorry if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but is the 2024 full year ISG comp ratio of 31% kind of a good place to run going forward, obviously, as you mean, revenue continues to grow?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. Obviously, Christian, as you can tell, we look at comp on a full year basis and you did have the outperformance as it relates to the revenue in the fourth quarter on a relative basis. And so you do see changes within that comp. We don\u2019t give full year guidance specifically on one expense line. We manage the company holistically. When we think about our expenses, we\u2019re looking at our overall efficiency of the firm. And what I would pay attention to is on the last page of the targets, the 70% efficiency ratio goal that we\u2019ve stated over the long-term.\n\nTed Pick: And what I\u2019d add to that is, listen, we\u2019re running a talent business. And so we pay for performance and performance comes in sort of the upside for our partners comes in two forms. One is through compensation over many years, which is why tenure matters. And of course, total return in stock ownership, which is, as you know, a critical part of our partner compensation, so that is the thinking. Of course, when you have good years, you experience some operating leverage in comp of which then flows to the bottom line. In tougher years, as you know, the comp ratio moves higher. What we did do in 2023 in the second half was some of the tough work around calling and doing some lateral work and that obviously has the \u2014 if it\u2019s done right, both enhances the efficiency of the income statement, but also allows for some incremental productivity on the top line of those bankers and traders and salespeople and structures and risk management folks as they begin to kind of gestate over the two, three years after that.\n\nSo we feel like we came out at a good place there.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\n\nTed Pick: Hey, Devin.\n\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much. Hey, Ted. Hey, Sharon. I just have one on Investment Management. Slide 12, you lay out, your parametric has been a great success story in the alternatives bucket. In investment management, overall, it\u2019s still less than 10% of firmwide revenue. And I know the Alts (ph) bucket specifically is an area of focus, but I\u2019m curious areas like private equity, private credit, there is a lot of secular growth there. I know you have ambitions to grow private credit, but how do you think about that becoming a larger strategic piece of Morgan Stanley? And what\u2019s the appetite there to maybe do acquisitions to step function or accelerate that?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: So when we look at \u2014 what I would focus you on as we think about investment management more broadly is the fact that, as you know, we are looking to create a diversified platform and we obviously were able to do that, as you mentioned, through acquisitions. And specifically through the acquisition of Eaton Vance when we think about both Parametric and a lot of the fixed income products. We\u2019re beginning to see a lot of reaping of those synergies across the more \u2014 the wealth management business, across MSIM, and across all of the initiatives that we laid out at the beginning. So remember, what we said is, we thought we \u2014 there was more to do on Parametric, specifically on the retail side, that\u2019s working. We\u2019re seeing increased participation from our FAs, retail clients, and even asset managers to leverage that parametric product.\n\nWe have also noted that we plan to think about things like fixed-income and use fixed-income and see international distribution, that was evidenced this quarter. A lot of the flows that we saw there have to do with international distribution. So the synergies themselves are working already. I think there is much more to do just on bringing the two franchises together. And as we see continued investment with different parts of private credit, different parts of private equity, different parts of infrastructure, we will take part in those secular growth trends as they move forward.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Dan.\n\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. One more question just on wealth. Can you talk about advisor retention, kind of recruitment, and backlogs here? And then you used to talk about the companion accounts within wealth and workplace. So curious if there is any update on where that sits and some of the progress you\u2019re seeing within that initiative.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah, I\u2019ll take that. So in terms of the workplace in general and how we\u2019re beginning to see the transitions in the companion accounts. What I would focus you on is companion accounts were something that we were looking at the beginning of time when we had put together the E*TRADE and the Morgan Stanley platforms, that integration is largely complete. What we\u2019re more focused now is actually better understanding the channel migration. And those are the numbers and statistics that we\u2019ve been giving over the last couple of calls more specifically. So what I mean by channel migration is, we have workplace assets that began at some point in workplace and we\u2019re seeing them move into the advisor-led concept. Over the last five years or so, since 2020, we\u2019ve seen $300 billion coming and initiating at some point from workplace and moving into that advisor-led channel, that has been a big part of the move towards first transactional and then that movement from transactional flows into fee-based.\n\nSo those are more of the metrics that I\u2019d point you to on the forward when we think about being able to mark ourselves to market from a funnel perspective.\n\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Ted. Thank you. Can you guys share with us \u2014 we share \u2014 many investors \u2014 many of us share your optimism on the outlook for Morgan Stanley in the business? Can you share with us the risk aside from the obvious geopolitical risks globally, what risks or curveballs are you guys trying to keep your eyes on for this year? Because again things do look very good for yourselves and others. But what are some of the risks you guys talk about on a regular basis?\n\nSharon Yeshaya: So needless to say, we\u2019re constantly running a number of stress tests as you think about the risks, geopolitical macro in nature, counterparty risks and that\u2019s been a lot of the focus when you think about the velocity of the balance sheet and all of the capital metrics that we have is making sure that we\u2019re in a position to constantly refresh. And look, when we think about \u2014 if you look back at any of the episodes that we\u2019ve talked about and then a lot of the risks that we\u2019ve learned, we are constantly thinking about where are there tall trees. How do you see the velocity of different positions that you have? So it\u2019s very hard to pin down and say, well, what match risk have you not necessarily solved for because generally speaking, there is something brand new that one \u2014 I don\u2019t know that anyone knew that there would be a global pandemic, right?\n\nBut the underlying risk of what does the global pandemic mean, you think about even the risk that you might have seen over the course of this quarter. You have an election, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with the election. None of us knew what would necessarily happen with the election. You look at the risks, you look at tall trees, you think about being able to bring down, what can you bring down quickly and how do you think about velocity? And then how do you run scenarios? What does it mean for higher rates? What does it mean for lower rates? And we look at different geographical exposures as well to try and better understand how we can manage all of that dynamism as you move forward.\n\nTed Pick: I guess, what I\u2019d add to that, Gerard, is most of the risks that we have been looking at in this period are \u2014 and Sharon kind of went through a whole panoply of them, they are largely in the buckets of either the implications or the reality of regime change around interest rates that the period of zero interest rates and zero inflation is now passed and that this hot coal that we feel are now tilted more towards inflation. And if there was a downside risk, it would be something that felt more stagflationary that we are running risk scenarios around that, then there might be periods when it feels a little colder again. And that is all sort of imputed in the language of interest rate policy around the world. So that\u2019s sort of bucket one, the end of financial repression.\n\nAnd then bucket two is the geopolitical uncertainty and tension that we\u2019re seeing that has built over the last number of years and will continue. And that\u2019s important to us because, of course, we\u2019re running a global business. So there may be places where there are re-equitization opportunities. There may be places where there is outsized risk in behalf of clients and we have to navigate that as well. So those are the two major buckets, I think, of our time. And that is why it\u2019s so important that we were able to put up a quarter that concluded a year where we had the kind of consistency we had on the top line, on the bottom line. We can\u2019t undertake that, that will be the case in every market context. But if you think about the year we just had, there were multiple years within that year.\n\nAnd the fact that the enterprise through the businesses we\u2019re in was able to generate that kind of consistency on the top and bottom line, I think augurs well for a period where we think all things being equal, the denominator of opportunities should improve.\n\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

A financial holding company, Morgan Stanley provides a full range of financial services to clients around the world.\n\nMorgan Stanley was formed in 1935 as a result of the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall separated commercial and investment banking in a way that forced the then-largest bank J.P. Morgan & Co to split into two groups. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to retain the commercial side of the business while partners Henry S. Morga, grandson of J.P., and Harold Stanley took the investment end. In its first year, Morgan Stanley did 24% of the IPO business and maintains a lion\u2019s share of the market to this day.\n\nThe original company existed and grew through acquisitions until 1987 when it merged with Dean Witter Discover & Co. The new Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover & Co existed for 14 years until 2001 when the name was shortened back to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank is credited in part with both beginning and ending the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The Process Driven Trading unit lost $300 million in one day due to a short-squeeze that popped the bubble in the housing market. After teetering on the brink of failure Morgan Stanley agreed to become a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve, a key factor in the original decision to split from parent J.P. Morgan & Co. Ironically when given the chance, present-day J.P. Morgan refused to buy Morgan Stanley but that was for the better.\n\nToday, Morgan Stanley operates through three segments via offices in 41 countries and employs more than 75,000 people. Revenue in 2021 topped $49 billion and total assets topped $1.15 trillion.\n\nThe operating segments are Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management segments. The Institutional Securities segment is by far the largest and most profitable. It offers a range of services and products for businesses, institutions, and entities that include capital raising, strategic advisory, underwriting, advice on M&A, restructuring, and real estate. The Wealth Management segment provides brokerage and investment advisory services for individuals and employers. The services include brokerage, financial planning, company stock-plan administration, insurance, mortgage loans, lines of credit, and retirement planning. The Investment Management segment provides investment products to a range of institutions, organizations, corporations, and governments.",

But here's the catch: Analysts aren't ready to flip bullish just yet. The firm says it still needs proof that consumer sentiment is actually turning the corner before calling this a long-term win.\n\nLooking ahead, Morgan Stanley forecasts 6.9% revenue growth for the year\u2014again, ahead of market estimates\u2014with non-GAAP net profit hitting 50 billion yuan, up 6%. Margins are set to climb to 4.05%, showing JD.com is squeezing more out of every yuan. The strong report prompted analysts to bump up earnings estimates, proving that JD's trade-in strategy is paying off.\n\nYet despite the beat, Morgan Stanley isn't ready to go all-in. The firm sticks to its \"in line with the market\" rating with a $41 price target. The big question: Can JD.com keep this momentum going in a still-shaky consumer environment?

As such, Jeremy Grantham, Rob Arnott, Bill Smead, and others have warned in recent months that stocks are in a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com peak in 2000.\n\nGuruFocus\n\nBut what if the AI-driven, bull-market run is, in fact, just getting started?\n\nKaty Huberty, the global head of research at Morgan Stanley, argues just that.\n\nHuberty's bullishness stems in part from where she believes we are in the AI capex and adoption cycle, she told BI on Thursday. Each wave of technology development going back decades is roughly 10x the previous cycle in terms of both user adoption and business investment to build out the products, she said.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nShe estimates $10 trillion in capex will need to be poured into developing AI. With mega-cap hyperscaler firms only having spent roughly $300-$400 billion total over the last two years, there's still a ways to go, Huberty said.\n\n\"If we're talking about ultimately a $10 trillion AI infrastructure investment, we're at single-digit penetration today,\" she said.\n\nAnother data point that tells her we're still at the beginning of the AI cycle is that earnings revisions for the market's top tech companies still have plenty of upside when considering the path they took during the mobile internet cycle starting in 2010.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nPrice multiples are also relatively low compared to what they were at the tail-end of the dot-com bubble, despite similar revenue and earnings numbers.\n\nThe median 12-month forward PE ratio for the top five stocks by market cap in 1999 was 65.3. In 2024, it was 31.1.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\n\"We're only 15% of the way through the typical estimate revisions and market cap expansion of a new computing cycle,\" Huberty said. \"So those are two data points that tell me we're still very early.\"\n\nShe continued: \"There's still a lot of alpha generation to come. That doesn't mean you can't have a quarter or a six- or 12-month period where the market digests before you see the next inflection point.\"\n\nAs for how to invest in the next stage of the cycle, Huberty likes AI beneficiaries or non-AI companies whose profits will be boosted by the technology.\n\n\"We're at this tipping point where adoption is now much more broad-based,\" Huberty said.\n\n\"None of this is priced,\" she continued. \"To justify that $10 trillion of infrastructure investment, you have to see the impact on efficiency. And we think it's coming here pretty quickly.\"\n\nShe said an analysis by her team showed that financial stocks seem to be best positioned to benefit first from AI adoption.\n\nOne way investors can gain exposure to the sector is through exchange-traded funds like the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH), and the iShares US Financial Services ETF (IYG).",

            "content": "As artificial intelligence transitions from digital interfaces to physical applications, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is looking at a rapidly expanding frontier, embodied AI, News.az reports citing Xinhua Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst said buzz around Tesla was less about EVs and more about its innovations in robotics and AI. While concerns over the EV market's headwinds, including competitive pressure from China and potential margin compression, loom large, the focus is shifting to Tesla\u2019s full self-driving (FSD) advancements, robotaxi milestones, and humanoid robots like Optimus.Morgan Stanley noted Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, could become one of Tesla's most valuable ventures, despite its absence from current valuation models.Analysts view this as a broader trend within the \"embodied AI\" space, encompassing machines capable of navigating and interacting with the physical world\u2014ranging from drones and autonomous vehicles to humanoid robots.Though key components such as actuators, sensors, rare earth magnets, and energy storage systems are often sourced from global suppliers, including many in China. As the adoption of embodied AI grows, supply chain security and resilience are becoming critical concerns.Tesla's integration of hardware and AI capabilities gives it a potential edge in addressing the supply chain bottlenecks and manufacturing challenges that plague the robotics industry. Analysts suggest Tesla's expertise in vertical integration and its ties with SpaceX and xAI, a company founded by CEO Elon Musk, could position it as a leader in this domain.Moreover, Musk\u2019s influence on policy discussions around autonomous vehicles could accelerate regulatory frameworks, enabling faster adoption of AI-powered technologies like robotaxis.Tesla's embodied AI ventures could redefine its growth trajectory. Analysts are revising models to incorporate the potential revenue streams from AI-driven industries, including autonomous ridesharing and intelligent robotics.\"Tesla's role in helping to 'fill the void' of next gen manufacturing and supply chain will be an increasingly consequential driver of growth and shareholder value, in our opinion,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.While Tesla remains synonymous with EVs, its AI ambitions may signal a new chapter for the company, one where robots, not cars, take center stage.\n\nNews.Az",

            "content": "Key Takeaways A TikTok ban could go into effect in the U.S. on Sunday, leaving other companies to compete for its users\u2019 attention and almost $10 billion in ad revenue.\n\nMeta could be the biggest winner given its large user base said analysts at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlphabet's YouTube, along with Snapchat, Pinterest, and Roblox are some of the top contenders to benefit from the ban.\n\nWith a TikTok ban potentially taking effect in the U.S. on Sunday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said other social media platforms could compete for the roughly $10 billion in ad revenue and 32 billion hours users spend on the app each year.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a shutdown in the U.S. as of Jan. 19 amid national security concerns. That means app stores such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play Store and Apple's (AAPL) App Store won't be able to offer TikTok to users in the U.S. after Sunday's deadline, and the app could go \"dark\" for U.S.-based users.\n\nMeta Could Be Biggest Winner, According to Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts suggested ahead of the decision that Meta (META) could be the \u201clargest fundamental winner\u201d if the ban takes effect Sunday, given its large user base and dataset on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\nThey added that for every 10% of U.S. user time currently spent on TikTok that Meta can capture, it could add 30 cents to 60 cents to the company\u2019s estimated roughly $30 in earnings per share in 2026.\n\n\u201cSaid another way, META\u2019s ability to capture half of [TikTok]\u2019s time would likely add $1 to $3 to our \u201826 EPS,\u201d the analysts added, noting the biggest gains could come from Instagram Reels, which offers similar short-form video content.\n\nAlong With Meta, YouTube Could See More Engagement\n\nYouTube, particularly YouTube Shorts, could also see increased engagement after a TikTok shutdown in the U.S., Morgan Stanley said.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley estimated Shorts monetizes at half the rate of typical YouTube content, meaning the same 10% time share gain might only add a 1% to 2% increase in YouTube ad revenue. That could mean even if YouTube gained a 50% share and Shorts monetized at the standard YouTube rate, ad revenue for its owner Alphabet would increase just 1.2% in 2026, the firm said.\n\nSnapchat, Pinterest, and Roblox Among Contenders\n\nSocial media companies Snapchat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS), as well as online gaming entity Roblox (RBLX), could also contend for a piece of the ad revenue pie, Morgan Stanley said. However, the analysts warned the companies might need to prove performance, scalability, and returns on ad spending.\n\nReddit (RDDT) and Applovin (APP) were among those that could see long-term benefits as well, Morgan Stanley added, noting improving engagement on their platforms.\n\n",

The scenario also involves fiscal measures working better than expected, improving the medium-term fiscal outlook and fulfilling the fiscal rule in 2025, and negotiations on First Quantum's Cobre Panam\u00e1 \u2013 which once represented 5% of Panama's GDP \u2013 beginning in the first quarter of 2025 with room for at least a partial reopening.",

            "content": "Matthew Hornbach: Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Matthew Hornbach, Global Head of Macro Strategy.\n\nMartin Tobias: And I'm Martin Tobias from the U.S. Interest Rate Strategy Team.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: Today, we're going to talk about the widespread concerns around the dip in reserve levels at the Fed and what it means for banking, money markets, and beyond.\n\nIt's Thursday, January 16th at 10am in New York.\n\nThe Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet since June 2022, when it embarked on quantitative tightening in order to combat inflation. Reserves held at the Fed recently dipped below [$]3 trillion at year end, their lowest level since 2020. This has raised a lot of questions among investors, and we want to address some of them.\n\nMarty, you've been following these developments closely, so let's start with the basics. What are Fed reserves and why are they important?\n\nMartin Tobias: Reserves are one of the key line items on the liability side of the Fed balance sheet. Like any balance sheet, even your household budget, you have liabilities, which are debts and financial obligations, and you have assets. For the Fed, its assets primarily consist of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, and then you have liabilities like U.S. currency in circulation and bank reserves held at the Fed.\n\nThese reserves consist of electronic deposits that commercial banks, savings and loan institutions, and credit unions hold at Federal Reserve banks. And these depository institutions earn interest from the Fed on these reserve balances.\n\nThere are other Fed balance sheet liabilities like the Treasury General Account and the Overnight Reversed Repo Facility. But, to save us from some complexity, I won't go into those right now. Bottom line, these three liabilities are inversely linked to one another, and thus cannot be viewed in isolation.\n\nHaving said that, the reason this is important is because central bank reserves are the most liquid and ultimate form of money. They underpin nearly all other forms of money, such as the deposits individuals or businesses hold at commercial banks. In simplest terms, those reserves are a sort of security blanket.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: Okay, so what led to this most recent dip in reserves?\n\nMartin Tobias: Well, that's the good news. We think the recent dip in reserves below [$] 3 trillion was simply related to temporary dynamics in funding markets at the end of the year, as opposed to a permanent drain of cash from the banking system.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: This kind of reduction in reserves has far reaching implications on several different levels. The banking sector, money markets, and monetary policy. So, let's take them one at a time. How does it affect the banking sector?\n\nMartin Tobias: So individual banks maintain different levels of reserves to fit their specific business models; while differences in reserve management also appear across large compared to small banks. As macro strategists, we monitor reserve balances in the aggregate and have identified a few different regimes based on the supply of liquidity.\n\nWhile reserves did fall below [$]3 trillion at the end of the year, we note the Fed Standing Repo Facility, which is an instrument that offers on demand access to liquidity for banks at a fixed cost, did not receive any usage. We interpret this to mean, even though reserves temporarily dipped below [$]3 trillion, it is a level that is still above scarcity in the aggregate.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: How about potential stability and liquidity of money markets?\n\nMartin Tobias: Occasional signs of volatility in money market rates over the past year have been clear signs that liquidity is transitioning from a super abundancy closer to an ample amount. The fact that there has become more volatility in money market rates \u2013 but being limited to identifiable dates \u2013 is really indicative of normal market functioning where liquidity is being redistributed from those who have it in excess to those in need of it.\n\nYear- end was just the latest example of there being some more volatility in money market rates. But as has been the case over the past year, these temporary upward pressures quickly normalized as liquidity in funding markets still remains abundant. In fact, reserves rose by [$] 440 billion to [$] 3.3 trillion in the week ended January 8th.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: Would this reduction in reserves that occurred over the end of the year influence the Fed's future monetary policy decisions?\n\nMartin Tobias: Right. As you alluded to earlier, the Fed has been passively reducing the size of its balance sheet to complement its actions with its primary monetary policy tool, the Fed Funds Rate. And I think our listeners are all familiar with the Fed Funds Rate because in simplest terms it's the rate that banks charge each other when lending money overnight, and that in turn influences the interest you pay on your loans and credit cards. Now the goal of the Fed's quantitative tightening program is to bring the balance sheet to the smallest size consistent with efficient money market functioning.\n\nSo, we think the Fed is closely watching when declines in reserves occur and the sensitivity of changes in money market rates to those declines. Our house baseline view remains at quantitative tightening ends late in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: So, bottom line, for people who invest in money market funds, what's the takeaway?\n\nMartin Tobias: The bottom line is money markets continue to operate normally, and even though the Fed has lowered its policy rates, the yields on money markets do remain attractive for many types of retail and institutional investors.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: Well, Marty, thanks for taking the time to talk.\n\nMartin Tobias: Great speaking with you, Matt.\n\nMatthew Hornbach: And thanks for listening.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of 19.75%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMorgan Stanley , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $16.22 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.05%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $12.9 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMorgan Stanley shares have added about 3.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Morgan Stanley?\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Morgan Stanley: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nBonds rated below investment grade may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market. Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds. High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe majority of $25 and $1000 par preferred securities are \u201ccallable\u201d meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.\n\nSome $25 or $1000 par preferred securities are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional \u2018dividend paying\u2019 perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible. In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period \u2013 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.\n\nInvesting in foreign markets entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. Investing in currency involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets and frontier markets, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.\n\nAlternative investments may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.\n\nHedge funds may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.\n\nREITs investing risks are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate: property value fluctuations, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions.\n\nMaster Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs carry interest rate risk and may underperform in a rising interest rate environment.\n\nCompanies paying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies. Risks applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. Health care sector stocks are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.\n\nAsset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful.

            "content": "If the rise of Donald Trump has taught us anything about politics, it\u2019s to expect the unexpected \u2013 but with his second term as President just a few days away, there are a few things that we can confidently predict. Prime among these is a drastic change in American energy policy.\n\nStay Ahead of the Market: Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nA supportive policy for energy will likely include both new exploration and new drilling activities \u2013 and that will open up plenty of opportunities as oil and gas companies expand their revenue bases.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s sector expert Devin McDermott is reevaluating his stance on energy companies, in light of these likely developments. The 5-star analyst has tagged two energy stocks in particular as buying opportunities and is placing bets on both.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these names, using data from the TipRanks database, to find out just what makes them compelling choices today.\n\nPermian Resources (PR)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Permian Resources, an independent oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) company based in Midland, Texas. The company works mainly in the state\u2019s rich Permian Basin, near the boundary with New Mexico. Permian Resources\u2019 holdings include a total of 450,000 net acres, of which 85,000 are net royalty acres. Of the hydrocarbon reserves on those holdings, an estimated 46% is oil. In the company\u2019s last reported quarter, 3Q24, Permian\u2019s average production reached 347.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d).\n\nIn recent months, Permian has taken actions to both expand its E&P activities and streamline its overall operations. In September of last year, the company completed a bolt-on acquisition to its assets in the Delaware Basin, a rich sub-region of the larger Permian formation. This transaction involved Occidental Petroleum and added some 29,500 net acres\u2014of which approximately 9,900 were net royalty acres\u2014to Permian\u2019s holdings in Reeves County, Texas.\n\nMore recently, in December, Permian announced an agreement with Kinetik Holdings to sell its oil and gas midstream assets in Reeves County. The divested assets include gathering systems and pipelines. Permian stands to receive $180 million in cash consideration, subject to adjustments post-closing.\n\nOn the financial side, Permian reported solid results in its Q3 earnings. Revenue was up 60.8% year-over-year, hitting $1.22 billion and beating the forecast by $10 million. At the bottom line, the company realized a GAAP EPS of 53 cents, up 40 cents from the prior year and 21 cents per share better than expected. Also noteworthy, the company\u2019s adjusted free cash flow in Q3 was $303 million, up 84% year-over-year.\n\nWhen we check in with Morgan Stanley analyst McDermott, we find that he is upbeat about Permian\u2019s ability to improve efficiency without compromising the quality of its assets or its ability to generate free cash flow. He writes of the company: \u201cPR is differentiated by a high-quality asset base, capital efficient growth, and a low cost structure, supporting sustainable (and growing) free cash flow generation. Management has a track record of operational execution and financial discipline. We estimate PR offers 2025 FCF yield of 11% FCF and 3.4x EV/EBITDA at $70 WTI (oil E&P median of 11% and 3.7x), while also offering stronger growth (12% oil per debt adjusted share CAGR over the next three years vs. 6% median for peers). As one of the lowest cost operators in the Permian, we see upside to long-term value creation from further efficiency capture from continuous focus on cost reduction and potential opportunistic M&A.\u201d\n\nMcDermott goes on to rate these shares as Overweight (i.e., Buy), with a $19 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 23%. (To watch McDermott\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis stock\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 14 unanimously positive analyst reviews set in recent weeks. The shares are priced at $15.48, and their $18.71 average target price suggests a 21% gain in store for the year ahead. (See PR stock forecast)\n\nExpand Energy (EXE)\n\nNext on our list, Expand Energy, was known as Chesapeake Energy until last year. As of October 1, on completion of its merger with Southwestern Energy, the company rebranded \u2013 and took its place as one of the largest natural gas producers in the US. Expand is based in Oklahoma City, and its operations include natural gas exploration and production in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, the Marcellus and Utica Shales of Ohio and West Virginia, and the Haynesville formation in Louisiana. The Appalachian operations deserve special note, as Expand\u2019s Marcellus Shale holdings allow the company to tap into one of the world\u2019s richest natural gas plays.\n\nIn the last few years, we\u2019ve all seen headlines about horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Both techniques allow E&P companies to maximize hydrocarbon recovery \u2013 and Expand uses both in its natural gas operations. The company leverages these techniques to increase production and extend the lifespan of its active wells, in some cases to as much as 40 years.\n\nExpand is also an important player in the liquefied natural gas sector, or LNG. This is a vital segment of the global economy, as LNG operations process natural gas into a more export-amenable form and ship it around the world. Expand has access to or is planning a series of LNG facilities on the Gulf Coast, in both Louisiana and Texas, which it feeds from the operations listed above. The company currently delivers between 1.5 and 1.8 bcfe/d (billion cubic feet equivalent per day) of natural gas to these liquefaction facilities.\n\nWe should note here that Expand\u2019s CEO said this month that the company is on track to increase its natural gas production to approximately 7 billion cf/day this year. This compares favorably to the company\u2019s 3Q24 production average, which was ~6.75B cf/day of gas equivalent.\n\nMcDermott, in his coverage of EXE for Morgan Stanley, highlights the firm\u2019s unique attributes. He notes, \u201cEXE is differentiated by leading scale in the Haynesville and attractive FCF growth from rising prices and volumes in 2025-26 as deferred wells are brought online and synergies are realized. EXE is well positioned to answer the call on the next growth cycle of US gas supported by a diverse transportation portfolio and direct access to the Gulf Coast LNG corridor. The stock is pricing in ~$3.35/mmbtu long-run Henry Hub, ~7% below the 2025 strip and ~11% below our $3.75 long-term assumption.\u201d\n\nThe analyst uses this stance to back up his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on EXE, and his price target, set at $127, reflects his confidence in a 22% upside potential on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, this stock has picked up 15 analyst reviews recently, with a 10-to-5 split favoring Buy over Hold that gives the shares a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $104.12, and its $112.80 average price target suggests that a 12-month gain of 8% is waiting in the wings.

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I\u2019m Ed Stanley, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Global Head of Thematic Research. Today I'll discuss how understanding AI\u2019s rate of change can generate alpha in the year of AI agents.\n\nIt\u2019s Tuesday, the 14th of January, at 2 PM in London.\n\n\n\nEven if you haven't been using artificial intelligence in your work or home life yet \u2013 you\u2019ll doubtless have heard about its capabilities by now. Tasked, for example, with drafting an elevator pitch for a 100-page report; it's a tedious task at the best of times. But using an AI model not only does it become a breeze, but these models can also generate you a podcast \u2013 if you so wish \u2013 through which to disseminate it, and almost in any language conceivable. But now imagine the algorithm begins thinking through multi-stage processes itself \u2013 planning, executing \u2013 to generate that 100-page report itself, in the first place. That \u2026 is an example of Agentic AI.\n\nAs the name implies, this next phase of AI development is where software programs gain agency, transitioning from reactive chatbots that we\u2019ve been using into proactive task fulfillment agents. And this transition is happening now.\n\nOver the past 36 months, we\u2019ve gone from reliable output that can displace or supplement 5-second or 5-minute tasks, such as translation or quick summaries, to models that are providing reliable output for 15-minute tasks, 1-hour tasks \u2013 like the ones that I just mentioned. And each time the skeptics have claimed that model improvements are slowing down, and thus call into question the returns on hundreds of billions of dollars that have been spent on AI infrastructure, the AI research labs manage to take another leap forward, surprising even seasoned analysts.\n\nThat\u2019s why we think this is such an important trend for 2025. AI Adopter companies that can leverage these agents will start to pull ahead of their peers. And as a result, tracking AI\u2019s evolution in the materiality of companies\u2019 investment cases, we think, has never been more important.\n\nSince our first AI Adopter survey in January 2024 to our latest just published in January 2025, we've seen profound shifts in the thousands of stocks that we cover globally. This ongoing transformation not only underscores that AI\u2019s diffusion is advancing rapidly, but that we\u2019re still very much in its early innings.\n\nTo understand the breakneck speed of the AI evolution through the lens of its impact on the stock markets, we need to wrap our heads around the concept of \u201crate of change.\u201d We just published the third iteration of our AI mapping survey of 3,700 global stocks under coverage. And it reveals that 585 of those stocks had their AI exposure or materiality to investment case changed by our analysts \u2013 and that is just versus 6 months ago. And it impacts around $14 trillion of global market cap.\n\nAnd this rate of change in AI isn't just a buzzword; it's a tangible metric driving outperformance. So, if we look back in the second half of last year, 2024, stocks where our analysts previously increased both AI exposure and materiality in our last survey \u2013 went on to outperform broader equity markets by over 20 per cent in the second half of 2024. If we apply the same logic looking forward, where do we think most outperformance is going to come from? It\u2019s in those same stocks where our analysts have just upgraded the exposure and materiality to the investment case.\n\nBeyond this simple screen for AI outperformers we think there are three other key conclusions from our latest survey. The first is AI Enabler stocks with Rising Materiality, within which we believe that Semiconductors, which have outperformed well, might soon pass the baton to the Software layer in terms of equity market dominance. Second, Adopters with Pricing Power. These are companies that adopt AI early and use it to expand their margins but sustainably, without having to give it back to their customers. And the third is Financial stocks, in particular, where AI Rate of Change has been the fastest of any sector in our global coverage \u2013 in terms of the efficiency gains that we think it can manifest for the share prices.\n\nSo all in all, 2025 promises a slew of significant developments in AI, and, of course, we\u2019ll be here to bring you all of the updates.\n\nThank you for listening.

The firm also estimated that the share was worth $800.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's updated analysis, Tesla's dominance in the emerging autonomous mobility market comes from strengths in data collection, robotics, energy storage and AI infrastructure. It also noted the power of Tesla Mobility, the company's autonomous rideshare division, worth $90 per share in a revised sum of the parts (SOTP) analysis. It projects the division will have a fleet of 7.5 million vehicles there by 2040 and produce $1.46 per mile in revenue with a 29% EBITDA margin.\n\nAs the report underscored the rising significance of Tesla's Network Services \u2014 recurring revenue, including supercharging and full Self Driving subscriptions, all paid for as a monthly service \u2014 it also warned that its leadership may face an uphill battle to demonstrate the 'core configuration' of the business going forward. An area, equating to $168 per share, is expected to account for one-third of Tesla's EBITDA by 2030 and more than 60 percent of EBITDA by 2040.\n\nThe new price target comes after Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas said the increase in the valuations placed on Tesla's Mobility and Network Services businesses has been partially offset by a lower estimated valuation for its third-party battery business.\n\nAdditionally, the report hinted at Tesla's unrealized potential in airborne AI \u2013 the kind found in sectors such as aviation and marine that has not contributed to the company's valuation.",

            "content": "Michelle Weaver: Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Michelle Weaver, U.S. thematic and Equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nDevin McDermott: I'm Devin McDermott, Head of Morgan Stanley's North America Energy Team.\n\nMike Canfield: And I'm Mike Canfield, Head of the Europe Sustainability Team,\n\nMichelle Weaver: This is the second episode of our special miniseries, Big Debates, where we cover key investment debates for 2025. Today, we'll look at where we are in the energy transition and some key investment opportunities.\n\nIt's Monday, January 13th at 10am in New York.\n\nMike Canfield: And 3pm in London.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Since 2005, U.S. carbon emissions have fallen by about 15 percent. Nearly all of this has been tied to the power sector. Natural gas has been displacing coal. Renewable resources have seen higher penetration. When you look outside the power sector, though, progress has been a lot more limited.\n\nLet me come to you first, Devin. What is behind these trends, and where are we right now in terms of the energy transition in the U.S.?\n\nDevin McDermott: Over the last 20 years now, it's actually been a pretty steady trend for overall U.S. emissions. There's been gradual annual declines, ratcheting lower through much of this period. [There\u2019s] really two primary drivers.\n\nThe first is, the displacement of coal by natural gas, which is driven about 60 percent of this reduction over the period. And the remainder is higher penetration of renewable resources, which drive the remaining 40 percent. And this ratio between these two drivers -- net gas displacing coal, renewables adding to the power sector -- really hasn't changed all that much. It's been pretty consistent even in this post COVID recovery relative to the 15 years prior.\n\nOutside of power, there's been almost no progress, and it doesn't vary much depending on which end market you're looking at. Industrial missions, manufacturing, PetChem -- all relatively stable. And then the transport sector, which for the U.S. in particular, relative to many other markets and the rest of the world, is a big driver transport, a big driver of emissions. And there it's a mix of different factors. The biggest of which, though, driving the slow uptick in alternatives is the lack of viable economic options to decarbonize outside of fossil fuels. And the fact that in the U.S. specifically, there is a very abundant, low-cost base of natural gas; which is a low carbon, the lowest carbon fossil fuel, but still does have carbon intensity tied to it.\n\nMichelle Weaver: You've also argued that the domestic natural gas market is positioned for growth. What's your outlook for this year and beyond?\n\nDevin McDermott: The natural gas market has been a story of growth for a while now, but these last few years have had a bit of a pause on major expansion.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, that's when you saw the biggest uptick in natural gas penetration as a portion of primary energy in the U.S. The domestic market doubled in size over that 10-year period, and you saw growth in really every major end market power and decarbonization. There was a big piece of it. But the U.S. also transitioned from a major importer of LNG, which stands for liquefied natural gas, to one of the world's largest exporters by the end of last decade. And you had a lot of industrial and petrochemical growth, which uses natural gas as a feedstock.\n\nOver the last several years, globally, gas markets have faced a series of shocks, the biggest of which is the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Europe's loss of a significant portion of their gas supply, which historically had come on pipelines from Russia. To replace that, Europe bought a lot more LNG, drove up global prices, and in response to higher global prices, you saw a wave of new project sanctioning activity around the world. The U.S. is a key driver of that expansion cycle.\n\nThe U.S. over the next five years will double; roughly double, I should say, its export capacity. And that is an unprecedented amount of volume growth domestically, as well as globally, and will drive a significant uptick in domestic consumption.\n\nSo that the additional exports is pillar number one; and pillar number two, which I'd say is more of an emerging trend, is the rise of incremental power consumption. For the last 15 years, U.S. electricity consumption on a weather adjusted basis has not grown. But if you look out at forecasts from utilities, from various market operators in the country, you're now seeing a trend of growth for the balance of this decade and beyond tied to three key things.\n\nThe first is onshore manufacturing. The second is power demand tied to data centers and AI. And the third is this broader trend of electrification. So, a little bit from EV's, more electric appliances, which fit into this decarbonization theme more broadly. We're looking at now an outlet, this is our base case of U.S. electricity demand growing at just shy of 2 percent per year over the next five years. That is a growth rate that we have not seen this century. And natural gas, which generates about 40 percent of U.S. power today, will continue to be a key player in meeting this incremental demand. And that becomes then a second pillar of consumption growth for the domestic market.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And we're coming up on the inauguration here, and I think one really important question for investors is what's going to happen to the energy sector and to renewables when Trump takes office? What are you thinking here?\n\nDevin McDermott: Yes. Well, the policy that supports renewable development in the U.S., wind and solar specifically, has survived many different administrations, both Republican and Democratic. And there's actually several examples over the last 10 to 15 years of Republican controlled Congress extending both the production tax credit and investment tax credit for wind and solar.\n\nSo, our base case is no major change on deployments, but also unlikely to see any incremental supportive policy for these technologies. Instead, I think the focus will be on some of the other major themes that we've been talking about here.\n\nOne, there's currently a pause on new LNG export permits under the Biden administration that should be lifted shortly post Trump's inauguration. Second, there are greenhouse gas intensity limits on new power plant and existing power plant construction in the U.S. that will likely be lifted, under the incoming Trump administration. So, gas takes a larger share of incremental power needs under Trump than it would have under the prior status quo. And then lastly. Consistently over the last few years, penetration of electric vehicles and low carbon vehicles in general in the United States have fallen short of expectations.\n\nAnd interestingly, if you look at just the composition of new vehicles sold in the U.S. over the past years, nearly two-thirds were SUVs or heavier light duty vehicles that offset some of the other underlying trends of some uptick in EV penetration.\n\nUnder the prior Trump administration, there was a rollback of initiatives to improve the fuel economy of both light duty and heavy-duty transport. I would not be surprised if we see that same thing happen again, which means you have more longevity to gasoline, diesel, other fossil-based transport fuels. Which kind of put this all together -- significant growth for natural gas that could accelerate under Trump, more longevity to legacy businesses like gasoline and diesel for these incumbent energy companies is not a bad backdrop.\n\nTrade's still at double its historical discount versus the broader market. So, not a bad setup when you put it all together.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Great. Thank you, Devin. Mike, new policies under the second Trump administration will likely have an impact far beyond the U.S. And with a potential withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and increased greenhushing, many investors are starting to question whether companies may walk back or delay their sustainability ambitions.\n\nWill decarbonization still be a corporate priority or will the pace of the energy transition in Europe slow in 2025?\n\nMike Canfield: Yeah, that's the big question. The core issues for EU policymakers at the moment include things like competitiveness, climate change, security, digitalization, migration and the cost of living.\n\nAt the same time, Mario Draghi highlighted in his report entitled \u201cThe Future of European Competitiveness\u201d that there are three transformations Europe has to contend with: to become more innovative and competitive; to complete its energy transition; and to adapt to a backdrop of less stable geopolitics where dependencies are becoming vulnerabilities, to use his phrase.\n\nWe do still expect the EU's direction of travel on things like the Fit for 55 goals, its targets to address critical mineral supplies, and the overall net zero transition to remain consistent. And the UK's Labour Party has advocated for Clean Power 2030 goals of 95 percent clean generation sources.\n\nAt the same time, it's fair to say some commentators have pointed to the higher regulatory burden on EU corporates as a potentially damaging factor in competitiveness, suggesting that regulations are costly and can be overcomplicated, particularly for smaller companies. While we've already had a delay in the implementation of the EU's deforestation regulation, some questions do remain over other rules, including things like the corporate sustainability, due diligence directive, and the design of the carbon border adjustment mechanism or CBAM.\n\nWe're closely watching corporates themselves to see whether they'll reevaluate their investment plans or targets. One example we've actually already seen is in the metals and mining space where decarbonisation investment plans were adjusted because of inadequate green hydrogen infrastructure and policy concerns, such as the effectiveness of the CBAM.\n\nIt does remain committed to its long-term net zero goals. But the company has acknowledged that practical hurdles may delay achievement of its 2030 climate ambitions. We wouldn't be surprised to see other companies take an arguably more pragmatic, in inverted commas, approach to their goals, accepting that technology, infrastructure and policy might not really be ready in time to reach 2030 targets.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Do you believe there are still areas where the end markets will grow significantly and where companies still offer compelling opportunities?\n\nMike Canfield: Yeah, absolutely. We think sustainable investing continues to evolve and that, as with last year, stock selection will be key to generating alpha from the energy transition. We do see really attractive opportunities in enabling technologies across decarbonisation, whether that's segments like grid transmission and distribution, or in things like Industry 4.0.\n\nWe'd recommend focusing on companies with clear competitive moats and avoiding the relatively commoditized areas, as well as looking for strong pricing power, and those entities offering mission critical products or services for the transition. We do anticipate a continued investment focus on data center power dynamics in 2025 with cooling technology increasingly a topic of investor interest.\n\nBeyond the power generation component, the urgent need for investment in everything from electrical equipment to grid technologies, smart grid software and hardware solutions, and even cables is now increasingly apparent. We expect secular growth in these markets to continue apace in 2025.\n\nWithin Industry 4.0, we do think adoption of automation, robotics, machine learning, and the industrial Internet of Things is set to grow strongly this year as well. We also see further growth potential in other areas like energetic modernization in buildings, climate resilience, and the circular economy.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And with the current level of policy uncertainty has enthusiasm for green investing or the \u2018E\u2019 environmental pillar of ESG declined\n\nMike Canfield: I think evolved might be a fairer expression to use than declined. Certainly, reasonable to say that performance in some of the segments of the E pillar has been very challenging in the last 12 to 24 months -- with the headwinds from geopolitics, from the higher interest rate backdrop and inflation. At the same time, we have seen a transition towards improver investment strategies, and they're continuing to gain in popularity around the world.\n\nAs investors recognize that often the most attractive alpha opportunities are in the momentum, or direction of travel rather than simple, so-called positive screening for existing leaders in various spaces. To this end, the investors that we speak to are often focused on things like Capex trends for businesses as a way to determine how companies might actually be investing to deliver on their sustainability ambitions.\n\nBeyond those traditional E, areas like renewables or electric vehicles, we have therefore seen investors try to diversify exposures. So, broadening out to include things like the transition enablers, the grid technologies, HVAC -- that's heating, ventilation and cooling, products supporting energy efficiency in buildings, green construction and emerging technologies even, like small modular nuclear reactors alongside things like industrial automation.\n\nMichelle Weaver: And, given this evolution of the e pillar, do you think that creates an opportunity for the S or G, the social or governance components of ESG?\n\nMike Canfield: We do think the backdrop for socially focused investing is very strong. We see compelling opportunities in longevity across a lot of elements, things like advanced diagnostics, healthier foods, as well as digitalization, responsible AI, personal mobility, and even parts of social infrastructure. So things as basic as access to water, sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nOne topic we as a team have written extensively on in the last few months It's preventative health care, for example. So, while current health systems are typically built to focus on acute conditions and react to complications with pharmaceuticals or clinical care, a focus on preventative care would, at its most fundamental, address the underlying causes of illnesses to avoid problems from arising in the first place.\n\nWe argue that the economic benefits of a more effective health system is self evident, whether that's in terms of reducing the overall burden on the system, boosting the workforce or increasing productivity. Within preventative healthcare, we point to fascinating investment opportunities across innovative biopharma, things like smart chemotherapy, for example, alongside solutions like integrated diagnostics, effective use of AI and sophisticated telemedicine advances -- all of which are emerging to support healthy longevity and a much more personalized targeted health system.\n\nMichelle Weaver: Devin and Mike, thank you for taking the time to talk, and to our listeners, thanks for listening.

The stock is down 34 percent so far this year.\n\nThe losses have mostly been felt due to reports of decreased demand due to pushback against CEO Elon Musk and his support of President Trump, as well as investor concern over the CEO\u2019s personal use of time between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Tesla itself.\n\nIn a note this week from Wedbush, analyst Dan Ives wrote:\n\n\u201cMusk needs to step up as Tesla CEO at this critical juncture. In a nutshell, the word \u2018balance\u2019 has been missing with Elon Musk and his ability to run Tesla as CEO\u2026.while instead focusing all of his energy and time driving his DOGE initiative within the Trump Administration. Since Trump\u2019s White House 2nd term kicked off in January, we have seen Musk and Trump connected at the hip with Musk essentially living at the White House and Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. There has been little to no sign of Musk at any Tesla factory or manufacturing facility the last two months and perception has become reality for Tesla shares. Trump getting elected President was a huge moment for Musk and Tesla in our view as this will create the fast track for an autonomous federal roadmap\u2026however the DOGE efforts have now intertwined Tesla into this brewing political firestorm.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s slight bump for Tesla shares is likely related to the support the company received from President Trump yesterday, who purchased a Model S sedan at the White House and pledged to pay for it with a check.\n\nThe move was one that signaled a buying spree from high-profile Republicans, including Sean Hannity, among others, who announced their support for Musk and Tesla:\n\nAs promised yesterday, I Just ordered my new self driving Tesla!

The firm also estimated that the share was worth $800.\n\nTesla Shares Rises as Morgan Stanley Upgraded Price Target to $430\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's updated analysis, Tesla's dominance in the emerging autonomous mobility market comes from strengths in data collection, robotics, energy storage and AI infrastructure. It also noted the power of Tesla Mobility, the company's autonomous rideshare division, worth $90 per share in a revised sum of the parts (SOTP) analysis. It projects the division will have a fleet of 7.5 million vehicles there by 2040 and produce $1.46 per mile in revenue with a 29% EBITDA margin.\n\nAs the report underscored the rising significance of Tesla's Network Services recurring revenue, including supercharging and full Self Driving subscriptions, all paid for as a monthly service it also warned that its leadership may face an uphill battle to demonstrate the 'core configuration' of the business going forward. An area, equating to $168 per share, is expected to account for one-third of Tesla's EBITDA by 2030 and more than 60 percent of EBITDA by 2040.\n\nThe new price target comes after Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas said the increase in the valuations placed on Tesla's Mobility and Network Services businesses has been partially offset by a lower estimated valuation for its third-party battery business.\n\nAdditionally, the report hinted at Tesla's unrealized potential in airborne AI the kind found in sectors such as aviation and marine that has not contributed to the company's valuation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Tesla (TSLA) has experienced significant volatility recently, dropping 14% from its $479.86 peak on Dec. 17, yet the stock managed to rebound on Monday following a bullish outlook from Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Adam Jonas. Jonas, a noted Tesla proponent, has upped his price target for the company to $430 from $400, suggesting a 4.27% potential increase from the current $412.58 market price, while maintaining an \u2018overweight\u2019 rating and keeping Tesla as a \u201ctop pick.\u201d\n\nJonas\u2019s optimism is based on Tesla\u2019s expanding role in what he terms \u201cphysical AI,\u201d encompassing the company\u2019s strengths in data collection, robotics, energy storage, AI computing, and manufacturing. He argues that 2025 could be pivotal for Tesla, as the market begins to fully appreciate these capabilities despite the known challenges in the electric vehicle (EV) market for that year.\n\nCentral to Jonas\u2019s valuation is Tesla\u2019s \u201cnetwork services,\u201d which he sees as a significant growth driver. This segment includes autonomous driving features, charging infrastructure, vehicle maintenance, software updates, and media content. Jonas attributes $168 per share of his $430 price target to this aspect, indicating it constitutes 39% of Tesla\u2019s total valuation in his model. Interestingly, he values Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service slightly higher than its core automobile business, at $90 per share versus $89 for the latter.\n\nIn a more optimistic scenario, Jonas significantly increased his bull case target for Tesla to $800 per share from $600. Here, he envisions Tesla selling 7 million vehicles by 2030 with a 26% gross margin. In this scenario, the autonomous ridesharing service is projected to contribute $263 per share, or 33% of the total $800 valuation, highlighting the future potential of Tesla\u2019s mobility services over traditional car sales, which are pegged at $130 per share.\n\nJonas emphasizes that while the automotive segment remains crucial, it\u2019s the integration of AI into physical products \u2014 what he calls \u201cembodied AI\u201d \u2014 that he believes will be the primary driver for Tesla\u2019s stock price appreciation. This perspective not only reflects confidence in Tesla\u2019s current business model but also in its strategic direction towards becoming a leader in autonomous mobility and related services.\n\nThe analysis by Jonas at Morgan Stanley underscores a broader narrative in the investment community about Tesla\u2019s potential beyond being just an automaker. It positions Tesla within the AI and tech ecosystem, where the company\u2019s data advantage and infrastructure could lead to significant value creation through network services and autonomous technologies. This could set Tesla apart in an increasingly competitive EV landscape, where traditional metrics like vehicle sales and margins are complemented by innovative revenue streams from technology and services.\n\nPrice Action: Tesla shares experienced a positive trading session on Monday, closing at $403.31, up $8.57 or 2.17%. The stock continued to climb after hours, gaining an additional $9.44 or 2.34% to reach $412.58. With a market capitalization of $1.27 trillion, Tesla remains the world\u2019s 8th most valuable company. The stock has demonstrated strong performance over the past year, achieving an 84.25% year-over-year gain.\n\nThe 52-week trading range for Tesla shares has been between $138.80 and $488.54. Additionally, as of January 10, 2025, Tesla\u2019s price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stands at 193.51. This ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for Tesla shares, likely due to expectations of continued growth and innovation in the electric vehicle and clean energy markets.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

While the EV giant tried to combat anemic demand - which itself is a function of fierce new competition out of China - for its aging product lineup through much of 2023 and 2024 by instituting price cuts and offering incentivized financing, it has recently introduced refreshed versions of Model 3 and Model Y (Juniper), and is rumored to be working on an affordable hatchback model (Model Q) to combat persistent demand-related malaise.\n\nComing back, Jonas notes that much of the recent appreciation in Tesla's share price \"reflects its expanding leadership in physical AI, leveraging natural advantages in data collection, robotics, energy storage, AI/compute, manufacturing, and infrastructure,\" and compounded by \"synergies across Elon Musk's companies, such as SpaceX and xAI.\"\n\nJonas then delivers the following punchline:\n\n\"We see 2025 as a year where Tesla's unique skillset could be further reflected in its valuation, despite well-known challenges in the FY25 EV market.\"\n\nBeyond 2025, the Morgan Stanley analyst expects \"Tesla's total addressable market (TAM) to expand into broader domains, many of which are still not reflected in current financial models.\"\n\nBear in mind that Elon Musk appears to be increasingly banking on the EV giant's FSD capabilities and the Optimus humanoid robot to drive the narrative around Tesla shares.\n\nFor instance, Musk has already announced that the \"completely autonomous,\" unsupervised version of the FSD will roll out later this year, with the much-anticipated Cybercab officially launching in 2026. The recently launched, much-improved version 13 of the FSD has played an important role in bolstering the market's confidence in this projected timeline. Concurrently, the CEO of Tesla continues to hype up the Optimus humanoid robot, recently going so far as to declare that Tesla was aiming to produce between 50,000 and 100,000 units of the Optimus robot in 2026 \"and then 10x it again the following year.\n\nIn light of Tesla's \"embodied AI\" moves, Morgan Stanley has raised its price target for the stock from $400 to $430.

At the same time, it has led to unprecedented corporate borrowing, reaching US$415 billion.\n\nQuote: \"This report estimates that US$210 to US$250 billion of this surge consists of compulsory, preferential bank loans extended to defence contractors \u2013 many with poor credit \u2013 to help pay for war-related goods and services.\"\n\nMore details: At the start of the full-scale invasion, the off-budget financing scheme helped Russia maintain its military budget at a controllable level, misleading international experts into believing the country faced no financial issues in funding the war.\n\nHowever, Kennedy says Russia's current reliance on off-budget financing is creating problems, driving inflation and interest rate hikes.\n\nNow the scheme risks triggering a systemic crisis due to disproportionately high interest rates, liquidity and reserve problems at banks, and a severely compromised monetary transmission mechanism.\n\nKennedy emphasises that the longer Moscow delays ending the war in Ukraine, the closer it will move towards corporate and banking collapses which the Russian government would be forced to cover. These difficulties could also lead to a fall in GDP.\n\nKennedy argues that Western resources can surpass Russia's capacity to sustain a war of attrition against Ukraine. He calls for continued support for Ukraine and tougher sanctions, and rejects any notion of sanctions being lifted in exchange for a ceasefire.\n\nQuote: \"Moscow\u2019s funding challenges only increase from here, especially if coalition countries enforce more fully the powerful energy sanction tools at their disposal.\n\nThrough continued resolve and a clear understanding of Moscow\u2019s vulnerabilities, Ukraine and its allies can realise the full potential of their negotiating leverage, avoid making unnecessary concessions, and reduce the longer-term risks posed by Russian revanchism.\"\n\nBackground: Sanctions against Russia, combined with widespread corruption, labour shortages, the costs of the war in Ukraine and the inefficiency of its defence industry, are undermining the Russian Federation's ability to sustain both its defence sector and economic stability.\n\nSupport UP or become our patron!",

            "content": "The performance of Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is expected to have been decent in the fourth quarter of 2024, supported by increased client activity and market volatility. Thus, the company\u2019s trading numbers are likely to have provided some support to its quarterly results, slated to be announced before the opening bell on Jan. 16.\n\n\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, the likelihood of continued decent economic expansion, cooling inflation and easing monetary policy drove client activity. Further, volatility was high in equity markets but was decent in other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. Thus, Morgan Stanley is likely to have recorded robust growth in trading revenues.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.38 billion, suggesting a rise of 8.2% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $1.78 billion indicates year-over-year growth of 24%.\n\n\n\nOur estimates for fourth-quarter equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.78 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively.\n\nOther Factors to Influence Morgan Stanley\u2019s Q4 Earnings\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Following the weakness in 2022 and 2023, global mergers and acquisitions (M&As) witnessed a marked improvement in the fourth quarter of 2024. Both deal value and volume were robust during the quarter, driven by solid financial performance, robust U.S. economic growth, buoyant markets and interest rate cuts. Further, the potential easing of regulatory oversight on M&As by the incoming Trump administration fueled deal-making activities. Nonetheless, lingering geopolitical issues remained a concern. Also, Morgan Stanley\u2019s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have supported advisory fees in the quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $593.2 million, suggesting a year-over-year fall of 15.5% on record fees earned last year. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $613.1 million.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the IPO market saw signs of cautious optimism driven by market volatility and global monetary easing. The impressive equity market performance drove some solid activity in follow-up equity issuances. Further, bond issuance volume was decent on advantageous economic conditions and corporate spreads at near historical lows despite seasonally slow volumes in December. Hence, Morgan Stanley\u2019s underwriting fees are expected to have increased in the quarter.\n\n\n\nThe consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $515.2 million, suggesting a 31.8% surge. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $360.6 million indicates a jump of 60.3%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $875.8 million implies a rise of 42.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\n\n\nOur estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $586.4 million, whereas the same for equity underwriting fees is $395.4 million.\n\n\n\nThus, growth in total IB income is likely to have been impressive, driven by the expected rise in underwriting revenues and advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.62 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 22.8%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.59 billion.\n\n\n\nNet Interest Income (NII): The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points since September 2024. This is expected to have offered support to Morgan Stanley\u2019s NII growth prospects as funding/deposit costs gradually stabilize. Further, the central bank signaled two more rate cuts this year. Hence, the overall lending scenario is likely to have improved.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $2.09 billion, suggesting a rise of 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $2.19 billion.\n\n\n\nExpenses: Cost reduction, which has long been Morgan Stanley's main strategy for remaining profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the December quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have been elevated. Also, as the company is expected to have recorded robust revenue growth, compensation related to it would have risen.\n\n\n\nWe expect total non-interest expenses of $11.04 billion, implying a 2.2% year-over-year increase.",

Haddad Brands, the buyer, plans to occupy a portion of the property and lease the remainder, Newmark said.\n\nMorgan Stanley bought the roughly 1.2 million-square-foot property for $519.4 million in 2007, which translates to a 31% discount in its sale to Haddad, according to CoStar data. Haddad, which makes and distributes children\u2019s clothing for brands including Nike and Levi\u2019s, is currently based at 100 W. 33rd St., according to its website.\n\nThe Class A, 29-story 2 Park, is within a 10-minute walk from both Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station. The art deco property features amenities including a 27th-story penthouse lounge and outdoor terrace, a ground-floor lobby, a conference center and bike parking.\n\nThe transaction comes as discounted office sales have been seen in cities from New York to Chicago. For instance, just a block south of 2 Park, a century-old Manhattan office property at 470 Park Ave. S known for its cast-iron clock featuring a wizard sold at a 40% reduction in price.\n\nNearby Times Square, UBS in October sold its property at 135 W. 50th St. for $8.5 million, a sliver of the $332.5 million it paid for in 2006, according to CoStar data.\n\nIn Chicago, three year-end transactions were also made at major discounts to pricing the last time the buildings traded.\n\nTenants aren\u2019t just shopping office properties. For instance, fashion brands from Uniqlo to luxury label Prada have also bought prime Fifth Avenue retail properties in Manhattan that house their flagships.\n\nOccupier-owner transactions rose 36% in the first three quarters of last year as more companies opt to purchase properties for a discount rather than lease, Newmark said.\n\nFor the record\n\nNewmark co-heads of U.S. capital markets Adam Spies and Doug Harmon; executive vice chairmen Adam Doneger, Marcella Fasulo and Josh King; executive managing director Avery Silverstein; and director Willis Robbins represented the seller, Morgan Stanley.\n\nLaw firm Fried Frank advised Haddad on its acquisition.

            "content": "Wall Street newcomers are often highly successful.\n\nBut Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson says a key to success is learning to accept failures.\n\nAlways being ready to up your game as you get promoted is also crucial, he said.\n\nIf you're just getting started in your career on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson has some tough love to share with you: life's only going to get harder.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in December, Wilson listed a couple pieces of advice he gives to his new hires, interns, and even his kids.\n\nNumber one: you're not going to be as successful as you're used to being. Landing a job at an investment bank or research firm is an achievement, with a stellar academic record often being a prerequisite. So many youngsters entering banking are accustomed to outperforming. But failing is a fact of life in banking, Wilson said.\n\n\"A lot of people coming to Wall Street are overachievers,\" Wilson said. \"I say, 'My guess is your historical report card has very few Bs on it. Maybe none. And definitely no Cs. And so what you're going to have to get used to coming to Wall Street is you're going to get a bunch of Fs, and you can't even fathom what that feels like.\"\n\nHow you adjust to that feeling will be one factor in how successful you become, he said.\n\n\"You picked the stock, it went to zero, everybody knows you made a mistake. How are you going to deal with that?\" Wilson said.\n\n\"The best investors generally get 55% of their calls correct,\" he continued. \"There are a lot of dynamics that play into being a good investor, a good analyst, a good strategist. But I think the hardest one is learning how to accept failure, learning how to be wrong, admit it, and move on. Acknowledge your mistakes.\"\n\nWilson, who is also Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, has put his advice to use in recent years. He was one of the most accurate market forecasters in 2022 amid a market sell-off, but his ongoing bearishness caught up with him in 2023 when the market turned around. He issued a mea culpa, offering more bullish price targets since then alongside the ongoing stock-market rally.\n\nAs for his second piece of advice, Wilson said to be ready to continually up your game as you become more successful.\n\n\"I have two sons in their 20s, and I always kid around with them. When they're successful at work, I say, 'Congratulations, you're gonna make it to the next level. Guess what: It's going to be harder,'\" Wilson said.\n\nBut that's not necessarily a bad thing, he said.\n\n\"That's life. Every rung is harder, and that's the thrill of it, too, because you're competing at a higher level,\" he said. \"If you're successful, you just understand that dynamic, and that's something I think young people need to know \u2014 what exactly they're signing up for.\"\n\nIn the interview, Wilson also shared more general career advice that can apply to people outside of the financial industry as well: stand up for ideas that you have high conviction in. In his role, that means sometimes issuing calls against consensus. He called this taking personal risk.\n\n\"You've got to be willing to go take a stand on stuff, whether it's in a meeting, with people you report to, pointing out things that you don't agree with, kind of making a firm stance,\" Wilson said.",

The group will join Raymond James\u2019 employee advisor channel, which is designed for wirehouse breakaways.\n\nAccording to the firm, the Veitch team works with near- and current retirees, estates, trusts and corporate retirement plans. According to David Veitch, moving to Raymond James will help the family practice build on its legacy.\n\n\u201cThe firm\u2019s culture was a key factor in our decision to transition, as it mirrors our own values and client-first mentality,\u201d David Veitch said in a statement.\n\nDavid has over 50 years of industry experience, including 15 years with Morgan Stanley before joining Raymond James. Drew Veitch entered the industry in 2015 at Morgan Stanley after 10 years working in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Veitch team isn\u2019t the first wirehouse team to move to Raymond James this week, as St. Petersburg, Fla.-based advisor Mary Lauritano also opted to join the firm from UBS. Lauritano manages about $525 million and will be joined by a duo of client services associates working out of the Raymond James Carillon branch in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe firm is nearing the day when Chief Financial Officer Paul Shoukry is expected to succeed CEO Paul Reilly as head of the company; the move was announced last year as part of a broader \u201cmulti-year succession planning process.\u201d\n\nReilly will step down on Feb. 20 after the firm\u2019s board voted in favor of the proposed succession plan last month. The firm also promoted Tom Walrond to lead the firm\u2019s employee advisor channel (the same channel that the Veitch team and Lauritano joined).\n\nLast year, Raymond James also announced its investment management arm would launch its first ETFs in 2025. To prepare, the firm hired Mo Sparks, a former director of exchange-traded products with the New York Stock Exchange, to the newly created role of head of exchange-traded funds.\n\nWhile the firm didn\u2019t have immediate plans to convert existing mutual funds into ETFs, it would consider putting \u201chigh-demand investment strategies\u201d into ETF wrappers. However, the firm won\u2019t incentivize its advisors to recommend or use home-grown ETFs with clients, nor would they get any fee discounts.",

            "content": "Last month, Citi promoted its largest cohort of managing directors in six years. Goldman Sachs in November elevated its most robust set of partners in 14. (That\u2019s seven two-year cycles.)\n\nBy the numbers, it may sound underwhelming that Morgan Stanley\u2019s newest group of managing directors, announced Wednesday, is the bank\u2019s biggest in just two years. But it reflects market trends in more ways than one.\n\nThe 173 promotions represent a 11.6% increase over last year\u2019s 155. But Morgan Stanley elevated 184 MDs in 2023 and 199 in 2022.\n\nBy comparison, Citi elevated 344 MDs, a 13.1% jump from the previous year. Bank of America\u2019s 387 MD promotions, announced in December, marked a 15.9% increase over the previous year. And Goldman\u2019s 95 newly minted partners represent an 18.8% increase over the 80 named in 2022.\n\nThe collective uptick comes amid an anticipated increase in dealmaking. A second Trump presidency is expected to bring a more business-friendly environment, replete with regulatory de-escalation. That may prompt more clients to lean into mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBut the banks\u2019 deeper bench of managing directors may also reflect their own healthier bottom lines \u2013 if stock value is to be taken as a benchmark. Over the past year, Morgan Stanley\u2019s share price has climbed 37.9% \u2013 slightly ahead of Bank of America and Citi\u2019s 36.6% and 36.0% jumps, respectively, though not quite on par with the 50.8% increase seen at Goldman.\n\nBy such measures, Morgan Stanley isn\u2019t falling short by not promoting a record number of MDs. Rather, the banking sector, as it often does, is moving in lock-step.\n\nThere are some variables Morgan Stanley measures differently than its peers. Including the new additions, women will represent 27% of managing directors at Morgan Stanley, according to Bloomberg. Other banks, by contrast, may highlight an increase in diversity by disclosing what percentage of new MDs are women, or any other underrepresented group.\n\nMore than half of MDs elevated by Bank of America last month were women or people of color, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, noting that 2024 was the fifth consecutive year that historically underrepresented groups comprised the majority of promotions to that rank.\n\nCiti, likewise, noted that 28.5% of its new MDs are women, and 44.8% are of a racially or ethnically diverse background. Goldman in November touted its \u201clargest number of diverse new partners\u201d \u2013 26 women, 17 Asians, six with a Hispanic or Latinx background, four Black people and three veterans. By percentage, that cohort is 27% women, about 4% Black, roughly 6% Hispanic and 18% Asian. Three of those figures represent a downward trend from 2022.\n\nBy comparison, 3% of new MDs at Morgan Stanley are Black, according to Bloomberg. Investment bankers comprised the largest share of new MDs: about 46% of new additions are from Morgan Stanley\u2019s institutional securities group, the wire service reported.",

Any returns displayed are gross figures and as such, do not take into account fees and other expenses, including advisory fees, the deduction of which, when compounded over a period of years, would decrease returns. Information regarding Morgan Stanley standard advisory fees is available in the Form ADV Part 2, at www.morganstanley.com/adv.\n\nThis report is based on tax law in effect at the time of its publication. Subsequent changes in tax law may have an impact on the strategies outlined.\n\nGiven the impact of individual circumstances on the assessment of federal gift and estate tax, such as the amount of lifetime exemption used and size of overall estate, we exclude estate taxes from scenarios below that are focused on wealth transfer after the investor passes away.\n\nMethodology for added return estimates\n\nTax-rate assumption: Unless otherwise stated, the tax rates assumed throughout the report are as follows: a 37% federal tax bracket, 3.8% net investment income tax rate (Medicare surtax) and 5.2% state tax rate.\n\nCapital Market Assumptions: Unless otherwise stated, asset return assumptions are based on the Global Investment Committee\u2019s (GIC\u2019s) capital market assumptions (published March 2024). Return scenarios are simulated using Monte Carlo analysis, with the GIC\u2019s strategic assumptions used for the first seven years and secular assumptions used afterward. For additional detail, please see the 2024 \u201cAnnual Update of GIC Capital Market Assumptions.\u201d\n\nSimulation: Unless otherwise stated, estimates for each strategy are modeled using 10,000 simulations of different market scenarios, using Monte Carlo analysis and the GIC\u2019s capital market assumptions. We report median internal rate of return (IRR) improvement as estimates of value-add in Exhibit 1 and provide estimates for a range of outcomes based on the 32nd percentile and 68th percentile IRR improvement (unless otherwise specified).\n\nTax-Advantaged Account: Our estimate for value-add is modeled as follows: Assume an investor could invest assets in either a taxable account or a common government-sponsored tax-advantaged retirement account. We compare the performance across both account types, measuring the post-liquidation values after 40 years of simulated growth. Both account types hold the same asset allocation of 50% equities, 20% fixed income and 30% alternatives. We calculate IRR for the tax-advantaged account by measuring the after-tax equivalent amount of the initial contribution and the post-liquidation value in order to calculate annualized gain. The IRR of the taxable account is measured similarly, though the initial investment is sized as an equivalent after-tax dollar amount assuming 100% cost basis.\n\nMunicipal Bonds: Our estimate for value-add is based on the historical average spread between the after-tax equivalent yield of 10-year US Treasury bonds and 10-year municipal bonds, measured between Jan. 5, 2001 and Sept. 9, 2024.\n\nDirect Indexing/Tax-Loss Harvesting: Our simulation follows the method described in the June 2024 report, \u201cDirect Indexing: Opportunities for Customization and Potential Tax Alpha.\u201d Our estimate for value-add is calculated as the post-liquidation IRR for a direct indexing strategy, assuming fees of 30 basis points per year. Our simulation runs 100 trials, with 10,000 iterations in each trial, in order to calculate the average IRR benefit across the 100 trials. We then compare this IRR to a baseline that is invested in a passively managed ETF, modeled as having zero fees and expenses. The simulation horizon used is five years.\n\nExchange Funds: Our estimate assumes that an investor owns a concentrated position that has a cost basis equal to 10% of its current market value and seeks to diversify into broad market exposure using an exchange fund. We calculate value-add as the difference in IRR between a scenario in which the investor exchanges their current concentrated position for shares in an exchange fund and a scenario in which they liquidate their concentrated position and invest the after-tax proceeds into 100% passive US equity exposure. In both cases, return assumptions follow the GIC\u2019s 2024 capital market assumptions and assume 0% turnover. The simulation horizon is 20 years. We assume that the exchange fund is held for seven years, that its underlying holdings are composed of 80% passive US equity and 20% private real estate exposure and that it charges an annual account fee of 0.92% of assets under management during the seven years. After seven years, the investor\u2019s shares in the exchange fund are redeemed in exchange for a basket of diversified US equity shares, which the investor holds for an additional 13 years.\n\nTax-Aware Long-Short Strategies: Our estimates source assumptions for the pace and magnitude of realized net capital loss possible in this strategy from \u201cBeyond Direct Indexing: Dynamic Direct Long-Short Investing\u201d (cited below), following the authors\u2019 analysis of a \u201crelaxed-constraint\u201d method and the 150%/50% long/short leverage approach. Our calculations assume an investment horizon of ten years and rely on the GIC\u2019s secular capital market assumptions for US equities. We conservatively assume that there is no additional investment alpha provided by the manager of the long-short strategy, and thus our estimates represent only the tax alpha added. Total expenses are assumed to be 1%. We calculate value-add by measuring the cumulative realized net capital loss and assume that funds grow tax-deferred. After 10 years, assets are liquidated and taxes paid. The estimated range shown in Exhibit 1 relies on the 90th percentile and 10th percentile of cumulative net capital loss, sourced from the report, in the same calculation described above.\n\nInvestment-Only Variable Annuity: Our estimate for value-add assumes that an equivalent amount of after-tax funds ($1 million) is invested in either an IOVA (bought in a nonqualified account) or a taxable account. Both strategies are invested in a 100% active equity portfolio with an annual turnover rate of 100% and are held for 40 years. Based on prevailing prices, we assume that the IOVA charges 0.95% of assets under management annually. After 40 years, we assume that gains in the IOVA are taxed as ordinary income in order to calculate post-liquidation value. We then calculate the IRR for each strategy and use the difference to represent the added return potential of an IOVA.\n\nIndexed and Variable Universal Life Insurance: Our estimates for value-add assume an equal amount of assets ($400,000) is used to either buy life insurance, contributed as premiums over a period of 10 years, or invested in a taxable account. The taxable account is assumed to be invested in investment grade bonds to compare with Index Universal Life insurance (IUL) and invested in equities to compare with variable universal life insurance (VUL). We calculate IRR based on each insurance policies\u2019 tax-free death benefits and compare these IRRs to the IRR achieved using the taxable portfolio\u2019s ending value, assuming a cost basis step-up (equal to pre-liquidated value) upon the account holder\u2019s death at age 85.\n\nLife insurance quotes assume the policyholder is a 45-year-old male non-tobacco user. Premiums are paid for both insurance policy types in a size of $40,000 per year for 10 years. These premiums are subject to a premium-based administrative charge and a sales charge that sum to 10% and 4.75% for IUL and VUL policies, respectively, plus a transaction charge of 9.5% and 3.7%, respectively, calculated against the remaining premium amount. During the first 10 years, both policies offer an initial death benefit of $619,564. After 10 years, the death benefit option in both life insurance contracts is switched from an increasing amount to a level amount, subject to the minimum required death benefit defined in US Code \u00a77702.\n\nWe assume that both IUL and VUL policies also charge a policy expense of $144 per year. The monthly cost of insurance rate varies by age, ranging from 0.00767% at age 46 to 0.01902% at age 85 and is sourced from the Prudential CPII Specimen Contract document (as of September 2024) to represent current prices available. For the IUL policy, we assume the subaccount credit rate is linked to the price performance of the MSCI All County World Index and subject to a floor rate of 0% and a cap at 10.25% per year.\n\nPrivate Placement Variable Annuity: Our estimates of value-add assume that an equal amount of assets ($1 million) is invested in either a private placement variable annuity (PPVA) or a taxable account and assume that 100% of funds are invested in alternatives, modeled as broad hedge funds, within each structure. IRRs are based on the liquidated values for both the PPVA and the taxable account, after a simulated holding period of 40 years. Representative of current prices, we assume that the PPVA charges a 1% sales load. Separate account charges are applied every year, including an account maintenance charge and an asset-based distribution charge. Current account maintenance charge is modeled as follows: 0.30% for assets below $20 million, 0.25% for assets between $20 million and $40 million, and 0.20% for assets of $40 million or more. The current asset-based distribution charge is modeled as follows: 0.05% for assets below $25 million and 0.00% for $25 million or more.\n\nPrivate Placement Life Insurance: Our estimates of value-add assume that an equal amount of assets ($3 million) is invested in either private placement life insurance (PPLI) or a taxable account, assuming 100% of funds are invested in alternatives, modeled as broad hedge funds, within each structure. We assume the investor begins at age 50 and dies at age 90, for a 40-year investment horizon in both scenarios. IRRs for PPLI are based on the amount distributed, income tax-free, after the policyholder\u2019s death and are compared to the IRR of the taxable portfolio, measured using its ending value after the same period of time and assuming a step-up in cost basis (equal to pre-liquidation value) upon death of the account holder.\n\nWe model the PPLI premium as $1,000,000 per year for three years, with an initial death benefit of $12,527,000. Sales load, deferred acquisition charge and state premium tax are each charged on the premium. Sales load charge is 1.75% for a premium below $2.5 million and 1.25% for a premium from $2.5 million to $5 million. Deferred acquisition charge is 0.7%, and state premium tax is 2.0%. Cost of insurance (COI) charge is based on client\u2019s age and health as well as net value at risk. Separate account charges are applied every year, including an account maintenance charge and an asset-based distribution charge. Current account maintenance charge is 0.20% for years 1-10, 0.15% for years 11-20 and 0.1% for years 21 and beyond. Current asset-based distribution charge is 0.3% for assets below $25 million, 0.2% for assets from $25 million to $50 million and 0.15% for $50 million or more.\n\nAsset Location: Our estimates assume that the investor holds assets across multiple account types and structures, including both taxable and tax-deferred accounts, as well as (in the asset-location scenario) an investment-only variable annuity, with a time horizon of 20 years. We assume that the investor maintains an aggregate asset allocation of 60% equities and 40% fixed income in both scenarios, but the location of each underlying asset is varied across the baseline and asset-location scenarios.\n\nOur baseline scenario follows a pro-rata asset allocation for both account types. This asset allocation includes 15% investment grade fixed income, 20% municipal bonds, 5% high yield bonds, 30% passive equities, 25% active equities and 5% REITs. In the asset location scenario, each account\u2019s allocations vary. The taxable account holds 40% municipal bonds and 60% passive equity; the tax-deferred account holds 30% investment grade fixed income, 10% high yield bonds, 50% active equities and 10% REITs.\n\nTurnover rates generally follow 2024 GIC assumptions, though we assume a turnover of 10% for low-turnover equity managers and 100% for high-turnover equity managers. During the asset accumulation period, investors stay in the 37% federal tax bracket, with a 5.2% state tax and a 3.8% net investment income tax. At the end of the investment horizon, portfolio values are evaluated using their after tax-equivalent amount, assuming that the investors are in the 24% federal tax bracket and subject to a 5.2% state tax. Investment-only variable annuity fee is assumed to be 0.95% per year.\n\nIntelligent Withdrawals and Income Smoothing: Our estimates for value-add assume that an investor holds a 60% equity, 40% fixed income portfolio across multiple account types, including taxable and tax-deferred accounts, as well as an investment-only variable annuity, and that the order and magnitude of withdrawals across these accounts is varied by the investor.\n\nWe allow for 20 years of asset growth in each scenario, with $1.5 million of assets distributed across accounts as in the \u201casset location\u201d example described above. We do not model additional contributions during this accumulation period. After these 20 years, withdrawals begin in order to provide retirement income. We calculate the annual withdrawal amount as equal to 4% of the aggregate portfolio\u2019s pre-tax value at retirement, plus an annual adjustment for the cost of living (following inflation). We assume that withdrawals continue for 30 years.\n\nIn the baseline scenario, we assume that withdrawals occur systematically, with withdrawals sized pro-rata from each account based on the assets held in each account. In the \u201cintelligent withdrawal\u201d scenario, we assume that withdrawals are taken from the taxable account first, then from the tax-deferred retirement account and IOVA in pro-rata amounts, and from the Roth last.\n\nThe \u201cincome smoothing\u201d scenario is designed to be similar to the intelligent withdrawal scenario, but in this case, we convert funds from the tax-deferred retirement account to a Roth account. The amount converted is determined such that, when combined with other sources of realized income each year, the upper threshold for the 12% tax bracket is reached.\n\nDuring the wealth accumulation period of all scenarios, we assume that the investor remains in the 37% federal tax bracket and is subject to a 5.2% state tax and 3.8% net investment income tax. During the subsequent retirement phase, we calculate the investor\u2019s federal tax bracket based on the withdrawal amount (and account type), alongside a yearly Social Security payment\u2014of $40,000 in the first year of retirement and adjusted for inflation afterward (Social Security subject to the 5.2% state tax and federal income tax).\n\nIncome tax brackets are based on the 2024 rates for a taxpayer that claims \u201cmarried, filed jointly\u201d status, and the tax brackets are assumed to grow with inflation.\n\nInflation rate is assumed to be 2.36% per year, per the GIC\u2019s 2024 capital market assumptions.\n\nPortfolios are rebalanced each year within each account type, after the yearly spending amount is withdrawn.\n\nUnrealized tax liabilities are subtracted from portfolio ending values to calculate IRR.\n\nAdded Return and Wealth Accumulation Estimates for Hypothetical Investor\n\nWe use Monte Carlo analysis to simulate 10,000 capital market scenarios in order to estimate the value-add from using tax-efficient investing techniques. These simulations produce a range of investment outcomes that inform our estimates for each category of technique: enrolling in tax-advantaged accounts, leveraging tax efficient strategies for taxable assets and applying portfolio-level tax strategies. These exhibits show the median outcome of these simulations, assuming a holding period of 20 years.\n\nIn the baseline scenario, we assume the investor has $10,000,000 in taxable assets and a target asset allocation of 20% investment grade fixed income, 30% passively managed equities, 20% actively managed equities and 30% alternatives (modeled as broad hedge funds). $1 million of the taxable assets to be invested is assumed to be a concentrated stock position that has significantly appreciated from cost basis and assumed to be 10% of its market value. We assume that the investor seeks to exit this concentrated position and diversify it into broad, passively managed equity exposure. In this baseline scenario, we model a liquidation of this position, incurring capital gains taxes, in order to reallocate the remaining after-tax proceeds into passively managed equities.\n\nThe next sequential modeling step modifies the previous scenario to estimate the potential impact of using tax-advantaged accounts. Here, we assume that the investor has accumulated $500,000 of their initial assets in a Roth account and $926,000 in a traditional retirement account (equivalent to $500,000 on an after-tax basis), with the remaining $9,000,000 in a taxable account. All three account types follow the same asset allocation as in the baseline scenario. Similarly, we assume that the $1,000,000 concentrated position in a single stock is liquidated at the beginning of the simulation and invested in passively managed equities, realizing capital gains and paying the associated taxes at that point.\n\nThe next modeling step applies tax-efficient strategies to the $9,000,000 held in taxable accounts. Here, we assume that the investor replaces their taxable fixed income holdings with municipal bonds that are exempt from federal and state taxes as well as the net investment income tax. We also assume that they deposit the concentrated $1,000,000 position in a single stock into an exchange fund, in return receiving proportional exposure to the exchange fund\u2019s performance, which we model as 80% passively managed, broad US equity exposure and 20% private real estate exposure. The remaining $2,000,000 of exposure sought in passively managed equities is achieved using direct indexing vehicles for the first five years of the horizon, followed by a buy-and-hold strategy with minimum turnover after that. We also assume that the investor allocates $1,000,000 to an investment-only variable annuity (assuming a pro-rata underlying asset allocation); and for alternatives exposure, $3,000,000 to a private placement variable annuity. The fees for both vehicles are assumed to be the same as those used in the modeling of Exhibit 1. The underlying exposure of the PPVA is modeled to be 100% invested in alternatives (modeled as broad hedge fund exposure). All other accounts and the IOVA are assumed to have the same pro-rata allocation of 28.6% municipal bonds, 42.8% passive equities and 28.6% active equities.\n\nOur final step models portfolio-level tax strategies, in this case \u201casset location\u201d (intelligent withdrawals and income smoothing are not applicable to accumulation-focused strategies). To implement this technique, we modify the underlying holdings of the different account types such that the Roth account, traditional retirement account and IOVA each hold 100% of their funds in actively managed equities, while the taxable account is assumed to hold 40% of funds in municipal bonds and the remaining 60% in passively managed equities.\n\nAs in the previous exhibits, asset growth rates are based on the GIC\u2019s 2024 capital market assumptions. We follow the strategic assumptions for the first seven years of the horizon and in the remaining years follow the secular assumptions. Turnover rates generally follow GIC 2024 assumptions, though we assume a turnover rate of 10% for low-turnover equity managers and 100% for high-turnover equity managers.\n\nDuring the asset accumulation period of the simulations, we assume that the investor remains in the 37% federal tax bracket, with a 5.2% state tax and a 3.8% net investment income tax. At the end of the investment horizon, portfolio values are represented as their after-tax equivalent amounts, and we assume that the investor is in the 24% federal tax bracket, with a 5.2% state tax and 3.8% net investment income tax.\n\nCitations\n\nLiberman, Joseph and Krasner, Stanley and Sosner, Nathan and Maia de Freitas, Pedro Paulo, Beyond Direct Indexing: Dynamic Direct Long-Short Investing (May 3, 2023).

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.\n\nInterest on municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax; however, some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Also, municipal bonds acquired in the secondary market at a discount may be subject to the market discount tax provisions, and therefore could give rise to taxable income. Typically, state tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s state of residence and, if applicable, local tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one\u2019s city of residence. The tax-exempt status of municipal securities may be changed by legislative process, which could affect their value and marketability.\n\nInsurance does not pertain to market values which will fluctuate over the life of the bonds; it covers only the timely payment of interest and principal. Credit quality varies depending on the specific issuer and insurer.\n\nVariable Annuities\n\nVariable annuities are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains the investment objectives, risks, fees, charges and expenses, and other information regarding the variable annuity contract and the underlying investments, which should be considered carefully before investing. Prospectuses for both the variable annuity contract and the underlying investments are available from your Financial Advisor. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.\n\nVariable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes and may be subject to market fluctuations, investment risk, and possible loss of principal. All guarantees, including optional benefits, are based on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not apply to the underlying investment options.\n\nOptional riders may not be able to be purchased in combination and are available at an additional cost. Some optional riders must be elected at time of purchase. Optional riders may be subject to specific limitations, restrictions, holding periods, costs, and expenses as specified by the insurance company in the annuity contract.\n\nIf you are investing in a variable annuity through a tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an IRA, you will get no additional tax advantage from the variable annuity. Under these circumstances, you should only consider buying a variable annuity because of its other features, such as lifetime income payments and death benefits protection.\n\nTaxable distributions (and certain deemed distributions) are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59 \u00bd, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Early withdrawals will reduce the death benefit and cash surrender value.\n\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC offers insurance products in conjunction with its licensed insurance agency affiliates.\n\nYields are subject to change with economic conditions.

Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nValue investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.\n\nIRS rules stipulate that if a security is sold by an investor at a tax loss, the tax loss will not be currently usable if the investor has acquired (or has entered into a contract or option on) the same or substantially identical securities 30 days before or after the sale that generated the loss.

            "content": "This vacation company\u2019s ops are split into two main categories, vacation ownership and travel & membership. The vacation ownership portfolio serves more than 800,000 timeshare owners, with properties at more than 270 resorts and vacation spots around the world. The travel & membership portfolio is based on a vacation exchange platform with 3.5 million members. Through the exchange, these members have access to over 4,000 resorts in 100 countries.\n\nThe first stock we\u2019ll look at here is Travel + Leisure Company, an Orlando-based timeshare company founded in 2006 and conducting operations at resort destinations worldwide. Travel + Leisure\u2019s primary focus is on developing, selling, and managing timeshare properties, mainly located in prime vacation spots. The company\u2019s operations are conducted through a range of brand names, including such well-known ones as Wyndham, Margaritaville, and Worldmark.\n\nPutting these sentiments into concrete terms, Grambling has picked two specific timeshare stocks as particularly attractive right now \u2013 and he\u2019s not shy about recommending both as Buys. Let\u2019s open up the TipRanks database and see how the Morgan Stanley view on these stocks stacks up against the broader Wall Street view.\n\n\u201cBoth consumers and investors alike often view timeshare skeptically, but the more stable-than-feared nature of the business and potential for attractive returns relative to rates can facilitate periods of outsized share price performance,\u201d Grambling opined. \u201cCurrently, the stocks are coming off an unprecedented three years of underperformance amid rising rates and normalizing leisure demand. We see potential for a return to stable growth from here vs. consensus flat, leading us to skew net positive on the stocks in 2025 but structural concerns and idiosyncratic changes to businesses warrant being tactical.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Stephen Grambling, covering the timeshare leisure sector for Morgan Stanley, notes that timeshare stocks are frequently underappreciated by investors \u2013 but that the industry is on the cusp of a bullish cycle.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s not surprising that timeshares have underperformed in recent years, consumers are starting to move back into them \u2013 and that opens an opportunity for investors.\n\nThis first half of the 2020s has been difficult for timeshare stocks. The shutdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic were followed by rising inflation and rising interest rates, which all pushed down hard on consumer demand. But the pandemic is well behind us now; inflation, while still slightly above the Fed\u2019s target rate, appears to be stabilizing; and the central bank is back to cutting rates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTurning to the company\u2019s financial results, we find that TNL\u2019s last reported quarter, 3Q24, had a top line of $993 million in total revenues. This was relatively flat year-over-year, and missed the forecast by $17 million. At the bottom line, the company realized a non-GAAP EPS of $1.57. This company has, in recent months, shown strong cash generation. In the nine months ending with September 30, 2024, the company\u2019s $266 million adj. free cash flow was more than triple the FCF from the first nine months of 2023 \u2013 and in Q3, the company generated $154 million of that free cash flow.\n\nOf particular interest to investors, Travel + Leisure continued its policy of returning capital to shareholders. In Q3, the company returned $105 million, through $70 million worth of share repurchases and $35 million in dividend payments. The last dividend declaration was made on November 6 and was paid out on December 13. The 50-cent common share dividend annualizes to $2 per share, and gives a forward yield of 3.9%.\n\nFor Morgan Stanley\u2019s Grambling, there are several important points to keep in mind on this stock. \u201cTNL\u2019s strategic pivot to focusing on higher FICO customers even at the expense of growth near term is finally paying off with an improvement in owner growth and potential for structurally lower defaults/ provision,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cMoreover, despite apparent stabilization in the membership segment, the stock still trades at a compelling 8.0x NTM P/E and 14% FCF yield. Look for the return to growth to catalyze both upside to estimates (we are 6%/17% above 2025 EBITDA/EPS) and a re-rating from 5.5x our 2026 to 7.5x 2026 EPS\u2026 Just as important, depressed valuation and history of steady capital return create a favorable risk adjusted reward.\u201d\n\nThese comments back up Grambling\u2019s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on TNL shares, while his $67 price target implies a 12-month upside potential of 31%. (To watch Grambling\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, there are 8 recent analyst reviews on record for TNL shares, and their breakdown of 5 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $51.23, and its $55.17 average target price indicates an 8% upside for the coming year. (See TNL stock forecast)\n\nHilton Grand Vacations (HGV)\n\nThe next stock on our list, Hilton Grand Vacations, may sound familiar \u2013 because it shares a name with the famous Hilton Hotel company. Since 2017, Hilton Grand Vacations has been acting as an independent company, working as the manager and operator of Hilton\u2019s timeshare and vacation ownership brands. This gives HGV a network of resorts \u2013 approximately 168 of them \u2013 spread across 16 states plus DC in the US, with an international presence in Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, the UK and mainland Europe, and Japan. These vacation properties are at the disposal of HGV\u2019s 722,000 members.\n\nTimeshare owners with HGV don\u2019t just have access to properties, they also have access to amenities on the properties, including such attractions as golf resorts, beachfronts, casino floors, and even ski slopes. Vacationers can find attractions keyed to adults or to families, with a wide range of activities to focus on, including shopping, spas, movies, sports, and restaurants.\n\nHGV has a history of expansion-through-acquisition, and has made two major moves in this direction in recent years. In 2021, the company acquired the upscale luxury hotel operator Diamond Resorts, in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion. More recently, HGV completed its acquisition-by-purchase of Bluegreen Vacations, in an all-cash transaction of $1.5 billion. Each of these acquisitions brings the target company\u2019s assets \u2013 resorts, destinations, attractions \u2013 into HGV\u2019s network, available for timeshare members.\n\nBased on its timeshare operations, Hilton Grand Vacations generated $1.3 billion in total revenues during 3Q24, its last reported financial period. While only $10 million better than the estimates, this revenue figure was up 27.5% year-over-year. At the bottom line, HGV\u2019s non-GAAP earnings were down year-over-year, from 98 cents per share to 67 cents per share \u2013 and missed the forecast by 5 cents.\n\nChecking in again with the Morgan Stanley view, we find that analyst Grambling is upbeat here, finding reason for optimism in this company\u2019s potential to bring improved returns going forward. He writes of the stock, \u201cHGV\u2019s acquisitions of Diamond & Bluegreen will continue to drive outsized EPS growth (20% CAGR 2024-26) through synergies and steady top-line growth. While both deals likely raise concerns about the quality of the owner base, especially on the heels of recent increases to the company\u2019s loan loss provision, the average FICO score of owners has actually held relatively stable. As a result, we see room for the company\u2019s provision to move lower over time. In addition, we expect HGV to deliver best in-class capital returns relative to its market cap (10% 2025 TSR / current market cap).\u201d\n\nGrambling puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on this timeshare company, along with a $47 price target that indicates room for a 23.5% upside potential on the one-year horizon.\n\nThe Moderate Buy consensus rating on this stock is based on 6 recent reviews that include 4 to Buy and 1 each to Hold and Sell. The shares are priced at $38.06 and have an average price target of $47.17, practically the same as Grambling\u2019s objective.

            "content": "It\u2019s only been a few months since COP29 took place. Since then things have taken a dramatic turn when it comes to the ESG agenda. Just last week Morgan Stanley stated that it is leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This took place hot on the heels of Citigroup and Bank of America leaving the Alliance. And, in further news, JP Morgan also left the Alliance just yesterday. Has Morgan Stanley turned its back on ESG?\n\nIt might have started in Texas. In November last year Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, for conspiring to artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices. It wasn\u2019t the first time. It may not be the last time either.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton Sues BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard for Illegally Conspiring to Manipulate Energy Markets, Driving Up Costs for Consumers: https://t.co/ROHNQnuvFF \u2014 Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) November 27, 2024\n\nThe case focused on how the tactics of the largest three asset managers had led to a rise in the cost of energy for everyday Americans. It was also suggested that the strategy helped the investment companies to produce extraordinary gains. The Attorney General made it very clear that \u201cTexas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized \u2018environmental\u2019 agenda.\u201d\n\nLarry Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive of BlackRock responded with \u201c[w]e are an active voice, we work with companies, but we need to work for the long-term interest[.]\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a long-term approach, suing the asset managers, according to some commentators. And it is also hurting pension funds in Texas, at the very least. At the same time, some argue that Texas is a very rich state with a huge budget surplus. How much can these ESG initiatives be harming Texans?\n\nWhat has been the ESG Strategy of Morgan Stanley so far?\n\nAll banks have an ESG strategy. Morgan Stanley is no exception. Sustainable investing, ESG Reports, the company has made a commitment to address climate change. At least that was the case in 2024.\n\nOne of the bigger stories from 2024 was about the Series C financing of Datamaran Ltd by Morgan Stanley. The banking giant was attracted to Datamaran because it\u2019s \u201ca market leader in providing technology that enables companies to embed ESG into their business practices.\u201d\n\nDatamaran, a software company that specializes in ESG, says it received $33 million in Series C financing from investment funds managed by Morgan Stanley https://t.co/RjEOqCHIH0 \u2014 Bloomberg Technology (@technology) September 19, 2024\n\nAlso in September, Morgan Stanley published its ESG Report for 2023. The report highlights how Morgan Stanley is a member of the IFRS Sustainability Alliance and helps monitor the standards being developed by the ISSB. More importantly, the Report reiterates Morgan Stanley\u2019s approach to ESG.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, Morgan Stanley set a goal to mobilize $1 trillion for sustainable solutions by 2030, including $750 billion toward low-carbon and green solutions. We have made significant progress, having now achieved over $820 billion.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley has a long-term goal of reaching net-zero financed emissions by 2050. This doesn\u2019t appear to have changed.\n\nWhat Has Happened at the Net-Zero Banking Alliance?\n\nAt first glance it doesn\u2019t appear that Morgan Stanley has made any changes in its stance towards ESG. This leads on to the question, what has happened at the Net-Zero Banking Alliance? Or NZBA for short.\n\nOrganizations like the IOSCO or IFRS are without doubt market leading membership organizations for investment banks and asset managers alike. But organizations like the NZBA are different. Bank-led and UN-convened, the NZBA is a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nNZBA is the climate accelerators for UN Environmental Programme Finance Initiative\u2019s Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). However, the organization has been decidedly silent since October 2024.\n\nIn August 2024 there was a change of leadership at the NZBA. At this time the First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) became the new Chair of the NZBA Steering Group. The NZBA Chair is selected by the members of the NZBA Steering Group. Ms. Hana Al Rostamani, Group CEO of FAB currently runs the NZBA.\n\nRostamani was voted the Most Powerful Businesswoman 2024 in the Middle East by Forbes. She is the first female CEO of a U.A.E.-based bank. The only link to some of the banks leaving the NZBA and Rostanami was at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week 2024 which took place in December. Rostanami was a speaker at the event, next to the likes of Jane Fraser of Citi, Georges Elhedery, Group Chief Executive of HSBC, or Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA & CEO, Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe event may have been a success, but the NZBA doesn\u2019t seem to have benefitted.\n\nIs ESG still a Priority for Global Systemically Important Banks?\n\nThere are no visible cracks in the NZBA. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citi, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and now JP Morgan all left the NZBA since Trump was re-elected. However, there is a further twist to the story.\n\nIn 2022 a group of U.S. state attorneys general including from Texas sent civil investigative demands to the six largest banks in the U.S. It was alleged their ESG-related practices hurt the American energy industry. Sound familiar? The Committee on Judiciary at the U.S. Congress wrote to several stakeholders in December 2022 highlighting:\n\n\u201cAt its core, ESG is merely partisan politics masquerading as responsible corporate governance. A major ESG \u2018policy centerpiece\u2019 is stifling investments in oil and gas, and Wall Street firms have \u2018bragg[ed] about their coordinated efforts to choke off investments in energy.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMuch of this rhetoric is being generated from republican led states like Texas. And these sentiments were already being used before Trump was re-elected.\n\nThere is no doubt that ESG will remain a priority for banks like Morgan Stanley. The question is how Morgan Stanley and others will go about communicating sustainability practices? If what the republicans believe is true and ESG is a political weapon, then regulations may be brought in place by the new administration. Regulations that might stifle the much-needed actions needed to address climate change. Or may create a new framework to compliment existing ones. Its hard to predict.\n\nWhat about the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative?\n\nWhen the Texas State Attorney General sued the asset managers, he implied that their involvement with the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative was a signal of their mutual intent to reduce the output of coal, increasing the cost of electricity for Americans.\n\nThe Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, similarly to the NZBA, is an international group of asset managers committed to supporting the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, and to support investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050. The initiative is accredited by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Race to Zero campaign and co-ordinated by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC). An organization that will struggle to make an impact in the U.S. during the next four years.\n\nMuch as the NZBA is struggling, the equivalent Asset Management Initiative will also be struggling. And it\u2019s not just Banks and Asset Managers. Even Insurance companies in the U.S. have had to lower their commitment to support global climate initiatives emanating from previous COP events.\n\nMorgan Stanley and others haven\u2019t turned their backs on ESG. They are just walking a tight rope between providing low-cost energy for U.S. citizens whilst looking to the future and protecting the climate. It may well be the case that the new U.S. administration redefines how ESG should be applied to investing. Morgan Stanley has not turned its back on ESG. Nor have the other U.S. banks.\n\nMunicipal Bonds in Texas\n\nIt appears that following the departure of JP Morgan from the NZBA things have improved for the largest U.S. banks in Texas. The Texas attorney general\u2019s office approves most public bond offerings before they\u2019re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. And municipal bonds are a huge market in the U.S., and in Texas returns are strong.\n\n\u201cThe NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,\u201d Paxton said.\n\nWho said running a financial institution was easy?\n\nAuthor: Andy Samu\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organizations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

            "content": "On January 7, 2025, Morgan Stanley executed a significant transaction involving Angel Oak Financial Strats Income Term (FINS, Financial). The firm reduced its holdings by 1,244,392 shares at a price of $12.85 per share. This transaction resulted in Morgan Stanley holding 877,414 shares of FINS, marking a substantial decrease in its position. The decision to reduce the stake in FINS reflects a strategic move by Morgan Stanley, potentially influenced by various market and financial considerations.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley, a prominent name in the financial services industry, has a rich history dating back to its founding in 1935. Originating from the legacy of JP Morgan & Co. and the Dean Witter brokerage house, the firm has grown through significant milestones, including the development of one of the first computer models for financial analysis in 1962. Morgan Stanley expanded internationally, establishing offices in Paris and Tokyo by the late 1960s and early 1970s. The firm went public in 1986 and continued to grow, merging with Dean Witter, Discover & Co. in 1997 to become the world\u2019s largest securities firm. Today, Morgan Stanley operates in 42 countries, managing over $800 billion in assets through its Institutional Securities Group, Wealth Management, and Investment Management divisions.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Portfolio\n\nMorgan Stanley's investment philosophy is characterized by a focus on innovation and strategic growth. The firm is known for its expertise in technology and financial services sectors, with top holdings including major companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL, Financial), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN, Financial), Meta Platforms Inc (META, Financial), Microsoft Corp (MSFT, Financial), and NVIDIA Corp (NVDA, Financial). This diversified portfolio reflects Morgan Stanley's commitment to investing in high-growth potential sectors, leveraging its global presence and extensive market knowledge to optimize returns for its clients.\n\nOverview of Angel Oak Financial Strats Income Term\n\nAngel Oak Financial Strats Income Term is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company based in the USA. The fund's primary objective is to seek current income, with a secondary focus on total return. It primarily invests in debt issued by financial institutions, including subordinated, unrated, senior, and high-yield securities. As of the latest data, FINS has a market capitalization of $322.055 million and a price-to-earnings ratio of 10.12. However, the stock's GF Valuation cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data.\n\nImpact of the Transaction\n\nThe reduction in Morgan Stanley's position in FINS may have several implications. This move could be part of a broader strategy to reallocate resources towards other investments with higher growth potential or to mitigate risks associated with FINS. The decision might also reflect an assessment of FINS's current financial health and market performance, which includes a [GF-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/gf-score/FINS) of 38/100, indicating poor future performance potential.\n\nFinancial and Market Performance of FINS\n\nFINS's financial health presents a mixed picture. The company has a [Profitability Rank](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rank-profitability/FINS) of 2/10 and a [Financial Strength](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rank-balancesheet/FINS) rank of 3/10, suggesting challenges in maintaining robust financial metrics. The [Piotroski F-Score](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/fscore/FINS) stands at 7, indicating some positive financial signals. However, the [Growth Rank](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rank-growth/FINS) is 0/10, highlighting a lack of growth momentum. Despite these challenges, FINS shows a [Momentum Rank](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/rank-momentum/FINS) of 8/10, suggesting some positive price movement in the short term.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Morgan Stanley's decision to reduce its stake in Angel Oak Financial Strats Income Term reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment. This move may be driven by an evaluation of FINS's financial and market performance, as well as broader market conditions. For value investors, this transaction underscores the importance of continuously assessing investment positions and adapting strategies to align with evolving market dynamics. As Morgan Stanley continues to navigate the financial landscape, its actions provide valuable insights into the firm's investment approach and market outlook.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Morgan Stanley, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley\n\nNYSE:MS Ownership Breakdown January 7th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nMorgan Stanley already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Morgan Stanley, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:MS Earnings and Revenue Growth January 7th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Morgan Stanley. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 23% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.8%.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.",

And just the six largest companies in the index by market cap make up around 30% of it, according to S&P Global data.\n\nS&P Global\n\nBut over-concentration in a portfolio can happen when any winning investments see big returns, not just when a certain sector fuels the S&P 500.\n\nIf your portfolio is more concentrated than you want it to be, meaning it's more vulnerable to the whims of its biggest holdings, there are multiple ways to rebalance, Wilson said.\n\nOne might be constructing a portfolio with sector ETFs, weighting each according to their size in the S&P 500 and adjusting the positions as conditions evolve. When you're bullish on the utilities sector in particular, for example, you can overweight it. When you're bearish on consumer staples, you can underweight it.\n\nThe strategy is \"essentially, I'm going to own the S&P 500, but I'm going to own it my way,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"Take a view on, 'Well this part of the index looks undervalued, this part of the index looks overvalued, or the trends that have been driving this performance are about to change,'\" he continued.\n\nFor Wilson's part, he likes the energy and materials sectors.\n\nHaving a financial advisor or an investor who watches the market closely may be ideal for this strategy, Wilson said.\n\nAnother rebalancing strategy could be simply adding other index funds to current holdings instead of trimming them, according to Wilson.\n\n\"You need to bring in new passive indices potentially that have underperformed,\" Wilson said.\n\nFor example, there's the S&P 500 equal-weighted index as opposed to the standard market-cap-weighted index. Each constituent in the S&P 500 equal-weighted index has the same size and impact on overall performance, as opposed to the cap-weighted index being dominated by, say, five or 10 companies.\n\nThe equal-weighted index is historically cheap relative to the cap-weighted index, but it has also underperformed over the last couple of years.\n\nOther index funds that track various parts of the market include the Russell 2000 for small-caps and the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which holds more than 3,600 US stocks.\n\nIn addition to concentration risk within the S&P 500, Wilson sees the broader index delivering poor annualized returns over the next decade. He said he expects returns to be \"flat-ish\" during that period due to how high valuation levels are \u2014 namely, the Shiller CAPE ratio and the S&P 500's forward 12-month PE ratio.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Rosenberg Research\n\n\"That is a very common view, that given where valuations are today, over the next 10 years, the returns from point A to point B will be basically flat-ish, and on a real basis, maybe negative,\" Wilson said. \"There will be plenty of opportunities to make money over that time in sectors and stocks even if the index is flat.\"",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nJPMorgan Chase has joined a growing list of major U.S. banks to depart the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a bank spokesperson confirmed to ESG Dive on Tuesday.\n\nThe bank\u2019s departure, first reported by Reuters , comes a week after Bank of America, Citi and Morgan Stanley announced their exits from NZBA and less than a month after Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo ended their memberships in the group.\n\nThe JPMorgan spokesperson said the bank would continue to work with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero, which recently announced its plans to refocus its work on mobilizing capital this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith JPMorgan\u2019s departure, five of the six largest U.S. banks by assets have exited NZBA in the past month.\n\nOnly three U.S.-based banks remain in NZBA \u2014 Amalgamated Bank, Climate First Bank and Areti Bank \u2014 according to the group\u2019s membership list. Amalgamated is the 158th-largest U.S. bank by assets, and Climate First is the 984th, according to the Federal Reserve; Areti was not among the 2,151 banks with more than $300 million in combined assets at the end of September.\n\nThe spate of NZBA defections comes just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate. The membership withdrawals also come after House Republicans spent the past two years probing such climate alliances for potential antitrust and consumer protection law violations.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work independently to advance the interests of our Firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security,\u201d a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe will also continue to support the banking and investment needs of our clients who are engaged in energy transition and in decarbonizing different sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\nAll of the recently defecting NZBA members were targeted by state Republican-led probes in the past few years. Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo were all probed by 14 Republican state attorneys general about their membership in 2022 and 12 Republican heads of agriculture last year about their membership status in the group.\n\nDespite leaving NZBA, JPMorgan is now at least the third recently departed bank to say it will also maintain engagement with GFANZ, which is the UN-backed umbrella organization for NZBA and other climate-focused alliances in the financial sector. Citi and Bank of America also reiterated their commitment to GFANZ in statements to ESG Dive last week.\n\nThe JPMorgan spokesperson said the bank will continue working with GFANZ, \u201camong others,\u201d on advancing solutions and the market conditions that \u201ccan help further a low-carbon and energy-secure future.\u201d\n\nThe continued commitment to working with GFANZ follows a Jan. 2 announcement from the group\u2019s secretariat Mary Schapiro that the alliance will restructure and turn its attention to \u201cmobilizing [climate] finance through public-private partnerships.\u201d\n\nSchapiro said the group had \u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks\u201d of a financial system able to finance the net-zero transition, and will now look to close the financing gap.\n\nUnder the restructuring, the alliance will engage through an independent \u201cPrincipals Group,\u201d led by CEOs and financial institution leaders, according to Schapiro\u2019s letter. The Principals Group includes Citi CEO Jane Fraser and BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, as well as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and State Street CEO Ron O\u2019Hanley, among others.",

Glazer has served as the company\u2019s finance chief since July 2020, just prior to the company\u2019s initial public offering that September, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining Palantir, he served as a corporate securities attorney for Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.\n\nIn 2020, the finance chief received a pre-listing stock grant of 4,030,000 shares of Class A common stock, according to the company\u2019s proxy statement for the year filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, back-loaded with a higher percentage set to vest in 2023. Glazer did not receive stock in 2023, with his total compensation for the year reaching $474,755, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Glazer\u2019s number of shares acquired upon vesting reached 1,504,760, with a value realized upon vesting of approximately $21 million, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy.\n\n\u201cThe vesting of the remainder of Mr. Glazer\u2019s 2020 RSU award is back-loaded, such that a larger portion vested in 2023 as compared to 2020, 2021, and 2022, to encourage his retention and the successful execution of our strategic growth plan,\u201d Palantir said of Glazer\u2019s compensation in its most recent proxy.\n\nAttention on Palantir \u2014 a Big Tech darling co-founded by PayPal alum Peter Thiel \u2014 has sharpened over the past year as the data analytics firm continues to see rapid growth. Amid the buzz over the potential of AI, the company\u2019s stock price surge last year by 340%, according to The Street.\n\nThe company \u2014 which takes its name from the \u201cseeing stones\u201d in JRR Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings series \u2014 has aimed to position itself as a dominant player in the growing generative AI industry, according to company filings.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down,\u201d Palantir CEO and co-founder Alexander Karp said in a statement included in the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report. \u201cThe world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the company\u2019s most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, Palantir reported a 30% year-over-year jump in total revenue to reach $726 million, according to its earnings report. The company is expecting to see revenues between $2.805 billion to $2.809 billion for the full year, according to its earnings results.\n\nHowever, Singh argues the 340% surge in value Palantir saw last year was \u201cdriven almost entirely by multiple expansion,\u201d according to The Street, with the analyst also flagging slower revenue growth for the company this year compared with 2024.\n\nThe company also faces stiff competition when it comes to claiming a crown \u2014 and investor attention \u2014 in the growing generative AI industry. One recent comparison of Palantir against technology firm Nvidia, for example, pointed to the latter company as a better investment, citing Palantir\u2019s past challenges with \u201cconsistent profitability\u201d and Nvidia\u2019s \u201cstronger market position.\u201d\n\nPalantir did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

Santiago/Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts stocks will face a rough start amid soaring bond yields and a strong dollar.\n\nIt says the market may get a boost later in the year as Trump's pro-business policies kick in.\n\nThe bank expects the S&P 500 to gain about 8% this year, about in line with Wall Street's consensus.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Mike Wilson says this year will be a tale of two halves for stocks, with the market set for a difficult few months before policy changes are felt by investors.\n\nThe bank's chief investment officer and top stock strategist pointed to soaring bond yields and a stronger dollar, which he said would pose a risk to stocks in the first half of the year as breadth, or the proportion of stocks participating in the market's rally, remains poor.\n\nBond yields have surged in recent weeks; the 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.5% amid hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve. Wilson said that's flipped the correlation between the S&P 500 and bond yields \"decisively into negative territory,\" a divergence not seen since last summer.\n\nBut Wilson added that that could change with improving breadth amid lower rates, a weaker dollar, stronger earnings revisions, and clarity on President-elect Donald Trump's tariff policies and Cabinet confirmations.\n\nThe market is pricing in one or two more interest-rate cuts this year. Meanwhile, the dollar has remained strong in recent weeks, nearing levels that could hurt companies with large international exposure and thus posing a risk to the market more broadly, Wilson said.\n\nThe dollar dipped on Monday after a Washington Post report said Trump's aides were reviewing plans to impose tariffs on every country but only on imports identified as critical to national or economic security, amounting to a watered-down version of Trump's original proposals. Trump denied the report in a post on Truth Social, and the US currency regained some losses.\n\nWilson said that with higher yields and a strong dollar, stocks would continue to face headwinds in the first half of the year.\n\n\"We think 2025 could be a year of two halves with the first half being more challenged,\" he wrote.\n\nHe said that after that, Trump's policy changes \u2014 like corporate tax cuts and government-efficiency measures \u2014 would most likely kick in to provide a boost to stocks.\n\nOverall, Wall Street remains largely optimistic on market returns this year, with an average 2025 year-end price target of 6,539 for the S&P 500, implying a 9% gain from current levels after back-to-back years with gains of over 20%",

Palantir\u2019s sales to corporations have been better than expected, thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) offering, as well as better deals than expected with the US government. Palantir also kept better control over costs than they thought likely, boosting free cash flow.\n\nEven so, they say, there is an insane amount of growth baked into the shares at their current prices:\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging this positive inflection and looking for ways to get more constructive on shares, the lack of visibility of material estimate revisions leaves PLTR trading too far ahead of the company's intrinsic value to justify a rating upgrade.\u201d\n\nOf course, given the mood of the markets, fundamentals seem relatively unimportant to traders. In other words, the stock can keep outrunning the basic business logic on sheer momentum.\n\nIn their note, Morgan Stanley analysts acknowledged that some optimism on Palantir stems from links between the company and the incoming Trump admin.\n\n\u201cBullish investors have pointed to several ties between Palantir and the incoming Trump administration as potential tailwinds for the stock going into next year. The ties investors point to range from 1) Palantir being co-founded by Peter Thiel, who hired Vice President-elect JD Vance at his venture capital firm Mithril Capital and was reportedly a major donor to his past political campaigns, to 2) Elon Musk on December 8 sharing a presentation by Palantir CEO Alex Karp on X with the words \u2018based.\u2019 We see a risk of any such announcements leading shares higher in the near-term.\u201d\n\nTheir price target for the defense-tech juggernaut is $60 over the next 12 to 18 months, or about 25% below its current price. For the record, Morgan Stanley analysts aren\u2019t the only ones finding it impossible to justify the shares of the stock on a traditional business basis of expected sales, profits, and growth.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n- Within the span of a month, Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance.\n\nThe Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprint, has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (BofA) and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, looks to be next.\n\nThe moves reflect US banks\u2019 desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.\n\nAnd NZBA is bracing itself for more US exits, secretariat lead Sarah Kemmitt told members in a Dec 31 letter seen by Bloomberg. She cited the \u201cpolitical environment\u201d. At the same time, the real-world impact of the NZBA defections is unclear.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, banks have collectively stepped up their financing of the fossil fuel industry since the alliance was formed in 2021.\n\nMembership of NZBA was likely more a case of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d than \u201cmeaningful climate impacts\u201d, said business law professor Jill Fisch from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA spokesperson for NZBA declined to comment.\n\nActivists are now demanding that the government intervene to target Wall Street. Environmental Advocates NY, a non-profit, says it is urging New York state officials to introduce regulations and laws that would compel banks operating in the world\u2019s biggest financial hub to take climate action.\n\nThe wave of NZBA exits follows behind-the-scenes tensions that have been brewing for more than two years.\n\nIn 2022, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were among banks pushing back against binding targets on climate finance. NZBA then watered down some requirements, and members stayed put.\n\nBut as the Republican Party grows more hostile towards climate-friendly organisations, the finance industry is repositioning itself.\n\nGlobal temperatures are rising fast, yet banks continue to reap short-term profits by sticking with fossil fuel producers.\n\nIt is therefore both \u201cdistressing and unsurprising\u201d that Wall Street is turning its back on net-zero alliances, said Professor Ken Pucker, who teaches sustainability at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nThe alliances were created in order to encourage the finance industry to take into account the longer-term cost of supporting oil, gas and coal.\n\nBack in 2021, when NZBA was formed, banks now leaving the alliance proudly touted their membership.\n\nBofA chief executive Brian Moynihan spoke of a \u201ccommitment to net zero\u201d in his role as co-chair of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, whose stated mission is to \u201cbuild a coordinated global effort\u201d to help green the private sector.\n\nAnd in an April 2021 statement announcing its agenda, the world\u2019s biggest coalition for climate finance \u2013 the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) \u2013 said it would \u201crequire signatories to set science-aligned interim and long-term goals to reach net zero no later than 2050\u201d.\n\nGfanz ended 2024 by recalibrating its mission as banks flee and GOP (Republican Party) attacks intensify. The group is distancing itself from the net-zero alliances for which it had previously been an umbrella organisation.\n\nGoing forward, Gfanz will make its guidance available to financial firms, whether they have committed to a net-zero alliance or not.\n\nA spokesperson for Gfanz declined to comment beyond the group\u2019s public statements.\n\nBanks that sign up to NZBA still commit to transition their financed emissions to align with \u201cpathways to net zero by 2050\u201d at the latest, according to its website.\n\nThey are also required to provide 2030 targets to show they are on track, and to document their progress.\n\nAll banks exiting NZBA have made public statements to say they still recognise decarbonisation as a worthy goal. But they have also made clear that their biggest duty is to serve the needs of their clients. None has provided an official reason for quitting the alliance.\n\nWall Street is now navigating a world in which bankers and money managers suspected of being unsupportive of the GOP\u2019s pro-fossil fuel agenda face a growing threat of litigation.\n\nJust weeks after Trump was re-elected in November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by adopting pro-climate strategies to suppress coal production.\n\nThen in December, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee said it found \u201csubstantial evidence that a climate cartel of financial institutions\u201d had engaged in \u201canti-competitive collusion\u201d by demanding that companies \u201cdisclose, reduce and enforce\u201d their net-zero climate commitments.\n\nThe committee, which is led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out Gfanz and similar groups for leading what it described as a climate crusade.\n\nGOP members have made clear they feel increasingly emboldened.\n\nAfter hearing of the defections from NZBA, Republican Congressman-elect Riley Moore of West Virginia said via a spokesperson that he will keep trying to ban and block financial firms suspected of supporting \u201canti-fossil fuel ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street firms continue to earn considerably more from arranging fossil-fuel deals than their European counterparts.\n\nIn 2024, JPMorgan topped the league table of banks underwriting bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt was followed by Wells Fargo, TD Securities, BofA, RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup. The biggest underwriter of green bonds, meanwhile, was BNP Paribas, which is the largest bank in the European Union.\n\nEuropean banks, which are subject to much stricter climate regulations than their US peers, have so far showed no sign of walking away from NZBA.\n\nAnd representatives of lenders with headquarters spanning London to Amsterdam to Frankfurt said they plan to stay put.\n\n\u201cOur position is very straightforward, we have absolutely no intention of leaving the NZBA,\u201d a spokesperson for Standard Chartered told Bloomberg. ING Groep and Deutsche Bank have made similar statements.\n\nGlobal banks provided about US$680 billion (S$931.6 billion) worth of fossil fuel loans and bond deals in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThat is up from US$667 billion in 2021, when NZBA was created.\n\nBanks that have stepped up such deals over the period include BofA and Goldman, the data shows.\n\nProf Pucker of Tufts University draws parallels between the choices banks are making today, and those they made in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHe says to understand banks\u2019 thinking now, it is worth recalling a 2007 comment by Mr Charles O. Prince III, who was Citigroup\u2019s chief executive at the time: \u201c\u2018As long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance\u2019.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming is now on track to race past the critical threshold of 1.5 deg C, raising questions as to the value of having financial firms claim they can still align their operations with that target.\n\nEnvironmental Advocates NY says the state government must now consider forcing banks to impose financing limits to align with climate goals, including restrictions targeting fossil fuels.\n\nIt is also calling for rules that would require banks to document the extent to which they are lowering their so-called financed emissions.\n\nMs Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director at the non-profit, said it is clear Republicans have succeeded in their efforts to get Wall Street to retreat from climate commitments, \u201cmodest\u201d as they were.\n\n\u201cThe banks won\u2019t police themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need regulation.\u201d BLOOMBERG\n\nFind out more about climate change and how it could affect you on the ST microsite here.",

            "content": "Morgan Stanley is reportedly considering adding cryptocurrency trading to its E-TRADE platform, a move that could significantly impact the crypto market by providing access to digital assets for E-TRADE's 5.2 million accounts.\n\nMorgan Stanley is an investment banking company, headquartered in New York, United States.\n\nCurrently, it appears that E-TRADE only offers indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies through products like futures, ETFs, and stocks related to digital assets.\n\nIf Morgan Stanley proceeds further with this initiative, E-TRADE would become one of the largest traditional retail brokerages to offer direct crypto trading, positioning it as a formidable competitor to existing platforms such as Coinbase.\n\nAs you can see, E-TRADE is able to be accessed easily through a smartphone or computer\u2014 making it a formidable competitor with other trading platforms.\n\nThis development would also align with Morgan Stanley's historically progressive approach. In August 2024, the bank authorized its 15,000 financial advisors to recommend Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to clients, specifically BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund.\n\nThe potential addition of crypto trading on E-TRADE could introduce a substantial influx of retail investors into the cryptocurrency market, potentially increasing trading volumes and market liquidity.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, Cumulative Spot BTC ETF Volumes have been on the steady rise. It is reasonable to infer that Morgan Stanley's recommendation to clients contributed to this increase.\n\nIt is important to note that Morgan Stanley would need to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve to offer crypto trading through E-TRADE, as the bank is classified as a bank holding company. This task will prove to be difficult, regardless of which administration holds the office in the United States, but only time will tell as there is a positive outlook for the future of digital assets.\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn to receive push notifications on our latest posts.",

            "content": "A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York, US, July 16, 2018. \u2014 Reuters\n\nMorgan Stanley terminated its membership of a major climate-banking group, joining a wave of Wall Street firms that recently quit a global alliance intended to aid the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMorgan Stanley is leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the lender said on Thursday. Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp said earlier this week that they were doing the same.\n\nThe defections are playing out against a tense political backdrop in the US, as the country\u2019s biggest financial firms find themselves the targets of Republican campaigns that have characterised net zero groups as climate cartels.\n\nSuch attacks have picked up, and as recently as November, Texas led a move to sue BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group Inc and State Street Corp for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate-friendly investment strategies to suppress the supply of coal. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invests in companies with the goal of harming them is baseless.\n\nOther banks that have recently quit NZBA include Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. All said they remain committed to their own net zero emissions goals and to helping clients reduce their carbon footprints.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed-emissions targets,\u201d Morgan Stanley said by email. Daniel Storey, a spokesperson for NZBA, declined to comment.\n\nMorgan Stanley adjusted some of its green targets in 2024. Among these was a funding goal for plastics, with a report published in September omitting an earlier pledge to facilitate the prevention, removal or reduction of 50 million metric tonnes of plastic waste from the environment by 2030. The bank also has warned of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of withdrawing financing too quickly from high-carbon clients that plan to decarbonise.\n\nNZBA had been one of a number of finance-industry groups affiliated with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. GFANZ ended 2024 by adjusting the way it operates. Going forward, financial firms will be free to draw on GFANZ for guidance and assistance without being members of one of the sector alliances.\n\nThe defections that have hit NZBA follow similar exits across climate groups in other corners of the finance industry. In 2023, a coalition of insurers saw a mass exodus amid litigation threats. And in 2022, an equivalent group for asset managers parted ways with Vanguard Group, the world\u2019s second-largest money manager. Other investment firms followed.\n\nThe Texas lawsuit against the three-biggest US money managers referenced their participation in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which is another climate group associated with GFANZ.\n\nGFANZ was formed more than 3 1/2 years ago in the run-up to the COP26 United Nations climate conference in Scotland. Back then, it had two aims: to raise the number of financial institutions committing to net zero, and to facilitate industry discussion on the challenges of the low-carbon transition.\n\nIn an updated statement, GFANZ said it has \u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks of a financial system capable of financing the transition to net zero.\u201d\n\nIn order to \u201csuccessfully transition the economy, we must accelerate progress in public policy and technology developments, and close three critical gaps: data, action, and investment,\u201d the group said. GFANZ now plans to \u201cturn its focus to closing the investment gap to help unlock the more than $5 trillion a year opportunity created by countries modernising their energy systems and putting economies onto a low-carbon path in the next decade,\u201d it said.",

With attractive incentives such as low taxes, and robust regulatory frameworks, the region has become a magnet for investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, family offices, and law firms. Major players like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have strengthened their presence across the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAsset management firms are also joining the trend. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has maintained a strong foothold in Saudi Arabia since opening its Riyadh office in 2019. Meanwhile, Wellington Management and Fiera Capital made their regional debuts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively, underscoring the region\u2019s growing appeal for global asset managers. These firms are drawn by opportunities in the Gulf\u2019s booming financial sector and the region\u2019s commitment to diversifying beyond oil revenues.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is set to remain the world\u2019s top destination for wealthy individuals for the third consecutive year, with a projected net inflow of 6,700 millionaires by the end of 2024, according to the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report. This figure significantly surpasses the United States, which ranks second with an expected net inflow of 3,800 millionaires. The UAE\u2019s appeal lies in its favorable tax policies, strategic geographic location, world-class infrastructure, and attractive long-term residency programs such as the \u201cgolden visa.\u201d\n\nAfrica: A New Era of Economic Growth\n\nAfrica is also an attractive place for investments, as demonstrated by the resounding success of the Africa Investment Forum 2024, which concluded on December 6 in Rabat, Morocco. The event secured an impressive $29.2 billion in new investor commitments after three days of intensive boardroom discussions. This year\u2019s Forum witnessed a record attendance of 2,300 investors and delegates from 83 countries, marking a 60% increase from the previous year. Across 41 investment boardrooms, participants engaged in discussions spanning sectors such as transport, power, energy, agribusiness, industry, mining, pharmaceuticals, private equity, tourism, urban infrastructure, and water management.\n\nOne standout success from the Forum was Nigeria\u2019s Special Agro-Processing Zone project, which aimed to raise $975 million but secured $4.8 billion in investor interest. Similarly, projects from Morocco and the Democratic Republic of the Congo attracted investments surpassing initial targets. The Forum\u2019s founding partners, including Africa50, Afreximbank, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Africa Finance Corporation, and the Islamic Development Bank, reaffirmed their dedication to strengthening collaboration and driving transformative investments across the continent.",

Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors.\n\nAfter rapidly expanding from 43 banks at launch to over 140 banks representing $74 trillion in 2024, members of the group have have come under significant pressure, particularly from Republican politicians in the U.S., who have been warning financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners and investors of potential legal violations from their participation in climate-focused alliances and of plans to exclude the companies from state business, as part of a broader anti-ESG political campaign.\n\nMorgan Stanley set a goal in 2020 to achieve net zero financed emissions by 2050 and has released a series of interim financed emissions reduction targets for several high-emissions sectors. The firm recently revised its interim financed emissions targets, based on its assessment that the global economy and policy is not currently on track with the ambition to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, which was the basis of its prior targets.\n\nIn the firm\u2019s statement, the Morgan Stanley spokesperson said:",

            "content": "Several major U.S. banks, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America, have recently announced their departure from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This global coalition was established to help financial institutions align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement\u2019s climate goals.\n\nHowever, this wave of exits highlights the growing tension between climate commitments and political pressures, particularly in the U.S.\n\nA Retreat from Climate Commitments: U.S. Banks\u2019 Bold Move\n\n\n\nThe NZBA, launched in 2021 under the umbrella of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), committed its members to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nThe alliance required banks to set interim targets, reduce emissions associated with their portfolios, and report progress transparently. It also encouraged funding for projects like renewable energy and reforestation to offset emissions.\n\nBy 2023, the NZBA had gained significant traction, with over 100 member banks collectively representing 40% of global banking assets. This made it a key player in mobilizing financial resources for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Yet, political and market dynamics have increasingly complicated these ambitions.\n\nPolitical Backlash and Legal Challenges\n\nIn the U.S., political opposition has intensified against net-zero initiatives. Republican-led states have accused financial institutions of prioritizing climate goals over economic interests.\n\nIn November, Texas and 10 other states sued major asset managers like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, alleging antitrust violations tied to climate activism. These lawsuits argued that such actions limited fossil fuel financing, reduced coal production, and raised energy prices.\n\nThis political climate has pressured banks to distance themselves from alliances perceived as restrictive or politically charged. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America\u2019s decisions to exit NZBA follow earlier withdrawals by Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and others, citing similar concerns.\n\nSo, What Now After the Exit?\n\nDespite leaving the NZBA, these banks remain committed to their sustainability goals. Morgan Stanley reiterated its pledge to report on interim financed emissions targets for 2030, emphasizing its continued support for clients transitioning to greener practices.\n\nThe bank has committed to achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050. To support this long-term objective, Morgan Stanley has set the following 2030 targets for major emitting sectors:\n\nThe firm plans to collaborate with clients to develop and implement strategies that facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Additionally, Morgan Stanley emphasizes the importance of transparent reporting and has committed to disclosing its progress toward these goals regularly.\n\nCitigroup also noted its progress on independent net-zero goals, while Bank of America stated it would continue working with clients to meet their sustainability needs.\n\nCitigroup has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, including both its operations and the emissions associated with its financing activities. As part of this commitment, Citi aims to decarbonize its own operations by 2030.\n\nThe bank has developed a Net Zero Framework that includes:\n\ncalculating baseline financed emissions for carbon-intensive sectors,\n\nidentifying appropriate climate transition pathways,\n\nsetting emissions reduction targets for 2030 and beyond, and\n\nimplementing strategies through client engagement.\n\nSimilarly, Bank of America remains committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions across its financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050. To support this goal, the bank has set interim targets for 2030, focusing on reducing emissions in key sectors such as auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation.\n\nTheir strategy includes mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030 through their Environmental Business Initiative to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America achieved carbon neutrality in its operations in 2019 and continues to work towards making its operations more sustainable.\n\nThese approaches reflect a strategic balancing act among major bankers. On the one hand, these institutions seek to maintain credibility as leaders in sustainable finance. On the other, they aim to avoid political and financial risks that could arise from their association with climate-focused alliances.\n\nBroader Challenges Facing NZBA\n\nThe challenges confronting NZBA extend beyond political opposition. Questions about the availability and quality of carbon credits, critical for offsetting emissions, have raised concerns about the alliance\u2019s effectiveness. Ensuring that credits meet stringent environmental and social standards is essential to maintaining the credibility of net-zero commitments.\n\nOperational complexities also pose difficulties. For instance, NZBA requires members to harmonize emissions reporting and reduction efforts across diverse portfolios and jurisdictions. This has led to administrative bottlenecks and slowed progress in achieving interim goals.\n\nAnother challenge is the perception of double regulation. Flights between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), for example, face overlapping compliance requirements under both CORSIA and local emissions trading schemes.\n\nSimilarly, banks must navigate overlapping climate regulations across multiple frameworks, further complicating their compliance efforts.\n\nGFANZ\u2019s Evolving Role\n\nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which oversees NZBA and other sectoral alliances, has adapted its strategy in response to these challenges.\n\nGFANZ announced it would no longer require financial institutions to join specific alliances to benefit from its guidance. Instead, it will focus on addressing critical gaps in data, investment, and public policy to accelerate the transition to net zero. The Alliance stated in a statement that it has:\n\n\u201cachieved its initial goal of developing the building blocks of a financial system capable of financing the transition to net zero.\u201d\n\nThis shift aims to unlock over $5 trillion annually to modernize energy systems and decarbonize economies globally. By prioritizing actionable investments and public-private partnerships, GFANZ hopes to sustain momentum despite recent defections.\n\nBut What Does it Mean for Sustainable Finance?\n\nThe exits from NZBA signal broader uncertainties in the sustainable finance sector. While financial institutions recognize the importance of addressing climate risks, they face competing pressures from stakeholders with differing priorities.\n\nInvestors demand accountability on climate goals, yet political forces challenge these commitments, particularly when viewed as detrimental to traditional industries like fossil fuels.\n\nMoreover, the scaling back of collective initiatives like NZBA could slow progress in mobilizing the trillions of dollars needed for the low-carbon transition. Without unified frameworks, banks may pursue fragmented approaches, reducing the overall effectiveness of global climate action.\n\nOpportunities And the Road Ahead for Net Zero Banking\n\nDespite these setbacks, opportunities remain for financial institutions to lead in sustainable finance. By leveraging innovative tools like sustainable bonds and green loans, banks can support decarbonization while mitigating political and financial risks.\n\nMoreover, investing in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and emerging carbon capture technologies offers pathways to align profitability with climate goals.\n\nThe exits of major U.S. banks from NZBA highlight the delicate interplay between climate ambition and political realities. While these developments may slow collective action, they also underscore the need for adaptable strategies to sustain progress. By addressing challenges proactively, the financial sector can continue to play a pivotal role in the global transition to a sustainable future.",

While providing no specific reason for its withdrawal, Morgan Stanley stressed its ongoing dedication to decarbonization.\n\n\u201cWe aim to contribute to real-economy decarbonization by providing our clients with the advice and capital required to transform business models and reduce carbon intensity,\u201d Morgan Stanley said. The bank also emphasized its commitment to reporting progress on its 2030 emissions reduction targets.\n\nBroader Context of Financial Industry Pressures\n\nThese exits come amid a broader trend of legal challenges, including lawsuits against BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street by Republican-led states alleging antitrust violations linked to climate-focused investment strategies. Financial institutions have increasingly faced criticism for their ties to fossil fuels while grappling with growing regulatory risks tied to climate action.\n\nDespite withdrawing from NZBA, Morgan Stanley affirmed, \u201cOur commitment to helping the world transition to net-zero carbon emissions remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nThese developments reflect the mounting challenges financial institutions face in balancing climate ambitions with political and regulatory pressures, raising questions about how they will independently pursue net-zero goals outside of global coalitions like the NZBA.\n\nFollow ESG News on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I\u2019m Jamie Rollo, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Europe Leisure & Travel Analyst. And today I\u2019ll talk about an intriguing trend \u2013 the cruise lines\u2019 accelerating expansion into private islands.\n\nIt\u2019s Tuesday, February the 25th, at 2 PM in London.\n\n\n\nNow the lure of a private island cruise is simple. You get almost exclusive access to a tropical retreat. You can lounge or snorkel on a pristine beach, you can enjoy a meal in a private cabana, you can even book a massage or a yoga class. The only other people around are fellow passengers on your vacation. So this isn't just the stuff of popular TV shows. It\u2019s potentially the future of cruising.\n\nCruise lines have actually been offering private islands for more than a decade. So it\u2019s hardly a new phenomenon. In fact, in 2019, we estimate the majority of Caribbean cruise passengers visited a private island.\n\nAs it happens, the Caribbean is the world's largest cruise destination. About saw 36 million cruise calls were there last year; that\u2019s about 40 percent of global passenger capacity. And that\u2019s surpassing the second largest region, the Mediterranean, at about 17 percent. Of course, the Caribbean\u2019s proximity to North America and its year-round tropical climate make it a prime location for cruising. But despite these advantages, historically the Caribbean\u2019s been seen as more of a lower-yielding market compared to regions like Europe or Alaska, which arguably have even more amazing scenery or historic sites.\n\nInterestingly, recent trends suggest that reputation might be changing. And new private islands over the last few years have reinvigorated the Caribbean cruise market.\n\nSo what\u2019s a private destinations or islands offer? For your guests, they get a seamless integration with the cruise experience. There\u2019s no transfer required to a destination. There\u2019s no external visitors coming into the resort. No-hassle, no-traffic, and very low crime.\n\nAnd for the cruise lines, well, they get greater control over the customer experience. They create superior customer satisfaction, which generates more repeat business. In addition, they can get that on-island spend that the guest would have spent with external vendors. And they can charge premium rates for exclusive areas.\n\nOn top of that, many of these islands are quote close to the U.S. mainland, so you\u2019re saving on fuel because the ship doesn\u2019t have to steam so far; and on port fees. And then finally, proximity to the U.S. also can increase the short cruise duration market, which widens the addressable market for new-to-cruise passengers. And also can limit anti-tourism or anti-cruise sentiment because it moves guests out of congested areas and prevents unwanted visitors.\n\nAll in all, the private island model offers a very high return on invested capital and may well be the future of the cruise line industry. In fact, if we add up the expansion plans of the biggest listed cruise lines, we think their private island guest count will double over the next few years. And that could add over 10 percent to top line sales and 30 percent earnings-per-share for the fastest growing cruise lines.\n\nSo very considerable financials, but also it\u2019s a private paradise within reach \u2026 and an idea we can all set sail to.\n\nThanks for listening. If you enjoy the show, please leave us a review wherever you listen and share Thoughts on the Market with a friend or colleague today.",

Earlier this week, Bank of America and Citigroup said they were leaving the alliance, and earlier in December Goldman Sachs Group and Wells Fargo announced they were doing the same.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed-emissions targets,\u201d Morgan Stanley toldBloomberg in an email.\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley didn't offer an explanation for the exit, according to Reuters, financial firms have repeatedly found themselves in the crosshairs of some members of the GOP who argue that corporate efforts to limit fossil fuels run afoul of antitrust law.\n\nLast summer, the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee published a report accusing financial institutions colluding to impose \"radical environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals on American companies.\" Their probe was largely focused on another climate group, Climate Action 100+, which is made up of financial institutions who strive to engage companies they invest in on climate issues. That coalition has also experienced a number of defections.\n\nIn December, 11 GOP-led states sued three asset managers in federal court, arguing that the firms had \"artificially constrained the supply of coal, significantly diminished competition in the markets for coal, increased energy prices for American consumers, and produced cartel-level profits\" for the firms in violation of antitrust law.\n\nDespite the stated goals of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, Morgan Stanley and other firms who are a part of the alliance have remained a major financial life lines for fossil fuel companies.\n\nAccording to a report published by a group of NGOs in 2023, 56 of the largest banks in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance\u2014including Morgan Stanley\u2014have provided nearly $270 billion in the form of loans and underwriting to more than 100 \"major fossil fuel expanders,\" from Saudi Aramco to ExxonMobil to Shell.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Morgan Stanley's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nThe top 8 shareholders own 51% of the company\n\n\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Morgan Stanley ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Morgan Stanley.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Morgan Stanley's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 23% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.8%.\n\nWe did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Morgan Stanley\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Morgan Stanley. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$344m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that public companies hold 23% of the Morgan Stanley shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Goldman Sachs: Diversify, Diversify, Diversify\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts a broader market rally in 2025, thanks to easing monetary policies and a strong economy. It's emphasizing the importance of diversification, especially since some sectors are looking pretty pricey right now.\n\nGoldman highlights mid-cap industrials, renewable energy, and undervalued international markets like Southeast Asia as areas with significant growth potential.\n\nWhat this means for you: Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Look beyond the highfliers and dig into undervalued sectors with promising fundamentals.\n\nExample investment: Think mid-cap industrial companies or international ETFs that focus on Southeast Asia, such as iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF (AAXJ).\n\n2. JPMorgan: Think Global, Act Local\n\nThe folks at JPMorgan expect central banks around the world to keep cutting rates. They\u2019re betting this will boost international equities and drive earnings growth.\n\nAmong the most promising regions are Latin America, with its strong commodity exports, and Southeast Asia, which is benefiting from supply chain diversification and robust domestic consumption.\n\nWhat this means for you: It might be time to give those overseas markets a second look. Emerging markets and Europe could be ripe for the picking, with potential for both growth and value opportunities.\n\nExample investment: Check out an emerging markets ETF, like iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM), or a region-specific fund, such as the Fidelity Latin America Fund (FLATX).\n\n3. Morgan Stanley: Eyes on the U.S. and Japan\n\nMorgan Stanley is bullish on equities in the U.S. and Japan, citing strong central bank policies that have fostered economic stability and supported corporate profitability. In the U.S., a resilient labor market and advancements in key industries like technology and renewable energy are driving optimism.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s focus on technological innovation and export strength, combined with favorable monetary policies, makes it a standout in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nHowever, there are risks on the horizon. Morgan Stanley warns that new tariffs could disrupt global trade flows, while stricter immigration policies in the U.S. might hinder workforce expansion and innovation. These factors could dampen economic momentum in the latter part of the year.\n\nWhat this means for you: Focus on markets with solid fundamentals, but keep an eye on political developments. Staying informed on potential policy shifts will be key to managing risks effectively.\n\nExample investment: Consider U.S. large-cap tech stocks, like Microsoft or Google, or Japanese automation leaders such as Fanuc or Keyence.\n\n4. BlackRock: Flexibility Is Key\n\nBlackRock is bracing for a year of transformation \u2014 and it's not just talking about AI. Economic shifts and geopolitical surprises could shake things up. To navigate this, BlackRock recommends a flexible approach, which means being ready to rebalance your portfolio and explore a mix of asset classes.\n\nThis could include equities in emerging markets, high-yield bonds, or alternative investments like real estate.\n\nWhat this means for you: Stay nimble. Be ready to adjust your portfolio as the landscape changes, and don\u2019t shy away from diversifying into less traditional asset types.\n\nExample investment: A balanced mutual fund that adjusts its holdings dynamically, like BlackRock\u2019s own Global Allocation Fund, or private real estate funds.\n\n5. Oppenheimer: The S&P Hits the Jackpot\n\nJohn Stoltzfus from Oppenheimer is calling for the S&P 500 to reach 7,100 in 2025. His reasoning? AI-driven productivity gains and robust economic growth.\n\nAdvances in artificial intelligence are expected to improve efficiency across industries, from health care and logistics to finance and manufacturing, which could lead to higher corporate profits and stock valuations.\n\nWhat this means for you: Tech isn\u2019t done yet. In fact, AI could drive another big wave of growth. Companies leveraging AI to streamline operations or create innovative products could see significant gains.\n\nExample investment: Look into AI-focused ETFs, like Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), or individual stocks like Nvidia, which powers much of the AI revolution.\n\n6. Charles Schwab: Strength With a Side of Volatility\n\nSchwab\u2019s analysts see the U.S. economy entering 2025 on solid footing, but policy changes could stir up volatility.\n\nPotential triggers include shifts in tariffs, which might impact global trade and corporate profits, and immigration policy adjustments, which could affect labor market dynamics and economic growth.\n\nWhat this means for you: Stick to your strategy, but be proactive. Consider diversifying your portfolio to include sectors less sensitive to policy changes, such as utilities or health care, and maintain a portion in cash or liquid assets to capitalize on market dips.\n\nExample investment: Dividend-paying stocks in defensive sectors, like utilities or health care, or short-term Treasury ETFs for liquidity.\n\n7. Bank of America: The Magnificent Seven Ride Again\n\nBank of America says a downturn might be inevitable, but the big tech names \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla \u2014 aren\u2019t slowing down. What makes these tech giants resilient is their strong cash flow, market dominance, and ability to innovate in fields like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\n\nThese companies are also well-positioned to benefit from any interest rate cuts and the continued expansion of AI applications across industries.\n\nThat said, risks still apply. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly around antitrust issues and data privacy, could pose challenges. Additionally, these companies' high valuations mean they might be more vulnerable in a market downturn.\n\nWhat this means for you: Don\u2019t count out the giants. They\u2019re still leading the charge, but consider balancing exposure with other sectors to mitigate risks.\n\nExample investment: Mega-cap growth ETFs, like Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), or individual stocks of the Magnificent Seven, such as Nvidia or Microsoft.\n\n8. Morningstar: Go Global for Value\n\nMorningstar thinks U.S. stocks are looking pricey, so they\u2019re urging investors to explore international markets.\n\nThey highlight Europe, where valuations are still relatively low compared with historical averages, and Asia-Pacific regions, particularly India and South Korea, which are benefiting from strong economic reforms and tech-driven growth.\n\nAdditionally, sectors like renewable energy and consumer goods in these regions present attractive opportunities.\n\nWhat this means for you: Think globally, and don\u2019t be afraid to go hunting for bargains overseas. Diversifying into undervalued regions and industries could pay off big.\n\nExample investment: A European-focused ETF, like Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK), or an Asia-focused mutual fund, such as Matthews Asia Innovators Fund (MATFX).\n\nWhat\u2019s the Big Picture?\n\nIf there\u2019s one takeaway from these predictions, it\u2019s this: 2025 could be a year of opportunities, but only for those who stay flexible and diversified.\n\nWhether it\u2019s AI, international markets, or defensive plays, there\u2019s something out there for everyone.\n\nJust remember to do your homework and stick to your investment goals.\n\nSo what\u2019s your next move?\n\nWill you dive into AI, hedge with global equities, or play it safe with dividends?\n\nWhatever you choose, the future is yours to shape. And the Wealth Daily team is here to help you every step of the way.\n\nSo let\u2019s make 2025 our best year of investing ever!",

            "content": "Nvidia\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on November 8, replacing Intel (INTC), marked a significant milestone for the AI chip giant. Throughout 2024, Nvidia (NVDA) became the standout performer in the index, with its stock price soaring by more than 170%, leading it to a $3 trillion market valuation. This growth positioned Nvidia as the second most valuable company globally, briefly surpassing even Apple (AAPL) for the top spot. This performance significantly outpaced the broader market, with the Dow Jones (^DJI) gaining 12.88%, the Nasdaq (^IXIC) rising 28.64%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) increasing by 23.31%.\n\nDespite Nvidia\u2019s stellar year, there are concerns about the sustainability of its growth. Morgan Stanley (MS) has highlighted issues such as the slowing production of Nvidia\u2019s Hopper GPUs and staggered readiness of their Blackwell products, alongside increasing competition from companies like Marvell (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) in the AI-focused Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market. However, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about Nvidia, maintaining an \u2018overweight\u2019 rating and a $166 price target. The firm believes that robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell architecture will \u201cprevail,\u201d outweighing current market debates. Additionally, they highlight strong underlying dynamics that support this outlook, even in the face of mixed near-term data.\n\nShifting focus to other sectors within the Dow, Walmart (WMT) has shown substantial gains, up nearly 72% in 2024, making it the second-best performer in the index. This success is attributed to its strategic investments in omnichannel infrastructure, consistent market share gains, and a stable customer base. Analysts at Telsey Advisory Group have marked Walmart as a top pick for 2025, expecting the retailer to leverage social media, enhance consumer service, and streamline supply chains. BMO Capital also sees a bright future, raising their price target to $110 from $100, while maintaining an \u2018Outperform\u2019 rating on the shares. They attribute this optimism to Walmart\u2019s strong positioning in an increasingly digital retail landscape.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP), securing the third spot with a 58.4% rise, has successfully stabilized its performance despite earlier concerns about rising delinquencies. Morgan Stanley anticipates continued support for AmEx in 2025, citing easing inflation, positive real wage growth, stable-to-lower interest rates, and rational lending standards as key drivers. Reflecting this outlook, the firm has raised its price target to $305 from $252 while maintaining an \u2018equal weight\u2019 rating.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS), up 48.44%, demonstrated resilience and strategic focus. CEO David Solomon emphasized the strength of Goldman\u2019s interconnected franchises during the third-quarter earnings call, highlighting its role as a premier M&A advisor and risk intermediary. JP Morgan (JPM) has a positive outlook, raising their price target to $550 from $520, anticipating benefits from improved capital markets activity and potential deregulation in a second Trump administration.\n\nIt should be noted that the consensus among various analysts indicates a generally positive sentiment towards Goldman Sachs, with targets ranging from $550 to $600 from other institutions like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), reflecting a strong belief in the bank\u2019s continued success.\n\nLastly, Amazon (AMZN), with a 44.39% increase, rounded out the top performers. The e-commerce giant\u2019s integration of AI across its operations, coupled with robust retail trends and superior fulfillment capabilities, has been well-received by analysts. Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth increased the price target to $290 from $245, maintaining a \u2018buy\u2019 rating, underscoring Amazon\u2019s strategic use of AI as a key growth driver.\n\nOverall, these companies\u2019 performances in 2024 reflect both sector-specific strengths and broader economic trends, with each leveraging unique advantages or facing specific challenges. Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI technology, Walmart\u2019s retail innovation, AmEx\u2019s financial stability, Goldman Sachs\u2019 strategic refocusing, and Amazon\u2019s AI integration highlight the diverse paths to success within the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",

Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors last year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, referred to a Dec. 13 court filing in which the company said that it did not bar its investors from also backing competitors. Investors were told that they would not receive competitively sensitive information from OpenAI if they chose to also invest in rivals to the company, the filing said.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a December interview with the Free Press that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings.",

            "content": "Watch BNN Bloomberg live.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks posted their worst start to a year in nearly a decade as investors braced for economic uncertainties with weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and an anticipated hike in tariffs.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year\u2019s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%.\n\nThe losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020. There\u2019s a lack of confidence over the country\u2019s economic recovery, with the Caixin manufacturing survey coming in below estimates and Donald Trump\u2019s threat of higher tariffs looming large ahead of his inauguration later this month.\n\nA sharp fall in the CSI 300 in the last trading session of 2024 also pushed the gauge below the 60-day moving average, a closely-watched technical threshold, likely leading to further selling by some funds. Several large financial stocks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China traded ex-dividend, exacerbating the benchmarks\u2019 losses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit troubling that investors are starting the new year in a cautious mode as this is happening after clearer stimulus signals from Beijing during its December policy meetings,\u201d said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. \u201cThe underlying momentum for China remains quite fragile, and it will take some efforts from the authorities to change the conversation on the country\u2019s medium-term deflationary dangers.\u201d\n\nWhile Chinese stocks rose 15% last year in a rare annual gain, a bulk of the increase came in the weeks following a late September stimulus blitz. The market has since been trading range-bound, with investors waiting for more significant stimulus to drive the market higher.\n\nFollowing the Central Economic Work Conference in December, China signaled more public borrowing and spending in 2025 with a shift of policy focus to consumption, in an effort to repair the economy\u2019s weak link as looming US tariffs threaten exports.\n\nWhile that announcement has given investors hope that Beijing is determined to revive the economy, some market watchers note that there will be a lull in stimulus until March when the so-called Two Sessions \u2014 China\u2019s annual legislative session \u2014 take place.\n\nTraders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025, according to Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.\n\nGlobal funds had already turned net sellers of Chinese stocks in November following two months of net inflows, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note dated Dec. 4. Passive funds turned to outflows after heavy inflows in October while active funds accelerated net outflows in November, they wrote.\n\nAs economic concerns linger, China\u2019s 10-year bond yields hit a fresh record low on Thursday. The People\u2019s Bank of China injected massive liquidity into the market at the end of 2024 without using high-profile stimulus, as officials preserve policy space before Trump returns to office.\n\nEquity trading volume was notable in Hong Kong on Thursday as markets reopened after a holiday, with that for the Hang Seng Index 50% larger than the average over the past 30 sessions. Meanwhile, turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has remained below 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in recent days, suggesting traders are opting to remain on the sidelines until catalysts become clear.\n\n\u201cThe losses today look very much trading driven, as there was a bit of accumulated gains that would have prompted selling with the breach of technicals,\u201d said Liu Dejun, fund manager at Beijing Kaiyuan Private Fund Management Co. \u201cMany are also talking about avoiding too much stock exposure ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, which is close to the Lunar New Year holidays.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Audrey Wan and John Cheng.\n\n(Updates prices, adds more comments.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "International crude oil prices fell around three per cent in 2024, slipping for a second straight year, as the post-pandemic demand recovery stalled, China's economy struggled, and the US and other producers pumped more crude into a well-supplied global market. Oil prices will likely be constrained near $70 in 2025 amid weak demand from importers and rising global supply.\n\nIn 2024, the crude oil and natural gas market navigated a complex landscape of controlled supply and variable demand, heightened geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic weakness, and a continued focus on energy transition. The resilience was reflected in the stability and consolidation of crude oil prices.\n\nBrent crude prices 2024 review Brent prices logged its second straight annual decline. According to Deloitte, Brent crude oil prices exhibited a minimal average monthly change and a monthly range-bound movement between $74 and $90 per barrel in 2024, making 2024 one of the most stable years in the past 25 years.\n\nOn Tuesday, the last trading day of the year, Brent crude futures settled up 65 cents, or 0.88 per cent, to $74.64 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude settled up 73 cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $71.72 a barrel. The Brent benchmark settled down around three per cent from its final 2023 closing price of $77.04, while WTI was roughly flat with last year's final settlement.\n\nIn September 2024, Brent crude futures closed below $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2021. In 2024, the oil benchmark broadly traded under highs seen in the past few years as the post-pandemic demand rebound and commodity price shocks of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine began to fade.\n\nBrent crude outlook for 2025 Oil will likely trade around $70 a barrel in 2025 on weak Chinese demand and rising global supplies, offsetting efforts led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) to shore up the oil market. The global benchmark Brent crude has averaged around $80 a barrel in 2024.\n\nAnalysts project oil prices to hover between $70-$80 in 2025, with a potential uplift of $10 if geopolitical tensions escalate. According to Reuters, Brent crude will likely average $74.33 per barrel in 2025, down from a forecast of $74.53 in November, marking an eighth straight downward revision. US crude is projected to average $70.86 in 2025, compared to last month's expectation of $70.69.\n\nOPEC+, which pumps about half the world's oil, at its December 2024 meeting pushed back the start of oil output rises by three months until April 2025 and extended the full unwinding of supply cuts by a year until the end of 2026.\n\nAnalysts from JPMorgan predict that supply will outpace demand by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). Leading global investment bankers Morgan Stanley and HSBC also revised down their expectations for an oil market surplus next year. It forecast a Brent crude price of $70 per barrel, following OPEC's decision to delay and slow plans for a higher crude output.\n\nThe decision came after crude prices weakened 18 per cent since June due to an oversupply and low war-related risk premium. Morgan Stanley raised its Brent forecast for the second half of 2025 to $70 from $66-68. The bank lowered its estimate for OPEC-9 (OPEC members minus Iran, Libya, and Venezuela, who are exempted from output curbs) production by 400,000 bpd for 2025 and by 700,000 bpd by the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nIt also cut its estimate for Iran's production by about 100,000 bpd through 2025. \u201cIn aggregate, this reduces our estimated surplus in 2025 from 1.3 to 0.8 million bpd in our total liquids balance, and from 0.7 to 0.3 million bpd in our crude-only balance,\u201d said Morgan Stanley in its note on Thursday, December 5.\n\nOn the other hand, HSBC maintained its Brent crude price forecast at $70 per barrel for 2025 and beyond, it said in a note on Friday. The bank anticipates an oil market surplus of 0.2 million barrels per day in 2025 if OPEC proceeds with planned production hikes in April. Previously, it had expected a surplus of 0.5 million bpd.\n\nAlso Read: Indian state refiners may buy Mideast spot oil to replace Russian shortfall\n\nBank of America (BoFA) expects Brent oil prices to average $65 per barrel, assuming no significant increase in OPEC production volumes in 2025. \"Demand growth has slowed this year and is expected to remain tepid in 2025 too, tipping the market into surplus next year,\" said BoFA. The weak demand outlook is the Achilles' heel for OPEC, the bank said, and forecast global oil demand growth averaging one million bpd this year and 1.1 million bpd next.\n\nInvestors will be watching the US Federal Reserve's interest rate-cut outlook for 2025 after US Fed bank policymakers projected a slower path in its December policy meeting due to stubbornly high inflation. Lower interest rates generally spur economic growth, which feeds energy and oil demand.\n\nWhat's hurting crude oil's outlook for 2025? -A weaker demand outlook in China in particular forced both the OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to cut their oil demand growth expectations for 2024 and 2025. The IEA sees the oil market entering 2025 in surplus, even after OPEC+ delayed its plan to start raising output until April 2025 against a backdrop of falling prices.\n\n-US oil production rose 259,000 barrels per day to a record high of 13.46 million bpd in October, as demand surged to the strongest levels since the pandemic, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Tuesday. Output is set to rise to a new record of 13.52 million bpd next year.\n\n-Some analysts still believe supply could tighten next year depending on US President-elect Donald Trump's policies, including those on sanctions. He has called for an immediate ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, and he could re-impose a so-called maximum pressure policy toward Iran, which could have major implications for oil markets.\n\n-China's manufacturing activity expanded for a third-straight month in December, though at a slower pace, suggesting a blitz of fresh stimulus is helping to support the world's second-largest economy. Analysts still see a much tighter oil market going into new year over Iran oil sanctions.\n\n-Buoying prices on Tuesday, the US military said it carried out strikes against Houthi targets in Sanaa and coastal locations in Yemen. The Iran-backed militant group has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's year-long war in Gaza, threatening global oil flows.\n\n\"We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile. Crude oil has support at $70.75-70.10, and resistance is at $72.00-72.50. In INR crude oil has support at \u20b96,040-5,970 while resistance at \u20b96,170-6,240. Traders are now waiting for US factory survey data to provide more insight into the demand outlook,\" said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.\n\nAccording to Kalantri, the market is now bracing for a potentially turbulent year ahead. Concerns about a supply glut, geopolitical risks, and the impact of the incoming Trump administration on oil policy are all adding to the caution.\n\n",

Act now before it\u2019s gone \ud83c\udf81\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index, which reflects the largest tech and nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, is up some 25% year-to-date and hit multiple record highs in 2024.\n\nThe top 5 winners on the Nasdaq 100 (as of Dec. 30) are AppLovin, MicroStrategy, Palantir, Nvidia, and Axon.\n\nFour of these top performers\u2014Palantir, MicroStrategy, Axon, and AppLovin\u2014are newcomers to the Nasdaq 100. AppLovin was added on Nov. 18, and the others on Dec. 23.\n\nNvidia remains the seasoned veteran, having been a component of the index since 2001.\n\nAnd after their significant surge in 2024, some analysts expect more gains for them in 2025.\n\nStrong demand for the Blackwell chip platform will dispel worries about Nvidia, Morgan Stanley says. Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAI drives Applovin adtech (Up 712%)\n\nAppLovin's impressive 8x growth is attributed primarily to the company's AI-driven advertising technology:\n\nIt builds models that help show targeted ads to the users who are most likely to engage, enabling companies to make data-driven marketing decisions.\n\nAppLovin stock rose 46% on Nov. 7 following its Q3 results. In the third quarter, AppLovin reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.2 billion, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rising 72% to $722 million.\n\nRelated: Analyst doubles stock price target for under-the-radar AI stock\n\nAppLovin reached an all-time high of $417.60 on Dec. 6, then slumped. The stock closed at $323.83 on Dec. 31.\n\nLoop Capital raised AppLovin's price target to $450 from $385 and affirmed a buy rating, thefly.com reported on Dec. 16.\n\nThe investment firm said AppLovin could be one of the better growth stocks again in 2025, and its recent weakness is possibly \"the best opportunity to accumulate the stock during this upcycle.\"\n\nWolfe Research has raised AppLovin's price target on AppLovin to $370 from $235 with an outperform rating.\n\nThe firm says the combination of improving fundamentals, an easing regulatory environment, secular AI tailwinds, and open-for-business capital markets represents \"an amazing time to not only be alive but also to cover software stocks.\"\n\nMicroStrategy: Trump win might help bitcoin plans (Up 359%)\n\nMicroStrategy's surge is primarily due to its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe company has aggressively acquired the world's largest cryptocurrency. As of Dec. 29, the company held some 446,400 bitcoins valued at $27.9 billion.\n\nDonald Trump's election to a second term was perceived as favorable toward cryptocurrencies as it likely means looser regulations. Bitcoin's price surpassed $100,000 in mid-December.\n\nMore stocks\u2019 performance in 2024\n\nMicroStrategy is viewed as a proxy for bitcoin investment, attracting investors seeking to buy cryptocurrency without direct crypto ownership.\n\nOn Dec. 12, investment firm Bernstein commented that MicroStrategy could sustain the strategy through at least 2025, supported by a favorable regulatory environment.\n\nPalantir: Software could be next AI wave (Up 340%)\n\nA number of investment firms believe in AI software's potential to boom into 2025.\n\nWedbush recently reported that while Nvidia fueled the AI engines with its chips, software giants are poised to steer those engines, empowering enterprises to use these data effectively.\n\n\u201cNow the time has come for the broader software space to get in on the AI Party as we believe the use cases are exploding,\u201d Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives wrote in a Dec. 26 report. The \u201centerprise consumption phase is ahead of us beginning in 2025.\u201d\n\nRelated: Analyst says big shift in AI coming in 2025 is huge tailwind for two stocks\n\nPalantir could benefit a lot from this big shift, according to Ives.\n\nPalantir's rally this year is driven by the company\u2019s expanding role in AI-powered data analytics. Governments widely use Palantir for intelligence and defense and enterprises use it for data-driven operations. Its products help them spot patterns and discover key insights in large datasets.\n\nPalantir reported quarterly results and guidance well above Wall Street expectations in November. Wedbush said the demand was \"rapidly rising.\"\n\n\"This will be a major growth driver for the U.S. Commercial business over the next 12 to 18 months as more enterprises head down the AI path with Palantir,\" the investment firm said.\n\nNvidia remains the AI chip star (Up 171%)\n\nNvidia's gain this year was fueled by surging demand for its graphics-processing units, which power AI applications across industries.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager unveils startling Nvidia stock forecast\n\nThe stock faced some recent weakness, closing at $134.29 on Dec. 31. Nonetheless, many Wall Street analysts remain highly bullish on Nvidia.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently said \"strong demand for Blackwell will prevail\" over worries about Nvidia, thefly.com reported. The investment firm has an overweight rating and $166 price target on Nvidia.\n\nTruist raised its Nvidia price target to $204 from $169 with a buy rating, citing all industry support for Nvidia's superior technology and expecting a constructive 2025.\n\nAxon: AI applications in law enforcement (Up 130%)\n\nAxon is a public safety technology company known for its body cameras, taser devices, and cloud-based evidence-management software.\n\nAnalysts are seeing growth points in its AI-powered software, like Draft One, which analyzes body camera video and audio transcripts and writes the first draft of police reports for officers.\n\n\"Today, we hear police officers spend about 50% of their time writing reports, and we drive that number down to about 10-20% of their time,\" Axon President Josh Isner recently told the Motley Fool.\n\nRelated: Analysts revamp Microsoft stock price targets on AI chip-demand shift\n\nIn early December, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall upgraded Axon to overweight from equal weight with a price target of $700, a 40% increase from $500.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Axon's 25%-30% growth to be durable, driven by the increasing role of software in its business. Over the long term, the firm sees it as a core holding.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager delivers alarming S&P 500 forecast",

            "content": "Reliance Industries (RIL) is strategically carving out its presence in the life sciences and healthcare space, a move that aligns with its broader diversification strategy.\n\nThe company has strengthened its diagnostic and digital healthcare ecosystem, with the acquisition of a 100% stake in Karkinos Healthcare for $42.7 million. Karkinos Healthcare, founded in 2020, is a technology-driven oncology platform offering innovative solutions for early detection, diagnosis, and management of cancer. Acting as a care partner during a patient\u2019s cancer treatment journey, the company clocked $2.6 million in revenue in FY23.\n\nOver the past five years, as per a Morgan Stanley report, the conglomerate has announced $13 billion in acquisitions, with 14% allocated to new energy, 48% to TMT (telecom, media, and technology), and 9% to retail. Of the total, the least investment ($54 million) has been made in the life sciences business. The Karkinos acquisition builds on Reliance\u2019s earlier investments in Strand Life Sciences, a genomics and bioinformatics company, and Netmeds, one of India\u2019s leading digital pharmacies.\n\nBut arguably the backbone of Reliance\u2019s healthcare ambitions is Reliance Life Sciences Private Limited (RLSPL), a wholly owned promoter group company which is not part of the listed entity. Operating across verticals such as biopharmaceuticals, molecular diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and industrial biotechnology, RLSPL is a market leader in plasma proteins, biosimilars, and vaccines.\n\nIn FY24, RLSPL reported \u20b92,205 crore in revenue, with its biopharmaceutical segment contributing a substantial 85% of this figure. With exports to 65 countries, international markets accounted for 46% of its revenue, demonstrating the global competitiveness of its offerings. RLSPL introduced five world-first biosimilars and has a pipeline of 23 biosimilars in the Indian market, underscoring its leadership in affordable and accessible therapeutics.\n\nTo meet growing demand and drive innovation, RLSPL is undertaking a \u20b92,200 crore greenfield expansion at its Dindori, Nashik facility. This state-of-the-art centre will double the capacity of its flagship Dhirubhai Ambani Life Sciences Centre in Navi Mumbai. Scheduled for completion by September 2025, the facility will focus on manufacturing plasma proteins, biosimilars, gene therapies, and vaccines, according to a rating agency report.\n\nThis investment aligns with Reliance\u2019s vision of becoming a leader in cutting-edge healthcare solutions. The expansion includes the development of pilot plants for gene therapy, a growing area of focus for the company, and increased capacity for producing vaccines to address domestic and global needs.\n\nRLSPL\u2019s financial performance highlights the sustainability of its growth with a PBILDT margin of 36%, delivering a PAT of \u20b9420 crore in FY24. With annual cash accruals in excess of \u20b9600 crore, supported by cash reserves of \u20b9364 crore, the company enjoys a low leverage ratio of 0.56x, ensuring financial flexibility for future investments.\n\nA quick glance at its products on online pharmacy retail chains shows that Reliance Life Sciences, currently, has a product portfolio comprising: Injections/Infusions (34), tablets (4), and capsules (7) besides powders, gels, and ointments (4). All these products cater to diverse therapeutic areas, such as cancer treatment, anaemia management, immune system support, bone health, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\n\nOutside of RLSPL, the listed entity, Reliance Industries, owns Strand Life Sciences, a subsidiary which was set up in 2000. Headquartered in Bengaluru, India, the company, with an equity capital of \u20b923.47 crore, is engaged in genomics-based research, offering services in bioinformatics, clinical diagnostics, and software development. The company\u2019s revenue from operations climbed to \u20b991.69 crore, an increase from \u20b982.41 crore in FY 2023, a growth of 11.28%. However, total expenses surged to \u20b9101.97 crore, a significant increase from \u20b981.36 crore the previous year. Employee benefits alone accounted for \u20b968.61 crore, resulting in a net loss of \u20b93.71 crore in FY 2024, compared to a profit of \u20b913.68 crore in FY23. The company\u2019s Delaware-based subsidiary, Strand Genomics Inc., which was set up to serve as a value-added reseller, and subcontractor for software services, too, ceased operations in 2016.\n\nIn the case of Netmeds Healthcare (formerly known as Netmeds Marketplace), the subsidiary operates in the healthcare and e-commerce space, offering services such as business consultancy, technical support, and advisory, as well as doctor consultations, diagnostic services, customer subscriptions, and the sale of pharma and over-the-counter products through its online platform and offline stores. In FY24, the company reported revenue of \u20b967.24 crore, a 53.7% decline from \u20b9145.31 crore in FY23, even as its profit fell 29%, from \u20b911.22 crore in FY23 to \u20b97.96 crore in FY24, indicating pressure on profitability. Inventory levels rose from \u20b949.12 lakh in FY23 to \u20b9183.16 lakh in FY24, suggesting an increase in stock for offline retail operations.\n\nWhile Reliance wants to make a mark in revolutionising India\u2019s healthcare landscape, the immediate concern for investors will be how the conglomerate with a \u20b916 lakh crore market cap tackles the weakening core O2C business even as it looks to ramp up its retail and telecom plays. Incidentally, it will be the first time in a decade that the RIL stock will end with a negative return.",

            "content": "Many Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan Stanley\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman, James Gorman, for US$21m worth of shares, at about US$105 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$126). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 26% of James Gorman's holding.\n\nInsiders in Morgan Stanley didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nNYSE:MS Insider Trading Volume December 31st 2024\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nMorgan Stanley Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Morgan Stanley. In total, Independent Director Stephen Luczo dumped US$7.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nDoes Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$347m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.",

The transaction is also secured by all first-lien loans.\n\nThe bonds are largely secured by mortgages on primary and secondary homes, while a significant amount, 47.1%, are funding investor properties, according to Fitch Ratings. The structure offers investors the notes through about nine classes of class A, M, and B, all of which have a final scheduled distribution date of October 2069.\n\nAll the notes in MSRM 2024-NQM5 are fixed rate. Senior classes A1A, A1B, A2 and A3 enjoy credit enhancement levels of 31.4%, 21.4%, 21.5% and 17.6%, respectively, according to Fitch. The M1 tranche has 8.6% in credit enhancement. After that, the B1A, B1B, B2 and B3 benefit from 3.8%, 6.0%, 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nNotes will replay investors through a modified sequential structure. Class A certificates will repay principal on a prop rata basis, and mezzanine and subordinate certificates are shut out of that repayment until all the principal in the class A notes is reduced to zero.\n\nThe transaction also benefits from excess spread, but that could be reduced on or after the January 2029 distribution date, Fitch said.\n\nUnderwriting for the deal appears to have shifted to alternative documentation compared with the MSRM 2024-NQM4 deal, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency. It accounts for 37.9% of the pool balance, compared with 24.6% on the 2024-NQM4 deal, KBRA said. Debt service coverage ratio, for investors properties, accounted for 31.9% of the pool, down from 43.8% on the previous deal. Traditional, full-doc underwriting also accounted for a smaller percentage of the pool balance, down from 30.4% on the 2024-NQM4 deal.\n\nSelf-employed borrowers account for 41.3% of the loan pool, KBRA said.\n\nMSRM-NQM5 is also geographically diverse, with California mortgages accounting for 24% of the pool balance. Florida and Texas follow with 14.4% and 9.3% of the mortgages, according to KBRA.\n\nHomeXpress Mortgage originated 12.8% of the loans, with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing on the transaction as servicer.\n\nFitch assigns AAA to the A1A and A1B notes; AA- to the A2 notes; A- to the A3 notes; and BBB- to the M1 tranche.\n\nKBRA assigns AAA to the A1 through A1B notes; AA to the A2 notes; A to the A3 notes; BBB+ to the M1 notes; BB to the B1 notes; BBB- to the B1A tranche and BB and B to the B1A and B1B tranches.",

Turley's BrokerCheck page lists 13 customer complaints against him.\n\nTwelve of those complaints were settled by J.P. Morgan Securities (the brokerage business the megabank acquired from Bear Stearns in 2008) between 2020 and this year for a total of $63.2 million. Turley denied the earliest of the 13 complaints, which was filed in 1999 when Turley was at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRather than allot JPMorgan the damages it had requested, the three-member FINRA arbitration panel overseeing the case awarded Turley $521,000 to cover his attorneys' fees and other costs. In approving that amount, the arbitrators cited California statutes providing reimbursement of legal expenses. As is common in FINRA arbitration decisions, the panelists did not go into their reasons for the decision.\n\nThe award notes that J.P. Morgan Securities accused Turley of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.\n\n\"The causes of action related to Claimant's allegation that Respondent was a former financial advisor with Claimant who unjustly enriched himself by brazenly lying to Claimant and breaching its policies over several years,\" according to the award.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nEx-J.P.

Morgan to pay $4M amid surge of complaints involving fired broker\n\n7 enforcement trends and notable cases in 2022\n\nJPMorgan wealth subsidiaries pay $151M SEC settlement\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the award. Turley's lawyer, Andrew Harvin of Doyle, Restrepo, Harvin and Robbins in Houston, said his colleagues and his client were \"very pleased that Ed has been vindicated.\"\n\n\"It shows this claim by JPMorgan should have never been brought in the first place,\" he said.\n\nLou Straney, a regulatory expert at Arbitration Insight , said it's highly unusual for a broker to prevail against a firm's claims in a case like this. He said he wouldn't be surprised if JPMorgan tries to appeal the decision.\n\nStraney said the award makes Turley almost seem like an innocent bystander.\n\n\"But he's been barred by FINRA,\" Straney said. \"That alone is usually enough to get you pretty far down the road and for the firm to be able to recover some money.\"\n\nTurley was a star broker at JPMorgan , generating about $30 million a year from $1.6 billion in assets under management, according to a detailed briefing of the case posted on the website of the Law Offices of Robert Wayne Pearce. Pearce represented several former clients of Turley's, including one in Texas who filed a claim for $55 million for unsuitable trading, misrepresentation and other alleged violations. Pearce, who declined to comment for this article, wrote that Turley would visit the wealthy client in Texas about once a quarter by flying his own jet across the country to \"wine, dine, and curry favor\" with him and his family.\n\nTurley logged 28 years in the securities industry before being fired by JPMorgan in August 2021 over a \"loss of confidence concerning adherence to firm policies and brokerage order handling requirements,\" according to BrokerCheck. He was barred by FINRA in November the following year after refusing to provide testimony concerning \"trading in customer accounts, including but not limited to the use of foreign currency and margin, and the purchasing and selling of high-yield bonds and preferred stock.\"",

This INR 308.38 Cr loss was a 7.8X increase from the INR 39.67 Cr loss it registered in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that had the company not incurred a share-based payment expense of INR 320.74 Cr for the quarter, it would have yielded a net profit of INR 38.92 Cr during the quarter under review.\n\nThe brokerage firm expects BlackBuck\u2019s adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margins to improve to 38% by FY27.\n\n\u201cWe also see FCF conversion in the 90-100% range, with return ratios in the low-20s% by F27. Our INR 450 probability-weighted PT implies 28x F27 EV/adjusted EBITDA, in line with the relevant B2B digital peer average.,\u201d the brokerage firm noted.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Rajesh Yabaji, Chanakya Hridaya and Rama Subramaniam, BlackBuck commenced operations as a truck aggregator. Since then, the company has diversified and now offers a full stack of solutions \u2013 from load management and telematics to payments for fuel, FASTag or toll charges, and truck financing.\n\nThe company operates a B2B marketplace specialising in intercity full truckload transportation.\n\nAt the time of listing, the company claimed to have around 27.5% of the country\u2019s truck operators on its platform. Without giving a number, BlackBuck founder and CMD Rajesh Yabaji said in a post-earnings call that it is adding 0.4% to 0.5% market share every month.",
