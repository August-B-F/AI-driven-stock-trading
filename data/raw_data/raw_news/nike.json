            "content": "Nike (NKE) beat modest earnings expectations under new CEO Elliott Hill, but investors remain jittery about the impact of Trump tariffs.\n\nNike stock fell nearly 8% at market open on Friday.\n\nThe footwear giant posted its fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday after the market close. Its revenue of $11.27 billion surpassed estimates of $11.03 billion, though it marked a drop compared to the $12.43 billion from a year ago.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at $0.54 compared to estimates of $0.30, but also under last year's $0.98.\n\nThe earnings report is the second under Hill, a company veteran who took the helm on Oct. 14. Shares initially popped, then dropped roughly 5% in after-hours trading as the company shared its fourth quarter guidance.\n\nCFO Matthew Friend warned of the impact of Trump's tariffs, including a 20% duty on all goods from China.\n\n\"We expect fourth quarter gross margins to be down approximately 400 to 500 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period last year. We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico,\" Friend said on the earnings call.\n\nNike reported a gross margin of 44.8% in Q3 last fiscal year. In this third quarter, gross margins dropped year over year to 41.5%, missing estimates of 43%.\n\nFriend said the team is \"navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile for rates and tax regulations as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.\"\n\nQ4 revenue is expected to be \"down in the mid-teens range, albeit at the low end,\" per Friend. Last fiscal year's fourth quarter revenue came in at $12.61 billion.\n\nHere's what Nike posted in the fiscal third quarter versus Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $0.54 versus $0.30\n\nRevenue: $11.27 billion compared to $11.03 billion\n\nNike brand revenue: $10.89 billion compared to $10.6 billion\n\n\"We've been through a lot of change, but what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. Nike, Inc. is a sports company,\" Hill said on the earnings call.\n\nThe road ahead will not be easy. In recent years, competitors' sneakers from On (ONON), Skechers (SKX), and Hoka (DECK) have taken market share. Meanwhile, a slew of tariff news has reignited inflation fears and shaken consumer confidence, which dropped sharply in February.",

            "content": "Nike\u2019s sales it seems is sinking and there is a huge drop as takers are dwindling. Nike is going to report its steepest revenue slump in nearly five years on Thursday when will announce its Q3 earnings result. Nike\u2019s new product line of sporting good and clothing were unable to impress buyers. The sneaker giant, Nike is struggling as customers are few and far fetched, adding to the woes is new tariffs and slower than expected turnaround.\n\nThe recent indicators demonstrates a long road ahead for Nike and its new CEO Elliott Hill, who took over in October 2024. Nike\u2019s stock has fallen by 19% since September 20, following Hill\u2019s appointment. Meanwhile, Adidas its biggest rival has seen its stock tick up slightly over the same period.\n\nNike\u2019s sales drop\n\nGlobal sales for Nike saw a drop of about 9% last quarter, including a 17% in China. Nike\u2019s biggest market, North America saw a demand slowdown resulting in sales dropping by 9%.\n\nSales for Nike dropped to $11.27B from $12.4B a year earlier. While Nike delivered a strong earnings beat, expectations were low, heading into the release and profits fell 32% from the year-ago period.\n\nAs per report, the sales for Nike in China it\u2019s key region was $1.73B, falling short of expectations of $1.84B.\n\nNike worst sales in years\n\nThe iconic shoemaker in the world is facing a demand slowdown and the upstart brands like Hoka and On are taking over. Customers are less spendy, not ready to shell out on expensive sneakers and clothing. The Nike earning guidance suggest it is going to have worst sales in recent years.\n\nNike earning report\n\nConsensus estimates from LSEG show that the Wall Street had expected Nike sales to be down 11.4% in current quarter. Beyond guidance, Nike beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations in its fiscal Q3.\n\nHere\u2019s how Nike performed during the quarter, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nNike\u2019s earnings per share: 54 cents vs. 29 cents estimated\n\nNike\u2019s revenue: $11.27 billion vs. $11.01 billion estimated\n\nThe sneaker company, Nike\u2019s net income for the quarter ending on Feb. 28 was $794M, or 54 cents per share, compared with $1.17B, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier, which is much less.\n\nNike\u2019s poor financial report\n\nCEO Elliott Hill said, \u201cI spent some time over there in December. I had not been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than what I remembered,\u201d He added, \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to accelerate our pace.\u201d\n\nHill since his return has been working to get back Nike to growth by focusing on winning back wholesale partners, innovative products and wooing athletes who moved out. The Nike\u2019s Q3 earnings report on Thursday depicts the work has not yet yielded results.\n\nNike\u2019s stock performance\n\nNike shares fell more than 4% in extended trading and are down more than 5% year to date, as of Thursday\u2019s close. Nike\u2019s stock has dropped around 30% over the last year.\n\nNike banking on innovation\n\nNike\u2019s biggest turnaround plan is its ability to reignite innovation and create shoes and apparel that reinforces it\u2019s position as market leader. Nike\u2019s new Pegasus Premium \u201cnearly sold out\u201d across North America and is expected to scale through fall 2025 as per Hill. So is the case with Nike\u2019s Romero 18.\n\nCan a Skims partnership help Nike?\n\nNike efforts to grow its female consumer base a key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales can be seen with its new brand teaming with Kim Kardashian\u2019s Skim. This new line dubbed NikeSKIMS will include apparel, footwear and accessories. With this partnership, Nike expects an improved inroad with women and be a strong competition to brands more popular with women like Lululemon, Vuori, amongst others than Nike currently does.\n\nThe planned women\u2019s line with Kim Kardashian-owned Skims \u201cwould be pretty good for the business,\u201d said John Nagle, chief investment officer of Kavar Capital Partners LLC. He added, \u201cif they can even just step into that market and be a significant player alongside the Lululemons and Vuoris.\u201d\n\nAlso during the Super Bowl Nike debuted a new ad campaign geared toward female athletes, its first big game advertisement in decades is a good strategy.\n\nWith continued innovative product line, fostering new partnership and trying to keep itself relevant it can just regain it\u2019s status as the undisputed king.",

We transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star Weekend in the Bay Area. Our brands, in one word, dominated,\u201d Hill claimed.\n\nThe CEO also shared that while sales were down generally, he remained confident in Nike\u2019s performance wear. He said revenues from running products grew mid-single digits, but didn\u2019t disclose a figure.\n\nChief financial officer (CFO) Matthew Friend said he expected fourth-quarter revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range, predicting a steeper fall than analysts had anticipated for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nHowever, Hill was optimistic about the long-term vision.\n\n\u201cThe progress we made against the \u2018Win Now\u2019 strategic priorities we committed to 90 days ago reinforces my confidence that we are on the right path,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s encouraging is Nike made an impact this quarter leading with sport \u2013 through athlete storytelling, performance products and big sport moments.\u201d\n\nThe brand\u2019s latest results followed two big leadership exits revealed this week. First was chief strategy and transformation officer Daniel Heaf, whose role was eliminated. Elsewhere, 20-year Nike veteran and chief communications officer (CCO) KeJuan Wilkins, who was promoted to that role in 2023 under former CEO John Donahoe, also left.\n\nKey quote\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the leaders of each of the geos and countries to implement the \u2018Win Now\u2019 strategy because, again, the strategy works.

They offered a snapshot of waning consumer demand.\n\nAnd above all else the numbers \u2014 though not as bad as Wall Street might have feared \u2014 show that Nike\u2019s turnaround will take time, a marathon and not a sprint.\n\nAs for those numbers released after the markets closed on Thursday (March 20), for the quarter that ended last month: Revenues were down 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, while the Street had expected a double digit-drop to the $11 billion level.\n\nBut looking forward, and as noted by CFO Matthew Friend, tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will hit margins by 4% to 5%. And revenues will decline in the midteens range, as management said on the call.\n\nThe stock slumped 4% in after-hours trading.\n\nFull-Price Digital Model\n\nWithin the consolidated top line, Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9% on a reported basis, amid declines seen across all geographies. Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12%, and driven by a 15% decline in Nike digital sales, and a 2% dip at the companies stores.\n\nSaid Friend on the call, with discussion of the digital sales: \u201cWe are repositioning Nike Digital within an integrated marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates and shifting closeout liquidation to our Nike factory stores.\u201d\n\nDigital traffic is expected to be down \u201cdouble digits in fiscal 2026,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cgradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. \u2026 For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model. For Nike factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory.\u201d\n\nDuring the call with analysts, CEO Elliott Hill, discussing the second quarter of his relatively new tenure at the helm of the company, said, \u201cWhile we met the expectations we set, we\u2019re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better.\n\n\u201cFor the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for Nike. \u2026 We\u2019re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on.\u201d\n\nThose actions will include diversifying sportwear apparel, he said. And across the brand, \u201cWe\u2019re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year\u2019s January and February to this year\u2019s Nike Digital and North America [sales] went from over 30 promotional days to zero,\u201d Hill said.\n\nCFO Friend\u2019s commentary on product lines and consumer demand were marked by declines in Nike sportswear and the Jordan brand, \u201cled by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business with a more pronounced impact on Nike Digital.\u201d\n\nNorth America revenues slipped by 4%; in the EMEA region, revenues slipped 6%, and in that segment Nike Direct was off 12% and digital sales declined 25%. China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.\n\nNavigating Uncertainty\n\n\u201cThe market continues to be promotional especially in consumer \u2026 and in the digital channel,\u201d Friend said of the China market.\n\nOverall, he said, \u201cWe are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nMoving through those headwinds, Hill said, \u201cWe are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. That\u2019s why I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We\u2019re going to run that through all three brand \u2014 Nike, Jordan, Converse \u2014 across performance, sportswear, men\u2019s, women\u2019s, kids, footwear, pro accessories, and up and down price points.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, as Hill said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of change, but what\u2019s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I\u2019ve been back, we\u2019ve reclaimed our identity.

While anchored by a \u201cWolf Grey\u201d titular hue, two key design choices produce a not-so-subtle allusion to the iconic \u201cCool Grey\u201d Jordan 11.\n\nFor one, the shoe features \u201cWolf Grey\u201d patent leather on the toe, eyelets, and heel, borrowing a headlining texture from Mike\u2019s eleventh signature model. Additionally, and more importantly perhaps, Nike includes white rope laces akin to those utilized on the \u201cCool Grey\u201d 11s. The toe box, quarter, and outsole appear in \u201cVast Grey,\u201d complemented by white treatments on the Swoosh and midsole.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the \u201cCool Grey\u201d Jordan 11 most recently returned in 2021 and is not among Jordan releases on our 2025 calendar. If anything, these AF1s are a solid consolidation prize for those who missed out on the recent \u201cCool Grey\u201d Jordan 9 retro.\n\nThe \u201cWolf Grey\u201d Air Force 1 retails for $125 and is expected to release Summer 2025 in men\u2019s sizing.

            "content": "Nike\u2019s fiscal 2025 third quarter results offered up a snapshot of just how biting the trade war and tariffs may be. They offered a snapshot of waning consumer demand.\n\nAnd above all else the numbers \u2014 though not as bad as Wall Street might have feared \u2014 show that Nike\u2019s turnaround will take time, a marathon and not a sprint.\n\nAs for those numbers released after the markets closed on Thursday (March 20), for the quarter that ended last month: Revenues were down 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, while the Street had expected a double digit-drop to the $11 billion level.\n\nBut looking forward, and as noted by CFO Matthew Friend, tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will hit margins by 4% to 5%. And revenues will decline in the midteens range, as management said on the call.\n\nThe stock slumped 4% in after-hours trading.\n\nFull-Price Digital Model\n\nWithin the consolidated top line, Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9% on a reported basis, amid declines seen across all geographies. Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12%, and driven by a 15% decline in Nike digital sales, and a 2% dip at the companies stores.\n\nSaid Friend on the call, with discussion of the digital sales: \u201cWe are repositioning Nike Digital within an integrated marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates and shifting closeout liquidation to our Nike factory stores.\u201d\n\nDigital traffic is expected to be down \u201cdouble digits in fiscal 2026,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cgradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. \u2026 For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model. For Nike factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory.\u201d\n\nDuring the call with analysts, CEO Elliott Hill, discussing the second quarter of his relatively new tenure at the helm of the company, said, \u201cWhile we met the expectations we set, we\u2019re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better.\n\n\u201cFor the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for Nike. \u2026 We\u2019re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on.\u201d\n\nThose actions will include diversifying sportwear apparel, he said. And across the brand, \u201cWe\u2019re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year\u2019s January and February to this year\u2019s Nike Digital and North America [sales] went from over 30 promotional days to zero,\u201d Hill said.\n\nCFO Friend\u2019s commentary on product lines and consumer demand were marked by declines in Nike sportswear and the Jordan brand, \u201cled by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business with a more pronounced impact on Nike Digital.\u201d\n\nNorth America revenues slipped by 4%; in the EMEA region, revenues slipped 6%, and in that segment Nike Direct was off 12% and digital sales declined 25%. China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.\n\nNavigating Uncertainty\n\n\u201cThe market continues to be promotional especially in consumer \u2026 and in the digital channel,\u201d Friend said of the China market.\n\nOverall, he said, \u201cWe are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nMoving through those headwinds, Hill said, \u201cWe are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. That\u2019s why I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We\u2019re going to run that through all three brand \u2014 Nike, Jordan, Converse \u2014 across performance, sportswear, men\u2019s, women\u2019s, kids, footwear, pro accessories, and up and down price points.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, as Hill said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of change, but what\u2019s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I\u2019ve been back, we\u2019ve reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. \u2026 Nike Inc. is a sports company.\u201d",

Consensus estimates from Visible Alpha show Wall Street analysts had expected sales to fall about 12%.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the fourth quarter will reflect the largest impact from our win now actions,\u201d Friend said, adding the company is also \u201cnavigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.\u201d\n\nNike shares initially ticked higher, before giving back gains to drop 5% in after-hours trading Thursday following the earnings call. They've lost more than one-quarter of their value over the past 12 months through the closing bell.\n\nSales Dropped in Q3, But Not as Much as Expected\n\nThe warning for the fourth quarter came as Nike reported third-quarter sales fell from a year ago, but not as much as analysts expected.\n\nThe athletic apparel giant saw its third-quarter revenue drop 9% year-over-year to $11.27 billion, though the figure topped the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Earnings of $794 million, or 54 cents per share, declined from $1.17 billion, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier, a narrower drop than Wall Street expected.\n\nThe better-than-expected quarter represents Nike's second under new CEO Elliott Hill, who took over in October. Earlier this month, Oppenheimer analysts suggested Hill\u2019s efforts to revitalize Nike appear to be \"taking shape,\" based on quarterly results from Foot Locker (FL), which sells Nike apparel.\n\nDuring the company's earnings call Thursday, Friend suggested headwinds from Nike's efforts to shift its portfolio would likely start to ease after the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nUPDATE\u2014March 20, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share price values.",

Shares initially popped, then dropped roughly 5% in after-hours trading as the company shared its fourth quarter guidance.\n\nCFO Matthew Friend warned of the impact of Trump's tariffs, including a 20% duty on all goods from China.\n\n\"We expect fourth quarter gross margins to be down approximately 400 to 500 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period last year. We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico,\" Friend said on the earnings call.\n\nNike reported a gross margin of 44.8% in Q3 last fiscal year. In this third quarter, gross margins dropped year over year to 41.5%, missing estimates of 43%.\n\nFriend said the team is \"navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile for rates and tax regulations as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.\"\n\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\nQ4 revenue is expected to be \"down in the mid-teens range, albeit at the low end,\" per Friend. Last fiscal year's fourth quarter revenue came in at $12.61 billion.\n\nHere's what Nike posted in the fiscal third quarter versus Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $0.54 versus $0.30\n\nRevenue: $11.27 billion compared to $11.03 billion\n\nNike brand revenue: $10.89 billion compared to $10.6 billion\n\n\"We've been through a lot of change, but what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. Nike, Inc. is a sports company,\" Hill said on the earnings call.\n\nThe road ahead will not be easy. In recent years, competitors' sneakers from On (ONON), Skechers (SKX), and Hoka (DECK) have taken market share. Meanwhile, a slew of tariff news has reignited inflation fears and shaken consumer confidence, which dropped sharply in February.",

It marked a 9% decline from the previous year\u2019s quarter, but handily topped Wall Street\u2019s already pessimistic expectation of $11.03 billion, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earnings per share of $0.54 nearly doubled the $0.29 estimate.\n\nThe market expected a lousy quarter from the sportswear giant as it works to clear inventory and increase engagement with its wholesale partners. But the third quarter results offer some green shoots that the turnaround plan under CEO Elliott Hill are bearing fruit. In October, Hill returned to Nike to replace John Donahoe as CEO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio,\u201d Hill said during the earnings call. \u201cIt will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over indexed, but our approach is simple, help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike.\u201d\n\nNike did not address tariffs in its financial release or on the earnings call. Concerns might be overblown as they relate to Nike. In a recent investor note, Telsey Advisory Group expected a muted impact on Nike with the 15% of its products manufactured in China largely to serve the Chinese market and few imported to the U.S.\n\nThe earnings report comes a day after a Bloomberg reported Nike\u2019s lead strategy and communications executives\u2014Daniel Heaf and and KeJuan Wilkins\u2014are both leaving the company. It adds to the list of senior leadership changes under Hill.\n\nGreater China was the worst performing region for Nike with sales down 18%, while North America, which is the largest market at $4.9 billion, was down only 4%. The Nike and Jordan brands represent the bulk of the company\u2019s revenue, but the firm also breaks out Converse revenue, which was $405 million, down 18% for the quarter with declines across all territories. NBA MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has helped raise the profile of that brand.\n\n\u201cNike is getting back to being Nike again,\u201d Jeffries analyst Randal Konik wrote in a quick reaction research note to the news. \u201cWe think this journey takes 2 years, but our call is for a V-shaped recovery in F27.\u201d\n\nLast month, Konik upgraded his rating from hold to buy and made Nike his current favorite pick. He sees an upside case for the stock at $140 based on 35x his 2027 fiscal year earnings per share estimate of $4.00. The base case has the stock at $115.\n\nNike\u2019s stock was the second-worst performer among the 30 components of the Dow in 2024 with a 30% drop. Its 7.2% decline the prior year made it the third-worst stock in the Dow.\n\nThe stock closed Wednesday at $71.86 and was down 5% in after-hours trading.",

Styles from the burgeoning Dn franchise, for example, reference Sean McDowell's design in a refreshing manner. And with the impending return of the Air Max Plus VII, Tuned Air aesthetics will only continue to steal the spotlight from modern proposals. Recently, the silhouette from 1998 emerged in a color scheme reminiscent of Jamaica's flag.\n\nWhile unofficially linked to the Caribbean island nation, the newly-surfaced Air Max Plus features a Varsity Maize/Pine Green/White/Black' ensemble perfect for Kingston's Carnival Sunday (April 6). Palm tree-inspired TPU overlays across the upper opt for the darkest tone of the bunch, as do mudguards, leather heel panels, and sections of the tooling underfoot. The textile mesh base, however, harkens back to its original look via its bold gradient finish from forefoot to spine. What's particularly curious about the Jamaican flag-reminiscent makeover is that it features a spotted pattern from mid-foot to heel. The design detail evokes images of the Air Max Plus VII's signature rubber overlays.\n\nTn badges reprise their typical look, while the whale tail-shaped shank underfoot opts for a two-tone finish of the sneaker's titular yellow-and-green duo. Visible Air units also indulge in the island-appropriate update.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the 'Varsity Maize/Pine Green'-accented Air Max Plus below. A firm Nike.com release date for the pair has yet to be disclosed by the brand, but that's expected to change before April ends. The shoe is priced at $180.\n\nFor more brightly-colored footwear from the Swoosh, check out the Air Jordan 1 'UNC Reimagined' retro set to land in May.",

Drawing inspiration from popular slip-on designs like the Foam RNNR and Crocs Classic Clog, the ReactX Rejuven8 distinguishes itself from other slip-ons offered by Nike, such as the Calm Slide, as the model comes with a ReactX foam upper, one of their most comfortable and responsive foams.\n\nSince its debut in January 2025, the ReactX Rejuven8 has taken the sneaker world by storm. Initial colorways, including Green Strike, Triple Black, Smoke Grey, Light Orewood Brown, and Team Orange, sold out within minutes of their release on Nike's website and at select retailers. This overwhelming demand has led to rapid sell-outs during each restock, which we monitor on the Sole Retriever mobile app in real-time.\n\nThe ReactX Rejuven8's virality extends beyond sales figures, as it\u2019s almost impossible to scroll through feeds and not see a post or video about the model. TikTok creators have contributed to the buzz, sharing unboxing videos and styling tips that have garnered significant engagement. This widespread social media presence, alongside many dubbing it Nike\u2019s version of Crocs, has undoubtedly fueled the shoe's desirability, making it a must-have item in contemporary fashion circles.\n\nWhere to Buy the Nike ReactX Rejuven8\n\nNike ReactX Rejuven8 Colorways\n\nThe Nike ReactX Rejuven8 is available to purchase through Nike and select retailers online and in-store and is priced at $70 for adult sizes and $60 for GS sizes.

That certainly goes for the rest of the country as well as the proverbial Madness takes hold, but year-in, year-out pro hoopers look back to their various alma maters, often in the realm of sneakers. With Devin Booker\u2019s Kentucky tenure capturing a particular high-point in the school\u2019s recent history (they haven\u2019t reached the Final Four since he left Lexington), it\u2019s a particular good omen that the Book 1 \u201cBlue Blood\u201d is beginning to emerge as the tourney looms.\n\nAfter the school shared his Book 1 \u201cKentucky\u201d PE, Devin himself promised a denim ode to the school coming to retail, something that the shoe at hand finally pays off. Atop a faux-vintage aged sole, the Suns SG blends between true collegiate style in the color choices with a more fashion-minded material choice. The allusions to the Wildcats are particularly undeniable down the throat of the shoe, both with the trademark blue hues coating the liner and laces as well as a throwback Cats logo on the tongue tag. Note too the exposed foam tongue, a first on the model.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 \u201cBlue Blood\u201d is listed on retailer calendars for an April 10th launch. Retail pricing will become firm as that date nears closer, but expect the typical $140 price tag for the time being.

And while laceless slides and other slip-ons provide the ultimate on-foot experiences for summer, some folks exclusively rock sneakers between May and August. For them, it seems the brand has prepped an all-new Air Force 1 Low featuring mesh panels throughout the upper.\n\nWhile not the first (nor last) time Bruce Kilgore's blueprint has been tweaked, the newly-surfaced style delivers one of the most curious updates in recent memory. A 'Coconut Milk' tone sets the stage across the top-half, covering the sneaker's traditional leather panels. A quick glance at the unreleased Nike Air Force 1, however, reveals porous mesh layers at the toe, mid-foot, and tongue. The breathable setup is reminiscent of the Air Jordan 4's signature sidewall details, which proved beneficial on the court in 1989.\n\nProfile swooshes and Achilles' heel overlays revert to their typical material, but both components keep things interesting with their textured presentation. A 'Canyon Gold' hue animates stitching across both pieces, while the tooling underfoot keeps things on-brand with a one-two punch of the aforementioned colors.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the reworked Air Force 1 Low ahead. Pairs of the 'Coconut Milk'-covered style are expected to hit Nike.com throughout April for around $135.\n\nFor more brown-colored footwear from the Swoosh, check out the Tom Sachs Mars Yard 3.0, the controversial artist's first collaboration with Nike in two years.",

More Nike branding is found on the hemp-constructed Swoosh and on the cork tongue tag, the latter featuring embroidered Nike text.

Find out more about how we test.\n\nApple Nike Sport Band review\n\nThe Apple Nike Sport Band is a workout-ready wrist strap that\u2019s built for the sporty type. At $49 / \u00a349, this is by no means one of the cheaper Apple Watch bands available, but it does, admittedly, have a premium feel to it that takes your workout monitoring to the next level.\n\nSpecifically, this band is constructed of the sweat and waterproof material, fluoroelastomer. Apple says that each strap has at least 30% recycled fluoroelastomer and that the flakes littered across the strap are made from a minimum of 66% fluoroelastomer \u2013 pretty neat. Interestingly, these flakes are scattered in a randomized manner, ensuring that each Nike Sport Band is unique.\n\nMore generally, this is a very nice looking band. I tested the Midnight Sky variant, where the flakes created a starry sky impression against the gray-black strap. Other than Midnight Sky, you can choose from: Blue Flame (blue and orange); Cargo Khaki (green and blue); Desert Stone (a sandy color with orange and blue details); Magic Ember (pink); Pure Platinum (white with mulit-colored splodges); and Volt Splash (green). I was a big fan of the many color options available \u2013 whether you want a more muted, professional looking option like Midnight Sky or an in-your-face vibrant band like Magic Ember, there\u2019s a style for anyone \u2013 something we always look for on our hunt for the best Apple Watch bands.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only variability to mention, though, because there are also a number of size options. This strap is compatible with three different case sizes: 40, 42 and 46mm. You can also get it in either small-to-medium (140-190mm) or medium-to-large (160-210mm). I used the former and found it very easy to get a comfortable fit \u2013 just poke the aluminum pin through one of the many holes in the strap and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nEven when keeping this strap on for entire days at a time, I never felt any irritation or annoyance. The high density of holes means there\u2019s plenty of room for your wrist to breathe and the material is inherently resistant against water and sweat, making this strap ideal for workouts, for instance. I went on a run and many a walk and never realized any strain or damage, so you can rest assured that there\u2019s plenty of quality here.\n\nAnd quality is exactly what you\u2019d expect for an Apple Watch band of this price. At $49 / \u00a349 this thing isn\u2019t cheap. There are some third-party alternatives \u2013 like the CeMiKa Silicone Sport Straps or Yoohoo Adjustable Metal Strap \u2013 that can be yours for less than $15 / \u00a315. But really, I think you\u2019ll feel the difference. The quality of material, excellent color design and more premium look of the Nike Sport Band makes it a superior companion for your Apple Watch \u2013 especially if you\u2019re someone that loves to get active.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nApple Nike Sport Band review: Price & specs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Price $49 / \u00a349 Materials Fluoroelastomer (at least 30% recycled) Band size S/M (140-190mm); M/L (160-210mm) Compatible with 40, 42, 46mm Resistances Sweat and water\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nShould I buy the Apple Nike Sport Band?\n\nBuy it if\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re the active type\n\nIf you\u2019re someone that likes to stay in shape \u2013 whether that\u2019s running, lifting weights, swimming (maybe all of the above?) \u2013 this is the ideal watch strap for you. It\u2019s made from a water-resistant material and has holes to let your wrists breathe \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\n\nYou want an easy-to-fasten strap\n\nSomething I love about the Apple Nike Sport Band is how easy it is to fasten to your wrist. Just poke the aluminum pin through one of the strap\u2019s holes and it will lock into place. No more messing around with an awkward buckle.\n\nDon't buy it if\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re on a tight budget\n\nThe only real issue I can take with this strap is its price. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy expensive given the quality on offer, but it\u2019s certainly not cheap. If you\u2019re looking for a massively budget-friendly strap, this one is to be avoided, unless you find it at a significantly discounted price.\n\nYou want an ultra premium option\n\nIf you\u2019re on the other end of the spectrum and want a top-tier premium watch strap, this might not be flashy enough for you. There are high-calibre metallic options like the Milanese Loop, for instance, but that will set you back almost $100 / \u00a3100.\n\nApple Nike Sport Band review: Also consider",

            "content": "Nike (NYSE: NKE) is set to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday, March 20, 2025. Analysts predict the company will report earnings of $0.28 per share on $11.02 billion in sales. This would represent a 64% decline in earnings and an 11% fall in sales compared to the previous year\u2019s figures of $0.77 per share and $12.44 billion, respectively. Investors will closely watch the company\u2019s performance amid ongoing challenges, including macro pressures, uneven consumer trends, and sluggish sales across various channels.\n\nThe company has $109 billion in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $49 billion, and it was operationally profitable with $5.5 billion in operating profits and a net income of $4.9 billion. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might just turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader.\n\nThere are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself before the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative \u2013 having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks.\n\nNike\u2019s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return\n\nSome observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:\n\nThere are 20 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 8 positive and 12 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 40% of the time.\n\nand one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 40% of the time. However, this percentage decreases to 25% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.\n\nMedian of the 8 positive returns = 7.7%, and median of the 12 negative returns =-6.8%\n\nAdditional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.\n\nCorrelation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns\n\nA relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \u201clong\u201d for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.\n\nLearn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors.\n\nReturns Mar 2025\n\nMTD [1] 2025\n\nYTD [1] 2017-25\n\nTotal [2] NKE Return -7% -2% 60% S&P 500 Return -5% -4% 153% Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio -6% -8% 552%\n\n[1] Returns as of 3/18/2025\n\n[2] Cumulative total returns since the end of 2016\n\nInvest with Trefis Market-Beating Portfolios",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nNike has the Air Max DN8 and the Big Head Origins slated as their big Air Max Day drops, but many are looking beyond March for their must-have bubbled pick-ups of 2025. Read on to learn more about the upcoming Air Max 95 \u201cNeon\u201d.\n\nThe original colorway of the 1995 model created by Sergio Lozano may be the most iconic Air Max sneaker of all-time. More recognizable than any of its siblings, the 95s are easily in a metaphorical Mount Rushmore of Nike footwear history for its timeless design.\n\nWith Nike\u2019s adherence to dropping shoes on milestone anniversary years, we foresaw the Air Max 95 \u201cNeon\u201d dropping in 2025 years ago. This year\u2019s version brings a very welcome twist as it will ditch the \u201cmodern\u201d Air units and revert back to the older construction that features the horizontal seam through the heel Air unit. This crucial detail was ditched way back in 2005/2006 as Nike re-engineered the cushion to be less prone to deflation; an unexpected byproduct was the disapproval by the public.\n\nThe Swoosh has taken serious efforts in restoring original shapes and constructions of its earliest Air Max models, and the 2025 version of the 95 is simply its best foot forward yet. It still falls short of the original via the smaller bag volume and the lack of psi markings, but that won\u2019t hold anyone back from copping multiple pairs.\n\nThe Neon 95 did drop at select stores in Japan over the weekend, but Nike has a firm release scheduled for the month of April planned out. Select stores in NYC, LA, Chicago, and along the I-95 route will release the shoes on April 4th, with wider SNKRS and retailer drop penciled in for April 17th. MSRP is set at $185.",

With just the right amount of stretch, ACG emphasizes mobility and protection here, using a water-repellent woven fabric to prevent you from getting soaked, as well as a mobility gusset, so you have some extra breathing room when you sit down on a bench to rest or crouch down to look at a cool bug along the trails. It\u2019s equipped with a webbing belt and zippered pockets to keep essential EDC accessories safe and sound.\n\nNike ACG Orb Weaver ADV UV LS Shirt\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nTechnical button-ups are the best of both worlds, making the move from your office to the trails as seamless as possible. Fitted with pockets galore, the Beaverton brand\u2019s Orb Weaver long-sleeve is perfect for storing small items like earbuds, keys, and anything else you have on hand throughout the day.

With its waterproof leather upper and rugged rubber outsole, you can also bank on protection from top to bottom. And while they resemble a pair of Diemmes from a distance, the shoe-boot hybrid\u2019s subtle Swoosh, chunky sole, and sleek colorways make it an affordable alternative.\n\nNike ACG Ays\u00e9n Day Pack\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nFinding the perfect backpack for your daily commute is no easy task; in fact, it\u2019s usually more challenging than the actual task you\u2019re commuting to complete.

Along the midfoot, the Swoosh comes in a light-washed blue denim, outlined in a sail white textile. Final details include a number one embroidered on the lateral heel and a sail midsole and outsole.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 Blue Blood will release on April 1, 2025, through Nike and select retailers online and in-store.

From there, the shoe includes a \u201cWorld Famous\u201d callout at the aglets in white text.

The project was first rumored last year and was said to include four colorways, however, only the \u201cBlack\u201d pair was highlighted in the brand\u2019s seasonal preview. Now, with the new Supreme season well underway, a first look at the \u201cWhite\u201d version has surfaced.

The iconic streetwear brand dropped its Spring/Summer 2025 teaser last week and followed up with its complete lookbook and range on Monday. On top of exciting new reveals featuring collaborations with artists like Damien Hirst and Aphex Twin, it revealed one of its upcoming Nike projects.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been covering the unreleased five-part Supreme x Nike SB Dunk Low campaign since last year, Supreme\u2019s long-rumored Air Max 1 \u201887 project was the one to make an appearance this week. While we lack a complete set of visuals featuring the shoe, two looks showcased the kicks in its \u201cBlack\u201d colorway. This version of the shoe looks to be presented entirely in black, save for its silver dubrae and white lateral Swooshes that are visible here. According to SneakerMarketRO\u2019s report last year, three other colorways of \u201cWhite,\u201d \u201cVarsity Purple\u201d and \u201cSpeed Yellow\u201d will accompany this pair when it drops later this year.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither Supreme nor Nike have confirmed which colorways of their forthcoming Air Max 1 \u201887 will be dropping and when. Stay tuned for more info, including an official look at all of the retail pairs, as it is currently set to drop at some point during Supreme\u2019s SS25 season via Supreme at a starting price of $170 USD each.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Supreme (@supremenewyork)",

A number of analysts soon lowered their price targets, however, warning Nike's turnaround could take longer than expected.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said recently they see room for \"slight outperformance\" in third-quarter EPS and projections for the fourth quarter. However, they still \"prefer to stay on the sidelines\" on the stock, considering an uncertain growth trajectory amid the company's strategic revamp.\n\nNike has increased its marketing and product efforts for women in recent months. The company announced a collaboration with Kim Kardashian's SKIMS for a new line of products, and aired a Super Bowl commercial highlighting prominent female athletes.\n\nNike shares have lost about one-quarter of their value over the past 12 months, at $73.70 as of Monday's close.\n\nUPDATE\u2014March 17, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.",

Its 'Light Armoury Blue/Sail/Ashen Slate/White' color scheme distances the sneaker from its performance origins, while embroidered snail-like figures on the forefoot cement its place in the aforementioned collection. Non-standard labels on the tongue are accompanied by unique lace fasteners that breathe new life into the 14-year-old design. Pull tabs at the heel also assist with easier on-and-off accessibility.\n\nFootbeds are stamped with a thematic mushroom character, rounding out Nike Sportswear's latest easy-going offering.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the Big Kids' Vomero 5 below.

This is evident on a newly resurfaced sample colorway of the sneaker from 2018 which blends a Penny Hardaway theme with the team colors of one of Major League Baseball\u2019s most enduring dynasties.\n\nRecently shared by Portland-based consignment Index is a Nike Air Foamposite One \u201cYankees\u201d sample. Taking its colors from the pinstripe uniform of New York\u2019s beloved baseball team, the unreleased sneaker also draws from the model\u2019s 2015 \u201cSharpie\u201d release. That colorway featured a striped upper inspired by Hardaway\u2019s practice of filling in the sneaker\u2019s grooves with a black marker in order to skirt around the NBA\u2019s uniform guidelines, which had strict regulations in the 1990s.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nAside from the \u201915 \u201cSharpie\u201d style, Nike never revisited the striped look at retail, but this \u201918 \u201cYankees\u201d sample seems to indicate the brand was at least entertaining the idea.\n\nDesigned by Eric Avar and first released in 1997, the Air Foamposite One has trended on and off since its original launch. It reached peak popularity in the early 2010s with the release of styles such as the aforementioned \u201cGalaxy\u201d colorway and a collaboration with streetwear brand Supreme. In recent years, the sneaker has experienced yet another resurgence and has also inspired looks from other brands including Balenciaga.\n\nThe \u201cYankees\u201d Air Foamposite One sample has rarely appeared on social media, and even less on the secondary market. It\u2019s previously been shared by sample collectors @rcclientele3 and @iamdavidnyc before its latest appearance at Index. The Portland store has a size 9 in the unreleased \u201cMidnight Navy/Wolf Grey/Sail\u201d style listed for $3,500.\n\nNike Air Foamposite One \u2018Yankees\u2019 sample (heel pair).\n\nNike Air Foamposite One \u2018Yankees\u2019 sample (lateral).

            "content": "My goal this year was to stop overthinking my outfits \u2013 to follow my intuition for how to style something vs making it more complicated than it needs to be for the sake of standing out. Sneakers used to be an easy styling piece for me: comfortable, friendly, unassuming. But somewhere along the way, I forgot how to let them exist as their own statement piece. Sneakers are strong enough to build an outfit around, especially the new Nike Air Max Dn8, the brand\u2019s latest iteration of the classic Air Max with bold colourways and a fluid futuristic silhouette. When it comes to styling sneakers, I now aim for cohesion instead of complications. I\u2019ve always believed that the way you style a piece is what creates individuality, but I\u2019ve realised that things can stand on their own and still be interesting. Just because the frills are gone doesn\u2019t mean the personality is. Ahead, here\u2019s how I\u2019m styling the new Nike Air Max Dn8.\n\nMichelle Li\n\nFleece\u00b2 I love pairing grey and white together. I love wearing double fleece (that\u2019s not a sweatsuit) together even more. Fleece is a texture that can quickly become too informal, but when worn in the right silhouettes, it adds just the right amount of casualness \u2013 especially to an outfit that feels too dressed up. It\u2019s the ultimate hack for the dilemma of wanting to look like you just threw something together without trying but still wanting to look cute. Combining the silver Nike Air Max Dn8 sneakers with a gigantic fluffy white fleece bubble skirt balances this look so that it all feels intentional.\n\nMichelle Li\n\nCherry red One of my favorite colours is a bright true red: it\u2019s bold, eye-catching and looks amazing with my complexion. It\u2019s also surprisingly easy to build fun colour combinations with. I chose to style my cherry red Nike Air Max Dn8 sneakers with a navy blue Nike track jacket, my vintage Commes des Garcons pleated silk skirt and red knee high socks. The bottom half of my outfit is bold and true-to-me, while the upper half tones it down and makes it more of a realistic, everyday look.\n\nMichelle Li\n\nSliver of silver Black is a colour that has become synonymous with effortlessly chic, but it has always taken me so much effort. I really struggle with figuring out how to wear black. For me, it can overpower the outfit and make every other colour extremely contrasted. This is my best attempt at head-to-toe black, with a hint of silver thanks to my Nike Air Max Dn8 sneakers, which soften the look.\n\nMichelle Li\n\nSimple suede Taking notes from what I said before about keeping things simple, this is my iteration of an easy weekend outfit for meeting up with friends and running my little errands. My weekend outfits are built for comfort, so I rarely wear anything other than sneakers. These Nike Air Max Dn8 sneakers are perfect for running around the city while still feeling like my style is being reflected. Sweatpants are what I\u2019ll automatically lean towards, but if I want to play a little bit more with my outfit, I\u2019ll wear a pair of Nike track pants with a vintage suede jacket for a clash of textures. That\u2019s the extent of my weekend brain\u2019s creativity.\n\nMichelle Li\n\nThe zip hoodie We used to fixate on how to dress up denim, and now we obsess over dressing things down and making our fancy clothing more suitable for everyday wear. Enter: the zip hoodie. It unquestionably sends the message that I\u2019m going for relaxed and informal. I especially love this Nike terry hoodie with a fancy skirt and the Nike Air Max Dn8 that also toe the line between athletic and streetwear \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect clash.",

Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe robbery was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in the Mojave Desert since last March, prompting an investigation by federal authorities, the Los Angeles Times first reported. The bandits stole Nikes in nine of the 10 incidents.\n\nThe 11 suspects in the Jan. 13 job, who were caught using tracking devices placed on some of the shoeboxes, pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment.\n\nTen of the defendants are Mexicans who were in the US illegally and one is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum processing, according to court records.\n\nIn 2022 a year-long investigation into burglaries of commercial railroad cargo containers resulted in 22 arrests in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nIn another major heist on November 20, Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County Arizona stopped a white van seen fleeing the area where a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry after losing air, according to another complaint.\n\nRoughly 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers, valued at $41,400, were found loaded in the vehicle, police said.\n\nTwo other cases BNSF freight trains were burglarized in separate incidents near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona last year resulting in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to additional federal criminal complaints.\n\nRoughly 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers, valued at $41,400, were found loaded in the vehicle, police said. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe thieves, sometimes tipped off by associates at warehouses, waited for the valuable merchandise to travel along rail lines parallel to Interstate 40, then boarded the lumbering freight trains when they changed tracks or opened their containers, Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona told the LA Times.\n\nThe criminals were often aided by accomplices who followed the train cars in vehicles. Those on the train would toss them the loot when the train stopped \u2014 either scheduled or because an air hose had been slashed, according to Brynna Cooke, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nOnce secured, the stolen kicks are usually transported to California to be sold or put for sale online through third-party Amazon and eBay resellers, according to the LA Times.\n\nMore than 10 BNSF trains have been robbed since March, according to a federal complaint. AP\n\nDespite railroads investing millions of dollars in security measures to protect their shipments, thefts from cargo trains cost the nation\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100 million last year due to the combination of stolen goods and damaged railcars.\n\nAnd the problem is only increasing as the heists are becoming better organized and more sophisticated.\n\nThere were roughly 65,000 train thefts nationwide last year \u2014 a 40% increase from the previous year, according to the Association of American Railroads trade group. Even that could be significantly understated as railroads don\u2019t publicize all thefts, Lewis told The Times.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15 billion and $35 billion in losses every year.\n\nThefts along any parts of the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for $15 billion and $35 billion in the US every year, according to ICE estimates.\n\nBNSF has told its employees not to engage with thieves but just to report when an incident occurs.\n\nWith Post wires",

UM will present him with an Honorary Doctorate of Forestry and Conservation.\n\nA homegrown Missoula native, Sprunk worked at Nike Inc. for 27 years, rising to the rank of chief operating officer as he helped transform and grow one of the world\u2019s most recognizable and successful brands. UM will present him with an Honorary Doctorate of Business.\n\nThese two outstanding alumni will serve as this year\u2019s UM Spring Commencement speakers.\n\nSteven Rinella\n\nRinella was taught to hunt and fish at an early age by his father. He earned a master\u2019s degree in creative nonfiction from UM in 2000, and he published his first book, \u201cThe Scavenger\u2019s Guide to Haute Cuisine\u201d in 2006. Other books followed, including \u201cMeatEater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter\u201d in 2013. Among his New York Times bestsellers are 2024\u2019s \u201cThe MeatEater Outdoor Cookbook.\u201d\n\nHis hit hunting and fishing program, \u201cMeatEater,\u201d ran for six seasons on the Sportsman Channel before moving to Netflix in 2018.\n\n\u201cRinella uses a trademark blend of storytelling, scholarly insight and thoughtful dialogue to enrich our national conversation around wildlife, landscape conservation and food systems,\u201d said Randall Williams, who earned a history doctorate from UM in 2015 and now works as a senior editor for MeatEater Inc. \u201cHe approaches political and social topics with a nuance and humility, acknowledging the validity of multiple viewpoints without abandoning his own personal convictions and rigorous skepticism.\u201d\n\nWilliams said Rinella uses his multimedia platforms to bring together people who don\u2019t always get along \u2013 everyone from hunters, vegetarians and ranchers to environmentalists and researchers. \u201cRinella has the rare ability to translate academic research and complex ideas for a general audience without sacrificing intellectual depth or nuance,\u201d he said.\n\nChad Bishop, who directs UM\u2019s Wildlife Biology Program, said Rinella promotes a thoughtful consideration of hunting ethics, which is necessary to sustain support for hunting in a society increasingly composed of non-hunters.\n\n\u201cI think Steven Rinella\u2019s career success represents the power of a UM education,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cHe was formally educated within our renowned creative writing program and went on to have a significant, positive impact on wildlife conservation.\u201d\n\nBen Long, a Kalispell author and conservationist, said Rinella has \u201craised the bar\u201d for intelligent outdoors content while becoming the most recognized face of the hunting and angling community.\n\n\u201cRinella has been called a \u2018celebrity hunter,\u2019\u201d Long said. \u201cHis efforts have helped secure millions of dollars annually for habitat restoration, wildlife research and public land access.\u201d\n\nEric Sprunk\n\nSprunk said playing basketball for Hellgate High School in Missoula helped develop the discipline and passion for athletics that propelled his professional business career. In 1987 he earned an accounting degree from the UM College of Business. He then worked seven years for Price Waterhouse in both Portland and Seattle, receiving early promotions twice.\n\nOne of the accounts he worked on was Nike, and soon officials there wooed him to \u201cjust do it\u201d and bring his Montana work ethic and infectious positivity to their company. He joined Nike in 1993, and quickly rose through the ranks, serving in various executive positions over three decades.\n\nSprunk spent half of his career as the executive vice president and general manager of global product and merchandising. He helped shape Nike\u2019s product portfolio and lead the company\u2019s global strategy, setting new standards for product innovation, design and merchandising. When he retired after seven years as chief operating officer in 2020, he had demonstrated the unique ability to drive large-scale transformation within a complex, diverse, global business environment while consistently delivering shareholder value and business outcomes.\n\nAnd there were perks. Sprunk was able to meet the world\u2019s best athletes and attend the biggest sporting events across the globe. At the same time, his loyalty to Griz Nation provided a pathway for UM grads who wanted to work at Nike.\n\n\u201cEric is known not only for his business acumen but also for fostering trust and loyalty among employees, customers and partners \u2013 qualities that set him apart in the global business landscape,\u201d said Suzanne Tillman, the UM business college dean whose position Sprunk helped endow. \u201cTo this day, Eric credits much of his success to the lessons he learned (at UM) and the relationships he built along the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest compliment I can give Eric is how he treats people,\u201d UM Athletic Director Kent Haslam said. \u201cHe is never too busy, never too important \u2026 to focus on someone else and make them feel like the most important thing in his life at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf you want to show students what you can do with a degree from UM, Eric Sprunk would be display No. 1.\u201d\n\nEric Sprunk\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The crime spree was first reported by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe train robbers identify high-security containers on eastbound BNSF trains from California's Interstate 40. They board and use saws, bolt-cutters, and other tools to break into the boxes and gain access to expensive footwear, tools, and electronics.\n\nNext, they cut the train's braking system air hose to force the driver to make an emergency stop. Then, they pull the products off the train and hide them nearby for their colleagues to load into box trucks at a later point. The merch is then hauled off to be sold or fenced to resellers, court filings show.\n\nOn January 13, a BNSF police officer spotted boxes containing more than 1,000 pairs of Nike shoes next to the rail tracks and worked with authorities to place trackers in four of them. Officials later recovered 150 cases of Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4 \"Brick by Brick\" worth an estimated $202,500 in a nearby van and also stopped a U-Haul containing shoes worth tens of thousands of dollars more. The shoe model was scheduled for release on March 14.\n\nIn April 2024, police recovered nearly 1,200 pairs of Nike shoes worth about $226,000. Two months later, they took down an alleged gang leader and reclaimed $3 million worth of merchandise believed to have been taken from BNSF trains. The items were found in storage units and residential homes and included 74 cases of Nike shoes and 108 packs of Nike socks.\n\nIn July 2023, authorities recovered 904 boxes of Turtle Beach Stealth Pro headsets, worth almost $600,000, which had been loaded into a landscaping truck and stashed in a nearby Motel 6.\n\nFilings show that in other seizures, officials reclaimed about $48,000 worth of Nike's \"Dunk Low Midnight Navy\" shoes and six boxes of \"Disney NBC Jack Squish\" \u2014 likely a reference to \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" character Jack Skellington as a Squishmallow.\n\nAuthorities have arrested several people in connection with the BNSF thefts, including 11 accused of involvement in the January heist and one man they believe to be a ringleader, but the thefts have continued.\n\n\"BNSF has robust security protocols, and our police department is focused on preventing these incidents on our network,\" a company spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We are working with federal, state, local, and tribal police departments to coordinate our approach to disrupting criminal activity and arresting offenders.\"\n\n\"It's essential that the entire criminal justice system, including policymakers, district attorneys, and judges, focus on this crime trend and help to ensure these criminals are held responsible and prosecuted,\" the spokesperson said. \"These are not victimless crimes, particularly when many of these packages include much-needed medicine, food, and critical supplies necessary for everyday life.\"\n\nCargo thefts cost the biggest railroads more than $100 million last year, according to the Association of American Railroads. There were more than 65,000 thefts in 2024, about 40% more than in 2023, the industry group said.\n\nBuffett, one of the world's wealthiest people worth more than $150 billion, oversaw Berkshire's acquisition of BNSF in 2010. The company's railroad system spans 28 states, generating nearly $24 billion in revenue and about $5 billion in net income last year.",

This latest release brings two new colorways of the Nike Astrograbber \u2014a revival of one of Nike\u2019s earliest turf shoes\u2014alongside an apparel capsule that continues Emily Bode Aujla\u2019s signature approach to blending sport heritage with contemporary fashion.\n\nAt the heart of this campaign is Nike athlete Ja\u2019Marr Chase, who sports both the Black/Tan and Chlorophyll/Black colorways of the Astrograbber, cementing the once-gridiron-exclusive silhouette as a modern-day sportswear staple. The campaign, shot by Eduardo Cerruti and Stephanie Draime in New Orleans, showcases the Astrograbber\u2019s unique fusion of vintage influence and contemporary styling, reinforcing its status as a timeless, everyday sneaker.\n\nFirst released in 1974 following the success of the Waffle Trainer, the Astrograbber was originally designed for football training before evolving into a broader symbol of Nike\u2019s innovative spirit. For this latest iteration, Bode Rec. elevates the model with premium materials and handcrafted details. The Black version features a woven textile upper that delivers a refined, versatile aesthetic, while the Chlorophyll green leather edition draws inspiration from a pair of Bill Bowerman\u2019s homemade, hand-dyed waffle joggers, which Bode Aujla discovered while visiting the Department of Nike Archives. Both pairs are adorned with metallic gold shoelace charms and arrive in special custom packaging that highlights the collaboration.\n\n\u201cBode Rec. is a line devoted to the history and evolution of athletic apparel, with a personal tie to football inspired by the time my dad spent playing the sport in high school and college,\u201d says Bode Aujla. \u201cWorking with Nike to reimagine the Astrograbber means partnering with such a historic American brand, which really embodies the inspiration behind Bode Rec.\u201d\n\nNike and Bode Rec. have confirmed that both colorways will release on March 14th via Bode.com, Bode retail stores in Los Angeles and New York City, and a newly opened Bode boutique in Paris. The Black colorway will then see a wider release on March 21st through SNKRS and select Nike and Bode Rec. retail partners. Stay tuned for further updates.\n\nStay tuned to our dedicated Nike Release Dates Calendar for updates as information becomes available.",

After leading his team to a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Antetokounmpo took to Instagram to preview his next signature shoe with Nike.\n\nPresumably named the Nike Giannis Freak 7, the new sneaker was highlighted in three different colorways. Taking on a new shape that differs greatly from the line\u2019s predecessors, the Giannis Freak 7 begins with a wavy texture at its midsole and carries this pattern across a portion of each side of the upper. He\u2019s opted to bring back reversed Swooshes, prominently placing them on each side of the sneaker. A two-piece outsole features an \u201cAntetokounmpo\u201d callout towards the lateral while his \u201cGA\u201d logo hits the tongue. Pictured first is a black and orange rendition that carries pink Swooshes. Another look features an all-yellow composition while a mock-up of the third \u201cWolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing\u201d seems to pair gray with \u201cVolt\u201d accents.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither Giannis Antetokounmpo nor Nike Basketball have indicated when the Nike Giannis Freak 7 will be making its retail debut. Based on the August release date of its predecessor, it will likely be several more months until this new model is available to the public. Based on the deck slide shown off in Antetokounmpo\u2019s Instagram post embedded below, it looks like it will be arriving at a $110 USD starting price via Nike SNKRS and select retailers.",

In-store winners will be notified on March 14th, while online winners will be notified via email by Thursday, March 20th. The sneaker will also release at UNDEFEATED Shibuya on March 15th. The shoes will release again through Nike and multiple partner locations later this Spring.\n\nThe following was published on March 13th, 2025:\n\nAfter a winter-long celebration stemming from the World Series victory last October, the Los Angeles Dodgers are now focused on a title defense to become the first back-to-back champs since the Yankees accomplished the feat in the late 1990s. They may have superstar power on both sides of the ball, but the spirit of the Black Mamba and the Nike Kobe 6 Protro \u201cDodgers\u201d could be the positive energy that pushes them to bring another ring to LA.\n\nA superb delight for LA sports fans, the Nike Kobe 6 Protro \u201cDodgers\u201d combines the love of Kobe Bryant and the hometown team in one spirited shoe. Inspired by the PE first shared by Vanessa Bryant, this special colorway needs little description; it\u2019s Dodgers to a tee as the snakeskin TPU is flooded in the signature shade of blue, while white and red accents rally the rest of the LA threads for the perfect Opening Day \u2018fit. Kobe\u2019s number 8 sits at the heel.\n\n1 of 4\n\nThe launch the shoe, Nike tapped the one and only UNDEFEATED to be the exclusive launch partner of the drop. On March 15th, the Kobe 6 \u201cDodgers\u201d will be available exclusively at UNDEFEATED chapter stores in the LA area and in Tokyo, the latter city being where the Dodgers will actually begin their 2025 campaign. These are part of a larger Nike Kobe \u201cGame Royal\u201d collection that includes the Diamond Elite Catchers Set, Kobe Alpha Elite Batting Gloves, Kobe Diamond Sliding Mitt, and Kobe Baseball Jersey (see below).

            "content": "Nike Women\n\nWas anyone else absolutely Fired! Up! watching this year\u2019s Super Bowl? Not because the Philadelphia Eagles finally got their win over the Kansas City Chiefs after losing to them in the Super Bowl two years ago, but because of Nike\u2019s brand-new \u201cSo Win\u201d commercial.\n\nThe ad, which aired right before Kendrick Lamar\u2019s halftime show, featured a mesmerizing cast of some of the most iconic women in sports right now, including A\u2019ja Wilson, Caitlin Clark, JuJu Watkins, Jordan Chiles, Sabrina Ionescu, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Alexia Putellas, Aryna Sabalenka, and Sophia Smith Wilson.\n\nIn the commercial, clips of the women dominating in their respective sports were intermixed with gorgeous in-studio cameos, all while Grammy winner Doechii does the voiceover narration. In the \u201cSo Win\u201d message, which Nike calls its new anthem, per a statement, Doechii gets into some of the many limitations that are put on female athletes, from their behavior being policed to how they look. By the end of the video though, those tired tropes and double standards are subverted. Watch below to witness the ad in all its glory and prepare for a pump-up like no other:\n\nGiven the enormous increase in viewership and investment across women\u2019s sports, the timing of this ad is no surprise. \u201cWomen\u2019s sports isn\u2019t the future\u2014it\u2019s right now,\" says Sabrina Ionescu in the statement. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it in packed arenas, in TV ratings, in the way people are showing up for the game like never before. Commanding attention isn\u2019t about being the loudest in the room. It\u2019s about making sure that when you step up, everyone takes notice.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a trend for Nike. The 60-second ad was Nike\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial since 1998, so it\u2019s a really big deal that the iconic brand chose to end its nearly 30-year Super Bowl hiatus highlighting women in sports, especially during an enormous cultural event that centers men.\n\nSo if you re like me and absolutely need to put the words from the \u201cSo Win\u201d anthem on your wall to include in your morning affirmations, the full transcript is below:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be demanding. You can\u2019t be relentless. You can\u2019t put yourself first. So, put yourself first. You can\u2019t be confident. So be confident. You can\u2019t challenge, so challenge. You can\u2019t dominate, so dominate. You can\u2019t flex, so flex. You can\u2019t fill a stadium, so fill that stadium. You can\u2019t be emotional, so be emotional. You can\u2019t take credit. You can\u2019t speak up. You can\u2019t be so ambitious. Break records. You can\u2019t have any fun. You can\u2019t make demands. You can\u2019t be proud. You can\u2019t keep score. You can\u2019t stand out. Whatever you do, you can\u2019t win. So win.\u201d\n\nBut the best part about this ad? The message goes well beyond sports. \u201cWinning isn\u2019t just about medals,\u201d says Jordan Chiles in the Nike statement. \u201cIt\u2019s about overcoming, about proving to yourself that you\u2019re capable of more than you ever imagined. You put in the work, you stay ready, and when the moment comes, you own it.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like",

And while widely celebrated, the Oregon-based company also commits itself on producing brand-new product inspired by its expansive archive. Case in point?: The V5 RNR for women.\n\nRooted in Nike Running's performance footwear of the early 2000s, the silhouette delivers heritage and a trendy aesthetic for modern audiences. The breathable, lightweight mesh upper sets the stage for a plethora of synthetic overlays, which opt for a refreshing 'Psychic Blue' color on the latest pair to surface. Reflective accents throughout the top-half harken back to beloved running franchises from the Swoosh\u2014which now includes the marquee Pegasus Premium.\n\nUnderfoot, the tooling solution falls in line with the design principles of yesteryear. No ZoomX, ReactX, or Cushlon foam found in top-of-the-line products appears on the lifestyle shoe, but the EVA foam provided delivers a reliable ride. A mid-foot shank indulges in the titular blue tone while delivering stability to every stop. Lastly, the rubber tread features recycled materials as denoted by its speckled finish.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the Women's 'Psychic Blue' V5 RNR below. Pairs are currently scheduled to beginning rolling out via Nike.com on Monday, March 31, for a budget-friendly $90.\n\nFor more from the Swoosh empire, check out the Jordan Release Dates Calendar, our comprehensive guide for all things from Team Jumpman.

Given the dominant black palette and flares of bright green on the sole unit, it\u2019s a fair comparison, and perhaps that \u201cGolden Age\u201d colorway was, in fact, a reference point here. However, official Nike copy includes no references to that 2007 pair, instead opting to let the \u201cBlack Volt\u201d establish its own legacy. It does, however, mark another heavy year of Foamposite releasesfor Nike, evidently intent on sparking a true Foamposite revolution: the Flightposite and return of the Galaxy Foams bolstered that effort in the weeks preceding this pair.",

Offered in lavender and navy, the sleek halter top features a blue-patterned Swoosh; clasp-neck closure; and two thin, open-back straps.\n\nA soft tank leotard features extra Swooshes on its black elastic straps, serving as a not-so-subtle reminder of gymnasts\u2019 strength and power. Meanwhile, a go-to training leotard features a Swoosh at center chest and a higher neckline cut in a silhouette designed for everyday performance and comfort.\n\nEach piece, offered in select kids\u2019 and women\u2019s sizing, has been created to complement Nike\u2019s full suite of training and sportswear apparel, which gymnasts have long embraced for workouts and everyday wear.\n\nThe leotards are the first training apparel born from a five-year partnership between Nike and USAG, which began in 2023 and will provide expanded opportunities for all kids to experience the thrill of movement and the confidence it builds, from their first forward roll to their first back handspring and beyond.\n\nWith their support extending throughout all USAG disciplines \u2014 acrobatic, artistic, gymnastics for all, parkour, rhythmic, trampoline and tumbling \u2014 the partners further aim to uplift elite gymnasts on their journeys to the world\u2019s greatest stages, in turn inspiring the next generation of athletes to experience gymnastics and joy-filled movement. (About half of all U.S. gymnasts are between the ages of 6 and 12.)\n\nAs part of the partnership, the Swoosh also will appear this year on National Team leotards and training apparel at key international and national events.\n\nThe Nike leotard collection is now available at nike.com, on the Nike App, and at select online retailers.\n\n",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nUsing this year\u2019s Air Max 95 \u201cNeon\u201d retro as the blueprint, Nike is celebrating the model\u2019s 30th anniversary by giving other memorable colorways the same big bubble treatment. We spilled ink on the return of the \u201cPink Foams\u201d earlier this year, and now a first look confirms that the shoe is in fact coming back with OG-inspired tooling.\n\nThe \u201cPink Foam\u201d Air Max 95 originally released in 2020 and was famously flaunted by Kim Kardashian on Instagram, which caused resale prices to skyrocket in the wake of a fairly mellow drop. The sneaker plays off the OG \u201cNeon\u201d colorway by swatching in \u201cPink Foam\u201d as the accent hue, appearing notably on the eyelets, outsole, Swoosh logos, and Air units. Grey suede sidewalls and a black midsole come in as familiar makeup.\n\nUnveiled by UK retailer Size? in the embedded video above, the 2025 retro dials is back to 1995 with an OG-inspired big bubble Air unit. While not quite on par with original Air Max 95s, the Air units are noticeably larger than those of the \u201cmodern\u201d version used in 2020. Moreover, just like the upcoming \u201cNeon\u201d retro, Nike adds a seam to the center of all the bubbles.\n\nThis is one of several big bubble Air Max 95s landing in 2025, joined of course by the \u201cNeon\u201d retro alongside an emerging lineup that includes \u201cCool Grey\u201d and black styles. A Ma Mani\u00e9re and Corteiz are releasing new Air Max 95 collaborations this year, but neither have received the same big bubble treatment.\n\nA concrete release date for the \u201cPink Foam\u201d Air Max 95 hasn\u2019t been announced yet, but we\u2019re still expecting an April 2025 arrival.

The model has been subject to thematic makeovers, like those for Halloween and Christmas, and has also appeared in exclusive colorways, like the Nike EYBL PE. Nike has given the Book 1 a makeover for the Chinese High School Basketball League.\n\nFeaturing a smooth leather and mesh mixture, the upper takes on a white finish across most of its paneling. This includes the leather around the toebox, mudguard, eyestays, collar, and heel, while the midfoot panel undergoes a makeover, replacing its usual canvas twill for mesh. Contrasting the neutral hues is a gradient pattern applied to the Swoosh, beginning in a pink hue and transitioning into an orange-yellow hue as you approach the heel.\n\nNike Book 1 CHBL\n\nMore pops of color come in the form of the yellow Book-branded woven tongue label, which contains Chinese characters translated to Nike, and the spine of the heel, which comes with a braided nylon patch in a mixture of deep blue and light blue. Finishing the design are the 1\u2019s embroidered into the lateral heel, the white rubber midsole, and a semi-translucent gradient outsole going from a light red-pink to icy blue as you move from the toe back.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 CHBL will release exclusively in China in Spring 2025 through Nike and select retailers. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is 1099 CNY (approx $150).

            "content": "NIKE's third-quarter fiscal 2025 results are expected to reflect ongoing challenges, including weak lifestyle product sales, sluggish digital revenues, and headwinds in Greater China and certain EMEA markets. These factors are expected to have contributed to slower revenue growth and margin pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. The lifestyle segment, comprising men's, women's, and the Jordan lines, has been facing persistent struggles, particularly in digital channels. Macroeconomic factors like inflation and rising interest rates have curbed discretionary spending, posing difficulties for premium brands in North America. In Greater China, shifting consumer behavior, lower foot traffic and weaker sell-through rates have pressured regional revenues. While NIKE has moderated its near-term expectations for the region, management has been optimistic about its long-term market position. On the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, the company forecast a low-double-digit year-over-year revenue decline for the fiscal third quarter, impacted by CEO Elliott Hill\u2019s strategic actions and foreign exchange headwinds. However, NIKE expects some benefit from the Cyber Week's timing shift into the fiscal third quarter. NKE expects the fiscal third-quarter gross margin to decrease 300-350 basis points (bps) year over year. SG&A expenses are estimated to see a slight reduction, reflecting restructuring charges from the prior year. The company anticipates other income and expenses, including net interest income, between $30 million and $40 million. Our model projects the gross margin to decline 300 bps to 41.8% for third-quarter fiscal 2025. We predict SG&A expenses of $4.1 billion for the quarter, suggesting a 2.6% year-over-year decline. As a percentage of sales, SG&A is anticipated to rise 290 basis points to 36.9%.\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. NIKE has an Earnings ESP of -6.90% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nNIKE Inc. NKE is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 20. The leading sports apparel retailer is estimated to have witnessed year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines in the fiscal third quarter. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $11.1 billion, suggesting a 10.6% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at 28 cents per share, indicating a decline of 71.4% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal third quarter were unchanged in the last 30 days. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 23.8%. Its bottom line beat the consensus estimate by 29.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. Quote\n\nHowever, NKE\u2019s strategic pricing and supply-chain optimization, including logistics, inventory management and distribution, are expected to have cushioned the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Effective inventory management strategies have been another critical component of NIKE's success.\n\n\n\nThe company continues to prioritize sports performance, accelerating product innovation and storytelling to enhance brand appeal. Its innovation pipeline, driven by initiatives like Speed Lane, aims to bring new fitness and lifestyle franchises to market faster. NIKE expects these innovations and focus on its sports performance product category to have supported its fiscal third-quarter performance.\n\n\n\nThe company is intensifying its focus on sports, speeding up the introduction and expansion of new products and innovations. NKE is also enhancing its storytelling efforts with greater impact and boldness while elevating the overall marketplace to strengthen brand distinction and align with consumer preferences. Additionally, the company is accelerating its innovation pipeline, advancing several innovations. It is taking bold steps to reclaim its leading edge in innovation. Focus on its sports performance product category has been the key to its strategy.\n\n\n\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, the company expects to see additional innovations be launched from Speed Lane, including several exciting new franchises in fitness and lifestyle, boosting performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nNIKE is transitioning its digital strategy toward a full-price model, reducing reliance on promotions. At the start of fiscal 2025, digital sales had shifted to a nearly 50-50 split between full-price and discounted items. This strategic pivot, alongside efforts to boost organic traffic and enhance consumer engagement, is expected to have supported digital sales in the to-be-reported quarter. NIKE is also leveraging value stores to clear excess inventory, reinforcing its premium positioning while optimizing sales performance.\n\nNIKE\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\n\nNKE shares have exhibited a downward trend, shedding as much as 26.8% in the past year. The stock has lost against the broader Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 2.3% and 9.5%, respectively. The NKE stock has also underperformed the industry\u2019s decline of 23.6% in the same period.\n\n\n\nNIKE's performance is notably weaker than its close competitors, including Wolverine World Wide WWW and Adidas ADDYY, which rose 34% and 11.1%, respectively, in the past year. NKE also underperformed Skechers\u2019 SKX decline of 18.2% in the past year.\n\nNKE\u2019s One-Year Stock Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt the current price of $74.17, NIKE trades at an 8.1% premium to its 52-week low of $68.62. The current price represents a 27.6% discount to the 52-week high mark of $102.49.\n\n\n\nDespite this recent downturn, NKE\u2019s valuation appears quite pricey. The company trades at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 33.24X, exceeding the industry average of 26.98X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 20.63X.\n\n\n\nGiven the premium valuation, investors could face significant risks if the company's future performance does not meet expectations. The Consumer Discretionary market is becoming increasingly competitive and NIKE\u2019s initiatives may not be sufficient to drive significant growth. Macroeconomic challenges and heightened competition could impede the company's ability to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nAs a dominant athletic footwear and apparel market player, NKE has been showing some promise through CEO Elliot Hill\u2019s strategies, crafted around transitioning its digital platform to a full-price model, scaling back performance marketing investments and refining its production and distribution strategy.\n\n\n\nWhile these efforts are expected to create long-term value, they are expected to lead to some short-term revenue challenges. The weaker guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 dampens near-term growth prospects. Also, its near-term challenges in lifestyle products and Greater China cannot be ignored.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs NIKE prepares to report its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, investors may question whether now is the right time to buy. The company\u2019s strong market position and strategic initiatives support a positive long-term outlook, making it an appealing choice for those seeking exposure to a global leader in the athletic and lifestyle sectors with growth potential and a commitment to shareholder value.\n\n\n\nHowever, headwinds in the lifestyle segment, challenges in Greater China, and broader economic pressures warrant careful consideration. Assessing these factors ahead of the earnings release can help investors make more informed decisions.\n\n\n\nWhile NIKE\u2019s long-term growth prospects remain strong, a cautious approach is advisable. For existing NKE shareholders, holding the stock may be a prudent move, as the upcoming earnings report could provide key insights into the company\u2019s future direction.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The brand has given assurances that it will not impact their product offerings.\n\nNike previously launched a separate legal action against Lululemon in New York in 2022, alleging that the brand\u2019s Mirror Home Gym product infringes on Nike patents related to interactive exercise technology.\n\nProceedings for this case are still underway.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe years-long legal battle between Nike and resale platform StockX over counterfeits will head to trial later this year, according to court documents filed last week.\n\nA federal judge granted part of Nike\u2019s motion for a partial summary judgment in the lawsuit, which has been ongoing since 2022. The athleticwear giant accused the resale company of counterfeiting and insidious false advertising, but the judge dismissed allegations of false advertising , per a release from StockX.\n\nThe companies have until Friday to file a joint letter indicating how long they expect the trial to take and the companies\u2019 availability between June 15 and November 15.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNike initially called for a partial summary judgment in the case last year, meaning it asked the judge to rule on some of its claims before the trial. That request came after Nike said it discovered at least 77 pairs of counterfeit Nike shoes sold on StockX. In response to that motion, StockX said it stood by its authentication process and that Nike\u2019s claims were misguided.\n\nIn last week\u2019s filings, Nike\u2019s request was granted in part as it looks to hold StockX liable for distributing four pairs of counterfeit shoes to Nike investigators and selling 33 pairs of counterfeit shoes to one individual named Roy Kim.\n\n\u201cVerification has been core to StockX since our inception \u2014 we\u2019ve invested millions of dollars in technology, training, and tooling, and we stand behind every product sold on StockX with our Buyer Promise,\u201d StockX said in its release on the judgment. \u201cIn this case and on an ongoing basis with all our customers, we offer refunds or replacements if someone receives an incorrect product.\u201d\n\nStockX said the products referenced in the request for partial summary judgment amounted to \u201c0.0004% of the 17.8 million Nike sneakers reviewed while this litigation was ongoing.\u201d Nike was the top-selling brand on StockX\u2019s platform during the last three years.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s a shame that rather than work with us to fight fakes, Nike has instead opted to use its resources to pursue meritless, expensive litigation,\u201d StockX said in the release. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to tell our story to a jury at trial.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit has evolved since it was first filed.\n\nNike initially sued the resale platform for allegedly using Nike trademarks in non-fungible tokens (or NFTs). Counterfeiting and false advertising claims were added to the lawsuit a few months later, after Nike obtained the four pairs of counterfeit shoes referenced in last week\u2019s filing.\n\nSimilar to another ongoing legal challenge between Chanel and What Goes Around Comes Around, the results of the Nike and StockX dispute could have implications for resellers that use and promote authentication systems.",

            "content": "Intrigue Abounds With Loaded Distance Events At This Week's Nike Indoor Nationals\n\nBy Oliver Hinson for DyeStat\n\nJohn Nepolitan photos\n\nThe Armory in New York City will host many of the best track and field athletes in the country this weekend for Nike Indoor Nationals. Here are 10 storylines to watch at the meet:\n\nWATCH THE FREE LIVE WEBCAST OF NIKE INDOOR NATIONALS ON RUNNERSPACE | LIVE RESULTS ON ATHLETICLIVE\n\nMcElhinney vs Moore In Girls 800\n\nThe girls 800-meter championshp includes 13 runners with sub-2:10 seed times, and up front, it\u2019s a battle between youth and experience. Dylan McElhinney (Hunter College NY) is the veteran, a two-time Nike Indoor Nationals champion and a USATF U20 champion. She\u2019s also a Manhattan native with plenty of experience at The Armory.\n\nThe challenger is Reagan Moore, a sophomore at Oak Knoll NJ. Moore has set personal bests in every event from the 200 to the mile this season, and she has proven that she\u2019s at her best when the competition is high. Last year, she lowered her 800 PB from 2:09.43 to 2:07.72 at New Balance Nationals Outdoor, and this season, she took off another three seconds at the NJSIAA Meet of Champions with a 2:04.80 performance.\n\nMoore has the fastest seed time in the field, and she clearly has a high ceiling. Can she beat the hometown veteran?\n\nHedengren Set To Dominate\n\nSince last fall, Timpview UT\u2019s Jane Hedengren has consistently delivered mind-blowing performances. First, she went nearly undefeated in the 2024 cross country season and won Nike Cross Nationals by over 40 seconds, throwing down a ridiculous 16:32 on a muddy Glendoveer course in Portland.\n\nShe\u2019s only competed a few times this indoor season, but with a 9:37 performance in the 3,200 meters at the Simplot Games and a 4:36 in the 1600 at the REP Distance Challenge (both at altitude, no less), she clearly has the best resume of any distance runner competing at the Armory this weekend.\n\nLast year, we saw a blowout in the girls 5,000 meter championship, as Elizabeth Leachman torched the national record with a 15:28 performance. Hedengren will likely have that mark in her sights, and it\u2019s certainly within her capabilities. She may not deliver a 49-second margin of victory like Leachman \u2014 Zariel Macchia (William Floyd NY), Rylee Blade (Santiago CA) and Emily Wisniewski (Crescent Valley OR) are also in the field \u2014 but she\u2019s the clear favorite, and most fans\u2019 eyes will be on the clock.\n\nHedengren is also part of a stacked girls mile field that includes Macchia, McElhinney, Addison Ritzenhein (Niwot CO), and Ellery Lincoln (Lincoln OR), but she\u2019s the clear favorite there, too, and the meet record of 4:36.61 could easily go down.\n\nHighly Competitive Boys Distance Races\n\nThe boys mile and 2-mile fields feature a lot of the same names, and those names belong to some of the best distance runners in the country. NXN champion Charlie Vause (Rio Rancho NM) is in both, as well as Corbin Coombs (Organ Mountain NM), TJ Hansen (Freeland MI), Evan Noonan (Dana Hills CA), Jack Bowen (McCallie TN) and Luke Pash (Ridgewood NJ), among others.\n\nCoombs has a lot of momentum heading into this weekend; on March 1, he threw down a 4:01.62 mile at the CIRCUIT Philly, giving him the fastest seed time in that event by two seconds. He has continued to progress as the season goes on, and like Hedengren in the women\u2019s distance events, he has the advantage of training at altitude year-round.\n\nHansen is another name to look out for; he finished just behind Coombs at the CIRCUIT, and he\u2019s run under 4:10 four times this winter. He was also second at NXN in the fall.\n\nVause, meanwhile, has only raced once this season, and Noonan hasn\u2019t raced since finishing fifth at NXN. These races will serve as early tests of their fitness; if either of them can pull off a win, they\u2019ll be sending a message that they are not to be ignored this outdoor season.\n\nThe 2-mile field has a high-caliber name that the mile doesn\u2019t: Tommy Latham. The Marist GA senior has also raced just once this winter, but he made the most of his lone opportunity, winning the boys mile at the Millrose Games in 4:00.94. His indoor 2=mile PB is 9:19.85, and his outdoor 3,200 meter PB is 8:46.88.\n\nPole Vault Titans Go Head To Head\n\nAll eyes will be on Victor Olesen (St. Christopher\u2019s VA) and Luke Beattie (Warwick Valley NY) in the boys pole vault. The two juniors are US#2 and US#3, respectively, and they both rank in the top 15 all-time indoors. They\u2019re separated by only a half inch \u2014 Olesen sits at 17-7.50 and Beattie sits at 17-7 \u2014 and they set their current PBs on the same day just two weeks ago. Now, they\u2019ll meet head-to-head for the first time this season.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll set a meet record, or any record, for that matter, as seemingly every pole vault record in existence belongs to Mondo Duplantis. However, their matchup is sure to bring fireworks.\n\nLutkenhaus Returns To The Armory\n\nA month ago, Cooper Lutkenhaus broke the indoor high school national record in the 800 meters at the Millrose Games, clocking a 1:46.86 as Josh Hoey, the former record holder, broke the American record in the same race with 1:43.90.\n\nLutkenhaus, a sophomore at Northwest TX, has the best seed time in the boys 800 meters this weekend by over three seconds. The question isn\u2019t whether he will win, or whether he will break the meet record of 1:49.46; it\u2019s how much he will beat it by, and how many other runners he\u2019ll drag under it. Wyland Obando (Long Beach Wilson CA) ran 1:50.26 at last year\u2019s CIF State Championships, and although he hasn\u2019t competed this winter inside, he may be able to tail behind Lutkenhaus for a lap or two and hang on for a sub-1:50. Obando is the only other competitor in the field with a sub-1:51 credential.\n\nTexas Sprint Talent On Display\n\nSprinting is different in Texas. Almost every week, it seems, another boys team is dipping under 40 seconds in the 4x100 relay, or another athlete is nearing (or breaking) the 10-second barrier. This weekend, the Lone Star state is sending its best and brightest to the Big Apple.\n\nOf the top five seeded athletes in the boys and girls 60, 200 and 400 (30 athletes total), 17 are from Texas. It\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that Texans could sweep every individual sprint championship.\n\nListing every Texas sprinter to look out for would take a decade, so here are the best of the best. Kendrick Jones Jr. (Lake Belton) is looking to defend his title in the boys 200 meters, and he\u2019s also the top seed in the 400. In both of those races, he\u2019ll be facing off against arguably the best sprinter in the Northeast, Philadelphia\u2019s Jayden Horton-Mims (Imhotep Charter PA). Horton-Mims equaled the national record in the 300 meters at the Millrose Games.\n\nCeleste Robinson (Cypress Ranch TX) is another name to watch. The Georgia commit hasn\u2019t picked up any major wins this indoor season, but she comes in with the fastest seed time in the girls 200 meters (22.82), which she recorded in her win at last year\u2019s Nike Outdoor Nationals. She\u2019ll be facing off against some of the best talent in her state in the 200 meters and the 60 meters this weekend, including Skylar Brazzell (Northwest Nelson) and Mia Maxwell (Humble Atastocita).\n\nOther top Texans include Jayden Finley (North Richland Hills), Ja\u2019Shaun Lloyd (Corsicana), Jonathan Simms (Allen) and Tate Taylor (Harlan).\n\nSeven Returning Champions Back For More\n\nSeniors ruled the 2024 meet, and now they\u2019re gone, leaving a massive hole to fill. The only returning champions are Horton-Mims (boys 400 meters), McElhinney (girls 800 meters and mile), Skyler Brazzell (girls 400 meters), Olesen (boys pole vault), Lauren Kirby (girls shot put showcase), Jones Jr. (boys 200 meters) and Cordial Vann (boys 60 meters).\n\nThis year, another dominant class of seniors, including Horton-Mims, McElhinney, Hedengren and several others, will be looking to write (or rewrite) their names in the history books, but they\u2019ll be going up against some of the best young talent in the country. Lutkenhaus (Northwest TX), Moore (Oak Knoll NJ), Sophia Rodriguez (Mercer Island WA), and Olivia Harris (Buford GA) \u2014 all sophomores \u2014 are some of the biggest names in the meet, and they\u2019ll be giving the veterans a run for their money.\n\nHannah Grace Raising The Bar In PV\n\nIf the idea of a two-horse race doesn\u2019t entertain you (see: boys pole vault), watch the girls\u2019 event instead. Hannah Grace (Coastal Christian NC) is the clear favorite, and unlike the top boys, she could easily break the meet record of 14-3.25. She comes in with the best mark in the field \u2014 and the country, for that matter \u2014 of 14-6. The next highest mark is 13-7.25 from Jaicee Jasmer (Sulphur Springs TX). It will be Grace against the bar.\n\nGrace was last year\u2019s USATF U20 champion, and she won the girls high school pole vault at the Millrose Games in February. She\u2019s cleared 14 feet twice this season, and with an A+ day, she could begin to take aim at the national record of 15-1.5 set by Amanda Moll, who now holds the indoor collegiate record.\n\nBoys 60-Meter Hurdles is STACKED\n\nUS#1. US#2. US#5. US#6. US#7. All of them will make their way to The Armory this weekend, making the 60 meters arguably the most competitive event of the meet.\n\nJa\u2019Shaun Lloyd (Corsicana) and Jasiah Rivera (Kingsville), both from Texas, are neck-and-neck at the top of the list with marks of 7.59 and 7.60, respectively. They haven\u2019t faced off this season yet, and they\u2019ve only lined up in the same field a few times throughout their careers. In addition to sprinting, hurdling is a big deal in Texas, and aside from giving us a glimpse into the outdoor season, this race will decide some bragging rights in the Lone Star state.\n\nJoshua Kai-Smith (Gar-Field VA), Tonovila Hicks (Springside Chestnut Hill PA), Le\u2019Ezra Brown (Dudley NC), Isaiah Washington (Prince George VA) and Trevon Foster (The Hill School PA) are also names to watch; all of them have seed times under 7.80, putting the entire top seven within two tenths of a second.\n\nJessica Oji On Cusp Of History\n\nAll she needs is an inch. Oji\u2019s PB in the shot put is 57-4.50, while the national record, held by Alyssa Wilson in 2017, is 57-5.50. The Livingston NJ senior and UPenn commit has thrown 52 feet or farther eight times this season, and she\u2019s improved by nearly six feet from the 2024 outdoor season.\n\nShe\u2019ll need a heave of 56-7.50 to break the meet record, which came from Olympian Raven Saunders in 2014.",

To celebrate this milestone, the Swoosh has prepared many exciting projects involving the sneaker. Not only is UNDEFEATED rumored to have five colorways on the way, A Ma Mani\u00e9re and Corteiz are due to drop their latest takes on the model later this season.\n\nAdding to the festivities, Nike is turning back time and revisiting the \u201cBig Bubble\u201d tooling of its original look \u2014 an approach the brand previously took with the Air Max 1 in 2023. Presented here in \u201cTriple Black,\u201d the shoe is absent of color, save for a blue tint present at the enlarged Air windows, highlighting its adjusted build that sees the Air bubbles bursting out of the shoe\u2019s standard shape.\n\nAt the time of writing, Nike has not yet confirmed when its big bubble version of the Air Max 95 will be returning.

Ingebrigtsen wearing the Nike Alphafly 3\n\nNike\u2019s roots in performance running have always made it the premier destination for sports professionals, as many of the greatest runners have inked a deal with The Swoosh. For Jakob A. Ingebrigtsen, the Norwegian runner who has set numerous records over the years, including becoming the youngest person, at 16 years old, to run a sub-4-minute mile, the 2000 meter world record in 2023, and recently becoming the first man ever to run a sub-3:30 indoor 1500m race. To honor the young prodigy, who is only 24 years old, Nike will give Jakob a collection of Nike running sneakers.\n\nWorking on five different sneakers, including the Pegasus 41, Zoom Victory 2, Zoom Fly 6, Vaporfly 4, and Dragonfly 2 Elite, Jakob has applied a similar color palette that includes medium ash, metallic gold, summit white, light silver, and sail. As of this writing, no images of any of the sneakers exist. However, if history repeats itself, expect to see special logos for Jakob similar to how Nike released Eilud Kipchoge\u2019s Collection of performance runners in 2024. Inspiration from the collection could come from various sources, such as his unique tattoos, his Norweign heritage, or something more personal to Ingebrigtsen that he wants to convey through footwear.\n\nThe The Jakob A. Ingebrigtsen x Nike Running Collection will release on May 15, 2025, through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $150 for the Peg 41, $190 for the Zoom Victory 2, $180 for the Zoom Fly 6, $270 for the Vaporfly 4, and $200 for the Dragonfly 2 Elite.

One of the earliest Nike football shoes, the kicks debuted back in 1974 before disappearing into the Swoosh archives for decades, largely forgotten and lost to the sands of time.\n\nThat all changed when designer Emily Adams Bode Aujla decided to put her stamp on them, releasing two colorways in 2024\u2014a creamy off-white knit and a sleek black leather rendition, both adorned with kitschy charms. The shoes made waves and sold out fast (anyone looking to cop a pair on the cheap may need to stick with the Nike Field General, a more accessible football trainer that also saw a re-release last year). But as with any successful sneaker collaboration, Nike and Bode weren\u2019t stopping with just one drop.\n\nBode Rec. x Nike Astrograbber \u2018Green\u2019\n\nIn 2025, Bode and Nike are running it back with two brand-new takes on the Astrograbber. First unveiled in February at the inaugural GQ Bowl\u2014Bode Rec.\u2019s spring 2025 runway presentation, hosted by this very publication in New Orleans\u2014the new installments get loud with one colorway and subtle with the other. First up, the \u2018Black\u2019 Astrograbber is exactly what it sounds like: all-black version of the shoe with a traditional mesh upper, offset by a gold football lace charm. For those hoping for more of a pop of color, the \u2018Green\u2019 spin departs from the neutral tones that have defined the collaboration thus far, opting for a sleek grass-hued leather with a black swoosh, laces, and sole.",

While there are no direct references to the game or the N64 console, the connections are abundantly clear and the demand has grown considerably since the shoes first revealed itself in mid-February. Retro gaming seems to be a larger focus for this variant of the Air Max 1 as Nike recently dropped an Air Max 1 Low Poly \u201cAdventure\u201d, itself inspired by Tomb Raider.\n\nThose who attend the event at BAIT have a chance to secure a pair ahead of the wider SNKRS launch happening later this month.

Rather than his third sneaker, the Air DT Max \u201996 featuring claw mark-like stripes, its Sanders\u2019 first signature model, the Air Diamond Turf, that\u2019s now replicated on the upper. It isn\u2019t just a matter of putting the upper of one shoe atop the sole of another, however, as the upper does still maintain the shape of the LeBron 21.\n\nAppearing in the Air Diamond Turf\u2019s original \u201cAtlanta Falcons\u201d colorway, the sneaker comes with a lower cut than the older model and a greater application of black suede. The shape of the strap and mesh windows remain largely the same, with a leather Swoosh now added, and so too does the mustache. Sanders\u2019 dual-sport \u201cPrimetime\u201d logo also carries over to the tongue, and the LeBron 21 sole unit remains unchanged with its full-length Cushlon 2.0 foam carrier and forefoot Turbo unit, which should make this pair a lot more comfortable than its more than 30-year-old counterpart.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nJames wore his LeBron 21 \u201cAir DT Max \u201996\u201d in several colorways but it never released to the public. The two mashup sneakers come after Sanders\u2019 rejoined Nike in 2023 following more than a decade away from the company and a promise that he would never work with it again. Prior to the reunion, the LeBron 15 borrowed the strap from the Air Diamond Turf in 2018.\n\nWith the LeBron 22 now the latest in James\u2019 series, a new edition of his prior sneaker releasing comes as something of a rarity for Nike.\n\nThe Nike LeBron 21 \u201cPrime \u201993\u201d will release in May through the Snkrs app and select third-party retailers.

Beachy, indeed.\n\nNow, it's still early days but 2025 feels like the year of the Air Max 180. Or, at the very least, the year of the Air Max 180's rebrand.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.

Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nAnd earlier in March, London record label Apron Records released a texturally astonishing Air Max 180 complete with a furry tongue, suede underlays, and cozy-fied fuzzy laces that transformed the classic sneaker into a modern looker.\n\nClearly, Nike is ramping up for Air Max Day ahead of schedule (it's March 26, BTW, mark your calendars).\n\nCompared to those two stellar stompers, the \"Light Khaki\" Air Max 180, available for $150 on Nike's website later this spring, is pretty demure.\n\nBut with its beautifully beachy colorway, the sneaker fits right in with this small but mighty lineup of Air Max 180 sneakers poised to take over the Air Max kingdom this year.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.

Astrograbber silhouette in two head-turning colorways.\n\nNike athlete Ja\u2019Marr Chase dons the revived turf shoe in a campaign awash in historic sport-style influence and tailored for contemporary resonance, representing an homage to both the silhouette\u2019s football roots and its modern appeal.\n\nCaptured in New Orleans days ahead of the runway debut for both Chase and the new Astrograbber colorways, the campaign further cements the classic gridiron look as a contemporary sportswear staple.\n\n\u201cBode Rec. is a line devoted to the history and evolution of athletic apparel, with a personal tie to football inspired by the time my dad spent playing the sport in high school and college,\u201d says Emily Adams Bode Aujla, Bode founder and designer. \u201cA lot of my inspiration for the restyled Astrograbber and new campaign is drawn from the anecdotal stories I learned when I visited Nike World Headquarters of Nike employee No. 1 Jeff Johnson and of Bill Bowerman, who created Nike\u2019s famous waffle sole using his wife\u2019s waffle iron, reminding of the handcrafted elements of early Nike footwear.\u201d\n\nThe Bode Rec. take on the Astrograbber \u2014 which originally debuted in 1974 on the heels of Nike\u2019s famed Waffle Trainer \u2014 upgrades the utilitarian turf shoe to a timeless look, with two new colorways celebrating the silhouette's enduring appeal.\n\nA black, woven textile design is the perfect complement to any sport-style look, while a green, leather style takes inspiration from a pair of Bowerman\u2019s homemade, hand-dyed waffle joggers that Bode Aujla spotted during her visit to the Department of Nike Archives.\n\nBoth looks sport metallic gold shoelace charms and come styled in custom packaging and branding that highlights the partnership between Nike and Bode Rec.\n\n\u201cWorking with Nike to reimagine the Astrograbber means partnering with such a historic American brand, which really embodies the inspiration behind Bode Rec.,\u201d says Bode Aujla. \u201cMuch like the Nike philosophy, I believe sport and recreation are vital to our growth as individuals, and that shines through in our new colorways and campaign.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, shot by Eduardo Cerruti and Stephanie Draime, features antiques collected during Bode Aujla\u2019s travels to Tokyo while launching the initial Nike and Bode Rec. campaign \u2014 calling to mind the universal appeal of the silhouette.\n\n\u201cThe new Astrograbber colorways are timeless and easy to wear, giving the next generation new ways to add a throwback, vintage style to their look,\u201d says Chase. \u201cNike and Bode Rec. hit all the right notes with their first collection last year, and these colorways take their partnership to another level.\u201d\n\nBoth colorways will be available March 14 at bode.com, Bode retail locations in Los Angeles and New York City, and a new Bode boutique in Paris. The black colorway will be available on SNKRS and at select Nike and Bode Rec. retail partners March 21.\n\n",

It sets out to empower student-athletes at the school, facilitating deals relating to their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). To this end, the group raises money with limited-edition, Oregon Ducks-inspired Nike footwear. Last year's Air Max 1 emerged in a similar color palette and with nods to the Pacific Northwestern university all-throughout the shoe. Air Max Day 2025's offering does the same, but its vibrant green tones also fall in line with the Air Max 95's original 'Neon' look, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.\n\nA representative of GOAT shared with House of Heat\u00ba that the three color schemes of the mish-mash design are 'Lightning,' 'Thunder,' and 'Storm.' Dutton unveiled the 'Storm' offering last week, whereas an official press release from the after-market platform shared detailed shots of the other two styles. The accompanying pairs feature similar Ducks of A Feather-appropriate details, and color palettes that breathe new life into the hybrid design. Glow-on-the-dark Airbags round out the trio.\n\nThe 'Lightning' pair will be available via raffle beginning on Saturday, March 15. In-store pick-up will be offered at Flight Club Tokyo starting Friday, March 21. Pairs will also be available via the GOAT app across the Asia-Pacific region beginning on Monday, March 24.\n\nThe Air Max 95/97 'Thunder' will be offered to Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions via the GOAT app on Friday, March 21.\n\nFinally, the project's 'Storm' style will be available at Flight Club New York, Los Angeles, and Miami on Saturday, March 22. Pairs will become available globally via the GOAT app on Wednesday, March 26, in celebration of Air Max Day 2025.\n\nFor more from the Swoosh conglomerate, check out the Nigel Sylvester Jordan 4 'Brick by Brick' collection set to land on Friday, March 14.",

Dropping right at the center of Nike Basketball\u2019s stranglehold on the sneaker game, the fifth Penny model released in a variety of trending colorways as well as nods to his past team affiliations. This version references his post-Orlando era when he formed one-half of the star-studded backcourt alongside Jason Kidd.\n\nWhile there were several Air Penny colorways bearing the Suns thematic, the gradient pattern is the evidence we need to prove that these are in fact a spin off the 2012 release.

The brand filled the streets of cities around the world with people clamoring for one of its Nike Air Max 95 colorways. Now, while a collaboration involving the Nike Air Trainer Huarache was rumored to release this season, we suddenly have official imagery of a fourth Corteiz x Nike Air Max 95.\n\nThis take on the Air Max 95 involves an all-black build that is accented by \u201cTour Yellow\u201d notes. This elevated take on the sneaker revisits the design of its predecessors, so you can look forward to its layered construction sporting yellow Corteiz branding at the lateral toe, heel, tongue and outsole. The pair also again features London\u2019s coordinates at the heel, as well as a netting at the uppermost layer of the upper.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither Nike nor Corteiz have shared any release details regarding this \u201cTour Yellow\u201d take on the Air Max 95. Stay tuned for updates from the duo as we currently expect this new pair to arrive on shelves by the end of the year via Corteiz and Nike SNKRS around the $190 USD price point that its predecessors had.",

            "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while NIKE (NYSE:NKE) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NIKE is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.22 = US$5.9b \u00f7 (US$38b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024).\n\nThus, NIKE has an ROCE of 22%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NIKE\n\nNYSE:NKE Return on Capital Employed March 9th 2025\n\nIn the above chart we have measured NIKE's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NIKE for free.\n\nWhat Can We Tell From NIKE's ROCE Trend?\n\nIn terms of NIKE's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 29% where it was five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nTo conclude, we've found that NIKE is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 10% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.\n\nNIKE could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our free intrinsic value estimation for NKE on our platform quite valuable.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The shoe brings back the adaptive lacing system that was a popular and effective feature of past models. Additionally, the midfoot plastic shank returns to give the shoe stability while lowering the weight. A reworked mesh upper and new rubber compound on the outsole also make the shoe lighter and more responsive without sacrificing durability. All the callbacks and additions are designed to rediscover more of the quickness and explosiveness the franchise is known for.\n\nWhat Works\n\nIf a shoe is called the Vapor, it should conjure feelings of speed and fast footwork. And that\u2019s primarily what this Nike line has established, and why it has been attractive to serious competitors. However, the outgoing Vapor 11 bucked that trend. It featured greater sturdiness and support, but was more truck than racecar. Its heavy-handed performance was a departure from the shoe\u2019s past formula and it brought mixed results.\n\nThe new Vapor 12 taps back into the franchise\u2019s core principles. It\u2019s lighter, sleeker and more aerodynamic than the outgoing model. The profile and features are very much in step with past favorites such as the Vapor 9/9.5 and Vapor X. Fans of those and other speed shoes will be pleased that this one recaptures the traditional Vapor vibe.",

Refining the aesthetic of the shoe with premium luxe materials, founder James Whitner of A Ma Mani\u00e9re sees the label \u201cHand Wash Cold\u201d as more than just a set of instructions.

Subscribe today.\n\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the Nike Vaporfly 4% was one of the most groundbreaking running shoes ever created. When it debuted commercially in 2017, it stood apart from every other racing shoe on the market, making claims that it could increase running economy by 4% (which, lab results showed, turned out to be true). From its futuristic thick-soled design to the loud, almost obnoxious slapping sound it made with each stride, the Vaporfly 4% sent shockwaves through the running shoe industry.\n\nFast forward eight years, the Vaporfly has been through four main updates since its inception. Except for the first update, which only brought a new upper, each Vaporfly update has been a complete overhaul that, for better or worse, dramatically changed how the Vaporfly line felt.\n\nThe lack of consistency from model to model makes it difficult to know whether you\u2019ll like the latest version enough to make the $260 investment. Fortunately, we received a pre-release sample of the Nike Vaporfly 4 and we\u2019ve been testing its fit, ride, and performance. Before you go and drop your hard-earned cash on Nike\u2019s latest super shoe, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nNike Vaporfly 4 Review\n\n(Photo: Cory Smith)\n\nWeight: 5.9 oz (men\u2019s 8.5/women\u2019s 10)\n\nStack Heights: 35 mm (heel); 29 mm (forefoot)\n\nHeel-to-toe Drop: 6 mm\n\nPrice: $260 (The Nike Vaporfly 4 release date is set for March 14, 2025, at Nike.com and select retailers)\n\nShop Men\u2019s\n\nShop Women\u2019s\n\nAt a Glance\n\nPros\n\nOver an ounce lighter than the Vaporfly 3\n\nBetter ground sensitivity and responsiveness\n\nBetter-fitting upper\n\nCons\n\nLess cushioned\n\nNot ideal for beginners\n\nNo longer suitable for marathons for many runners\n\nWhat\u2019s New\n\nLightest Vaporfly yet, weighting 5.9 ounces for a men\u2019s 8.5 and women\u2019s 10\n\nSlightly lower stack height at 35 mm in the heel and 29 mm in the forefoot\n\nA redesigned carbon fiber plate that is three degrees steeper, designed to enhance propulsion and efficiency\n\nDrop is reduced from 8 mm to 6 mm\n\nNew last designed to improve fit\n\nNew engineered mesh upper with stretchy sawtooth laces\n\nRedesigned midsole geometry removes excess material and cuts weight\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nGiven Nike\u2019s history of significant updates to its premier racing shoes, I approached testing the Vaporfly 4 with an open mind. At first glance, it\u2019s easy to tell this is a completely different shoe from its predecessor. Visually, it has a similar silhouette as the Alphafly 3 and Air Zoom 6.\n\nTaking them out of the box, I was immediately struck by how light they were. Weighing in at a mere 5.9 ounces for a men\u2019s size 8.5 or women\u2019s 10, they are over an ounce lighter than the Vaporfly 3. This places them as the second-lightest carbon fiber super shoe we\u2019ve tested, behind the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1, which weighs 4.9 ounces for a men\u2019s size 9.\n\n(Photo: Cory Smith)\n\nAs I laced them up for my first test run, I noticed they had a much better fit than the Vaporfly 3. Nike built the Vaporfly 4 off a new last that\u2019s more accommodating through the arch. The engineered mesh upper wrapped my medium-width foot perfectly.\n\nThis secure and comforting feeling only got better as I laced the stretchy sawtooth laces up. While stretchy laces can sometimes be frustrating, Nike nailed them. The ridged sawtooth design really provided the bite needed to counterbalance the stretchiness. The overall fit, security, and sense of being dialed into a shoe is Nike\u2019s best execution yet and perhaps the best I\u2019ve ever tested. I hope we see a similar system in future Nike racing shoes.\n\nHeading out for my run, my first impression was that the Vaporfly 4 felt a lot like the original Vaporfly NEXT%. It didn\u2019t have the deep, trampoline-like rebound or plush cushioning of the Vaporfly 3. That makes sense, as the Vaporfly 4 features the lowest stack height (35\u201429mm) of any Vaporfly to date.\n\nAfter getting used to today\u2019s trend of thicker, softer shoes, the reduced stack took some adjustment. However, as I picked up the pace and drove through my toes, I noticed a welcome connection with the ground, rather than the \u201csoft-foam sinking feeling\u201d as with most super shoes.\n\nWhat the Vaporfly 4 lacked in cushioning, it more than made up for in responsiveness. With its sleek profile, ultra-lightweight design, and strategic use of Nike\u2019s highest energy-returning ZoomX foam, it\u2019s clear this shoe was built for speed\u2014not marathon-paced speed (at least for mortals), but the kind of explosiveness needed for 5K to mile efforts.\n\nRegaining the Vaporfly\u2019s Unique Identity\n\nWhile some may be disappointed by a less-cushioned Vaporfly, this move makes a lot of sense in relation to Nike\u2019s racing shoe lineup. When the Vaporfly 3 became more cushioned, it lost some of its responsiveness, leanness, and raw speed. It became more of a half marathon and marathon shoe for most runners, encroaching on the already built-for-the-marathon Alphafly. This shift not only made the Vaporfly somewhat redundant, it also left a gap in Nike\u2019s racing shoe lineup for shorter distance races ranging from the road mile to 10k. Those who wanted a more responsive shoe for shorter distances either had to opt for the carbon-fiberless Streakfly or deal with a rather bulky Vaporfly 3 or Alphafly 3.\n\nAs Nike continues to refine the Vaporfly, it evolves\u2014not always in a predictable way, which can be frustrating. If you loved the original Vaporfly NEXT%, chances are you didn\u2019t feel the same about the softer, more cushioned Vaporfly 3\u2014evidenced by several Nike athletes still racing in the NEXT%. If you were a fan of the Vaporfly NEXT%, I think you\u2019d like the Vaporfly 4.\n\nUnfortunately for those who love the Vaporfly 3, the Vaporfly 4 shares very little in common. If you\u2019re a fan of the Vaporfly 3, now\u2019s the time to stock up.\n\nThe good news for most of us is that the Vaporfly is returning to its leaner, more responsive roots that earned it legend status. It\u2019s lighter, lower to the ground, and less cushioned, making it ideal for shorter races ranging from the mile to the half marathon, and, for those that can handle a more responsive, less thick-soled cushioned shoe over the distance, the marathon. If the Streakfly had a carbon plate, this is what it would feel like.\n\nNike Vaporfly 4: Who Is It for?\n\nI\u2019ve been testing super shoes since they first entered the market and have run in every super shoe made since. One thing is clear\u2014response rates vary widely between runners and shoes. A model that works wonders for one runner might offer little to no benefit for another (as we showed with our super shoe showdown). The Vaporfly 4 is no exception. It\u2019s a tool designed for a very specific purpose, for a particular runner.\n\nAs a running coach who frequently recommends shoes to my clients, here\u2019s what I\u2019d tell them regarding the Vaporfly 4: For the average runner, this isn\u2019t the ideal choice for a marathon\u2014or even a half marathon; its lower stack doesn\u2019t provide the bouncy, leg-saving cushioning as most of today\u2019s super shoes. Instead, I\u2019d strongly suggest the more cushioned and bouncy Alphafly 3. In fact, I\u2019d probably recommend less-experienced runners use the Alphafly 3 for short-distance races.\n\nHowever, for the more experienced runners with an efficient, powerful stride, the Nike Vaporfly 4 shines at distances from the road mile up to the 10K and, perhaps even the half marathon.\n\nShop Men\u2019s\n\nShop Women\u2019s\n\nSimilar Shoes",

While in 2024, the Air DT Max \u201996 returned to shelves and James poured out some on-foot tributes in accordance, he chalked off a colorway of his LeBron 15 with homages to Deion, far before any cross-marketing opportunities were at hand.

The midfoot strap is the most significant new inclusion, keeping the translucent mesh at the quarter in accordance. However, new overlay panels stretch from the toe to the heel, culminating in the amoeba-like branding tag at the rear.

As mentioned, however, many of his recent nods to Deion\u2019s shoes have come on the LeBron 21 specifically, making this arguably the most sensible option in his catalog.\n\nThe Nike LeBron 21 \u201cDiamond Turf\u201d is expected to hit shelves in May 2025, carrying a $180 sticker price.

            "content": "Published March 7, 2025\n\nLast year, LeBron James showed his love for Deion Sanders, who, after years of disavowing Nike, returned to The Swoosh and began to drop his old signature sneakers by wearing a special pair of the Nike LeBron 21. This pair combined details from the Air DT Max \u201896 onto what was then his latest signature sneaker. While we know this pair will be released later this year, new images of another Deion-inspired Nike LeBron 21 have appeared \u2014 the LeBron 21 Prime 93.\n\nLeBron\u2019s 21st signature sneaker transforms, borrowing branding details and design elements from the Nike Air Diamond Turf, the first signature model from Deion Sanders\u2019 Nike line. Paneling is redone to mimic the upper of the Diamond Turf, including the iconic Nike-branded lockdown strap on the forefoot, the mesh paneling on the midfoot, and the toebox\u2019s perforations and stitching. Prime Time logos replace the LeBron logo atop the tongue, while golden Nike Air text is embroidered onto the heel tab.\n\nNike LeBron 21 Prime 93\n\nThe pair mimics the color scheme of the 49ers colorway, which was recently re-released in OG fashion. Finishing the upper are the gold hits trimming the white leather panels, the red sockliner, and the metallic red eyelets. Down below, the LeBron 21\u2019s tooling setup remains untouched but comes coated in black, white, and red.\n\nThe Nike LeBron 21 Prime 93 will release on May 9, 2025, through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $180. Download the Sole Retriever mobile app to stay updated on the latest releases, raffles, news, and more in the sneaker and streetwear world.",

            "content": "Classic Nike Free technology has found its way to Nike golf on the Nike Free Golf NN. Of course we had to review it. Let\u2019s find out how this beloved tech translates to golf.\n\nNike Free Golf NN Price: $130 (some colorways at $78) Sizing: True to size Buy at Nike\n\nNike Free Golf NN Testing Process\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN was the only time I\u2019ve put over 20 miles on a golf shoe\u2026and I intend to keep it that way (I\u2019ve never been more tired).\n\nI decided to do my testing while spending the week covering the Black Desert Championship in Saint George, Utah.\n\nAn article posted by Glenmuir claims the average golfer walks roughly five miles per round. I put five miles on the Nike Free Golf on day one, and somewhere close to fifteen more throughout the rest of the week.\n\nI experienced all types of terrain and slopes, so I can confidently tell you how the Nike Free Golf felt and whether or not they\u2019re worth your hard-earned cash.\n\nAt first glance, the Nike Free Golf NN might make you think you\u2019re preparing for a quick run under the city lights. It brought me back to my junior high days with its simple design, reminiscent of the Nike Free Run models.\n\nEnough reminiscing, though\u2014let\u2019s dive in.\n\nTraction\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is spikeless and was built specifically to perform well in wet climates.\n\nThe traction is a mix of different rubberized shapes, with the heel having the most consistent ridge-like structure. As I mentioned earlier, I put twenty miles on the Nike Free Golf NN and never experienced slippage.\n\nOn top of the intense walking at Black Desert, I also made sure to get a quick round in while the weather was nice. The Nike Free Golf NN performed great on the course\u2014even though I shot a below-average round.\n\nI noticed the best traction on the fairway and felt no struggle with more powerful shots on the tee box.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say this is the best spikeless traction on the market, but I would recommend the Nike Free Golf NN to any casual golfer looking for a solid starter shoe.\n\nFit\n\nI went all in by wearing the Nike Free Golf NN to the Black Desert Championship. It was pretty risky to show up to a tournament in a shoe I hadn\u2019t worn yet.\n\nHow did it turn out for me? Just fine.\n\nI wear an 11.5, and the 11.5 Nike Free Golf fit perfectly. No slippage, blisters, or need to re-tighten throughout the day. The Nike Free Golf NN felt great and ran true to size.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this in previous articles, but if you\u2019re new here, I\u2019ll say it again: My feet are somewhere between narrow and wide. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself to have wide feet, but they\u2019re definitely not narrow either.\n\nThat being said, the fit was nice and roomy for me. Honestly, they could\u2019ve given me even less room around the toes, and it would have been fine.\n\nMy recommendation to our wide-footed readers is to look for the \u201cwide\u201d option on Nike\u2019s website. When a direct wide option is available, go with your normal size but in wide.\n\nCushion\n\nNike Free Run shoes were created to give athletes a shoe that mimics the feeling of being barefoot as Nike struggled to keep up with the ultimately doomed barefoot running craze that was happening at the time.\n\nHonestly, the midsole was great considering what I put it through during week one. My feet were tired, but I was impressed by how good they felt overall. It was a little bit stiffer than I would\u2019ve liked, but this helped on the different types of terrain I encountered on the course.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve ever worn a shoe designed to mimic barefoot movement, and I took note of the slight increase in flexibility and natural feel.\n\nThe only downside was slight soreness on my heels. The Nike Free Golf NN felt a little tall at the heels, which led to mild soreness from the heel to the midfoot.\n\nIt\u2019s a trivial issue and not a major concern, but it\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re someone with sensitive heels.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you can put twenty miles on a golf shoe in seven days without major blisters or pain, it\u2019s safe to say the support is solid.\n\nNike added a bulky plastic clip around the heel, extending up to the start of the midsole, which contributes to excellent support.\n\nOn top of that, Nike reinforced the upper to securely attach it to the outsole, adding extra stability.\n\nThis is a great shoe with multiple elements contributing to strong support.\n\nStyle\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is an adaptation of the Nike Free Run line, making it recognizable right off the bat.\n\nThe original Nike Free Run was released in the early 2000s, and the most recent Free Run model came out several years ago.\n\nSome may find it odd that Nike decided to release a Nike Free Golf model in 2024, but as I mentioned, the Nike Free Golf NN is both recognizable and familiar. I remember a TED Talk by Derek Thompson in which he discusses the importance of creating something new while still maintaining a sense of familiarity.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Nike did with the Nike Free Golf NN.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is currently on sale on Nike\u2019s website. At $78 and $92 (at the time of publication) for some colorways, it ranks among the top five budget options for Nike golf shoes. When comparing price to performance, I feel the Nike Free Golf NN is priced appropriately, and you\u2019ll definitely get your money\u2019s worth.\n\nIt\u2019s not the flashiest golf shoe of all time, but it gets the job done for the golfer focused on casual performance.\n\nConsidering its similarities to the Nike Free Run shoes, the price is in line. The biggest difference is the golf-specific traction, which justifies the slightly higher price compared to the regular Nike Free Run shoes. Nike gets an A+ on this one.\n\nNike Free Golf NN Summary\n\nFor anyone who plays golf casually, the Nike Free Golf NN will suit your game well. If you\u2019re an aspiring tournament golfer, I\u2019d opt for a spiked shoe.\n\nThe Nike Free Golf is the perfect shoe for new golfers, but it\u2019s also a safe and comfortable choice for seasoned players. I\u2019m currently a 14.4 handicap, and I felt the Nike Free Golf suited my game just fine.\n\nFor its performance, the Nike Free Golf would make a great addition to your golf closet, especially if you\u2019re just getting into golf and looking for your first pair.\n\nconnorlwt 9 / 10 Total Score\n\nHow the Author Golfs\n\nTyler Allred (19 handicap): Golfs 2-3 times a week spending the bulk of his time playing actual rounds. Mostly pushes himself to improve every part of his game, but also enjoys a casual round of golf every now and then.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWhile Nike did send a pair of the Free Golf NN to facilitate this review, the company had no involvement in this review, didn\u2019t receive an advance look at it, and has not attempted to influence it.",

            "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This release was updated March 6, 2025, to debut the Nike Air Max Dn8 campaign.\n\nNike is debuting the Air Max Dn8 campaign as the silhouette becomes available globally, bringing the new style to life through the lens of eight world-class innovators and eight global athletes who explore eight unique interpretations of unreal motion and creative experimentation, powered by the Air Max Dn8.\n\nAmong the pairings of expert creators and competitors are English photographer Gabriel Moses and footballer Kobbie Mainoo; French photographer Ilya Chemetoff and American hurdler Masai Russell; French photographer Marius Gonzalez and Japanese skateboarder Yuto Horigome; Berlin creative studio NEWFORMAT and Spanish footballer Salma Paralluelo; Miami creative collective EDGLRD and Spanish footballer Nico Williams; German photographer Daniel Sannwald and American hooper Ja Morant; Munich-based photographer Elizaveta Porodina and Brazilian skateboarder Rayssa Leal; and London creative studio A New Plane and Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung Ka-Long.\n\nEach image from the campaign harnesses the power of these unique partnerships to create new explorations of Air, nodding to Nike\u2019s longstanding culture of innovation.\n\nVisit nike.com/airmax for more information about the leading eight Air Max Dn8 colorways, and view images from the campaign in the gallery below. Additional campaign imagery is available here.\n\n***\n\nJanuary 30, 2025 \u2014 Nike is inviting athletes, sneaker fans and those who challenge culture to explore its latest Air Max experiment, the Air Max Dn8, marking the latest chapter in the footwear cushioning revolution Nike began more than three decades ago.\n\nFor the first time, the Air Max Dn8 extends Nike\u2019s Dynamic Air technology to the full length of the foot, offering a new expression of how it feels to walk on Air.\n\nAkin to its predecessor, the Air Max Dn, the new silhouette leverages dual-pressured air units to respond to pressure with every step, delivering unreal cushioning, flow, sensation and motion.\n\nThe Air Max Dn8 advances that innovation over two Air units and eight tubes that create a sustained, pressurized flow from the heel to the forefoot, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with Air.\n\n\u201cFor the Dn8, we wanted to be lower to the ground. We wanted to feel more Air. We wanted to improve transition,\u201d says Jonathan Kosenick, Lead Designer, Men\u2019s Sportswear. \u201cAll of those goals led us to design the shoe with eight Air chambers directly in contact with the ground, which allows the chambers to more effectively compress and be way more flexible, delivering a much bouncier, springier sensation that channels a Nike performance footwear approach into a shoe you want to wear every day.\u201d\n\nThe Air Max Dn8\u2019s rear Air unit is comprised of two pressurized chambers, each with two tubes. The two chambers are specifically tuned with higher pressure in the back two tubes (15 psi) and lower pressure in the front two tubes (5 psi). With every step, air freely flows between the tubes in each chamber. The forefoot Air unit mirrors its rear counterpart, with air moving between two lower-pressure tubes in the back (5 psi) and two higher-pressure tubes in the front (15 psi).\n\nTogether, the dual Air units enable unreal responsiveness and all-day comfort that\u2019s possible only with Dynamic Air, leveraging the same level of innovation that goes into elite performance silhouettes to create optimal cushioning and heel-to-toe propulsion to accentuate every movement of the day.\n\nA soft, breathable upper complements the Dynamic Air technology, and elevated materials deliver a premium feel and standout durability \u2014 all with a bold style inspired by fluidity and motion.\n\n\u201cWhen designing the Dn8, we kept thinking about what makes some of our favorite classic Air Max models so great: that you can put them on and go, and no matter what happens over the course of the day, that shoe is not only going to succeed, it\u2019s going to exceed expectations,\u201d says Kosenick. \u201cWe wanted to build a shoe that had the same sort of, \u2018go anywhere, do anything\u2019 character \u2014 an impulsivity, a versatility that will perform under any circumstance by harnessing the capabilities of Dynamic Air.\u201d\n\nThe Air Max Dn8 will be available in a Hyper Pink colorway on SNKRS and at select retail partners February 6. A red colorway will be available globally March 6, with additional men\u2019s, women\u2019s and kids\u2019 colorways launching in the following weeks. Visit SNKRS to learn more about the design.\n\n",

            "content": "Nike announced the newest iteration of the shoe that started it all, the original \u201csuper shoe.\u201d And, well, forget almost everything you know about the OG marathon racer. The Vaporfly 4 is still super, but not for the reasons you might expect. Let me explain.\n\nWhen the first Vaporfly 4% was released in 2017 , it truly was in a class of its own. It was light, soft, and fast\u2014an impossibility using older foams, which could never deliver all three experiences at the same time. The flood gates soon opened and other brands\u2014Nike, too\u2014raced to not only match but also improve on the formula.\n\nBut, for a long time, the Vaporfly remained the preferred marathon shoe among Nike\u2019s fastest runners. Even as recently as the 2023 New York City Marathon , we witnessed more Vaporflys than Alphaflys on the feet of top finishers, despite the latter shoe having been purpose-built for 26.2 miles.\n\nThat seemingly left Nike with a conundrum: It had two shoes for marathon racing, and it had to do something to give both a reason to exist. We saw the first step in that evolution when Nike launched the Alphafly 3 . At the time, Bret Schoolmeester, senior product director overseeing Nike Running Footwear, told me, \u201cAlphafly is really intended to be a specific marathon-racing tool. So we wanted to say, \u2018alright, what\u2019s keeping some athletes from choosing the Alphafly for race day?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat shoe got smoother and lighter, with a more accommodating fit and a more energetic ride. Marathoners adopted it quickly. Kelvin Kiptum set the marathon world record in AF3. Sifan Hassan captured gold at the Paris Olympics Marathon in them, too.\n\nNike Vaporfly Next% 4 Proto $260 at heartbreak.run Pros\n\n\n\nCons\n\nWeight, as tested 7.2 oz (M12) Weight, claimed 6.0 oz (M8.5) Stack Height 35 mm (heel), 29 mm (forefoot) Drop 6 mm Cushioning ZoomX foam Carbon-Fiber Plate Redesigned full-length FlyPlate Available March 2025\n\nWhat\u2019s Different About the Vaporfly?\n\nSo, where does that leave the Vaporfly with the most recent update? Well, it\u2019s apparently being subtly nudged to shorter distances, if you parse one of Nike\u2019s marketing messages: \u201cNike\u2019s most versatile racing shoe with the ability to serve runners over distances ranging from mile to the marathon.\u201d\n\nThat creates space between the two shoes and fills a hole that had opened in Nike\u2019s racing lineup. (At the same time, Nike has announced an update to the , which is more like a classic racing flat well suited for even shorter road races\u2014a type of shoe that\u2019s all but disappeared from the catalogs of most running shoe companies.)\n\nThe biggest reason for that bias toward shorter distances is because the shoe has been made firmer and snappier. It just won\u2019t provide the same level of cushioning and comfort needed for those of us on the roads for three or four hours, or longer.\n\nIn testing, that\u2019s exactly what I found. The shoe is exceptionally fast for interval workouts and even during marathon-pace runs. But, as my workouts stretched out to 15 or 16 miles (including warm up and cool down), I started to wish that I had reached for the Alphafly on those days instead. I could likely lace these up for a half marathon, but I\u2019m doubtful it\u2019ll be the shoe I take to the start line in Hopkinton when I race the Boston Marathon next month.\n\nThomas Hengge I put in 75 miles of intervals and tempo runs ranging from 10K to marathon pace while testing the Vaporfly 4.\n\nThe Drop on the Vaporfly 4\n\nThe biggest change from version 3 is that the Vaporfly went on a diet. The sole is thinner and the shoe is lighter. Nike lowered the heel-to-toe offset to 6mm (down from 8mm), by reducing the total stack height\u2014Nike says the heel is now 35mm thick.\n\nThat may not seem like much, but remember that most marathon racing shoes are pushing right up against the 40mm thickness limit instituted by World Athletics. Five millimeters is a little under a quarter inch, so the difference in cushioning is easily discernible.\n\nIt was less obvious when I bounced around in place comparing this Vaporfly with the 3. I\u2019d venture to guess that it might have felt even a little softer as I did that dumb thing you see on Instagram\u2014stomping on the foam with a comically impossible heel strike.\n\nPart of that might be explained away by slight variations in production samples\u2014rarely do shoes measure exactly as the spec sheet states. Our men\u2019s size 9 sample of the Vaporfly 3 had stack heights of 35.8mm and 24.6mm, yielding a drop greater than 11mm. I haven\u2019t received a men\u2019s 9 of the Vaporfly 4 to measure for exact comparison yet.\n\nAt slower speeds, like when jogging a warmup, the heel still felt fairly soft. Once I got rolling at race speeds, however, I became more certain of the difference in ride and could tell the shoe had firmed up. It was also clear in the way I slightly adjusted my stride. I typically land with just the slightest heel strike. But, in the VF4, I noticed I landed midfoot more regularly, especially toward the end of a 10-mile progression run where I had worked down to a 5:53 mile. As the rubber slapped at the blacktop, it felt like there was nothing wasted between my foot and the road.\n\nAlong with the change to foam geometry comes the first change to the plate shape. Nike says the FlyPlate\u2019s curvature is 3 degrees steeper, \u201cwhich helps unlock leverage from the foot and ankle.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen from plated shoes is that the plate isn\u2019t really a spring that helps you bounce down the road. Rather, it\u2019s designed precisely to let you harness as much of that foam underfoot as possible, and take advantage of the magical powers found in the new compounds. So it makes sense that with the tweaks to the proportions of foam, a different plate shape may yield different results.\n\nLighter Is Faster\n\nThere was a time when racing shoes were built to be as light as possible. Studies showed that an extra 100 grams of shoe weight caused you to burn 1 percent more energy\u2014heavier shoes slowed you down. So we all laced up shoes that had about as much cushioning as a bedroom slipper to hammer 26.2 miles. Gosh, I don\u2019t miss those days.\n\nThat thinking largely disappeared for a while. The Alphafly weighs more than the Vaporfly, yet we recommend you reach for it for longer races because the benefits of the foam, plate, and Air units compensate for the tax of the weight.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean shoe companies are content to let shoes get unnecessarily bulky. In fact, a big emphasis for this racer was to shave weight. My size 12 is 0.7 oz lighter than v3 and more than a full ounce lighter than the original 4%.\n\nThomas Hengge The Vaporfly 4 has a heavily sculpted midsole, which helps to reduce weight.\n\nThe easy answer to how Nike shaved the weight is the missing foam. But, there\u2019s even more gone: Nike extended the channel that runs down the middle of the shoe underfoot, extending it even further back toward the heel.\n\nThat channel didn\u2019t pose any stability issues for me, thankfully. While the workouts I did in these shoes were mostly straight line affairs at speeds ranging from 10K to marathon pace, I had to do a fair amount of juking side to side. A favorite stretch of bike path that we use for tempo runs features yellow gates to keep cars out. That means we also have to carve an exaggerated S-shaped course around them. In doing so at sub-6:00 pace, the shoes felt completely planted beneath me every time. The same can\u2019t be said for softer, thicker shoes, which require me to pump the brakes briefly.\n\nThe Fit Is Good, But\u2026\n\nIf you followed the tweaks to the Alphafly 3 a year ago, you may have had an idea what was in store for the VF4 refresh: a more accommodating fit! Like the marathon racer, this speedy race-day shoe got a bit wider through the midfoot\u2014even though the foam at the narrowest point of the midfoot is skinnier where it meets the road. You can visibly see it when comparing the two shoes side by side and looking down from above. The sockliner in my men\u2019s size 12 is about 1.5 cm wider through the midfoot, up to the point where the arch starts to curve upward.\n\nJeff Dengate The Vaporfly 4 (left) has a wider, more accommodating fit through the midfoot compared to the Vaporfly 3 (right).\n\nI, personally, was not bothered by the width of the Vaporfly 3. I have a high arch and racy fitting shoes work well for me. But other testers felt the bite and, no matter how much they wanted, they just couldn\u2019t make the upper work for the marathon distance. The extra bit of room, especially in the arch, will be much appreciated for those of you in a similar situation.\n\nThe upper material itself looks like a ho-hum engineered mesh, but it performs a magic trick. I swear, every time I pull the laces tight, it feels like either the laces or the mesh is stretching. I had to pay close attention to realize that it\u2019s simply just the fabric shifting and totally conforming around my foot. It kind of shapeshifts. It\u2019s a sensation I\u2019ve not tired of.\n\nThat movement might be cause for the only real issue I had with the shoe: my left heel slips. It\u2019s happening only on my left foot, and I rarely ever experience heel slippage in any running shoes. I\u2019ve tried pulling the laces tighter, but I really do not like extra pressure on my foot, even if racing fast. I\u2019ve also tried using the top eyelet to better lockdown my heel, but have found no joy. There\u2019s still just the slightest bit of wiggle back there.\n\nThomas Hengge The upper mesh shifts as you pull the laces tight, closely wrapping around your foot.\n\nI will add that it has not really posed any real problem, but it\u2019s a minor annoyance. It certainly hasn\u2019t stopped me from grabbing the shoe for some of my hardest sessions\u201475 miles of intervals and tempo runs during this training block. And I\u2019d probably choose it first for a 10K or half marathon race, even knowing that I might feel the movement.\n\nWho Should Buy the Nike Vaporfly 4?\n\nGiven all the changes, this shoe is really going to excel for competitive runners at a wide range of distances. It\u2019s a shoe I\u2019d snag for everything from a 5K on up to a half marathon (I\u2019m probably in low-1:20s shape right now). For new runners, slower finishing times, and those who just appreciate some cushy bounce on race day, you may find yourself only ever lacing this one up for the shorter end of the spectrum. The exceptionally light and fast runners may still love the Vaporfly for races up to the marathon, because of that harsh, snappy ride with good ground feel and responsiveness.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeking more comfort and late-miles protection for three to four hours of hard running, you\u2019re better served putting those miles into the Alphafly 3.\n\nBuy Men\u2019s Buy Women\u2019s",

            "content": "Nike made headlines in February 2022 when it filed a headline-making lawsuit against StockX, alleging that the sneaker and streetwear marketplace was on the hook for trademark infringement, dilution, and unfair competition. (Nike has since added counterfeiting and false advertising claims to the mix.) According to Nike, StockX was offering up non-fungible tokens (\u201cNFTs\u201d) that made \u201cprominent use [of] Nike\u2019s trademarks, marketing those NFTs using Nike\u2019s goodwill, and selling those NFTs at heavily inflated prices to unsuspecting consumers who believe[d] or [were] likely to believe that [the NFTs were] in fact, authorized by Nike\u201d when Nike did not authorize and was not involved in the creation or sale of such NFTs.\n\nIn response to Nike\u2019s suit, Detroit-headquartered StockX has argued that it is not running afoul of the Swoosh\u2019s trademark rights by offering up NFTs \u201cto track ownership of frequently traded physical goods.\u201d In its March 2023 answer, StockX asserted that the claims made by Nike \u201clack merit, disregard settled doctrines of trademark law, including the doctrines of first sale and nominative fair use, and show a fundamental misunderstanding of the various functions NFTs can serve.\u201d At the same time, StockX claimed that the likelihood of consumer confusion at play is low since \u201cat every point in the process, consumers are made aware they are purchasing physical goods that StockX has authenticated.\u201d\n\nBut also, StockX has maintained that its sale of the NFTs \u201cis no different than major e-commerce retailers and marketplaces who use images and descriptions of products to sell physical sneakers and other goods,\u201d which \u201cconsumers see (and are not confused by) every single day.\u201d\n\nFollowing a period of relative inactivity on the docket for this case, the parties are preparing for trial. With that in mind (and in light of the importance of the case as one of the few major fashion/sportswear cases to center on the intersection of trademarks and NFTs), we have put together a brief running timeline of notable filings (complete with links to any corresponding articles) in order to help you to stay abreast of developments \u2026\n\nMar. 4, 2025: StockX must face Nike\u2019s claims trademark infringement and false advertising claims, Judge Valerie Caproni found, stating that the issues are to be decided by a jury. In a win for Nike, the court granted summary judgment on its counterfeiting claim, holding that StockX is liable for selling 37 pairs of counterfeit sneakers \u2013 four pairs to investigators employed by Nike and the rest to StockX customer, Roy Kim.\n\nNov. 12, 2024: In a pair of newly unsealed filings, Nike urges the court to hand it an early victory on the willful counterfeiting and false advertising claims it has waged against StockX. According to its motion for partial summary judgment and corresponding memos in support, which were originally filed in August, Nike alleges that these causes of action are \u201cripe for summary adjudication because StockX admits the predicate facts establishing these claims.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Nike argues that StockX has \u201cadmi[ted] that it received, examined, advertised as \u2018100% Authentic,\u2019 and distributed counterfeit \u2018Nike\u2019 footwear.\u201d And StockX \u201cadmits that it knew that its authenticity claims were false,\u201d per Nike, and yet, \u201ccontinued to promote them.\u201d\n\nNov. 5, 2024: StockX is looking to escape some of the claims lodged against it by Nike. In a motion for partial summary judgment that was originally filed in August and unsealed in November, the online resale platform is looking to escape the false advertising claims waged against it by Nike. Among other things, StockX arguesthat Nike has failed to put forth any evidence showing that its authentication and advertising practices mislead consumers or harm Nike.\n\nJun. 6, 2022: In an answer to Nike\u2019s amended complaint, StockX denies the bulk of the claims that Nike has lodged against it, asserting that the amended complaint is \u201cnothing more than a failed attempt to bolster its still meritless claims.\u201d In addition to arguing that it is \u201clawfully us[ing] NFTs to allow users to more efficiently transact in authentic goods,\u201d StockX maintains that Nike\u2019s suit is little more than an \u201canticompetitive\u201d attempt by the sportswear titan to \u201cstifle the secondary market, hurt consumers,\u201d and \u201can affront to the entire resale market.\u201d\n\nMay 25, 2022: Nike lodged an amended complaint. By way to the new complaint, the Swoosh doubles-down on its existing causes of action against StockX and adding counterfeiting and false advertising to the mix. Additionally, Nike requests that the court \u201cswiftly and permanently stop StockX from continuing to sell Vault NFTs bearing Nike\u2019s famous marks, selling counterfeit Nike goods, and making false and/or misleading claims regarding the purported authenticity of those goods.\u201d\n\nMar. 31, 2022: StockX filed an answer, in which it argues that it is not running afoul of Nike\u2019s trademark rights by offering up NFTs \u201cto track ownership of frequently traded physical goods.\u201d Pushing back against Nike\u2019s trademark claims, StockX argues that \u201cconsumers are made aware they are purchasing physical goods that StockX has authenticated, that StockX is storing such physical products in its vault, that such physical goods may be traded via blockchain and tracked using a StockX-branded Vault NFT, and that the Vault NFT may be redeemed for the physical goods themselves.\u201d As such, \u201cNo one has been \u2013 or could be \u2013 confused as to the source.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, StockX takes issue with Nike\u2019s position that \u201cresellers of products are legally prohibited from accurately describing the physical products they seek to trade in the digital world,\u201d which it argues is \u201ccontrary to trademark law.\u201d\n\nFeb. 3, 2022: Nike filed a trademark infringement and dilution, and unfair competition complaint against StockX in a New York federal court, arguing that the marketplace site was \u201cminting\u201d NFTs that make \u201cprominent use [of] Nike\u2019s trademarks, marketing those NFTs using Nike\u2019s goodwill, and selling those NFTs at heavily inflated prices to unsuspecting consumers who believe or are likely to believe that those \u2018investible digital assets\u2019 (as StockX calls them) are, in fact, authorized by Nike.\u201d\n\nThe case is Nike, Inc. v. StockX LLC, 1:22-cv-00983 (SDNY).",

Having just launched the futuristic sneaker in a 'Black/Volt' color scheme similar to the original Air Max 95 'Neon,' the Swoosh has reimagined the Dynamic Air offering in a style reminiscent of the Air Max Plus 'Voltage Purple' from 1998.\n\nInherently, the Air Max Dn franchise is linked to Sean McDowell's inaugural Tuned Air design by way of the updated visible Air cushioning and Dn badges that appear on the insole, spine, and outsole. The Dn8's latest color scheme, however, dispels any doubt of the connection, as its mix of 'Fierce Purple' and 'Total Orange' draw a cleat through-line to the inaugural Tns.\n\nPalm tree-reminiscent overlays across the profiles set the stage for a subtle gradient pattern that turns the titular purple tone to pitch 'Black.' The bulk of the components across the upper keep things understated, as does the sole unit's foam build. Visible Dynamic Air units, however, introduce a drab shade of citrusy goodness, delivering yet another vibrant take on the fairly-novel silhouette.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the 'Fierce Purple' Air Max Dn8 below. Pairs are scheduled to hit Nike.com beginning on Thursday, May 8, for $190.\n\nFor more sneaker news, check out the Adidas AE 2, Anthony Edwards' sophomore signature model.",

            "content": "Stifel Financial\u2019s NBA All-Star 2025 Athletic Footwear Survey found that the market\u2019s \u201cchallenger\u201d brands are again leading the trends in the fashion sneaker market.\n\nThe firm\u2019s survey highlights the move by consumers to embrace newness across various trends and increase the popularity of challenger brands, which the company first underscored in its 2024 Back-To-School Athletic Footwear Survey. That shift in the market ultimately led to a change in top leadership at Nike, Inc. and has since given way to even more challenger brands taking shelf space and share in the lifestyle sneaker market.\n\nStifel said that Nike remains the most popular brand, and the brand\u2019s Dunk model remains the most frequently mentioned style \u201cflattered by discounting.\u201d However, the firm noted that Nike, including the Jordan brand, references as the most popular brand were down 26.4 percentage points (ppts) year-over-year (y/y) to 51.8 percent of total checks \u2014 an all-time low for the Nike brand.\n\nThe firm also noted that Nike styles represented three of the Top 5 styles this year vs. the 10-year historical average of 4.1 of the Top 5 in its previous survey reports.\n\nThe data in Stifel Financial\u2019s NBA All-Star 2025 Athletic Footwear Survey (based on a survey fielded the week of the NBA All-Star game) shows increasing marketplace fragmentation, according to the company\u2019s observations and analysis.\n\nNew Balance references as the most popular brand increased 8.2 ppts y/y to 24.1 percent, Adidas references increased 6.9 ppts y/y to 11.9 percent and On references increased 2.7 ppts to 3.6 percent of total references. Asics, Vans and Hoka collectively combined for 6.8 ppts of popularity reference share gain in the latest report.\n\nStifel said in the report that, helped by category growth, shelf space gains and the emergence of a DTC model, which affords more dollars for reinvestment, competing brands have a newfound scale.\n\n\u201cNike dominates court styles, but fashion trends have shifted, and challenger brands each have a unique identity that, collectively, Nike has struggled to counter,\u201d Stifel noted.\n\nMost Popular References by Retailer\n\nNike brand offerings, including Jordan and Converse, were referenced as the most popular styles in 51.8 percent of checks, a 26.4 ppts y/y decline and a 9.6 ppts sequential decline from Stifel\u2019s Back-to-School checks in August 2024.\n\nNew Balance styles were referenced as the most popular in 24.1 percent (+8.2 ppts y/y) of checks. Stifel said New Balance registering as the second most popular brand is notable given that in Back-to-School 2022, not one New Balance style registered a mention as most popular.\n\nAdidas styles were mentioned as the most popular in 11.9 percent of stores surveyed, up 6.9 ppts y/y, but down 1.7 ppts sequentially from an all-time high recorded in Back-to-School 2024. The popularity of Terrace styles (Samba, Campus, Gazelle) accounted for the year-over-year increase in Adidas brand\u2019s most popular style mentions.\n\nOn brand styles were referenced as most popular in 3.6 percent of checks, increasing +0.9 ppts y/y and +2.7 ppts from the Back-to-School 2024 checks. Most popular references were almost entirely concentrated at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Notably, employee education of specific On styles has improved, and Stifel suggested that employees are recommending specific On styles, including Cloudsurfer, Cloud 6, Cloudswift, and Cloudnova.\n\nAsics styles were referenced as most popular in 3.2 percent of checks compared to no references in the prior-year All-Star checks and 2.3 percent in the Back-to-School 2024 checks.\n\nVans Knu Skool was referenced as the most popular style at 1.8 percent of stores but, as expected, was viewed in the survey as having limited penetration in the street lifestyle channels.\n\nHoka received its first references as a most popular style during an All-Star check (had received references in BTS 2023 and 2024.\n\nNike-Specific Analysis\n\nNike Dunks\u2019 popularity mentions increased with scattered promotions across the marketplace and at Nike.com. The Nike Dunk increased its lead in the top style position and was mentioned in 58 percent of stores, a 13 ppts increase vs. the prior year and 6 ppts sequential increase from Back-to-School. Promotions were scattered with some stores selling primarily at full price and others, with certain colors, discounted. Notably, at Nike.com, key Dunk colorways, including the black-and-white Pandas, are discounted to $100 (vs. $115 regularly) when customers add to a cart.\n\nJordan\u2019s brand popularity is well below the prior-year levels. Jordan brand styles were mentioned in 39 percent of checks for All-Star 2025, declining from 53 percent in the prior year but an improvement from 34 percent in Back-to-School 2024. Observations for the brand are mixed . For specific styles, such as the Retro 3s, 4s, and 5s, inventory is becoming scarce. Jordan Retro 1s are becoming less visible in the marketplace, though store employees spoke discounts of specific Jordan 1 colorways, Notably, the Air Jordan Retro 1 High OG \u201cBlack Toe\u201d Reimagined, released February 15, is easily available for purchase and is trading well below its original price at StockX.\n\nNike Air Force 1 popularity is down sharply. The AF1 was mentioned in 24 percent of checks for AS 2025, falling from 46 percent in the prior year and 39 percent in the BTS 2024 checks. Conversations with store employees indicate the style is generally an afterthought and more of a safe recommendation.\n\nJust two non-court Nike styles resonate. Vomero 5, mentioned in 20 percent of stores (vs. 14 percent in BTS 2024 and 1 percent in AS 2024). P-6000, 11 percent of stores (vs. 3 percent in BTS 2024 and not mentioned in AS 2024).\n\nNike newness not meaningfully resonating with store employees. Some key styles expected to gain popularity have not been visible in store checks. Nike Shox: never mentioned Air Max Dn: mentioned in 1 percent of stores (not previously mentioned) Pegasus Premium: never mentioned, though just released late January C1TY: never mentioned V2K: not mentioned (vs. 1 percent in BTS 2024 and 1 percent in AS 2024) Killshot: mentioned in 1 percent of stores (vs. 1 percent in BTS 2024 and not mentioned in AS 2024)\n\nNike Legacy style relevance fading , suggesting popularity is more concentrated with its top styles. Nike Air Max 270: mentioned in 14 percent of stores (vs. 21 percent in BTS 2024 and 22 percent in AS 2024) Nike Court Styles: mentioned in 4 percent of stores (vs. 7 percent in BTS 2024 and 13 percent in AS 2024) Nike Air Max 90: mentioned in 2 percent of stores (vs. 6 percent in BTS 2024 and 10 percent in AS 2024) Nike Blazer: mentioned in 1 percent of stores (vs. 3 percent in BTS 2024 and 19 percent in AS 2024) Nike VaporMax: not mentioned (vs. not mentioned in BTS 2024 and 6 percent in AS 2024)\n\n\n\nFor access to the full survey results, contact Stifel Financial\u2019s Jim Duffy.\n\nImage courtesy Nike, data, analysis and tables courtesy Stifel\n\n***\n\nSee below for more from SGB Media on Stifel\u2019s 2024 BTS Survey:",

The Swoosh made Kobe Bryant the face of the model, and basically every Nike-sponsored country wore it throughout the Olympics. Designed by Eric Avar, it was the first shoe to feature Flywire tech and Lunarlon cushioning, thus creating a blueprint for Nike Basketball models for years to come.\n\nFollowing a 2016 retro, the \u201cUnited We Rise\u201d colorway is stepping back into the spotlight through a Hyperdunk-inspired tennis model. The Vapor 12 Hypersmash tributes the iconic hoops shoe with Flywire cables and a similar TPU heel badge, taken with patriotic red, white, and blue in all the right places. Many hoopers have been clamoring for a Hyperdunk retro run, but this is probably the closest we\u2019re getting (for now).\n\nThe Vapor 12 Hypersmash \u201cUnited We Rise\u201d is available now via the Nike website, commanding a $180 retail price. See official images below if you\u2019re moved to cop some late 2000s nostalgia.",

Palm tree-reminiscent overlays across the upper have set the stage for a number of compelling color schemes \u2013 including one that evokes images of the Air Jordan 8 'Aqua' retro expected to release before the year ends.",

The shoe takes on a Foamposite shell that features a zip-up shroud with an upper that is constructed out of black neoprene to give it a snug-like fit that can be closed up with a zipper. The subtle Nike branding hits the tongue while the Swoosh logos are strategically placed on the heel to seamlessly blend with the rest of the design. The shoe sits atop a black rubber outsole for added durability and traction to give the sneaker functionality both on and off the court.

A silhouette long-teased as a centerpiece of their strategy in and around Air Max Day 2025, the DN8 will see an early tip a couple of weeks earlier than the brand holiday, letting loose nearly a dozen looks for the nascent silhouette in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizing.\n\nTen distinct colorways are on tap for the model\u2019s earnest arrival (following a one-off release in \u201cHyper Pink\u201d). Like the Dn launch looks, many execute simplistic two-tone or tonal outfits. Pairs in all-red, all-black, and all-beige are joined by red/black, pink/black, and white/black. However, Nike is pushing the envelope with the silhouette a bit earlier into the DN8\u2019s lifecycle than its predecessor. A steely edition with pops of metallic green, a pair decked out in chrome, and a flip on the \u201cAqua\u201d Air Max Plus each stand as early highlights as the silo tips off.\n\nIf this is your first run-in with the model, it marks a natural evolution from the spotlighted product at this same juncture in 2024, the Air Max Dn. Its key innovation was four Air chambers (not bubbles) inset into the heel that shifted as the wearer stepped, offering a novel responsive cushioning package teased to consumers by inviting them to \u201cFeel the Unreal.\u201d As suggested in its title, the Nike Air Max DN8 quite literally doubles the appeal, now imparting that same tech into a full-length sole containing eight chambers. Along with that underfoot overhaul, an all-new upper, highlighted by a striped heel cage and teeth-like cut-outs that echo each chamber on the upper.\n\nBelow is a complete list of all the Nike Air Max DN8 colorways landing on March 5th, split between men\u2019s and women\u2019s colorways. Retail is set at $190 across all of them. Within each \u201cWhere To Buy\u201d section, you can find direct pick-up links for release day \u2014 note that you\u2019ll also be able to spot which editions will also come in GS sizing.\n\nMen\u2019s Colorways\n\nWomen\u2019s Colorways Of The Nike Air Max DN8",

The court order confirmed that StockX is liable for selling 37 pairs of counterfeit sneakers in relation to this case, which includes four pairs sold to Nike investigators and 33 pairs to a third-party buyer named Roy Kim.\n\nIn an interview with Kim in 2023, Kim told Complex he purchased 62 pairs of Air Jordan 1s from StockX and had plans to resell them later down the road for profit. Kim later discovered the sneakers he bought from the marketplace were fake after he checked the shoes' authenticity on other platforms.\n\nThe court denied Nike's other claims in its motion, which alleged StockX of trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, injury to business reputation, and false advertising. The entirety of StockX's motion against Nike was also denied.\n\nThe outstanding claims are to be settled at trial, which will take place between June 15, 2025, and Nov. 15, 2025.\n\nIn a statement, StockX said that the judge\u2019s rejection of Nike\u2019s allegations of willful wrongdoing on StockX\u2019s part reflects how significantly the platform has invested in combatting counterfeits.\n\n\u201cVerification has been core to StockX since our inception\u2014we\u2019ve invested millions of dollars in technology, training, and tooling, and we stand behind every product sold on StockX with our Buyer Promise,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIn this case and on an ongoing basis with all our customers, we offer refunds or replacements if someone receives an incorrect product.\n\n\u201cThe products in question in this case amount to a mere 0.0004% of the 17.8 million Nike sneakers StockX reviewed while this litigation was ongoing. Compare that to the more than $80,000,000 of suspected counterfeit sneakers alone that StockX has prevented from being sold on our platform since launching in 2016. As we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s a shame that rather than work with us to fight fakes, Nike has instead opted to use its resources to pursue meritless, expensive litigation. We look forward to the opportunity to tell our story to a jury at trial.\u201d",

The proposal sought to replace a historic French door on the second floor of the property with a window featuring an illuminated sign of Michael Jordan's iconic Jumpman logo inside the store.\n\nMORE: Police seek suspects who took copper wire from Portal installation in LOVE Park\n\nWhen the city objected to some of the proposed changes to the property, Nike made revisions to its proposal that include using a non-illuminated Jumpman logo on a pediment above the three French doors, which will be replaced. The revisions were made after a zoning permit issued by the city on Jan. 21 gave Nike approval for plans to install signage, and a general permit from the Department of Licenses and Inspections on Feb. 28 also approved a smaller, non-illuminated Jumpman logo that will adorn the wall just above the main entrance to the store. An illuminated sign will be installed inside the store's entrance portal.\n\nA Nike spokesperson declined to comment about the timeline for the opening of the World of Flight store in Philadelphia but said the company plans to share updates as the project progresses. The two-story space covers nearly 7,000 square feet and is located next to a New Balance store along one of Center City's prime retail corridors.\n\nNike opened its first World of Flight store in Milan in 2022, describing the shop as the \"pinnacle retail concept\" for the Jordan Brand \"at the forefront of streetwear and basketball culture.\" Two other locations opened in Tokyo and Seoul in 2023. The store in Seoul is decorated with photos of Jordan and displays shoes he wore during his reign with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s. Nike and Jordan partnered to create the first Air Jordan sneakers in 1984.\n\nThe Jordan Brand spun off as a subsidiary of Nike in 1997, exclusively selling Jordan's line of footwear and apparel. The brand has since grown to represent other star athletes, including Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, who joined its roster two years ago and often wears cleats bearing the Jumpman logo.\n\nAhead of Super Bowl LIX, Adweek described Hurts as \"a walking billboard for Jordan Brand,\" and Hurts was part of the \"Unbannable\" marketing campaign this winter that called back to the NBA fines Jordan received when he debuted his black-and-red Air Jordan 1s during the 1984 NBA season.\n\nHurts' growing relationship with the Jordan Brand was on full display during the Eagles Super Bowl parade. The quarterback donned a trendy Jordan Brand sweatshirt with a spin on the expression, \"Love, Hurts,\" and a sculpture of Hurts' last name was placed next to Robert Indiana's famed installation at LOVE Park. The phrase was coined in a Jordan Brand commercial that aired after Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP.\n\nNearby the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a Jordan Brand food truck also gave out free cheesesteaks and Hurts-branded swag.\n\nOther Jordan Brand athletes include 76ers rookie Jared McCain and NBA stars Jayson Tatum, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Russell Westbrook.\n\nThe space at 1617 Walnut St. has been vacant for about five years. It was sold to a New York investor for $5.4 million in 2022. The storefront had been slated to become a Free People shop, but the fashion retailer instead moved into a space across the street. Nike has a separate Factory Store in the Fashion District mall at 9th and Market streets.",

The company is slated to reveal its earnings on March 20, 2025. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.28, down 71.43% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $11.12 billion, indicating a 10.57% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.05 per share and a revenue of $46.24 billion, representing changes of -48.1% and -9.98%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Nike.

Will the \u201cBaroque Brown\u201d Nike Air Flightposite be a part of that plan? First looks at a new colorway have just landed, potentially charting the next steps for the tanky silo.\n\nPerhaps the only comparison point for this shoe is the \u201cBaroque Brown\u201d Total Air Foamposite Max, a shoe itself connected to the only Foamposite One that comes to mind, the unreleased \u201cChocolate\u201d sample presumably minted around the same era (the pair first surfaced in 2006). Where those colorways each utilized lighter contrast trim, this shoe keeps things to an entirely two-tone arrangement, the zipped closure and sole unit underfoot each anchor the titularly tinted hardware between.\n\nThe Nike Air Flightposite \u201cBaroque Brown\u201d is expected to hit the shelves for Holiday 2025, retailing for $140.

            "content": "Nike wasn\u2019t known by that name in the beginning. The original name that Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman chose was Blue Ribbon Sports. They had running shoes in mind. This was largely because Knight ran Track at the University of Oregon and Bowerman coached Track there. The first shoe they created was a running shoe called the Waffle, because of that popular story where they made a sole out of a waffle maker. That apocryphal story is immortalized in the Steve Prefontaine biopic, Without Limits. Fast forward decades later and Nike is the biggest running sports brand the world has ever seen. They\u2019re still making a ton of running shoes so here\u2019s our list of the Best Nike Running Shoes currently available.\n\nOf course, this does not encompass all WearTesters\u2019 Nike running shoe reviews. You can browse them all on our Nike reviews page or our Running Shoes Reviews page.\n\nEach shoe is put into a specific category where its strength best shines. This way, you can easily go through the list without figuring out which shoe is meant for which type of running. You can click the category you\u2019re most interested in, and you\u2019ll see the best Nike has to offer.\n\nWe would also like to hear your thoughts on this list, and you can even share your own list in the comments below.\n\nThese are our picks:\n\nUpdated 03.05.2025\n\nBest Neutral Cushioned Nike Running Shoe\n\nNike Vomero 18 The Nike Vomero 18 is the first entry in Nike\u2019s new Maximum Cushioning pillar. In fact, its 46mm heel/36mm forefoot gives it the highest stack ever in a Vomero. The combination of a thin ZoomX layer on top and a beefy hunk of ReactX foam underneath make for a ride that feels more like a hybrid of the Vomero 17 and the InfinityRN 4 rather than a true Vomero (minus the InfinityRN\u2019s polarizingly prominent arch); the Vomero 18 loses some of the uptempo versatility of Vomeros of yore as a side effect. While all that extra cushion also means a significant weight increase that won\u2019t escape notice, performance doesn\u2019t actually suffer. The Vomero 18 successfully resists feeling at all clompy or bulky thanks to the improved rocker geometry and smooth ride. The result is a shoe that may be less inclined toward pacy stuff but that\u2019s highly capable of keeping you turning over in comfort through even your longest of marathon training runs. While lacing and the mesh upper are different from the Vomero 17, the added heel tab is the only significant upgrade regarding the upper. As for the outsole, there\u2019s thick durable, waffle-patterned rubber where it counts and a less dense, boxy pattern in less high-wear areas to save a bit of weight. The waffle pattern gripped well on multiple surfaces, and, while durability may not be at the quite same (extremely high) level of the Vomero 17\u2019s outsole, it should be in the typical 300-500 mile range. The fit is true-to-size in length; however, we\u2019d suggest most wide footers opt for the wide version, as the standard Vomero 18 isn\u2019t particularly accommodating. Ultimately, the Vomero 18 may sacrifice some speed in favor of cushion, but it\u2019s a reliable, easy day and long-distance cruiser with a smooth, efficient ride \u2013 and it comes in at a surprisingly competitive price. See the full review.

While Nike isn\u2019t officially touting it as a max cushion model, it comes in at 45mm in the heel and 35mm in the forefoot. But the biggest buzz around this shoe isn\u2019t its measurements. The Nike Pegasus Premium harkens back to shoes like the Nike LeBron 10 and the Nike Zoom All Out Flyknit and looks to give us what so many models couldn\u2019t: a full-length, visible Zoom Air unit that doesn\u2019t have our ankles working overtime to keep us stable. To achieve this, the Pegasus Premium showcases the first sculpted (or \u201cscooped\u201d) visible Air Zoom unit in Nike\u2019s history, which also attempts to return more energy to the runner by mimicking the curve of a carbon plate. The Zoom unit is paired with ReactX in the heel and fluffy ZoomX as a top layer. While there is still some mild instability at the heel, Nike has largely managed to address stability needs from a performance perspective. The forefoot bounce also exceeds any Zoom Air-packing running shoe to date, so the shaping of the Zoom bag seems to be working as Nike intended. The downside of all that glorious midsole tech is that Zoom Air is generally heavy, and the Peg Premium outweighs the majority of road shoes on the market. For that reason, along with less than ideal traction, it could end up being best suited to casual wear for those sensitive to weighty trainers (though the minor heel instability could become magnified during extended casual wear). While we weren\u2019t crazy about the poofy, top portion of the tongue, the upper is highly breathable with good lockdown, and we\u2019d anticipate strong durability overall. While the Peg Premium is more wide-foot friendly than many Nike Models, we\u2019d still recommend most wide footers try them on when available. Overall, the level of cushion is what we\u2019d expect for a super trainer at this (albeit \u201cPremium\u201d) price point, and the Pegasus Premium is definitely made with a performance-first mentality. But seeing as it still gets outperformed by lower-priced shoes like the Asics Superblast 2 ($200), Brooks Glycerin Max ($200), and Puma MagMax Nitro ($180), the $210 price tag might be a tough sell for many runners. But one thing is for sure: the fantastic aesthetics will make the Pegasus Premium a sought-after lifestyle option. See the full review.

The Zoom Fly 6 may also be Nike\u2019s long-awaited competitor to supertrainers like the well-loved Asics Superblast 2 ($200). In fact, the Zoom Fly 6\u2019s $170 price tag is only slightly higher than many \u201cregular\u201d daily trainers that often sit in the $160 range. While the shoe\u2019s length feels very short at first, our testers were ultimately happy going true-to-size. The fit is surprisingly accommodating at the forefoot (for a Nike shoe), but true wide footers may still need more room, particularly through the very snug-fitting midfoot. Other cons include laces that easily come untied if you don\u2019t have enough length to double-knot them, as well as the fact that everyone will hear you coming as you hit the pavement. But our testers loved the run experience. The Zoom Fly 6 sports a dual-layer cushioning setup of ZoomX and SR-02, with a full-length, carbon fiber Flyplate sandwiched in between. The result is a protective and responsive ride with a firmer feel. While we wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anything other than road surfaces, the Zoom Fly 6 is more stable underfoot than expected given its midsole setup, and the well-performing, breathable upper especially shines in warm weather conditions. The Zoom Fly 6 is a versatile training option whose energy return keeps propelling you forward at any pace. It can take you through more relaxed daily runs as well as through uptempo and longer efforts without ever losing its fun factor. See the full review.

However, the stability features are unobtrusive and won\u2019t affect you if you don\u2019t need the help. The very noticeable arch on previous Infinity Runs is also found on this version though it\u2019s somewhat toned down. If you don\u2019t like a lot of arch support, you should still stay away. If an ever-present arch doesn\u2019t bug you, the InfinityRN 4 is a highly comfortable daily training shoe that\u2019s ready for lots of miles while also packing a ton of casual appeal.

It\u2019s more accommodating and comfortable than previous models and includes a less pronounced arch (but it\u2019s still ever-present). It\u2019s still not a very stable shoe around corners and a lot of the heel material is cut away so hard heel strikers will have better options. The price is high, but if you miss the original Alphafly magic, you\u2019ll get most of it back by wearing the Alphafly 3. Read the full review. Fit: True to size, Drop: 8mm, Price: $285 9 / 10 Total Score Buy Nike Alphafly 3 \u2013 Men Buy Nike Alphafly 3 \u2013 Women\n\nNike Vaporfly 3 The Nike Vaporfly 3 is the most cushioned, comfortable, and stable Vaporfly to date thus making it also the best Vaporfly to date. It\u2019s a great update. Stability, breathability, and comfort all improved while the Vaporfly line stayed bouncy, plush, and lightweight. Durability still needs work and the tongue is weirdly tall and wide but neither is a dealbreaker. The Vaporfly 3 is going to be many people\u2019s racing shoe of choice. It puts Nike back in the upper echelon of marathon racing shoes for those (like us) who weren\u2019t all that enthused with the Vaporfly 2 and Alphafly 2. Read the full review.

The durability needs work, the upper is sloppy, and there\u2019s little support. But the ZoomX midsole, sleek design, versatility, and minuscule weight make the Streakfly a fun shoe for speedy workouts. See the full review. Price $160 9 / 10 Total Score Buy Nike ZoomX Streakfly\n\nBest Nike Running Shoes \u2013 Honorable Mention\n\nNike Pegasus 41 The Nike Pegasus 41 changes the previous Pegasus\u2019 midsole geometry to a more modern rocker, adds 4mm of stack height, locks down well, and is highly durable. That makes it a good running shoe. But it\u2019s priced about $10 too high, provides a level of ground feel in the toes that\u2019s going to be a bit much for some runners, and isn\u2019t wide foot friendly (though an extra wide version is available). That mixed bag of pros and cons keeps the Pegasus 41 as an honorable mention. How you feel about the specific pros and cons will determine whether or not you\u2019ll like running in the Pegasus 41.

The Nike Invincible 3 features a thick midsole comprised entirely of Nike\u2019s super bouncy ZoomX foam and it functions like a suspension system for your feet. While stability is improved versus previous versions, it still might be too unstable side-to-side for some. The outsole features ample rubber for serious durability and the traction is on point even in driving rainstorms. The plush upper is solid but more streamlined and not as comfy as previous versions. Other reviewers experienced bad heel slip but our reviewers didn\u2019t have that issue\u2026but keep it in mind as a potential drawback of the fit. So while the upper took a step back, the midsole took a step forward and we end up with another Invincible that\u2019s not perfect but whose squishiness will garner plenty of fans.

We do love the looks and will rock them casually (a lot). But running in them regularly is a different story. Once the upper\u2019s break in period ends, it\u2019s comfortable. But the firm-ish midsole that\u2019s light on squish is just a mediocre experience. The Nike Pegasus Plus is slightly above average, but it could have been so much more. Read the full review.

The ZoomX midsole is really, really comfortable across distances from the 800m to 5000m. It\u2019s an incredibly lightweight versatile track spike that the best runners love to wear. Price: $150 9.5 / 10 Total Score Buy Nike ZoomX Dragonfly\n\nNike Air Zoom Victory The Nike Air Zoom Victory is the Alphafly of track spikes. Incredible bounce and cushion but it\u2019s not for everyone. In this case, the Victory\u2019s carbon plate is too stiff for some runners as they struggle to achieve their natural running motion. But all that cushion, especially the huge articulated Zoom Air bag at the forefoot, is a real treat.

Over the last 42 years, Bruce Kilgore's design has been reimagined ad nauseam, distancing the silhouette from its performance basketball origins and cementing it as one of the most iconic footwear products in the lifestyle realm. Rei Kawakubo's BLACK COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS imprint recently added another tally to these efforts, giving the model's notorious all-'Black' finish a fashion-forward co-sign.\n\nIt's been a running joke for ages that you need to be cautious of anyone seen wearing a 'Black-on-Black' pair of the Air Force 1 \u2013 especially if it's in \"cooked\" condition. BLACK CdG's update might get a pass, but it still exudes Black Air Force 1 Energy.\n\nPrepped for spring, the newly-surfaced collaboration between Kawakubo's empire and the Swoosh falls in line with other recent linkups between the two. A high-quality leather build across the upper sets the stage for 'White' contrasting details along the profiles. Call outs to the black-obsessed arm of the COMME des GAR\u00c7ONS network land in a mix of experimental and straightforward touches. 'Metallic Silver' lace dubraes often associated with the AF1's '07 iteration reprise their roles, while traditional Nike logos on the insole are accompanied by another nod to the Japanese institution.\n\nEnjoy a detailed shots of the latest Air Force 1 Low by BLACK CdG below.

            "content": "Nike has continually changed the game with its roster of athlete-approved and celeb-approved sneakers, but the athletic giant is taking on travel with its new Nike 24.7 Collection.\n\nAs the collection name suggests, Nike 24.7 features clothing and accessories designed for comfortable all-day wear, blending the functionality of the brand\u2019s workout gear, with the fashion-forward styling of its designer collaborations.\n\nThe collection introduces two new technical innovations that Nike says \u201coffer everyday comfort with a luxurious feel.\u201d The first is what they\u2019re calling their \u201cImpossiblySoft\u201d fabric, a smooth and slightly silky material that\u2019s reminiscent of scuba gear, but with more softness. The second innovation, dubbed \u201cPerfectStretch,\u201d is a four-way stretch fabric that allows for freer movement without feeling overly tight or restrictive.\n\nIn a press release, Nike says the new 24.7 collection \u201csets the standard of comfort and elevated athletic style. Engineered to embody the athlete\u2019s mindset, the collection seamlessly blends life and sport in men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel that\u2019s versatile, distraction-free, and tailored for all-day comfort, style and function.\u201d\n\nFirst unveiled in January, the Nike 24.7 collection is available online now. Below, shop some of our favorite pieces, including the Nike zip-up, pants and baseball cap that I wear on all my travels (seriously, it\u2019s become a cool, utilitarian uniform).\n\nNEW RELEASE $120 I picked up this Nike 24.7 half-zip in the \u201csteel green\u201d colorway (at right) and in black, and it\u2019s already taken me on multiple trips this year.\n\n\n\nNike says the material is \u201cdouble-knit\u201d for coziness, but to me, it really just means it\u2019s soft enough to sleep in when I\u2019m trying to get some zzzs on the plane. The cotton and modal blend is gentle (read: not scratchy) against my skin, and there\u2019s just a touch of spandex for easy movement and flexibility. The sweat-wicking Dri-FIT material means I stay warm without overheating, and the zippered pockets let me keep my passport and documents safely with me at all times.\n\n\n\nThis 24.7 collection zip-up comes in sizes XS to 4XL; I\u2019m 5 foot 7 and normally wear a size small, but I bought this in a size medium for a roomier, oversized fit. Sizes are selling quickly online so we recommend adding to cart while your size is still in stock.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S CHOICE $110 I pair my half-zip sweatshirt with these Nike pants for a comfortable but still put-together look. Made from Nike\u2019s \u201cImpossiblySoft\u201d material, the pants feel like sweatpants but are tailored to look like trousers. Unlike jeans or actual trousers though, they\u2019re cozy enough to wear even if you\u2019re sitting in a car or on a plane for hours at a time.\n\n\n\nThe pants pull on with an elastic waistband and drawstring. I love the side pockets and the hidden zippered pocket that can hold small essentials like my keys or ID. A zippered back pocket provides additional storage options. These pants feature a relaxed fit \u2014 slightly wider on the waist and thighs and then tapered just a tad around the ankles. It\u2019s not as casual or sloppy-looking as actual sweatpants, but just as suitable for all-day wear.\n\n\n\nThese Nike 24.7 pants come in multiple colors but we like the tonal look and bought it in matching colors with our zip-up above.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S PICK $90 For women, Nike\u2019s 24.7 collection includes this oversized cropped sweatshirt, which is also great for travel or for post-workout hangs. The dropped shoulders give off a fashion-forward streetwear look, but the structured silhouette keeps things tailored, in case you want to wear this crewneck to coffee or lunch. The material is super soft and lightweight, a mix of polyester, modal, cotton and spandex. Choose from two colorways in sizes XS to XXL.\n\nALSO CONSIDER $18.97 $26 27% off I top off my travel look with this Nike baseball cap, which is made from 100% organic cotton fibers. The cap sits perfectly on my head without being too tight or too tall (or too boxy), and the adjustable strap makes it easy to fit most crown sizes. Nike does offer it in three sizes to be safe.\n\n\n\nI love this khaki colorway, which feels more elevated than basic black or white, but Nike has the cap available in more than a dozen other colors too.",

Subscribe today.\n\nWhether you like it or not, today\u2019s running shoes are getting thicker and more cushioned. Thanks to lighter, bouncier, and more resilient foams, brands can now stack more foam underfoot without sacrificing performance. The previous stack ceiling used to look more like 30-40 mm, but as the new 46 mm Nike Vomero 18 proves, 30-40 mm is more like a jumping-off point, but why?\n\nHistorically speaking, adding more foam meant creating a less stable platform, but modern engineering has tackled that issue head-on. Midsole geometry, such as wide underfoot platforms with flared soles at the base, helps stabilize the foam and enables taller stack heights to feel more secure. And if there\u2019s a shoe that typifies this shift, it\u2019s the Nike Vomero 18.\n\nFor some background, Nike\u2019s latest lineup revision uses three categories: the \u201cVomero silo\u201d for maximum cushioning; the Pegasus line for everyday running; and the Structure family as the go-to supportive option.\n\nWithin each category are three models: a base or icon model, a premium model, and a plus model. The premium and plus will utilize more advanced technologies, such as additional ZoomX foam or Air Units. Two current shoes in the cushioned category\u2014the Infinity Run and Invincible\u2014will eventually be phased out.\n\nStill with me? Let\u2019s dig into the Vomero 18 to see how Nike\u2019s max cushioning family actually performs.\n\nThe Nike Vomero 18\u2019s cushioning is plentiful.

While I try to be completely objective, I\u2019m aware that I subconsciously form preconceived expectations about how the shoe will perform. However, when I received the Vomero 18 in late November, I approached the shoe blind, knowing none of the specs. This gave me a great opportunity to take my first run with a completely open mind.\n\nI initially felt that the comfort level was off the charts. The Vomero 18 is by far the most comfortable iteration I\u2019ve tested in Nike\u2019s Vomero line. Everything about the shoe is plush and luxurious, especially the heavily padded engineered-mesh upper.\n\nAnd despite the plushy superlatives, the Vomero 18 instantly felt familiar\u2014like I\u2019d been running in it for months. Often, breaking in a new running shoe feels like adjusting to driving a car that\u2019s not your own, but this wasn\u2019t the case. I naturally settled into my preferred cadence without having to think about it.\n\nUnderfoot, the cushioning was plentiful, protective, and stable. Not knowing what the stack height was, I assumed it was around the same height as its predecessor, which has 40 mm under the heel. When I later got the specs from the Nike rep, I was dumbfounded to find out the Vomero 18 had a whopping 46 mm of foam under the heel, making it Nike\u2019s thickest cushioned shoe ever.\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Beverly)\n\nWith that in mind, I was doubly shocked at how stable the shoe felt. Although brands are getting better at making taller-stacked shoes less tippy, there\u2019s still often an elevated feeling. The Vomero 18 didn\u2019t feel particularly high at all compared to other shoes of similar height I\u2019ve tested.\n\nA few design elements contribute to the Vomero 18\u2019s more grounded feeling. For one, the shoe has a wider base platform than previous Vomero models. Additionally, the dual-density midsole combines foam and a new version of React X that Nike claims has 13 percent more energy return. React X is meant to provide structure and support on the bottom, while the softer, more energetic ZoomX\u2014found in Nike\u2019s Alphafly and Vaporfly lines\u2014is layered on top for a bouncier ride.\n\nThe one downside to having this much cushioning (and foams) is weight. The Vomero 18 weighs 11.4 ounces for men and 9.2 ounces for women, making it among the heaviest shoes of this type. While it didn\u2019t feel overweight, it\u2019s certainly not a shoe made for uptempo running. During a few pickups, I found the Vomero 18 bulky and cumbersome to carry through the stride, and I could certainly feel its weight underfoot. It is best used on long, easy runs and everyday mileage when comfort and a plush ride are a priority.\n\nNike Vomero 18: Final Verdict\n\nLike a fine wine, my relationship with the Vomero has improved over the years. As someone who enjoys a softer shoe, I\u2019ve found each incremental change inched the shoe towards my plusher preference, culminating in Nike\u2019s Vomero 18, the most cushioned version yet.\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Beverly)\n\nAfter running in the Vomero 18 over several distances at a variety of paces, I\u2019ve found it to be one of the best training shoes from Nike in some time. To be honest, I\u2019ve found Nike\u2019s everyday trainers to be a bit underwhelming compared to the competition in recent years, and the Vomero 18 is a step in the right direction.\n\nWhile Nike has concentrated on dominating the carbon fiber racing shoe market with their flagship Alphafly and Vaporfly racing models, brands like Hoka, ASICS, and Brooks have stepped in to capture a significant share of the everyday comfort trainer market. However, it\u2019s clear that Nike is making a change by revamping their trainer roundup.\n\nNike Vomero 18: Who Is It For?\n\nNike has made a bold commitment with the redesigned Vomero 18\u2014outside those who prefer a minimalist feeling, I\u2019d recommend this for every type of runner. It\u2019s cushioned, stable, and runs extremely smoothly. As long as you don\u2019t need to pick up the pace, the Vomero 18 delivers everything I\u2019d want in a maximum cushioned shoe.\n\nSimilar Shoes\n\nAsics Superblast 2, Brooks Glycerin Max",

This principle was the force behind the success of the Pegasus Premium\u2018s grand debut earlier in January, proving that the Swoosh still has the chops to design athlete-driven equipment that can be worn for fashionable purposes.\n\nWe view the upcoming ACG Ultrafly 2 in that same category. Designed for serious trail-runners, the second model of the Ultrafly series builds on the $260 Ultrafly 1 with a radical new re-design that has firm potential to be a hit amongst the gorp-core demo along with hardcore runners.\n\nThis first look at an early pair was spotted not long ago by @runners_highest on Caleb Olsen, a Nike athlete and ultramarathoner that regularly tests out upcoming Nike Trail product. The Ultrafly 2 boasts an oversized Swoosh logo that dips into the midsole while the exterior shell features a ridged pattern similar to a topographic map. It will very likely have a carbon Flyplate layered onto the ZoomX foam cushioning like Ultrafly 1 does. The outsole also features the official Vibram stamp on the outsole whereas the Ultrafly 1 did not (although that model was also designed in partnership Vibram).\n\n1 of 3\n\nInterestingly enough, this early Ultrafly 2 is branded with ACG on the tongue and All-Conditions Gear. This may suggest that the Nike Trail line could be absorbed into the Nike ACG mainline, or that this model specifically is being transferred over to that category. An even earlier sample of the Ultrafly 2 (pictured below) did not feature ACG logos, but rather a large NIKE TRAIL text on the medial side and the Nike Trail logo on the toe.\n\n1 of 5\n\nNike has yet to officially announce the details around the Ultrafly 2, but with what appears to be finalized pairs out in the open and being tested, Nike could be announcing the model soon.",

But on Sunday, March 2, spectators at the Tokyo Marathon caught glimpses of the \u201cLate Night Talking\u201d singer doing literal laps on the streets of Japan before he finished with a 3:24:07 race time.\n\nThe most stylish man of the year in 2020, according to GQ readers, was seen sporting a look that shows running fits can look equally as good as your typical going-out getup. Styles was rocking racing sunglasses, a white headband, a black Nike hoodie, Tracksmith short-shorts, and (presumably) the Nike Alphafly 3 sneakers.\n\nStyles' choice of sneakers (or \u201ctrainers\u201d as the UK-born musician would call them) makes sense given the Alphafly 3s are the Swoosh's fastest (and most expensive) running shoes. Nike literally designed the Alphaflys for marathons, with a full-length carbon fiber plate for forward propulsion and dual Air Zoom units for powerful springiness. Its propensity for getting runners to cross the finish line at 26.2 miles could be the reason how Styles managed such an impressive run time (in addition to the hours of dedication to training and his diet, we presume). At his race time, Styles was averaging under eight miles an hour, and you can even view his splits at the Tokyo Marathon website.\n\nOur resident marathoner and running shoe expert Tanner Bowden, who has completed the Tokyo Marathon himself, called the Alphafly 3s the best elite racing shoes from Nike, saying \u201cthe shoe looks like a spaceship and moves about as fast as one, with a massive stack height that feels so distinctly propulsive it makes you want to run fast.\u201d\n\nCould you beat Styles' race time? Depending on your aptitude for running, there's a non-zero chance you might. Of the over 38,000 runners who took part in this year's Tokyo Marathon, Styles' unofficial ranking was 6,010\u2014quite an impressive feat for a \u201cGolden\u201d boy.",

            "content": "Nike continues to refine its performance footwear with the release of the Vomero 18, a running shoe designed to deliver exceptional cushioning, breathability, and support. While its substantial heel structure might suggest a competition-ready design, this model prioritizes comfort and endurance, making it an ideal choice for daily runners and long-distance enthusiasts.\n\nEquipped with a dual-density midsole that combines ZoomX foam and ReactX foam, the Vomero 18 offers a balanced ride that blends responsiveness with plush cushioning. This thoughtful construction allows runners to experience reduced impact on their joints while maintaining energy return with every stride.\n\nAdvanced Cushioning for a Smooth Ride\n\nOne of the standout features of the Nike Vomero 18 is its enhanced midsole, which integrates ZoomX foam with ReactX technology. This pairing provides a lightweight yet responsive feel, ensuring that every step is both comfortable and efficient.\n\nZoomX foam, Nike\u2019s most energy-efficient cushioning, is placed strategically to absorb shock and enhance propulsion, while ReactX foam contributes to long-lasting comfort without adding unnecessary weight. The result is a shoe that delivers smooth transitions from heel to toe, allowing runners to maintain their pace with reduced fatigue.\n\nBreathable Upper and Adaptive Fit\n\nNike has also focused on ventilation and flexibility with the Vomero 18\u2019s engineered mesh upper. This material is designed to enhance airflow, keeping feet cool during long runs.\n\nIn addition to breathability, the upper\u2019s adaptive construction provides a snug, supportive fit, reducing pressure points and allowing for natural foot movement. The plush tongue and padded lining contribute to a secure and comfortable experience, making the shoe a reliable choice for daily training sessions.\n\nEnhanced Outsole Traction and Stability\n\nThe outsole of the Vomero 18 introduces a pod system with a reconfigured traction pattern, improving grip on various surfaces. Whether running on pavement, light trails, or the treadmill, this updated outsole ensures better agility and control, enhancing overall stability.\n\nThis new design also supports a smoother heel-to-toe transition, reducing strain on the ankles and knees, which is particularly beneficial for runners focused on long-term performance and injury prevention.\n\nWho Should Consider the Nike Vomero 18?\n\nNike designed the Vomero 18 for runners who prioritize comfort and support over speed-focused performance. It\u2019s an ideal option for:\n\nDaily runners seeking plush cushioning for extended mileage\n\nAthletes looking for a training shoe that minimizes impact\n\nThose who need a breathable, secure fit for consistent running sessions\n\nWith its blend of soft and responsive cushioning, the Vomero 18 caters to those who want a well-balanced ride that adapts to different paces and training intensities.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe Nike Vomero 18 is available now through Nike\u2019s official website and select retailers, priced at $150 USD. With its durable construction and innovative cushioning, this model is set to become a go-to option for runners seeking a comfortable yet performance-driven shoe.",

Whether you\u2019re a runner or a gorp-core fan, this shoe delivers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBuilding on the Ultrafly 1, this version introduces a new ridged design. Its textured upper resembles a topographic map, adding to its rugged appeal. The oversized Swoosh now extends into the midsole, making a bold statement. Meanwhile, ACG branding appears on the tongue, reinforcing its outdoor-ready identity.\n\nFirst seen on ultramarathoner Caleb Olsen, this model stays true to its roots. It retains ZoomX foam and a carbon Flyplate for energy return and stability. However, the biggest improvement is the Vibram outsole, which enhances grip and durability. This upgrade addresses a key weakness of its predecessor.\n\nInterestingly, early samples featured Nike Trail branding instead of ACG. This detail suggests Nike made last-minute changes before finalizing the design. While an official release date is unknown, wear-test pairs suggest a launch is near.\n\nExpect the Nike ACG Ultrafly 2 to drop likely in Summer 2025 at select retailers. Stay tuned for updates on Nike.com and official release details.\n\nStay up to date with all upcoming sneaker releases from our Sneaker Release Dates page.

In collaboration with TITAN of the Philippines, Nike will launch a spirited Sabrina 2 designed by prominent individuals of the country\u2019s footwear and art community.\n\nTITAN\u2019s infusion of Filipino heritage and the country\u2019s love of the game is expressed through a collaborative execution by Titan\u2019s own Alessah Papa and visual artists Aila Torre and Lari Gazmen. The concept has its roots in three graphic elements: the Fire Spinner plant on the right insole is reflected in the gradient coloring of the Swoosh logo, also representing the fiery passion for basketball shared by Ionescu and the women\u2019s basketball community in the island cluster. The left insole illustrates a metaphor for all who will soon witness the growing impact of women\u2019s basketball. Behind the tongues are the \u201cMake Space\u201d mantra, which was first introduced in a Nike GT Cut advertisement featuring the WNBA champion, and a visual that combines a Tangram puzzle with Bauhaus shapes.\n\nOn March 11th, coinciding with Ionescu\u2019s first stop of her first-ever Asia Tour, Titan will host the 2025 Show Her Love Tournament Finals at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The first launch of the collaboration will occur that day at Titan and the NBA Store in the Philippines. Titan members will get early exclusive access before the March 11th launch; more information is on Titan22.com and the Titan App.\n\nFollowing the drop in the Philippines, limited launches are also scheduled on March 15th in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Nike South East Asia. The global launch of the Sabrina 2 by Titan will conclude the launch on March 22nd.\n\n1 of 3",

On a recent podcast, Ben reflected on his history with Nike, admitting that while he once lashed out, he now sees that if things had gone differently, he might have been working with the company today instead of becoming a world-famous jeweler.

Well...sorta, kinda.\n\nThe latest \"Black Cat\" Jordan 4 looks a little different from the classic, and that's because it isn't the same ole Jordan 4 as before. The famous color scheme now appears on the Jordan 4 Net, an updated Air Jordan 4 model that takes the phrase \"nothing but net\" very seriously.\n\nDebuted in 2024, the Air Jordan 4 Net was born to stun. The adventurous makeover includes this oversized TPU cage covering the tongue with the shoelaces on top. But inside the \"cage\" is the classic Jordan 4 we've loved since 1989 including its traditional fixings like the \"wings,\" Air soles, and Jumpman motifs.\n\nAgain, the Jordan 4 Net even wears the \"Black Cat\" colorway, one of the AJ4's cleanest schemes ever. The all-black design has famously graced the Air Jordan 4 and Jordan 3 models. At the same time, spin-off models like the skate-ish Jordan 4 RM have also helped keep the \"Black Cat\" legacy alive.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.

The sneaker features buttery premium leather uppers along with removable silver charms. The cage doesn't appear to be detachable. Otherwise, it wouldn't be the Jordan 4 Net!\n\nThe real-deal \"Black Cat\" 4s are still expected to return later this year. But if you're looking for the \"Black Cats\" on a weird, new sneaker vibe, the black Air Jordan 4 Net is slated to release on February 26 at 10AM EST on Nike's website.",

The arrangement of the pink shades are nearly identical, and the lone distinguishing characteristic is the use of black on the Swoosh logo, lace collar, ankle, and interior.\n\nThe Pink Aura, however, has a more vibrant saturation of the hue (more of \u201chot\u201d pink), whereas the version seen here appears a bit softer in its appearance.\n\nNonetheless, Nike has plans to release the A\u2019One in Black/Hyper Pink beginning May 29th, 2025 for $110.

God-like hands come down from the clouds and squishes the figure.\n\nWithout the inaugural visuals, it'd be easy to mistake the unreleased sneaker duo as simply more inline takes from Nike Sportswear. The clip doesn't overtly share the backstory behind Slawn's fist project with the Swoosh, but the speckled paint on the predominantly 'Black' pair seemingly references the video's space themes in addition to the paint that stains the artist's clothing and footwear while working in his studio in north London.\n\n'Metallic Silver' and 'Metallic Gold' eyelets near the top of the tongue work together with updates to the base layer and Nike Air branding on the spine to leave Slawn's mark on Tinker Hatfield's iconic design from 1990. Sole units underfoot, however, opt for tonal finishes that don't detract from the top-halves' 'Black' and 'Sail' finishes.\n\nEnjoy closer looks at Slawns' Air Max 90s below \u2013 courtesy of German retailer BSTN.

Since then we\u2019ve seen an unprecedented amount of colorways presented as both general releases and PEs \u2014 going from homages to legendary sneakers to looks themed around the state of Arizona.\n\nWhile we await word of a Nike Book 2, Booker just took the court in a new \u201cMowabb\u201d-inspired pair. The ACG line\u2019s Mowabb silhouette debuted in 1991 and was brought back in 2021 for its 30th anniversary. In continuation of its legacy, a \u201cMowabb\u201d colorway in \u201cSesame\u201d and \u201cDusty Cactus\u201d just dropped today and now we have a look at its \u201cTrails End Brown\u201d counterpart.

            "content": "Kevin Durant\u2019s latest signature sneaker, the Nike KD 18, features a design inspired by the cult favorite Nike Air Terra Humara trail running shoe from 1997. And last night, during the Phoenix Suns\u2019 125-108 home win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Durant debuted a new version of the sneaker which takes its colors from yet another classic Nike design.\n\nAccording to photographer Riccardo Mestre, the latest Nike KD 18 colorway takes inspiration from Durant\u2019s Washington, D.C. birthplace and upbringing in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Referencing the area\u2019s affinity for the retro Air Bakin basketball shoe, Durant\u2019s new KD 18 is colored with a bright red-and-black upper which features contrasting yellow shoelaces.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nMestre shared detailed images of the shoes on social media, including one styled after Nike\u2019s \u201c1-800\u201d ads from the \u201890s.\n\nNike KD 18 \u2018Air Bakin\u2019 (1-800 ad). @uninstructedvision\n\nThe clashing color look was a signature detail of the Air Bakin, which, like the Air Terra Humara, was originally released in \u201997. In the NBA, the Air Bakin was most memorably worn by Tim Hardaway while he was a member of the Miami Heat. Touted by Nike as being lightweight and breathable while still durable, the Air Bakin featured a mesh-based upper and heel Air Max cushioning.\n\nThe original Nike Air Bakin \u20181-800\u2019 ad. Nike\n\nNot without controversy, tens of thousands of pairs of the original Air Bakin were recalled in the late \u201890s. The heel of the shoe featured embroidery of an \u201cAir\u201d logo in a font which some believed too closely resembled the word \u201cAllah\u201d in Arabic script. The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the design, which reportedly led to Nike attempt to cover up the controversial logo with patches and paint. When that didn\u2019t work, Nike recalled 38,000 pairs of the shoe and issued a formal apology to the Muslim community.\n\nThe original black, red and yellow colorway of the Air Bakin was last released in 2014. More recently, streetwear brand Supreme issued two collaborations of the Air Bakin in 2023.\n\nFans of Durant\u2019s retro-inspired pair will reportedly have a chance to purchase the sneaker at retail. According to Sole Retriever, the Nike KD 18 \u201cAir Bakin\u201d will be released on May 15 for a retail price of $150. Its SKU is HV1992-600 and its full colorway is \u201cFire Red/Black-Amarillo.\u201d\n\nNike KD 18 \u2018Air Bakin\u2019 (lateral). @uninstructedvision\n\nNike KD 18 \u2018Air Bakin\u2019 (tongue detail). @uninstructedvision",

I'll go with option number two, as Nike has indeed brought the heat with its latest Air Max shoe.\n\nFollowing a smoking-hot reveal earlier this year, Nike's Air Max 90 \"Volcano\" sneaker has finally erupted. Translation: the cleverly made Nike shoe is officially here.\n\nBut first, let's revisit the design of the \"Volcano\" Air Max 90, which is \u2014 if I may \u2014 straight flames.\n\nExpect the classic Air Max 90 sneaker, but make it extra hot like the fiery force of nature (volcanoes, of course!).

Authorities say train burglaries have increased over the past two years, specifically targeting BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) Railway trains.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe latest wave of robberies was first reported by the Los Angeles Times. The Times reports that there have been at least 10 robberies since last March, during which thieves have stolen approximately $2 million worth of Nike merchandise.\n\nThese heists are believed to be connected to an international crime syndicate based in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, the complaint says. Authorities in that case say the thieves target high-value containers on eastbound trains traveling throughout California and Arizona.\n\nThe criminal complaint further describes the thieves' modus operandi.\n\nOnce aboard the trains, the robbers use bolt cutters and saws to break open container locks and go to work, stealing electronics, footwear and other valuable items.\n\nIn the January heist in Perrin, Ariz., thieves targeted a BNSF train transporting Nike products. The perpetrators cut the train's braking system air hose, which triggered a dangerous, automatic emergency stop.\n\nOnce the train was halted, the burglars unloaded thousands of pairs of valuable unreleased Nike Air Jordan sneakers, hiding them in nearby bushes until they could be retrieved.\n\nUnbeknownst to the thieves, some of the containers were equipped with tracking devices.\n\nLaw enforcement officers eventually apprehended the suspected criminals in two separate vehicles filled with hundreds of cases of the stolen goods.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe shoes, which are not set to be released to the public until March 14, are expected to retail for $225 per pair.\n\nCourt documents reveal that of the 11 people arrested in connection with this case, nine were living in the United States without legal status, primarily from Sinaloa, where authorities say the crime ring is headquartered. One suspect is a U.S. citizen, while another has been undergoing asylum proceedings since May 2024.",

            "content": "NIKE has long been a dominant force in the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry. Has NIKE\u2019s comeback been fueled by CEO Elliot Hill\u2019s strategies? Let us elaborate. NKE\u2019s recent share performance has benefited from CEO Elliott Hill\u2019s strategies aimed at revitalizing the brand and driving sustainable growth. A key aspect of his strategy is transitioning NIKE\u2019s digital platform to a full-price model while reducing the reliance on promotional activity. This shift is designed to strengthen brand positioning and profitability, aligning with NIKE\u2019s premium market status. The company is scaling back performance marketing investments, focusing instead on organic consumer engagement and improved shopping experiences. These efforts are expected to create long-term value, even as they lead to some short-term revenue challenges. NKE is refining its production and distribution strategy, particularly by adjusting timelines and reducing the supply of select classic footwear franchises. This move is aimed at maintaining exclusivity and demand while ensuring a healthier inventory position. However, this recalibration has resulted in a faster decline in classic footwear sales, contributing to revenue headwinds in fiscal 2025. Despite these near-term pressures, NKE\u2019s focus on premium pricing, inventory management and digital transformation under Hill\u2019s leadership is positioning the company for stronger long-term profitability and market dominance. As part of its recovery drive, this month, NIKE signed a partnership with SKIMS, the brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede. This collaboration will introduce NikeSKIMS, a shoe and athletic wear range focused on women. This innovative brand merges performance-driven technology with body-conscious design, aiming to disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry.\n\nAt the current share price of $80.02, NIKE trades close to its 52-week low mark of $68.62. The stock price reflects an 16.6% premium to the company\u2019s recent 52-week low. Meanwhile, the NKE stock\u2019s price reflects a 23% discount from its 52-week high of $103.94. NIKE trades above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish sentiment.\n\nNIKE Inc. NKE stock has shown a marked recovery in the year-to-date period, with shares rising as much as 5.8%. With this increase, the company\u2019s shares have outpaced the broader Shoes & Retail Apparel industry and the Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s growth of 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively. Also, the NKE stock has surpassed the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 0.9% in the same period. This Beaverton, OR-based athletic shoes and apparel retailer\u2019s shares have shown recovery trends after recording a significant downside in 2024. The NKE stock has lost 23% in the past year and 32.5% in the past two years.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNIKE\u2019s Estimate Revision Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE\u2019s fiscal 2025 EPS moved up by a penny in the last seven days, while the same for fiscal 2026 EPS was unchanged. The downward revisions in earnings estimates indicate analysts\u2019 reduced confidence in the stock.\n\n\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE\u2019s sales and EPS implies year-over-year declines of 9.8% and 47.9%, respectively. For third-quarter fiscal 2025, the consensus mark for sales and EPS indicates 10.3% and 71.4% year-over-year declines, respectively.\n\n\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWill NKE\u2019s Recent Momentum Last?\n\nWhile investors are encouraged by NIKE\u2019s progress on its long-term strategy, a full recovery from ongoing challenges may take time. NKE has seen sustained softness in its lifestyle segment, alongside a drop in digital revenues, indicating shifting consumer preferences. The company faces declining retail traffic and sell-through rates in Greater China, which has been a focal point for its global strategy. These issues have led to slower revenue growth and compressed profit margins.\n\n\n\nNKE has experienced sluggish sales trends in its lifestyle segment, including men's, women's and Jordan. Supply-chain disruptions and reliance on Asia manufacturing continue to expose NIKE to geopolitical risks and labor shortages, affecting its operations. Inventory management remains another critical focus.\n\n\n\nNIKE acknowledged that inventory levels remain higher than expected, particularly in NIKE Direct, though partner-owned inventory has declined from the previous year. In response, the company is aggressively reducing aged inventory, aligning supply with demand in NIKE Digital, and ensuring sufficient marketplace capacity for its latest product assortments.\n\n\n\nAs part of its quarterly guidance, NKE projects a low-double-digit revenue decline for third-quarter fiscal 2025, reflecting the impacts of strategic shifts, foreign exchange headwinds and restructuring efforts. The gross margin is expected to contract 300-350 basis points year over year, while SG&A expenses are anticipated to decline slightly due to prior-year restructuring charges.\n\n\n\nWhile NIKE is actively repositioning its product strategy and addressing inventory challenges, near-term headwinds remain concerning. Investors should monitor the company's ability to stabilize sales, improve margins, and navigate its digital and international transitions before making investment decisions.\n\nPremium Valuation for NIKE Stock\n\nNKE is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 35.36X, exceeding the industry average of 28.4X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 21.64X.\n\n\n\nNIKE also trades at a premium to its close competitor, lululemon athletica inc. LULU, which has a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 23.32X. NKE\u2019s valuation is also higher than that of other industry peers, including Adidas ADDYY and Skechers\u2019 SKX multiples of 29.08X and 13.32X, respectively.\n\n\n\nThough trading much below its five-year high of 48.27X, the current valuation may be considered expensive, given the significant downside risks if the company's ongoing perils are not resolved for a prolonged period.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs NKE\u2019s Stock Recovery a Buy Opportunity?\n\nNIKE\u2019s recent stock gains reflect investor confidence in its strategies, signaling a long-term recovery and growth trajectory. The company is doubling down on its sports-focused approach, accelerating product innovation and expanding key offerings to reinforce brand strength.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, NKE is refining its marketing strategy with more impactful storytelling and a premium marketplace experience, aligning closely with evolving consumer preferences. These efforts are aimed at revitalizing demand and sustaining competitive differentiation.\n\n\n\nHowever, NIKE\u2019s premium valuation, coupled with slowing growth, raises concerns about the near term. Weaker third-quarter fiscal 2025 guidance has tempered growth expectations, while uncertainties persist around the recovery of its lifestyle segment and ongoing challenges in Greater China.\n\n\n\nGiven these headwinds, investors may consider a cautious approach as NKE works through its strategic transition and macroeconomic pressures.

Purchases you make through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nNike sees the rise in attention for women's sports, from the collective celebration of Simon Biles' Olympic gymnastics career, to the support of Sha'Carri Richardson and her own gold medal triumph, and the latest, Caitlin Clark's game-altering ascension to the WNBA. Now, with the launch of the \"So Win\" brand collection, they want you to rep your favorite female athletes and their iconic imagery.\n\nThe launch first came with running tee's that say: \"You can't win, so win\" and Nike's classic \"Just Do It\" but surrounded by outstanding female athletes. Launches have also come from Caitlin Clark, A'ja Wilson and Sabrina Ionescu. More designs from more athletes are still coming including USWNT icons Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson and current college basketball stars JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers.\n\nNow you can snag Sha'Carri Richardson's personalized running tee, from the Olympic gold-medalist runner herself. The tee features her iconic manicure gripping a gold medal, which is fitting.\n\nThe tee is made of 100 percent cotton, only comes on a black shirt, and retails for $45.\n\nShop Sha'Carri Richardson \"So Win\" t-shirt\n\nWhat is the \"So Win\" brand collection from Nike?\n\nNike launched the \"So Win\" brand collection with a Super Bowl commercial in early February. The collection celebrates the power of sport and the athlete who compete in them. It features an iconic roster from Nike, each with their own designs.\n\nIt steps away, just a bit, from Nike's long-time slogan, 'Just Do It.' Instead, it focuses on athletes who are always told what they can and can't do, and even what they may or may not be capable of. It aligns Nike with the movement and rise of women's sports.\n\nThe \"So Win\" campaign includes Jordan Chiles, Caitlin Clark, Sabrina Ionescu, A'ja Wilson, Sophia Wilson, and Sha'Carri Richardson.\n\nWho is Sha'Carri Richardson?\n\nSha'Carri Richardson is a track and field athlete who competes in the 100 meter and 200 meter competitions. In 2023, Richardson became the U.S. national champion in the women's 100m dash at the 2023 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. She won gold in the 100m at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest, and won gold as part of Team USA's women's 4 x 100 relay.\n\nRichardson was shrouded in controversy early in his track career after she had qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The Louisiana State University alumnae ran the 100-metre in 10.86 seconds, but later tested positive for cannabis, making her unable to compete in the Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist signed with Nike in 2019, the same year she became a professional runner.\n\nMORE NIKE SHOPPING: Shoes, jerseys and more inspired by basketball phenom A\u2019ja Wilson\n\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.",

            "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This release was updated February 27, 2025, to include retail information for the Nike Vomero 18 and additional photos of the silhouette.\n\nGet comfortable \u2014 with longer runs, faster paces and pushing your limits.\n\nThat\u2019s the invitation Nike extends to all runners with the introduction of its Vomero 18, the new standard in maximum cushioning and road running comfort.\n\nInformed by the needs and detailed insights of women runners to suit all genders, this best-in-class silhouette is an expression of smoothness and softness, providing a comfort-first experience with a lightweight feel.\n\nThe new Vomero features a combination of ZoomX foam through the length of the shoe and ReactX in the heel and forefoot, providing runners with double-stacked cushion for the ultimate ride. With balanced foam stacks providing more cushion than ever, the silhouette also offers an increased stack height of 46mm, 6mm taller than the previous Vomero and the tallest ever in the Vomero line.\n\nMaximum cushioning is the go-to feel for everyday runs, and this comfortable, plush ride serves a variety of athletes: from new runners looking to lace up for the first time, to experienced runners who want to increase their mileage or start their post-race recovery, and anyone looking for all-day comfort.\n\n\u201cWe heard from runners that when they think of maximum cushioning, they envision a soft, plush experience that alleviates feeling the impact of the ground underfoot. We obsessed the details to give the running community that sensation with best-in-class design and technology,\u201d says Ashley Campbell, Running Footwear Product Line Manager. \u201cThat ethos is apparent throughout the Vomero 18, a shoe purpose-built to give every runner \u2014 from the everyday to the elite \u2014 the ultra-comfortable ride that is both supportive and easy on the body, and equips runners to achieve their goals.\u201d\n\nThe Vomero\u2019s sole is made of a durable rubber, providing traction for high mileage, and its upward curve features increased rocker geometry, providing runners a smoother heel to toe transition. The upper features soft, stretchy engineered mesh that offers breathability around the toe and tongue.\n\nIn addition to its functional versatility, the Vomero 18 also demands to be noticed. Simultaneously bold and soft, the silhouette stands out from the pack with design cues that accentuate every run and everyday life. For example, the Vomero\u2019s heel lift signals movement and is where runners experience the maximum cushion in each step. The curvy form is aesthetically beautiful and provides greater continuity throughout every run, and the material textures complement and juxtapose each other, creating a dynamic visual.\n\nDesigned with women\u2019s style preferences in mind, an effervescent mix of colorways allows runners to express their individuality, with the lead \u201cAtmosphere Pink\u201d option symbolizing the illuminating joy a runner feels on a long run and a color pattern and accents that punctuate the shoe\u2019s elevated look and feel.\n\nNike is also extending the comfort, style and modern design of the Vomero 18 to its kids\u2019 running lineup, offering the next generation of runners ReactX foam for the first time, along with the highest stack height among Nike kids\u2019 running shoes.\n\nThe Vomero franchise is one of three distinct categories that comprise Nike\u2019s simplified Road Running Footwear Lineup, which is based on trusted icons and dedicated to what runners love most: cushioning.\n\nThe Vomero 18 reflects a new era of maximum cushioning for ultimate comfort, while the Pegasus franchise delivers responsive cushioning for all-day energy return and the Structure franchise offers supportive cushioning for a stable ride.\n\nThe new lineup offers runners their preferred type of cushioned ride for whatever run they want to take. It also makes it easier for runners to determine what footwear offers them the right mix of benefits, technology and price point, providing a more inviting and accessible experience \u2014 especially for runners gearing up for the first time or adding a new shoe to their rotation.\n\n\u201cWe heard from runners that they desire a more intuitive experience in selecting their running footwear. So we\u2019ve simplified our Road Running Footwear Lineup to obsessively focus on the timeless need for cushioning,\u201d says Marian Dougherty, Senior Director, Global Running Footwear. \u201cBased on icon franchises, the new lineup helps guide runners to the right ride for them \u2014 whether it\u2019s highly responsive, maximum cushioning or a supportive ride.\u201d\n\nThe Vomero 18 is now available globally at nike.com and select retailers.\n\n",

Nike and the NWSL launched a new era of their 12-year partnership last year with a custom jersey for each team, but the 2024 secondary kits were all template holders as a bridge to get to these new kits in 2025. From here, teams are expected to get one new kit each year, alternating between primary and secondary.\n\nGoalkeeper jerseys have also been updated in 2025.\n\nFor the first time, fans can purchase authentic versions of jerseys in addition to replicas, consistent with other major leagues. Replica jerseys will feature embroidered crests this year, an upgrade from the printed crests of previous years. The authentic jerseys feature more detail and higher-end material \u2014 and cost $100 more, coming in at $195 before any customization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll players from the 2025 NWSL season will be available for customization in the NWSL\u2019s shop, according to the league\n\nThe league also announced expanded sizing options for replica jerseys, ranging from extra small to double XL for women, and small to triple XL for men.\n\n\u201cThis suite of jerseys, featuring bold designs, vibrant colors and accompanying lifestyle products like the anthem jacket, represent another key step in growing the NWSL\u2019s footprint within the global marketplace,\u201d said NWSL VP of consumer products Katie Eaton in a statement. \u201cAs we continue to elevate our product offerings, we\u2019re focused on blending sport and lifestyle in ways that authentically connect with players and fans alike.\u201d",

            "content": "Nike is collaborating with Slawn, the irreverent British-Nigerian artist known for his bold characters and spray paint work, on two pairs of Air Max 90s that are set to release in March, sneaker industry sources tell Complex. Nike hasn\u2019t announced the project, but images of the collab circulated online this week.\n\nSneaker News unwittingly leaked the Slawn shoes on Tuesday, posting two previously unseen colorways of the Air Max 90 that were listed for sale online at German retailer Asphalt Gold. The store likely did not realize the Air Max 90 was a special project intended for a later release.\n\nNeither Sneaker News nor Asphalt Gold made mention of Slawn in their descriptions of the shoes.\n\nA close look at the details on the sneakers reveals their origin. The heel badges feature a Slawn-like face with long semicircular eyes. It\u2019s tough to make out from the Asphalt Gold photos, but the uppers on the Air Max 90s appear to feature Slawn drawings embossed on the leather. The shoes have redone mudguards, paint speckles, and imperfectly-shaped Swooshes on their uppers. The Slawn x Nike Air Max 90s come in black (style code FD6492-001) and white (style code FD6492-100).\n\nAt least one pair of shoes already made it out into the wild. On Tuesday, a YouTube user from the Netherlands published a barely-viewed video featuring the black Air Max 90. Like Sneaker News, the user did not make the connection to Slawn, but the clip shows the words \u201cAir Slawn\u201d written on the box in graffiti lettering.\n\nAsphalt Gold, no doubt realizing it accidentally previewed the first collaboration from an artist that\u2019s new to the Nike roster by posting the shoes early, has pulled the Air Max 90s from its website.\n\nNike and Slawn did not respond to requests for comment about the collaboration.\n\nWhile Nike hasn\u2019t made its partnership with Slawn public, there have been quiet signals pointing to their alignment. At Art Basel in Miami last December, Slawn spent time with Nike employees who work on the brand\u2019s collab product. He attended the pre-launch party for the Stash x Nike \u201cBlue Is Back\u201d pack at Concepts wearing the upcoming Air Max DN8, a 2025 shoe that Nike is in the early stages of building hype around. Weeks later, on Dec. 19, he posted a photo that appeared to show him on a conference call with Nike as part of a carousel on Instagram.\n\nUPDATE (02/27): Slawn has officially unveiled his two Air Max 90 collabs on Instagram today. Additionally, the artist announced the opening of a pop-up space at the Truman Brewery in London this Saturday, March 1, for his Air Max 90s. At the time of writing, a wider release for the project has not yet been announced by the brand.",

They're targeting Nike shoes and electronics in heists that sound like something straight out of the Wild West\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Northern Arizona train heist results in 11 arrests Investigators say more than 200 cases of Nike shoes were stolen after thieves cut a hose on the train to force it into an emergency stop and 10 of the 11 people arrested were in the country illegally. Fox - 10 Phoenix\n\nA band of robbers targets a train in the remote desert of Arizona, sneaking on board, slashing an air hose and forcing the locomotive to come to a dead halt. Then they take the goods and flee.\n\nNo, it's not the 1800s. It's 2025.\n\nIn less than a year, at least 10 such train heists in California and Arizona have netted about $2 million worth of Nike shoes, USA TODAY has confirmed after the Los Angeles Times first reported the string of robberies. More than 60 people are being charged in federal court in connection with the 10 heists, as well as other thefts in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe robberies work like a \u201chuman conveyor belt,\u201d with the goods passed from the train to the ground, to a truck, according to Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at CargoNet, a private company that provides supply chain theft intelligence to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done fast. It\u2019s fast as lightning,\u201d Lewis told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, adding that the thieves like conducting the heists in isolated areas so they have time to flee. \u201cA lot of those areas you can't get to other than with a helicopter ... You can't even get to some of those rail tracks with off-road vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the thefts have targeted trains operated by BNSF. The company says it's working with local authorities to address the problem.\n\n\"We work hard to protect our customers' freight from pickup to delivery and have security measures in place to help ensure these goods arrive safely,\" BNSF said in a statement to USA TODAY on Tuesday. \"We are working with federal, state, local, and tribal police departments to coordinate our approach to disrupting criminal activity and arresting offenders.\"\n\nTrain, ground, truck: a quick process\n\nIn multiple affidavits submitted in federal court filings and obtained by USA TODAY, Homeland Security Investigations special agent Brynna Cooke describes how the heists are done.\n\nRobbers scout containers to identify those that could have valuable cargo like Nike shoes and electronics, Cooke says.\n\nThey usually board trains in staging areas before they begin rolling. Then while the train is moving, they move from container to container, opening them with saws and bolt cutters.\n\nWhen they find something worth stealing, they\u2019ll often force the train to stop by cutting the braking system air hose, causing it to \u201cgo into an emergency stop.\u201d According to Cooke, once the train comes to a halt, box trucks are sent in to unload the merchandise and flee.\n\nLewis has seen the process firsthand.\n\n\u201cI've watched them through binoculars,\u201d he told the Republic. \u201cI just couldn't get there in time.\u201d\n\nJan 13: More than $400,000 in shoes are stolen in Arizona\n\nOne of the most recent train thefts happened on Jan. 13 in northern Arizona when police arrested 11 people in connection with the robbery of Nike shoes from a BNSF train in a remote area outside of Williams, some 170 miles north of Phoenix, according to court records obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nRobbers who were on board the train cut its air hose around 11 a.m., causing the train to automatically go into an emergency stop.\n\nShortly after the thieves cut the Arizona train's air hose on Jan. 13, a BNSF police officer who was in the area spotted several cases of Nike shoes beside the train and later saw several people loading Nike cases into a U-Haul truck and a Ford Econoline truck nearby.\n\nThere were trackers inside some of the boxes that authorities then used to conduct a traffic stop on the van, court records say. When authorities later searched both trucks, they found 1,985 pairs of unreleased Nike shoes worth over $440,000, according to court records.\n\nThe shoes targeted were a new Air Jordan 4 style, a striking red-orange collaboration with BMX athlete Nigel Sylvester, dubbed \u201cBike Air.\u201d When they go on sale in the spring, they will retail for $225.\n\nBut not all train heists end in arrests. When thieves cut air hoses in remote areas, conductors and engineers are stranded along with the disabled train. Ill-equipped to stop a robbery, they can\u2019t do much beyond calling 911.\n\n\u201cI've had conductors telling me that they actually watched them unload it,\" Lewis told the Republic. \"But by policy, they can't confront them because they're not armed, and the bad guys could be armed.\"\n\nJan: 10, $18,000 in shoes are stolen\n\nIn Southern California, two suspects are accused of stealing about $18,000 worth of merchandise in a remote area known as the Wonder Valley. According to a news release from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department, BNSF Police contacted authorities for help.\n\nPolice said they were notified that several suspects were robbing a train. On the way to the scene, police said they saw a box truck driving in the area.\n\n\u201cDeputies conducted a traffic enforcement stop on the vehicle and, through investigation, located approximately $18,000 in stolen items inside the truck,\u201d police said.\n\nTwo men, 28-year-old Oscar Sosa of Apple Valley, California, and 45-year-old Jose Villalobos-Infante of Phoenix, were arrested in connection to the robbery. They've since been charged with second-degree burglary, grand theft and conspiracy, according to the Hi-Desert Star.\n\nUSA TODAY was not able to immediately find attorneys representing the men.\n\nJan: 15, $400,000 in shoes are stolen again\n\nOnly two days after the Arizona heist and five days after the robbery in San Bernardino County, robbers allegedly targeted a train in the same area of California.\n\nAccording to a news release from police, BNSF Railroad police notified the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department of a train robbery. Deputies again spotted a white van leaving the area.\n\n\"However, the vehicle failed to yield, and a pursuit ensued,\" a sheriff's department statement said. \"The vehicle became disabled on a dirt berm, two occupants fled, and a foot pursuit ensued.\"\n\nTwo teenagers, whose names have not been released, were arrested in connection with the robbery. Police said they were able to recover 218 cases of Nike shoes valued at about $408,000.\n\nPolice have identified possible \u201cringleader\u201d\n\nAccording to federal court records, a man identified as Felipe Avalos-Mejia is alleged to be the ringleader of some of the train heists, operating out of Phoenix and Los Angeles.\n\nInvestigators say that Avalos-Mejia had a network of scouts who helped him select trains to target. Investigators also said Avalos-Mejia provided cars and paid burglary crews to rob the trains.\n\nPolice raided 11 homes and 16 storage units connected to Avalos-Mejia in June, arresting 43 suspects and recovering $3 million in merchandise believed to have been stolen from BNSF trains.\n\nAvalos-Mejia was arrested one day later on June 21. Court documents say police found $120,000 in cash, as well as a \"detailed ledger that listed Nike and other merchandise that is typically burglarized from BNSF trains, as well as dollar amounts detailing what the merchandise is worth and for what it is sold.\"\n\nAvaloz-Mejia's attorney declined USA TODAY's request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nContributing: Lane Sainty, the Arizona Republic\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

            "content": "Thieves have targeted freight trains running through the deserts of California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists resulting in the theft of more than $2m worth of new Nike sneakers, including many that have not hit the retail market yet, according to officials and court documents.\n\nIn a 13 January robbery, suspects cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train traveling through a remote section of Arizona and made off with more than 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. Many of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which will not be available to the public until 14 March and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.\n\nIt was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in remote areas of the Mojave desert since last March that authorities are investigating, the Los Angeles Times reported. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, according to investigators.\n\nEleven people were charged in the 13 January burglary with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. All 11 have pleaded not guilty and were all ordered detained until trial. Ten are Mexicans who were in the United States illegally. Another defendant is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum proceedings in the United States, authorities said in court records.\n\nThe suspects in the 13 January heist were caught with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes, the complaint says.\n\nIn another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Arizona, on 20 November after its air brake hose was cut, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave county stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states.\n\nTwo other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona, last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints.\n\nThieves typically scout merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks, and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice-president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona. Lewis told the LA Times that the thieves were sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by associates working at warehouses or trucking companies.\n\nIn another case, authorities say a Mexican man who controlled crews that burglarized trains had scouts who would tip him off on trains to target, supplied vehicles, paid crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise.\n\nThe suspects are often aided by accomplices in \u201cfollow vehicles\u201d, which track the rail cars. The loot is tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2013 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut, according to Brynna Cooke, a homeland security investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nThefts from cargo trains cost the country\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100m last year because of a combination of the value of the stolen goods and the cost of repairs to railcars the thieves damaged, and the problem is getting worse in recent years as the thefts have become more organized and sophisticated. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimates that the number of thefts jumped roughly 40% last year to 65,000 nationwide.\n\nIn 2022, thieves raided cargo containers on trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months, taking packages belonging to people across the US and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes of items deemed not valuable enough to steal. The audacious thefts prompted authorities and freight companies to step up security in the area. In 2015, thieves stole 111 guns after breaking the locks off a train in a Chicago railyard.\n\nRailroads have invested millions in measures to help prevent such thefts, butthey cannot easily restrict access to the more than 140,000 miles of track they operate across the country. It crosses remote, rural areas and cuts through the heart of many cities carrying millions of shipments of everything from bulk commodities such as coal and grain to raw materials like rock.\n\nThe rail trade group said additional federal enforcement and tougher penalties were needed to deter the thefts. The railroads estimate that only about one out of every 10 theft attempts result in an arrest, and many of the people who are arrested are repeat offenders. One railroad even reported arresting the same individual five times in a single day.\n\nBNSF and the other major freight railroad that hauls goods across the western United States, Union Pacific, did not immediately respond to inquiries from the Associated Press about the thefts. BNSF said in a statement to the LA Times that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.\n\nThe company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.\n\nCargo thefts from trains, trucks and ships are a problem in shipping hubs all across the country and a focus of the FBI. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15bn and $35bn in losses every year. Many of the more organized groups target major shipping hubs such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago and Atlanta.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nMidsole & Platform\n\nSam: The Vomero 18 is for sure a super max stack height trainer at 46mm heel / 36mm forefoot. Made up of a top layer of top end supercritical ZoomX with Nike's newer ReactX below, we have lots of cushion underfoot.\n\nThe Vomero goes way up in stack height with 6.5mm more at the heel and 6mm more upfront than the Vomero 17 that is in no way mushy and is highly impact absorbing with a moderately energetic rebound.\n\nSpeaking of reliability, we are also quite stable for such a big, relatively soft shoe although it is clearly not a pronation \u201ccontrol\u201d shoe. The platform is broad at the heel (90mm) narrow at midfoot, as Nike\u2019s often are at 70mm, and about as broad as one sees upfront at 115mm.\n\nThe broad heel stabilizes landings, the narrow midfoot and deep central groove facilitates transitions and the big 115mm forefoot provides a broad stable platform to toe off from.\n\nGiven the softer foam and narrow midfoot platform I was surprised how stable the Vomero 18, and this despite a relatively unstructured midfoot upper. Credit I think goes to the bulbous rear sides of the shoe which I think provide some adaptive stability as well as the solid heel hold\n\nSuper high stack height shoes often can be hard to turn over at slower paces on toe off, and especially so with lower drops than here but Nike wisely goes with a 10mm drop.\n\nThe 10mm drop ramp sensation is not overwhelming but it is there and along with the well segmented outsole we are also helped by very decent front flexibility at the 36mm forefoot. Beyond 36mm of stack upfront it is hard to get flexibility so such shoes must rely on a rocker. For example, the 6mm drop and 39mm forefoot Glycerin Max has to rely on a very pronounced front rocker way up in the front of the shoe. At slower paces or with pronounced heel striking, it is considerably harder to turn over than the Nike.\n\nAll in all for a reasonably priced super max shoe, the Vomero\u2019s midsole\u2019s careful design and choice of materials really has no compromises for training at a fairly wide range of paces and for longer distances given the cushion depth with moderate well tuned energy return, decent stability and relatively low weight.\n\nFor sure I would like the next Vomero to have all ZoomX maybe in dual density as here: top layer a little softer than bottom or be slightly lower stack height to be more agile. This likely would lead to a weight drop but the price might go up. Challenge on Nike!\n\nPeter: The midsole Is a big old blob of ZoomX sitting above a lower layer of ReactX. I know this\n\nbecause the back of the shoe has arrows to tell me what\u2019s what!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulbousness of the ZoomX can be a bit of a hazard as it pokes out a little further than the rest of the medial side of the shoe. I definitely scraped my calf a couple of times here and there. Not a huge issue, but it can be a little bit annoying.\n\nThe platform is wide and very stable. This is a solid and stable feeling shoe even though it\u2019s sitting on top of a big mound of foam.\n\nBen: With its roots as a stability shoe, I was not surprised to find the very broad base. As noted above, the ZoomX is very real and very present, as is the ReactX just beneath it. The combination is certainly not squishy, but not overly firm either (which I feared).\n\nThe combination also adds a lot of overall heft and bulk to the shoe but the weight remains reasonable. I also believe that this substantial midsole will lend itself to the shoe\u2019s durability (as does the outsole). It\u2019s a shoe that wants to be taken out and used for big miles, both daily and over the long haul.\n\nSally: I am glad that Peter also noted the arrows on the back of the shoe (I thought I was being so observant!), but how funny is it that Nike thought we might want a road map of what and where the different midsoles are?! I love Zoom X, the more the merrier, as it is their lightest and softest and most responsive foam, but I understand why the bottom layer is React X, bolstering the durability, adding some stability and keeping the price reasonable. The combination works very well and despite its heft, it feels smooth and responsive underfoot.\n\nRyan: I\u2019m actually glad they didn\u2019t opt to use ZoomX for the entire midsole here. While it would have been lighter, it would have almost certainly resulted in an unwieldy, hyperactive midsole, and would have essentially stepped on the toes of the ZoomX Invincible in Nike\u2019s lineup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe character of the Vomero\u2019s hybrid midsole works well for its intended use case. I took one look at this bulging stack of foam and expected the rebound to be an unruly mess, but it surprised me with its relative stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it \u2018responsive\u2019, but for the amount of cushioning you get, the shoe is fairly well behaved. I credit the width of the heel and forefoot here, as such a broad platform with a generous cavity directly under the heel gives a sense of stability.\n\nIn the parlance of a wine snob: I am getting notes of ReactX with a ZoomX finish on this one. The foams work nicely in tandem to stabilize impact, and then to deliver upward propulsion in that distinctly ZoomX fashion. It\u2019s a nice, albeit beefy, pairing that should easily endure hundreds of miles of running.\n\nCourtney: As aforementioned, this shoe is a stacked sky high with dual layer foams delivering a highly cushioned ride but with stability that makes it a great choice for a daily trainer. Overall, I did feel this amount of cushion felt over the top for me as a smaller framed runner.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd even with the high drop of 10mm I couldn\u2019t quite roll forward as quickly as other trainers I have tested. There could be a bit more collapsing in the arch as the platform tapers in medially which could contribute to that slowing of the roll forward.\n\nOutsole\n\nSam: The Vomero outsole is much more segmented upfront with more exposed midsole at mid foot and towards the heel than its predecessor shown below.\n\nThe rubber is in all the right places so durability should be fine. I have not yet tested on the same wet and slushy roads as I did the Premium and will soon to compare traction.\n\nIts design makes it more cushioned in feel and flexible up front and easier to toe off at slower paces if a bit less snappy and responsive there as the V17. The more strategic rubber coverage, common at other brands\u2019 trainers but kind of new to Nike also helps reduce weight as rubber is the heaviest material in a run shoe.\n\nPeter: The outsole on the Vomero 18 combines some old school Nike waffle on the heel and both sides of the forefoot with three segments of firm (ish) rubber pods.\n\nThe middle of the shoe has exposed ZoomX and in the rear there\u2019s a cutout that\u2019s wide enough and gently sloping enough that it shouldn\u2019t pick up any rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction has been excellent and the outsole should last a good long time.\n\nBen: Not much to add that hasn\u2019t already been said. The outsole offers a lot of grip and is not in any way excessive or intrusive. It helps with the overall vibe of the shoe: comfortable and ready to go to work. It promises to be highly durable.\n\nSally: This outsole works well and checks all the boxes: the grip on wet surfaces is great, it looks as though it will be durable, and it is pleasantly quiet on the run. Nike has reduced the amount of the traditional waffle pattern coverage by retaining the high abrasion rubber waffle grip around the edges, but exposing some midsole and using a minimal amount of another rubber under the forefoot. My assumption is that this helps reduce weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney: The outsole on the Vomero is designed with durability and traction in mind. I ran through ice and slush and although I slowed down considerably through the slick icy spots, I didn\u2019t once lose my balance or slip. The outsole really does the job well!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe segmented rubber adds some flexibility in the forefoot while the rubber in the rear provides some stability. I do think the lug-like protrusions most likely add considerable weight to the shoe, but perhaps this is something worth the extra energy expenditure s we are looking at a training shoe after all.\n\n\n\n\n\nRide, Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nPeter:The Vomero 18 shines on the ride. It\u2019s a big, burly max trainer but it runs lighter than it looks. The ride is really enhanced by the flexibility of the outsole. The midsole foams are forgiving without being mushy and the outsole rubber helps firm things up just right. Based on the weight I was afraid that running in the Vomero 18 would be kind of a slog, but it\u2019s actually pretty delightful. These aren\u2019t race day or tempo shoes, but they don\u2019t mind speeding up a little during a run. There\u2019s some decent energy return and a very stable and enjoyable ride.\n\nThe Vomero 18, coming in at $150 feels like a great super-max trainer/recovery day shoe for anyone. It\u2019s a fun, easy ride and should last for a long time. I put it up against some other shoes in the same category and it holds up great. See comparisons below for details.\n\nPeter\u2019s Score: 9/10 It\u2019s a big burly shoe for easy days and recovery days with a very comfortable, flexible and enjoyable ride.\n\nBen: This is a sturdy, solid - if not somewhat bulky - daily trainer. It\u2019ll work well for cruising easy miles and/or for recovery days. Nike is clearly trying to revamp its daily trainers and this latest iteration of the Vomero bodes well for that. I see this is a really nice daily trainer, in what is a highly crowded category, as others have noted. It is not a super trainer, nor is it trying to be that. I found it refreshing and fun, even surprisingly so.\n\n9.4/10 with deductions for weight and lack of real pop.\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude00\n\nSally: In a crowded arsenal of available running shoes, the Vomero 18 has quickly earned a coveted spot in my rotation. It is a delightful new take on the super high stack max cushioned trainer, plush and comfortable for long miles but smooth and responsive on the run. This is a perfect easy day cruiser when time on the feet is more important than the pace. Yes, they are a bit on the heftier side of things, but they feel lighter on the feet than the scale would indicate. They are stable and easy fitting, and roll nicely at most any pace. As I hit the peak training weeks of another Boston Marathon training block, I am often reminded to \u201crun slow to run fast.\u201d This is my shoe for that!\n\nI am excited to see this new direction and focus for Nike, returning to the everyday as well as elite runner with some solid training day companions to their top tier race shoes.\n\nSally\u2019s score: 9.4 / 10.0\n\nRide (50%) : 9.3 Fit (30%): 9.9 Value (15%): 10 Style (5%): 10\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a1/2\n\nSam: Nike scores a solid win with the Vomero 18 by solving the puzzle of a decently lively, fairly light and reasonably priced super max cushion trainer.\n\nFocused on a comfortable big cushion ride, it also succeeds in actually being able to move along at various places without me feeling bogged down, even when tired.\n\nNike has in recent years struggled to deliver mainstream modern everyday trainers either too aggressive for most (invincible Run) or dated \u201cIcons\u201d the Pegasus.\n\nHere with the Vomero 18 they succeed with a solid all around super max cushion trainer which is in no way ponderous for a variety of runs with as a bonus at a very reasonable price. How could it be improved? An all ZoomX dual density midsole to liven the ride and lighten the weight even if it came in somewhat more expensive.\n\nSam\u2019s Score: 9.3 /10\n\nMy deductions are the same as Ben\u2019s: weight and lack of pop\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a \u00bd\n\nRyan: The ride is certainly worthy of a high-mileage trainer made for casual/recovery paces. It provides enough stability with its hybrid midsole, but has that distinctive ZoomX pop to both protect your knees and to keep you springing along for 90+ minutes. One distinct characteristic I felt, which I also observed in the Invincible, is of a feeling of roundedness on both the lateral and medial side of the shoe during pronation. It doesn\u2019t make the shoe unstable per-se, but it does make for a laissez faire kind of experience when your foot strikes the ground \u2014 the edges of the outsole aren\u2019t very distinct.\n\nOn the flip side, it doesn\u2019t have a smooth, buttery transition like a more uptempo trainer such as the Pegasus. This is likely due to its heftier use of materials \u2014 an overall weight gain, a thick, semi-lugged rubber outsole, and a fairly broad platform from heel to toe. While it\u2019s great for locking into a comfortable long run pace, it certainly doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t deliver the silky smooth ride that a more uptempo trainer might. Overall, the Vomero 18 is a rock-solid, long distance workhorse. What you get here is tons of mellow comfort, along with deep, reasonably stable cushioning (thanks to a nice blend of midsole foams), for a palatable $150. I have to admit that I liked the 17 more though. I think the 18 has gone a bit too \u2018big and burly\u2019 as evidenced by the shoe\u2019s transition to a super max trainer. Ryan\u2019s Score: 8.8 /10 Deductions for weight, turnover, breathability, and an overly-rugged outer \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nCourtney: The Vomero 18, with its increased sky high 46mm stack can certainly be considered a max stack comfort trainer. Its highly durable outsole will keep you running for many miles. This shoe is not one for your workouts, but it will go the distance for those recovery to easy day miles for me. The Vomero is great for runners of any level and could also be a suitable walking shoe. Courtney\u2019s Score: 8.65/10 A solid daily trainer, but deductions for a heavier, clunkier ride. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\n7 Comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\nPegasus Premium (RTR Review)\n\nSam: Take about the same platform width and stack height, as well as layers of ZoomX and ReactX, and between them insert an Air Zoom \u201cplate\u201d shaped similarly to Nike\u2019s carbon Flyplate.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a lighter, more secure and precise but less accommodating non stretch mesh in the toe box (but close) upper and you get the Pegasus Premium. Its ride is somewhat firmer and faster riding off the front despite its 0.75 oz weight penalty. It is a more stable choice for long runs at somewhat faster paces with the Vomero a more well rounded all around choice for daily training.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee my detailed comparison review of Pegasus Premium to Vomero 18 HERE.\n\nASICS Superblast (RTR Review)\n\nSam: A direct comparative to the Vomero 18, the Superblast has a single density all supercritical FF Turbo midsole. At 8.6 oz / 243.8 g US 8.5, the SB is a big 1.5 oz lighter than the Nike. At 45 mm heel / 37 mm forefoot the heels are at the same height while the Superblast\u2019s forefoot is 7mm higher. It is not only stiffer in flex but quite a bit harder to turn over and at slower faster paces for me and comes alive at faster paces and this despite its considerable weight advantage over the Nike. The Nike is a more practical max cushion daily trainer and a better value at $50 less than the Superblast.\n\nPeter: What Sam said! Agreed.\n\nSally: The Superblast is well loved by many runners for its do-it-all-well versatility, but that comes at a price ($200). WIth a similar superstack height of 45 mm, the Superblast is lighter and I felt a better uptempo shoe, but the Vomero belongs in my rotation because it excels at the easy comfortable daily paces.\n\nBen: As noted above, the Superblast is lively and responsive, in a more nimble package. That said, the price reflects the upgraded ride. I think I\u2019d still go with the ASICS.\n\nHoka Bondi 9 (RTR Review)\n\nSam: At about the same weight of 10.2 oz / 286g US8.5, on a very slightly lower heel platform of 43mm but much higher (+8mm) forefoot of 38mm and wider 100mm heel / 85mm midfoot / 100 mm forefoot platform, the Bondi gets there with an all supercritical EVA single foam midsole. Somewhat softer, more flexible and bouncier than the Vomero 18, its closest comparison, it is not quite as fast feeling but yet easier on tired legs. True to size for me and with comparable fits.\n\nBrooks Glycerin Max (RTR Review)\n\nPeter: Almost exactly the same weight. Running the Vomero 18 and the Glycerin Max back to back was interesting. The Glycerin is far less flexible and is firmer too. The Vomero rides more smoothly and easily and FEELS lighter than the Glycerin. It\u2019s a reminder that stiff shoes with a rocker are not the only super-shoes out there. The Vomero feels like a more standard running shoe built with more modern materials. It\u2019s kind of a classic ride. I prefer the Vomero here.\n\nBen: For me the Brooks is a joy to run in, though again at a hefty price. It\u2019s smooth and has good responsiveness for a shoe of its bulk. I\u2019d take the Brooks.\n\nSam: In agreement with Peter about the comparative rides . With a 45.25 mm heel / 39.25 mm forefoot and only 6mm drop vs 10mm for the Vomero and 36mm at the forefoot, the Glycerin is overly stiff at slower paces with its abrupt rocker really only activating at faster paces, unlike the Vomero easier flexing profile. At $200 it is $50 more. Similar fits. Easy pick of the Vomero here.\n\nSally: (W8 True to size in both) The Glycerin Max feels like so much more shoe underfoot, slightly heavier but much stiffer and clunkier with a seemingly softer heel. I much prefer the spunkier and smoother ride of the Vomero 18 to the Brooks Marshmallow, and the Vomero is $50 cheaper.\n\nSalomon Aero Glide 3 (RTR Review)\n\nSam: Much lower in weight at 8.5 oz / 242g US8.5 and somewhat lower in stack height 40 mm heel / 32 mm forefoot,, the Salomon goes all supercritical foam with a springy eTPU foam is what I could call a \u201cracier\u201d daily trainer when compared to the Vomero. Its no seams on the inside, the very comfortable true to size upper is just fine but can\u2019t quite keep up with its platform for me compared to the Vomero\u2019s. If your needs and paces are faster the Salomon is a better choice. If you want a steady cruiser for slower miles or long runs the Vomero\n\nUnder Armour UA Infinite Elite 2 (RTR Review soon)\n\nSam: Basically take the Vomero\u201ds wide platform and go with a lower stack height of 38/32 make the foam (TPU similar to Saucony PWRRUN+) bouncier and softer and add a higher volume upper and you get the Elite 2. I was able to get a decent lockdown for my narrow to medium volume feet but the UA\u2019s upper clearly favors higher volume feet. In ferns of ride it leans more easier and recovery runs than the Vomero which leans daily trainer and long runs due to its quicker returning midsole and greater stability.\n\nHoka Clifton 10 (RTR Review)\n\nPeter: While the Clifton weighs in at about an ounce lighter, the Vomero is the more enjoyable ride for me. It\u2019s always interesting to switch shoes multiple times during a run to help figure this stuff out. The Vomero feels a bit more fluid and the fit is more accommodating. If I had to pick one it would be the Vomero.\n\nSam: Agree with Peter. The latest Clifton goes up in stack height (close to Vomero) and up in drop to 8mm but retains its old school CMEVA foam. While lighter than the Vomero it has a duller ride (its foam). It\u2019s upper is more precise in fit and will favor lower volume feet. Hoka sort of missed the boat here by not using the livelier supercritical foam of the Bondi 9 in the Clifton.\n\nBen: The Clifton 10 has really grown on me. In the beginning I found it stiff and a bit harsh but it\u2019s softened up over time. Like the Vimero, it\u2019s certainly not a fast shoe. I imagine there are some who will appreciate Nike's more accommodating fit and upper. It\u2019s a close one.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsics GEL-Nimbus 27 (RTR Review)\n\nCourtney: The Nimbus weighs a bit more than the Vomero at 10.65 oz for men\u2019s sample weight and 9.6oz for women\u2019s. Surprisingly, despite the weight, I felt the Nimbus runs a bit faster than the Vomero.\n\nThe upper on the Vomero is definitely a more plush experience with the uber-cushioned tongue and double layered mesh but fits a bit snugger to the foot and may be more ideal for lower volume feet. The Nimbus\u2019s jacquard engineered knit conforms to the foot but with much less cushion, though in my opinion, is just as comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nimbus seems better suited to running in the elements with a bit more shielding than the Vomero\u2019s perforated almost foamy upper. Though I love the white and neon pink orange colorway of the Vomero, I can already see some dirt marks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth shoes provide plenty of room in the toe box to accommodate any swelling and have executed the heel counter well to hold you in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nimbus\u2019s blocky rear platform provides a lot of support, while the Vomero though supportive in its geometry and overlays, sports a more narrow midfoot especially on the medial side. Quite obviously, these high stack trainers provide plenty of underfoot cushion but both leave a little something to be desired in their responsiveness.\n\nIndex to all RTR reviews: HERE\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping at our partners below for the Vomero 18 is much appreciated and helps support RoadTrailRun\n\n\n\n\n\nRUNNING WAREHOUSE US Men's & Women's SHOP HERE\n\nTOP4RUNNING EUROPE Men's & Women's SHOP HERE Use RTR code RTRTOP4 f or 5% off all products, even sale products\n\nFLEET FEET Men's & Women's SHOP HERE\n\n\n\nSamples were provided at no charge for review purposes.

            "content": "Migrant thieves targeting slow-moving freight trains through remote parts of California and Arizona have run off with more than $2 million worth of not-yet-released Nike sneakers in a series of movie-like heists, officials said.\n\nIn the most recent robbery on January 13, a group of 11 suspects \u2014 10 of whom were in the country illegally \u2014 cut an air brake hose from a BNSF freight train as it rolled through a secluded area of Arizona and stole nearly 2,000 pairs of sneakers worth some $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in Phoenix federal court.\n\nMany of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which are not available to the public until March 14 and are expected to fetch $225 retail per pair, the complaint states.\n\n4 Migrant thieves targeting slow-moving freight trains through remote parts of California and Arizona have run off with more than $2 million worth of not-yet-released Nike sneakers in a series of movie-like heists, officials said. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe robbery was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in the Mojave Desert since last March, prompting an investigation by federal authorities, the Los Angeles Times first reported. The bandits stole Nikes in nine of the 10 incidents.\n\nThe 11 suspects in the Jan. 13 job, who were caught using tracking devices placed on some of the shoeboxes, pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment.\n\nTen of the defendants are Mexicans who were in the US illegally and one is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum processing, according to court records.\n\n4 In 2022 a year-long investigation into burglaries of commercial railroad cargo containers resulted in 22 arrests in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nIn another major heist on November 20, Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County Arizona stopped a white van seen fleeing the area where a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry after losing air, according to another complaint.\n\nRoughly 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers, valued at $41,400, were found loaded in the vehicle, police said.\n\nTwo other cases BNSF freight trains were burglarized in separate incidents near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona last year resulting in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to additional federal criminal complaints.\n\n4 Roughly 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers, valued at $41,400, were found loaded in the vehicle, police said. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe thieves, sometimes tipped off by associates at warehouses, waited for the valuable merchandise to travel along rail lines parallel to Interstate 40, then boarded the lumbering freight trains when they changed tracks or opened their containers, Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona told the LA Times.\n\nThe criminals were often aided by accomplices who followed the train cars in vehicles. Those on the train would toss them the loot when the train stopped \u2014 either scheduled or because an air hose had been slashed, according to Brynna Cooke, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nOnce secured, the stolen kicks are usually transported to California to be sold or put for sale online through third-party Amazon and eBay resellers, according to the LA Times.\n\n4 More than 10 BNSF trains have been robbed since March, according to a federal complaint. AP\n\nDespite railroads investing millions of dollars in security measures to protect their shipments, thefts from cargo trains cost the nation\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100 million last year due to the combination of stolen goods and damaged railcars.\n\nAnd the problem is only increasing as the heists are becoming better organized and more sophisticated.\n\nThere were roughly 65,000 train thefts nationwide last year \u2014 a 40% increase from the previous year, according to the Association of American Railroads trade group. Even that could be significantly understated as railroads don\u2019t publicize all thefts, Lewis told The Times.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15 billion and $35 billion in losses every year.\n\nThefts along any parts of the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for $15 billion and $35 billion in the US every year, according to ICE estimates.\n\nBNSF has told its employees not to engage with thieves but just to report when an incident occurs.\n\nWith Post wires",

            "content": "Nike is inviting runners to experience the latest in racing innovation with new iterations of two industry-defining silhouettes: the Vaporfly 4 and Streakfly 2.\n\nBoth styles are powered by Nike\u2019s legendary system of speed: a proprietary combination of ZoomX foam and a carbon fiber Flyplate that distinguishes runners from the rest of the pack, helping them reach their potential. The refined system helps both models push the limits of sport while reflecting Nike\u2019s racing heritage and five-decade commitment to making the best running footwear for elite athletes and newer runners alike.\n\nThe Vaporfly 4 is the lightest model in the franchise\u2019s storied history, using new athlete insights and Nike\u2019s unparalleled standard of precise design to level up the silhouette that started the super shoe revolution eight years ago, furthering Nike\u2019s position at the leading edge of racing innovation.\n\nBuilt for all runners and inspired by the best athletes \u2014 including Joshua Cheptegei and Mohammed Ahmed, who tested the shoe throughout production \u2014 the new Vaporfly is the most versatile Nike racing model on the market, setting the standard for distances ranging from the 5K to the marathon. The silhouette blends the stability of the Vaporfly 3 and the softness of its veritable predecessor, introducing a finely tuned balance of support and propulsion that serves runners of all abilities and intensities.\n\nThat propulsion is born from an updated Nike Flyplate curvature, which helps unlock leverage from the foot and ankle, as well as the energy return generated by ZoomX foam, Nike\u2019s lightest and most resilient midsole compound.\n\nIt\u2019s also boosted by the silhouette\u2019s featherweight design, which is roughly 10% lighter than the Vaporfly 3 and 20 grams lighter than the original Vaporfly (2017). The latest model\u2019s midsole design saves weight by eliminating foam where it isn\u2019t needed, while a new upper increases comfort and fit consistency while contributing to the overall weight savings of the shoe.\n\n\u201cThe Vaporfly 4 is the ideal Vaporfly. Nike nailed it,\u201d says Mohammed, a Nike athlete and Canadian long-distance runner. \u201cThere are so many aspects I love about this shoe: It\u2019s lighter than its previous iteration, more responsive, gives a comfortable ride, has a stable feel, and offers a great fit. Simply put, it\u2019s the perfect combination of carbon to foam in this shoe to date. I love running fast in this shoe.\u201d\n\nThe Vaporfly\u2019s DNA also extends throughout the Nike Racing line, serving the needs of runners at shorter and longer distances with groundbreaking running innovation and technology that enable peak performance for all athletes. That influence takes form in the new Streakfly 2, a specialized racing innovation designed to help runners deliver top performances in shorter races, such as the road mile, 5K or 10K, as well as fast intervals and tempo training sessions.\n\nEach element of the Streakfly 2 is purpose-built to deliver raw speed and ultra-responsive cushioning, with a full-length Flyplate and aggressive new shape in an incredibly lightweight package designed with input from everyday athletes and Nike distance runners.\n\n\u201cUsually, I would need to switch from sneakers to spikes during interval training to condition my muscles and avoid injury,\u201d says Nike athlete Jessica Hull, an Australian middle- and long-distance runner. \u201cBut the responsive, supportive design of the Streakfly 2 allows me to run all of my fastest reps without having to change into spikes, helping my feet and legs feel fresher the next day.\u201d\n\nThe Streakfly 2 is built on the last of a track spike, giving the silhouette a decidedly aggressive stance with a 4mm heel-to-toe offset, allowing athletes to more easily run on their forefoot. The full-length Flyplate is a first in the Streakfly line and similar to that of the Vaporfly 4, providing unmatched propulsion that helps runners push boundaries and shatter their personal bests. ZoomX midsole foam delivers a standard-setting combination of flexibility and durability, further enhancing the silhouette\u2019s energy return, while an upgraded outsole pattern and rubber deliver precise traction with every stride.\n\nA redesigned, centered lace system and slight elasticity in the new laces allows athletes to dial in a more custom fit, and a new engineered mesh upper increases comfort, breathability and fit consistency while cutting down on weight.\n\nThe overall weight of the shoe pushes the boundary of lightness: The silhouette tips the scales at just 126 grams, which is roughly 40 grams lighter than the original Streakfly and similar models on the market.\n\n\u201cThe Streakfly 2 is a renaissance for racing,\u201d says Nike athlete Cooper Teare, an American middle- and long-distance runner. \u201cThey level up from the previous model with improved performance, thanks to the new components like ZoomX foam and the full-length carbon fiber Flyplate. Nike even updated the lacing system, so the fit is better. They really thought through all the details. I can run fast 200s or a smooth 5K pace in the new Streakfly.\u201d\n\nThe new Vaporfly and Streakfly models join a Nike Racing lineup of performance footwear that includes the Alphafly 3 marathon shoe and Zoom Fly 6 super trainer. The racing silhouettes also pair with Nike\u2019s new Aeroswift Race Day apparel, which is built with Dri-FIT technology and is precisely engineered for optimal airflow, fit and movement \u2014 offering all runners the same level of innovation as Nike\u2019s elite track & field athletes.\n\nThis industry-leading lineup of performance footwear and apparel equips runners of all levels with the features they need to train and compete at their peak, reflecting Nike\u2019s unmatched commitment to championing runners and the running community.\n\nFurther, Nike\u2019s racing shoes and Race Day collections are built by runners, for runners, with learnings from throughout the innovation and design process informing the development of performance footwear and apparel across the brand\u2019s running portfolio.\n\nThe Vaporfly 4 and Streakfly 2 will be available globally at nike.com and select retailers starting in March. The Aeroswift Race Day men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel collections are available now.\n\n",

Since its inception, the Vaporfly has been the baseline standard for marathon racing. Yes, there have been other shoes with more pods and plates and rockers and tech, but when it comes to pure simplicity in a carbon-plated race day shoe, it\u2019s hard to beat the Vaporfly.\n\nWe absolutely loved the last version of the shoe. It remains one of my all-time favorite racers, both for the fit of the upper and the performance underfoot. It struck the perfect balance between comfort and performance, offering a pure race day feel with a touch of magic thanks to the ZoomX and carbon Flyplate combination.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a lighter shoe any time we can get it, so the weight savings will surely make the Vaporfly 4 a shoe that disappears on the feet. The question is: will the sacrifices made by trimming down the midsole affect the overall performance? We\u2019ll find out soon enough, as we\u2019ll have the shoe in for testing in the coming weeks.",

            "content": "Thieves have targeted freight trains running through the deserts of California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists resulting in the theft of more than $2m worth of new Nike sneakers, including many that have not hit the retail market yet, according to officials and court documents.\n\nIn a 13 January robbery, suspects cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train traveling through a remote section of Arizona and made off with more than 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. Many of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which will not be available to the public until 14 March and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.\n\nIt was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in remote areas of the Mojave desert since last March that authorities are investigating, the Los Angeles Times reported. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, according to investigators.\n\nEleven people were charged in the 13 January burglary with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. All 11 have pleaded not guilty and were all ordered detained until trial. Ten are Mexicans who were in the United States illegally. Another defendant is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum proceedings in the United States, authorities said in court records.\n\nThe suspects in the 13 January heist were caught with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes, the complaint says.\n\nIn another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Arizona, on 20 November after its air brake hose was cut, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave county stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states.\n\nTwo other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona, last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints.\n\nThieves typically scout merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks, and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice-president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona. Lewis told the LA Times that the thieves were sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by associates working at warehouses or trucking companies.\n\nIn another case, authorities say a Mexican man who controlled crews that burglarized trains had scouts who would tip him off on trains to target, supplied vehicles, paid crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise.\n\nThe suspects are often aided by accomplices in \u201cfollow vehicles\u201d, which track the rail cars. The loot is tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2013 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut, according to Brynna Cooke, a homeland security investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nThefts from cargo trains cost the country\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100m last year because of a combination of the value of the stolen goods and the cost of repairs to railcars the thieves damaged, and the problem is getting worse in recent years as the thefts have become more organized and sophisticated. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimates that the number of thefts jumped roughly 40% last year to 65,000 nationwide.\n\nIn 2022, thieves raided cargo containers on trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months, taking packages belonging to people across the US and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes of items deemed not valuable enough to steal. The audacious thefts prompted authorities and freight companies to step up security in the area. In 2015, thieves stole 111 guns after breaking the locks off a train in a Chicago railyard.\n\nRailroads have invested millions in measures to help prevent such thefts, butthey cannot easily restrict access to the more than 140,000 miles of track they operate across the country. It crosses remote, rural areas and cuts through the heart of many cities carrying millions of shipments of everything from bulk commodities such as coal and grain to raw materials like rock.\n\nThe rail trade group said additional federal enforcement and tougher penalties were needed to deter the thefts. The railroads estimate that only about one out of every 10 theft attempts result in an arrest, and many of the people who are arrested are repeat offenders. One railroad even reported arresting the same individual five times in a single day.\n\nBNSF and the other major freight railroad that hauls goods across the western United States, Union Pacific, did not immediately respond to inquiries from the Associated Press about the thefts. BNSF said in a statement to the LA Times that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.\n\nThe company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.\n\nCargo thefts from trains, trucks and ships are a problem in shipping hubs all across the country and a focus of the FBI. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15bn and $35bn in losses every year. Many of the more organized groups target major shipping hubs such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago and Atlanta.",

Nike\u2019s strongest entrant in that arena in 2024 was the Nike Air Max Waffle, an archival mashup concept that you likely regard as a perfect blend between dueling ends of Beaverton\u2019s catalog or an awkward in-between amalgamation. If you\u2019re in the latter camp, perhaps the right colorway can swing you in the opposite direction. Another chance for that emerges via the shoe\u2019s first look in the new year, the Nike Air Max Waffle \u201cHyper Blue.\u201d\n\nThis checks off only the fifth Air Max Waffle Racer to date, meaning each successive look carries plenty of weight in projecting forward how the silhouette will continue to grow. To this point, The model has pulled from already-established looks for either one of its parent models (the Air Max Plus or Waffle Racer proper). Here, the blend of \u201cHyper Blue/Metallic Gold/Black\u201d embraces a colorway both have already taken to, executing the always-reliable combo of blue and gold, anchored by a suede mudguard and heel and jet black waffle tread underfoot.\n\nThe Nike Air Max Waffle \u201cHyper Blue\u201d releases on March 20th, retailing for $140.

            "content": "When you're spending $250 or more on running shoes, you're either in the serious runner category or you're aspiring to be. There are stellar pairs on the market for less than that. Hoka's Bondi and Clifton come to mind. New Balance's affordable Fresh Foam and even the lifestyle-focused 990 work just fine. But I was curious when it comes to bang for your buck in the sneaker department. Is something as pricey as Nike's Vaporfly 3 worth the investment (though it's technically a step down from the marathon-level )? I've been putting it to the test to find out, and surprisingly I'm on board.\n\n\n\nHaving run a marathon a few years ago in a pair of Nike's older Flyknit iterations, it seems only right that my current half marathon training shoe incorporates the same ultralightweight technology. While I'm not aiming for record-breaking time\u2014a solid nine- or ten-minute mile will do quite fine\u2014it's still nice to feel like I'm running fast, to feel propelled forward. These shoes do exactly that.\n\nLightweight and built for speed\n\nThis shoe is as close to running barefoot as it gets in terms of weight. The cushioning system is decidedly not barefoot-like. Each shoe weighs 7.1 ounces, one of the lightest on the market, creating that barely-there feel. The ZoomX foam is Nike's most responsive sole material, and it's where you lose the barefoot-ness of this run. It delivers phenomenal energy return from heel to toe with each stride. Different from previous iterations, the Vaporfly 3 features a modified thin rubber outsole to reduce outsole weight and thickness, allowing for extra millimeters of ZoomX foam underfoot.\n\nYet even with all of this added foam, the sneakers don't get that squishy quality you tend to find with other models. I could still feel my run, but the shoes put a spring in my step that I didn't even realize I'd been missing. That would be thanks to the carbon-fiber plate at the core of the sole. It's what revolutionized the world of running shoes, and it's what makes this specific pair so fast.\n\nGood for sweaty feet\n\nPersonal note: My feet sweat. While sweaty feet aren't something I'm ashamed of, it's uncomfortable when I'm running if my feet are overheated with my socks getting all moist. During a marathon, it can actually slow you down. One of my favorite parts about this shoe is that it's as breathable as it gets. You can literally see your socks through the mesh holes of the upper; it's like a mesh lacrosse pinnie in footwear form. While this might not seem like a big deal, this perforated upper keeps my foot cool as I run long distances.\n\nPower in the details\n\nEvery element of the design of the Vaporfly 3 is thoughtful, from heel to toe. The sleek and streamlined silhouette is an aerodynamic shape. A full-length carbon-fiber Flyplate delivers a stiff and propulsive feel. Light padding on the tongue aims to reduce lace pressure. Even the various colorways all have unique touches: The all-black pair features a \"Running Is Mental\" heel design, nodding to the mindful aspects of the sport. The flame-patterned style\u2014which still has a full size run on the Nike site at the time of writing\u2014commemorated Japan's 2025 New Year Ekiden.\n\nMy two notes\n\nThe other thing to be aware of when purchasing your pair is that they run slightly small. We're talking a half size too small, at least. That's how all of my Nike running shoes are, so perhaps it's a personal anatomy issue. Who knows. But if you're in between sizes, I'd go up. That's general practice in running, though. Too big is bad, but any amount of too small is really unusable.\n\nAlso, you are going to need to replace them eventually. The worst part about finding a running shoe that you fall in love with is the knowledge that one day you are going to need to get a new pair. So when a heftier price tag is attached to said new pair, it's going to sting a little. While the construction isn't any less durable than that of other Nike models, I have noticed that the sole does wear slightly quicker than others.\n\nIs Nike's Vaporfly 3 worth $270?\n\nIt comes down to patience and preference. When I first tried the Vaporfly, it actually took a little bit to get used to such a pro-level running shoe. I had never experienced anything like that energy return, so it required some time adjusting to the extra bounce in my gait. But now? Running with another pair of shoes feels weird. I need to start a savings jar so I'm ready for when these kick the bucket.",

The old school Nike Basketball tooling remains intact, with only the mixed-materials upper opting for understated color updates. 'University Gold' accents are expected to land throughout the pairs, likely on NOCTA-specific branding. As with other footwear items from Drake's line, the autumnal drops will likely be accompanied by high-quality apparel and accessories done in similar color palettes.\n\nNo firm Nike SNKRS release details have been disclosed by either party involved as of yet, but that's expected to change as the end of summer rolls around.

Analyst Randal Konik upgraded his rating from hold to buy and made Nike his current favorite pick.\n\nOn Monday, Nike was the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and posted the third-best gain among S&P 500 members.\n\nNike investors have taken their lumps over the last couple of years. In 2024, the stock was the second-worst performer among the 30 components of the Dow with a 30% drop. Its 7.2% decline the prior year made it the third-worst stock in the Dow.\n\n\u201cAfter a few years of challenges and self-inflicted wounds, we believe new leadership will improve product direction and re-establish balance between DTC and wholesale,\u201d Konik wrote. \u201cAs channel inventories rebalance along with improved product direction and execution, we believe a substantial earnings recovery will ensue over the coming two years. With shares near a valuation trough, we believe now is the right time to aggressively buy shares.\u201d\n\nIn October, Nike veteran Elliott Hill returned to the company to replace CEO John Donahoe. Konik says Hill is \u201ctackling product and distribution issues head-on,\u201d and that he is setting the company to take back lost share.

            "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Thieves have targeted freight trains running through the deserts of California and Arizona in a string of audacious heists resulting in the theft of more than $2 million worth of new Nike sneakers, including many that haven\u2019t hit the retail market yet, according to officials and court documents.\n\nIn a Jan. 13 robbery, suspects cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train traveling through a remote section of Arizona and made off with more than 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Phoenix. Many of the shoes were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which won\u2019t be available to the public until March 14 and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.\n\nIt was one of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in remote areas of the Mojave Desert since last March that authorities are investigating, the Los Angeles Times reported. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, according to investigators.\n\nEleven people were charged in the Jan. 13 burglary with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. All 11 have pleaded not guilty and were all ordered detained until trial. Ten are Mexicans who were in the United States illegally. Another defendant is a Mexican citizen who was in asylum proceedings in the United States, authorities said in court records.\n\nThe suspects in the Jan. 13 heist were caught with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes, the complaint says.\n\nIn another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Arizona, on Nov. 20 after it started losing air, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states.\n\nTwo other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Arizona, last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints.\n\nScouting merchandise\n\nThieves typically scout merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona. Lewis told the Times that the thieves are sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by associates working at warehouses or trucking companies.\n\nIn another case, authorities say a Mexican man who controlled crews that burglarized trains had scouts who would tip him off on trains to target, supplied vehicles, paid crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise.\n\nThe suspects are often aided by accomplices in \u201cfollow vehicles,\u201d which track the rail cars. The loot is tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2014 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut, according to Brynna Cooke, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent cited in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nA significant cost\n\nThefts from cargo trains cost the nation\u2019s six largest freight railroads more than $100 million last year because of a combination of the value of the stolen goods and the cost of repairs to railcars the thieves damaged, and the problem is getting worse in recent years as the thefts have become more organized and sophisticated. The Association of American Railroads trade group estimates that the number of thefts jumped roughly 40% last year to 65,000 nationwide.\n\nIn 2022, thieves raided cargo containers aboard trains nearing downtown Los Angeles for months, taking packages belonging to people across the U.S. and leaving the tracks blanketed with discarded boxes of items deemed not valuable enough to steal. The audacious thefts prompted authorities and freight companies to step up security in the area. In 2015, thieves stole 111 guns after busting the locks off a train in a Chicago railyard.\n\nRailroads have invested millions in measures to help prevent such thefts, but it\u2019s not like they can easily restrict access to the more than 140,000 miles of track they operate across the country. It crosses remote, rural areas and cuts through the heart of many cities carrying millions of shipments of everything from bulk commodities like coal and grain to raw materials like rock.\n\nThe rail trade group said additional federal enforcement and tougher penalties are needed to deter the thefts. The railroads estimate that only about 1 out of every 10 theft attempts result in an arrest, and many of the people who are arrested are repeat offenders. One railroad even reported arresting the same individual five times in a single day.\n\nBNSF and the other major freight railroad that hauls goods across the western United States, Union Pacific, didn\u2019t immediately respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the thefts. BNSF said in a statement to the Times that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.\n\nThe company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.\n\nCargo thefts from trains, trucks and ships are a problem in shipping hubs all across the country and a focus of the FBI. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that cargo thefts at various points along the supply chain from ports to trains to trucks account for between $15 billion and $35 billion in losses every year. Many of the more organized groups target major shipping hubs like Los Angeles, Dallas, Memphis, Chicago and Atlanta.",

Seeing initial success from its in-house Nike Direct and Nike Digital operations, the company leaned into its own sales capabilities in favor of maintaining relationships with its wholesale partners.\n\nHowever, as customers shifted from pandemic-aided shopping at home to going back to stores as things normalized, Nike's sales declined for the first time since the start of the pandemic itself.\n\nCue a new CEO in Elliott Hill for Nike, and Jeffries analyst Randal Konik now believes the company's risk-reward profile is attractive. With Hill focused on restoring Nike's distribution relationships and getting back to its innovative roots, Konik thinks the stock is currently at its \"valuation trough\" at 25 times earnings.\n\nCiting recent surveys showing Nike's brand remains strong and an increase in job postings for product positions on the company's website, Konik thinks the market is underestimating Nike's turnaround story.\n\nFurthermore, a separate fall 2024 Piper Sandler study of teen shoppers showed that Nike's brand remains best in class. Nike was the favorite footwear and clothing brand among 57% and 33% of teens, respectively -- both of which were six times larger than the next competitor.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThough Nike's turnaround requires patience from investors, its popularity with young shoppers points to a bright future if Nike's new management can execute.",

            "content": "The thieves stealthily board eastbound freight trains, hiding out until they reach lonely stretches of the Mojave Desert or high plains far from towns. They slash an air brake hose, causing the mile-long line of railcars to screech to an emergency stop.\n\nThen, they go shopping.\n\nThat\u2019s the modus operandi described by investigators in a string of at least 10 heists targeting BNSF trains in California and Arizona since last March. All but one resulted in the theft of Nike sneakers, their combined value approaching $2 million, according to investigators.\n\nNew sneaker releases may have touched off at least some of the recent incidents. In Perrin, Ariz., thieves allegedly cut an air brake hose on a BNSF freight train on Jan. 13 and unloaded 1,985 pairs of unreleased Nikes worth more than $440,000, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix. Many were Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4s, which won\u2019t be available to the public until March 14 and are expected to retail at $225 per pair, the complaint states.\n\nTheft crews typically scout high-value merchandise on rail lines that parallel Interstate 40 by boarding slow-moving trains, such as when they are changing tracks and opening containers, said Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at Verisk\u2019s CargoNet and a deputy sheriff in Arizona.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis said the thieves are sometimes tipped off to valuable shipments by confederates working at warehouses or trucking companies. Other times they simply look for containers with high-security locks, which they cut with reciprocating saws or bolt cutters, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent said in affidavits filed in federal court.\n\nOnce the desired loot is found, the thieves alert \u201cfollow vehicles,\u201d which track the train. The stolen goods are tossed off the train after it comes to a halt \u2014 either for a scheduled stop or because an air hose has been cut or control wires inside signal boxes have been sabotaged, said the federal agent, Brynna Cooke.\n\nThe cargo is then loaded into box trucks, or hidden in nearby brush until they arrive \u2014 provided the surveillance crews that are following the train don\u2019t detect law enforcement, Cooke said. These tactics are often employed by transnational criminal groups that consist primarily of Mexican citizens from Sinaloa, she said.\n\nThere were at least 65,000 railroad cargo thefts last year, a 40% increase from 2023, according to industry estimates compiled by the Assn. of American Railroads. The thefts \u2014 which are typically classified as burglaries because they don\u2019t involve directly confronting victims, as with robberies \u2014 are believed to have cost the nation\u2019s largest rail companies more than $100 million, according to the trade group.\n\nThose figures may be an undercount, because railroads don\u2019t publicize all thefts, Lewis said. Details typically emerge publicly only when arrests are made and criminal complaints are filed.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to put my own dirty laundry on the street?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf I show a theft trend going along a rail line, everybody\u2019s going to know the railroad has a problem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBNSF said in a statement that its internal police force shares information with local law enforcement and prosecutors as appropriate.\n\nThe company said its crews are instructed not to confront thieves, but to report the incidents instead. But the crews rarely encounter them, it said, because the trains are so long and the thieves take care to evade detection.\n\nIn Lewis\u2019 experience, the thefts tend to ebb and flow, often tied to the release of a desirable new product. In December, investigators saw a rash of thefts in which smart vacuum cleaners were stolen from train containers, Lewis said.\n\nIn the Jan. 13 heist, stolen cases of Nikes hurled from the train were later picked up by trucks, the federal complaint states. County and state law enforcement officers were able to catch up with the vehicles with the help of tracking devices that were inside some of the boxes. Eleven people were arrested and charged with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. Nine were found to be Mexican citizens in the U.S. illegally, prosecutors said. Three were charged with illegal reentry after removal and six with improper entry. Five defendants have pleaded not guilty; six have yet to enter pleas, according to a court docket.\n\nIn another case, a BNSF train came to an emergency stop near Hackberry, Ariz., on Nov. 20 after it started losing air, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Mohave County stopped a white panel van seen leaving the area and found about 180 pairs of then-unreleased Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers valued at $41,400, the complaint states. The driver pleaded not guilty to possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment.\n\nAnd in yet another BNSF train burglary near Yampai, Ariz., on Dec. 6, investigators recovered about $48,000 worth of then-unreleased Nike Dunk Low Midnight Navy sneakers, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court charging four people with possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment. Three have pleaded not guilty, with one set for a change of plea hearing to plead guilty, and one has yet to enter a plea, according to the case docket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators also recovered a combined total of $346,200 worth of then-unreleased Nike Air Jordans following two BNSF train burglaries in April and June, according to documents filed in Phoenix federal court.\n\nTwo other cases in which BNSF freight trains were burglarized near Kingman and Seligman, Ariz., last year resulted in the theft of $612,000 worth of Nikes and eight arrests, according to federal criminal complaints. In the Kingman case, five defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges of possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment, according to the case docket. Details involving the Seligman case have been filed under seal.\n\nThe stolen merchandise is usually transported to California to be sold or offered for sale online via third-party Amazon and EBay resellers, Cooke said in affidavits filed with several of those cases.\n\nBoth Amazon and EBay said in statements that they have zero tolerance for criminal activity on their platforms, and that they work with law enforcement to support prosecutions against people who sell stolen goods.\n\nThe court documents show that the thefts have continued even with the arrest last June of a man authorities have described as a ringleader. Felipe Arturo Avalos-Mejia, known as Pollo, allegedly used scouts to help him select which trains to target, supplied vehicles for and paid burglary crews and facilitated the sale of stolen merchandise, according to a complaint filed in the Phoenix federal court.\n\nInvestigators said he lived in Los Angeles, operated out of both Los Angeles and Phoenix and is believed to have been involved in BNSF train thefts for more than 11 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 20, California local law enforcement agencies and Homeland Security agents executed search warrants at 11 residences and 16 storage units related to the ongoing train burglaries, arresting 43 suspects and recovering from the storage units about $3 million worth of merchandise believed to have been stolen from BNSF trains, according to the complaint. More merchandise \u2014 including numerous boxes of stolen Nike shoes \u2014 were allegedly recovered from the home of a woman who said she had a romantic relationship with Avalos-Mejia, the complaint states.\n\nAvalos-Mejia initially evaded authorities, court documents state. Investigators said they recovered from the location where he fled 74 cases of stolen Nikes, 108 packs of socks and 35 pairs of shoes worth about $94,659, as well as 10 stolen vehicles believed to have been used in prior BNSF train burglaries.\n\nAvalos-Mejia was taken into custody June 21 at a restaurant in Huntington Park along with another man, who was carrying a Louis Vuitton bag with $120,000 in cash and a detailed ledger listing Nike and other merchandise burglarized from BNSF trains alongside dollar amounts detailing its worth, according to the complaint.\n\nAvalos-Mejia has pleaded not guilty to possessing or receiving goods stolen from interstate shipment, and his trial is scheduled to get underway in June, the case docket states. His lawyers couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nLocal law enforcement authorities are also involved in train theft investigations. San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s deputies are looking into possible connections between recent burglaries in Arizona and two heists in the desert ghost town of Amboy, in which $436,000 worth of Nike merchandise was stolen from BNSF trains.\n\nIn the first, on Jan. 10, BNSF police asked San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s deputies for help responding to the burglary, the Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a news release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn their way to the train line, deputies saw an unmarked box truck driving through Wonder Valley, an unincorporated community outside Twentynine Palms. They conducted a traffic stop and found $18,000 worth of Nike shoes that had been stolen from the train, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nDeputies arrested the occupants of the box truck \u2014 Jose Villalobos-Infante, 45, of Phoenix, and Oscar Sosa, 28, of Apple Valley, who were allegedly headed to Los Angeles with the stolen merchandise, according to the complaint.\n\nVillalobos-Infante and Sosa have pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree burglary, conspiracy and grand theft that were filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court.\n\nFive days later, BNSF police again contacted the Sheriff\u2019s Department to ask for help responding to a freight train that was being burglarized by multiple people in Amboy, according to a news release from the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nAs deputies traveled to the scene, they tried to stop an unmarked white van driving in Wonder Valley, but it sped off, sparking a pursuit, the release states. The van got stuck on a sand berm and its two occupants ran off, investigators said. Deputies, with the help of a Sheriff\u2019s Department helicopter, caught up with and arrested two boys, 16 and 17. Their identities were not released because they are minors, and the San Bernardino County district attorney\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on whether charges were filed against the two teens.\n\nThe same night, deputies saw another vehicle they believed to be related to the crime and broadcast its information over the dispatch system. California Highway Patrol later stopped the vehicle in Landers, but its driver fled on foot and remains at large, the Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators recovered 218 cases of Nike products worth $418,000, the Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\n\nTimes researchers Cary Schneider and Scott Wilson contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Nike will partner with Kim Kardashian's Skims to launch NikeSkims womenswear brand.\n\nThe collaboration aims to enhance Nike's appeal to female athletes and consumers.\n\nLike the Jordan brand, NikeSkims is intended to be a long-term partnership.\n\nNike is extending its brand lineup through a rare partnership with Kim Kardashian's Skims. It's a bet that her star power can have a similar impact as Michael Jordan has on the sportswear giant \u2014 for women.\n\nThe two companies announced NikeSkims on Tuesday, a line of training apparel, footwear and accessories for women. While Nike regularly partners with athletes and celebrities for limited-edition sportswear, this seems a step up from that typical collaboration.\n\nIt's the first time Nike has partnered with an existing external company to create a brand. It's a \"win-win\" for both companies, Rachel Wolff, retail analyst at Business Insider's sister company EMARKETER, said.\n\nAs Nike pushes ahead with its play for appealing to all genders by upping its bets in female athletes, a deal with a womenswear superpower like Skims will fuel its \"gender offense,\" as CEO Elliott Hill called it during a recent earnings call. The long-term deal, which neither company revealed the financial details of, marks the beginning of a womenswear-specific brand intended to exist alongside Jordan, Nike, and Converse.\n\nIt does, however, call to mind Nike's biggest partnership yet \u2014 with Michael Jordan. In 1984, the popular basketball player inked a deal with Nike for $500,000 a year, plus royalties, Forbes reported. They introduced the world to Air Jordans the following year with the release of the Air Jordan 1 sneaker.\n\nAs the sneakers grew in popularity, it extended beyond basketball shoes to include streetwear. Today, Jordan himself has a $3.5 billion net worth, and Nike paid him some $260 million before tax over its past fiscal year, per Forbes.\n\nForty years later, the Jordan brand is still a revenue driver for the company. It brought in approximately $6.9 billion in wholesale equivalent revenue for fiscal 2024 \u2014 about 17% of Nike's total wholesale equivalent sales.\n\nLike it used Jordan's massive popularity decades ago, Kardashian's global influence and more than 350 million Instagram followers will be a valuable boost in visibility for Nike. She cofounded Skims in 2019 as a shapewear brand before expanding into loungewear, and it has boomed in size, reaching a $4 billion valuation in 2023.\n\n\"Nike has the opportunity to capitalize on Skims' intense popularity among women consumers, who are an important target audience for the athletic brand, while Skims gets access to a much larger group of consumers as well as Nike's manufacturing capabilities,\" Wolff said.\n\nNike representatives directed BI to a press release in response to a request for comment. Skims did not immediately respond.\n\nThe two brands have been working on NikeSkims since 2023, the New York Times reported. Skims CEO Jens Grede drew parallels between Skims and Nike in October 2024, but experts seemed hesitant to agree at the time.\n\nWhile Nike has become a brand that can sell \"a lot of things to a lot of people,\" as BMO analyst Simeon Siegel put it, others have said Skims' proximity to Kardashian could be a problem.\n\n\"Skims is not likely to be a 'for everyone' brand because there are going to be people who don't want the association with Kim Kardashian,\" Matthew Quint, director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School, said in October.\n\nHowever, it's hard not to think of Kardashian \"as the Michael Jordan of influencers,\" Grede told NYT. Her net worth, as estimated by Forbes before the deal, is $1.7 billion.\n\nNikeSkims is expected to launch this spring with a global expansion planned for 2026. Skims' power to attract consumers was demonstrated in its collaboration with outerwear brand The North Face, which sold out within hours of launching on December 10, Women's Wear Daily reported.",

It certainly speaks to the gorpcore crowd, but historically speaking, sneakerheads tend to favor OGs more than spinoff models. Additionally, considering the model\u2019s $160 price tag and likeminded \u201cDrift\u201d versions of the Air Max Plus and Air Max 90, it\u2019s proven hard for the Pegasus Wave to stand out in a crowded field.\n\nAs the model passes six months on shelves, Nike is touching down with a \u201cLight Orewood Brown\u201d colorway with \u201cAshen Slate\u201d detailing. The TPU cage structure features a subtle gradient, the toe cap is comprised of hairy suede, and padded canvas covers the tongue and toe box. Rope laces make their usual appearance, and wide mesh stretches down from the collar to the quarter; just barely peeking through the rib-inspired cutouts. This is probably the most lifestyle-focused Pegasus Wave we\u2019ve seen thus far, with preceding colorways favoring more vibrant, sporty makeups reminiscent of 2000s runners.\n\nThe Pegasus Wave \u201cLight Orewood Brown\u201d carries the usual $160 shelf price and will arrive in men\u2019s sizes for Spring/Summer 2025.

Originally worn by Booker in March 2024, the Nike Book 1 colored to resemble the Nike ACG Air Mowabb \u201cTwine\u201d is set to hit stores a year later.\n\nLike many of the player exclusives worn by Booker, the styling of this Nike Book 1 is inspired by one of the brand\u2019s iconic designs from the past. Playing into Booker\u2019s love of the great outdoors, the shoe gets its colors from one of Nike\u2019s most memorable All Conditions Gear sneakers, the ACG Air Mowabb.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nNike ACG Air Mowabb \u2018Twine\u2019 2021 release.\n\nOriginally designed by Tinker Hatfield in 1991, the ACG Air Mowabb used an inner bootie reminiscent of the brand\u2019s Air Huarache line and was released in a number of 1990s-styled color combinations. The specific style that inspired the Nike Book 1 is the \u201cTwine\u201d ACG Air Mowabb, which was last released in 2021 and combines shades of Twine, Fusion Red, Club Gold and Teal Charge.\n\nShifting to the \u201cMowabb\u201d Nike Book 1, the exact color names have been adjusted, but there\u2019s no doubting the inspiration behind this upcoming release. Its colorway is \u201cSesame/Black/Bright Mandarin/Smoke Grey/Dusty Cactus/White,\u201d which results in an overall look that is slightly more toned-down than its bold \u201890s inspiration.\n\nNike Book 1 \u2018Mowabb\u2019 (lateral).\n\nAlong with the upcoming \u201cMowabb\u201d and \u201cNeon\u201d styles turning from exclusives to retail releases, Nike has treated fans to a Cortez-inspired version of the Book 1 which uses the colors of the sneaker featured in the iconic film Forrest Gump.\n\nThis latest Nike Book 1 \u201cMowabb\u201d is currently expected to be released in March for a retail price of $140, although it\u2019s yet to appear on Nike\u2019s SNKRS platform.

His Air Force 1s, vivid in hue and pattern, mirrored this approach.\n\nThose sneakers were also a reflection of Tisci's personal style. Even prior to his first Nike collaboration in 2014, Tisci was rarely seen wearing any shoes other than Nike AF1s. \"It feels like the shoes have become part of me, part of my body,\" he once said.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.

It'd be pretty unlike Tisci to not release some sort of collaborative Nike shoe, after all.\n\nAn Air Force 1, perhaps?",

            "content": "Moneyball analysis shows why Nike's financial metrics and valuation look compelling for investors.\n\nNike (NKE -1.35%) dominates the global athletic footwear and apparel market as one of the world's most recognizable brands. Let's examine how this sportswear giant performs according to Moneyball's AI-powered analysis system.\n\nHow Moneyball Works: AI-Assisted Investment Scores\n\nMoneyball combines artificial intelligence with expert analysis to evaluate companies across multiple dimensions. The system analyzes various metrics including financial performance, technology implementation, product strength, and leadership quality to generate objective scores that help investors make more informed decisions.\n\nBreaking Down Nike's Scores\n\nNike's Superscore of 74/100 reflects its strong market position and financial performance. Return on unleveraged net tangible assets (ROUNTA) is a metric Warren Buffett favors for measuring efficiency in generating returns from physical assets. Nike's ROUNTA of 27.4% demonstrates impressive efficiency in utilizing its physical assets to generate returns.\n\nNike's Moneyball Scorecard:\n\nSuperscore: 74/100\n\nFinancial: 84/100\n\nTechnology: 75/100\n\nProduct: 76/100\n\nLeadership: 49/100\n\nAI Implementation: 51/100\n\nSurge: 44/100\n\nGARP: 93/100\n\nROUNTA: 27.4%\n\nStandout Metrics and Areas for Growth\n\nNike's standout Financial score of 84/100 and Product score of 76/100 reflect its market dominance and branding excellence. However, the Leaders score of 49/100 highlights where the company has lagged in recent years.\n\nThe return of Elliott Hill -- a longtime Nike executive for 32 years -- as CEO in October 2024 gives room for optimism that this weak leadership score can improve as Hill executes the company's mini-turnaround of sorts in the quarters ahead. Whether Hill can successfully navigate Nike's resurgence will be key for investors.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nNike's Technology score of 75/100 and AI Implementation score of 51/100 indicate the company is maintaining competitive technological capabilities while having opportunities to further enhance its AI integration.\n\nDespite its operational stumbles over the past several years, Nike is still a cash machine -- generating more than $5.5 billion in free cash flow annually and with $739 million in net cash on the balance sheet. This gives the company a war chest to invest in its tech and AI capabilities to bolster its brand and competitive advantage.\n\nWhat These Scores Mean for Investors\n\nNike's strong financial metrics and product scores represent solid fundamentals, while the high GARP (growth at a reasonable price) score of 93/100 suggests the stock may be attractively valued relative to its growth prospects. Nike shares trade at a free cash flow yield of 4.8% -- a historically attractive valuation for the stock.\n\nGiven these factors and Nike's relatively strong Moneyball scores, I believe the stock is well positioned to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years.",

            "content": "Ever since 2018, the popular collaboration between Nike and designer Riccardo Tisci had been dormant \u2014 until today. However, the first product from the reignited partnership departs from the series of sneakers previously offered for a $500 USD leather handbag called \u201cThe Mercer Bag.\u201d\n\nSurfacing as part of Nike\u2019s SS25 lineup, the Italian-made bag is understated in comparison with Tisci\u2019s tenures at Givenchy and Burberry, with a full body of solid-colored black pebble leather. Nike\u2019s logo adorns the front flap with a subtle debossed application, while Tisci\u2019s metal R.T. wordmark is fixed to the corner of the bag and the strap. Elsewhere, golden hardware facilitates easy removal and adjustment of the matching strap.\n\nTisci and Nike inaugurated their partnership in 2014 with an Air Force 1 collection boasting jacquard ankle straps. Later, they released reinterpretations of the Nike Air Cast 1 and NikeLab Dunk Lux High, Flyknit sneakers and an Air Zoom Legend boot. Their most recent collaboration took place in 2018 with the release of a mid-top Air Max 97 and an Air Force 1 High.\n\nThough quiet in its sensibilities, the sudden pivot to a luxury bag for their first collaboration in seven years speaks to how the industry, and particularly the menswear market has evolved since 2018. While sneakers continue drive interest from younger consumers, the last few years have shown increased spending on luxury bags. Luxury resale platform The RealReal\u2019s 2024 report showed that searches for men\u2019s handbags grew 900% year-over-year last year, a shift that has steadily taken shape as men have warmed up to sporting luxury bags.\n\nAt the same time, Nike has struggled to generate interest with the overexposure of highly-sought sneakers and \u201clack of innovation\u201d cited by many. The sports gear titan also recently announced a joint label with Kim Kardashian\u2018s shapewear line, NikeSKIMS, aiming to further connect with female consumers.\n\nPerhaps the sudden release of the Mercer Bag can also be seen as part of a strategy to cast a wider net, while simultaneously gaining from the luxury price point. Nike made a similar move in its collaboration with French designer Jacquemus, creating a Swoosh-shaped handbag, now selling for $400 USD at the Nike web store. It\u2019s possible that this is just the start of a hybrid-luxe strategy emerging from the Oregon-based company.\n\nWhile stockist information is sparse, Nike and Riccardo Tisci\u2019s new Mercer Bag is set for release on March 1 at select retailers. Stay tuned to Hypebeast for updates on the handbag release and a potentially larger collection in the works.",

            "content": "Even if you're just a casual sports fan, you've probably heard of Caitlin Clark. The basketball star shattered records in college in scoring, three-pointers, and assists, among other categories, and has dazzled fans in her rookie year in the WNBA, bringing a surge of attention and record audiences to women's basketball, much like Tiger Woods did in golf a generation ago.\n\nArguably, Clark is the biggest female athlete since Serena Williams, and she's gotten more interest on Alphabet's Google over the last year than Lebron James or Steph Curry. Her brand has extended beyond basketball and into pop culture, as she's appeared on Saturday Night Live in a Weekend Update segment and was dressed by Prada for the WNBA draft, the first time the luxury brand took such a step for the NBA or WNBA draft. In the meantime, she's set records for attendance and merchandise sales in what's become known as the Caitlin Clark effect.\n\nIn other words, her marketability is self-evident.\n\nNike (NYSE: NKE), the world's largest sportswear company, was smart enough to sign an endorsement deal with Clark. First, it did a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal with her in 2022 when she was in college. Then, this April, it signed her to an eight-year, $28 million contract ahead of her debut in the WNBA. But what the company has done with her since then is a head-scratcher.\n\nA person shopping for sneakers in a store.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNike's airball\n\nNike won a bidding war against rivals like Under Armour, Adidas, and Puma to team up with Clark. But since then, the Swoosh has done almost nothing with Clark, despite her superstardom and the attention around her rookie season.\n\nNike hasn't produced a commercial featuring Clark or included her in a marketing campaign. Reportedly, Clark's signature shoe, which was part of the deal, won't be released until 2026 because Nike wants to prioritize A'ja Wilson's shoe, the reigning MVP. On social media, some fans took note that Nike didn't even bother posting to congratulate Clark on winning Rookie of the Year.\n\nIt's unclear why Nike has chosen to ignore what's arguably the sports story of the year, but politics seem to play a role. Other WNBA stars have been resentful of the attention Clark received even before she played in a single WNBA game.\n\nBy contrast to the delay with Clark's shoe, Lebron James wore his signature Nike sneaker in his first NBA game in 2003 and had a TV commercial to go with it. Michael Jordan, meanwhile, donned his debut signature shoe just a few weeks into his rookie season in 1984.\n\nA familiar problem\n\nNike stock has plunged since its peak in 2021, as a strategic shift under outgoing CEO John Donahoe has backfired. Many of Nike's challenges seem to stem from the same issue it's facing with Caitlin Clark: ignoring customers.\n\nMuch of the transformation under Donahoe was built around Nike transitioning from primarily a wholesaler to primarily a direct-to-consumer brand. That shift made sense in some ways, as it gave Nike more control of its brand and image and allowed it to earn larger gross margins. But more importantly, it was not in customers' best interests.\n\nIt turns out that pulling back from retail partners like Foot Locker alienated Nike customers who shop there and simultaneously gave an opportunity to upstart rivals like On Holding and Deckers' Hoka brand to gain valuable shelf space. That's part of the reason they are growing much faster than Nike and rapidly taking market share from it in running.\n\nSimilarly, ignoring the Caitlin Clark mania is clearly not giving customers what they want, as many would be lining up for Clark's first shoe if it were available. Delaying it is to the clear detriment of the business, especially when Nike desperately needs a catalyst to turn the business around as it's forecasting a decline in sales for the current fiscal year. A resonating ad campaign around Clark could be just what Nike needs to create a halo effect for the larger brand and help it return to growth.\n\nHill's priority?\n\nElliott Hill will take over as Nike CEO on Oct. 14. The longtime company veteran, who's coming out of retirement for the position, will have his work cut out for him since Nike is struggling on multiple fronts.\n\nBut an easy way for Hill to engender some goodwill among Nike's customer base, tap a massive market of female athletes and fans, and hearken a new era for the brand is to put Clark center stage where she belongs.\n\nThe next WNBA season won't begin until May, but that should give Nike's new management team time to formulate a compelling strategy around Clark and get her signature shoe out by next season.\n\nDoing so would be a slam dunk for the brand, for Nike stock, and for Clark.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nike wasn\u2019t one of them.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nDTC online rug brand Ruggable has named Nicole Otto its new chief executive officer. Otto assumed the role in January, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nOtto spent 16 years climbing the corporate ladder at Nike, eventually overseeing the brand\u2019s North American direct-to-consumer business. In that role, Otto was responsible for the company's direct business lines, including Nike Digital, Nike Stores and Nike Factory Stores throughout the U.S. and Canada, per LinkedIn.\n\nOtto most recently served as global brand president for The North Face and was previously a senior advisory consultant with McKinsey & Company.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFounded by Jeneva Bell in 2017, the privately held Ruggable has been operating without a CEO for two years.\n\nOtto replaces Nathan Baldwin, a spokesperson confirmed. Baldwin served as CEO from 2018 until 2023, according to LinkedIn. That same year, Ruggable laid off 100 corporate employees as part of an \u201cinternal restructuring.\u201d The company did not respond to questions about whether Baldwin left as part of that restructuring and who ran the brand in the interim.\n\nAt the time, the company cited a challenging economic environment as a reason to downsize the business. A number of other DTC, venture-backed companies were experiencing the same stagnant growth and also made cuts to their staff around that time.\n\nNicole Otto previously led Nike\u2019s direct-to-consumer business in North America. Courtesy of Ruggable\n\n\u201cThe environment for DTC firms is still challenging,\u201d Neil Saunders, GlobalData Managing Director, said in an email. \u201cCompetition is intense and consumer demand is more subdued than it was during the heyday of DTC. Firms are still having to spend a lot on marketing and customer acquisition, so profitability can be elusive. That said, a lot of surviving DTC firms have worked through some of their issues as they try to demonstrate a pathway to profitability.\u201d\n\nFollowing its cuts to employee overhead in early 2023, Ruggable expanded its product assortment and international presence. The brand added over 1,000 designs to its machine-washable rug collection and expanded the DTC online business overseas by opening its first facility in the U.K.\n\nWith the appointment of Otto, the brand is eyeing growth. Otto said in a statement she is focused on expanding the brand and strengthening connections with shoppers.\n\n\u201cNicole shares our vision to redefine the future of home textiles and deliver on our mission to fill every home with design-forward, innovative products that spark joy,\u201d Bell said in a statement. \u201cWith her global and omnichannel expansion experience, we're confident that she will successfully lead Ruggable through its next phase of growth over the coming years.\u201d",

            "content": "Sonny Vaccaro is considered one of basketball\u2019s ultimate insiders and was re-introduced to a new generation through the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck 2023 film \u2018\u2019Air.\u2019\u2019 Collaborating with Emmy-winning and best-selling author Armen Keteyian, Vaccaro\u2019s new memoir, \u2018\u2019Legends and Soles,\u2019\u2019 provides an unvarnished look at the role Vaccaro played in Michael Jordan\u2019s ascent to the world\u2019s most famous and richest athlete, as well as his far-reaching impact throughout the basketball world. Here\u2019s how to pre-order the book.\n\nMy first introduction to Michael Jordan took place in Los Angeles just before the 1984 Summer Olympics during the pre-Olympic training camp. The U.S. men\u2019s team was practicing on the West Coast at the time, and it couldn\u2019t have been more than a week or 10 days from their first game against China on July 29 at the Forum in Inglewood.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have been able to contact Michael directly, so I asked George Raveling if he could introduce us. Raveling was one of three assistant coaches on the Olympic basketball team and the head coach at Iowa. I had known George for nearly 20 years, dating back to the Roundball Classic, the nation\u2019s first high school all-star game. We were so close he had stood as the best man at my wedding to Pam three months earlier at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. George had attended the Olympic tryouts and witnessed the roster cut from the initial three dozen candidates down to 20, and then to the final 16. It was a team so rich in talent that future Hall of Famers Charles Barkley and John Stockton didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nA lunch was set at Tony Roma\u2019s rib place in Santa Monica. This would be the first and perhaps only opportunity I\u2019d have to demonstrate to Michael the size and seriousness of the commitment Nike was ready to make to him. Just talk, nothing on paper. The whole thing was hush-hush because the Olympic team\u2019s head coach was Bobby Knight, known for his quick temper and low tolerance for outside distractions. Had he known Raveling was arranging for one of the players to meet with a shoe company representative, he might well have fired him on the spot.\n\n6 Sonny Vaccaro (l.) and Michael Jordan (r.) talk at a Nike party with Jordan\u2019s mom Deloris sitting across the table. Sonny and Pam Vaccaro personal collection\n\nThe meeting itself would never have taken place had it been anyone else at Nike making such a request. David Falk, Jordan\u2019s agent, would never have allowed his firm\u2019s new client \u2014 who had decided to turn pro early \u2014 to meet anyone without being present, and I firmly believe he had no idea this clandestine lunch was taking place. George wouldn\u2019t have consented to bring Jordan to a meeting with anybody but me. Even at George\u2019s urging, Michael would not have gone to Santa Monica to meet just any marketing guy, regardless of the brand.\n\nJordan knew who I was from the Roundball and college basketball, even though we had never met.\n\nRudy Washington, a friend from the Roundball days and an assistant coach at USC, kindly agreed to drive Jordan over from the team hotel to the restaurant where George would meet up with us.\n\nI was already seated when Rudy led Michael past a row of booths to the table. George followed them in and, after we hugged, introduced me to Michael.\n\n\u201cSonny,\u201d he said, \u201cmeet Mr. Michael Jordan.\u201d\n\nJordan seemed a bit reticent. Still, we shook hands and I hugged him hello, too. I thanked him for making the effort and taking the time to meet with me. Washington, who had brought along a friend, excused himself to dine in another room at the restaurant.\n\nOver a meal of baby back ribs, an onion ring loaf, and a round of soft drinks, we small-talked about basketball, how George and I knew each other, and also how I hadn\u2019t chosen Jordan for the Roundball Classic. In truth, none of the dozens of coaches and local scouts in my nationwide network had touted Michael to me. He didn\u2019t have a Chicago/Philadelphia/LA/New York City reputation. Our major stars, Patrick Ewing and A.C. Green, were far and away better known as America\u2019s top prep players in 1981. Although Jordan had been selected for the McDonald\u2019s All American Game, he wasn\u2019t even the North Carolina Player of the Year that year; a 6-foot-4 sharpshooting guard named Buzz Peterson, another UNC recruit from Asheville, N.C., had won it.\n\nAs the meal moved on, Michael\u2019s reticence subsided and we settled into an easy rapport as I began explaining the dimensions of the package he could expect.\n\nGeorge listened intently, but never uttered a word.\n\nI knew Michael would take what I was about to say seriously, since I was already the face of Nike basketball and Nike\u2019s presence had grown dramatically in recent years. He understood the importance of our meeting.\n\n6 Michael Jordan (l.) and Sonny Vaccaro (r.) at a Nike Party. Sonny and Pam Vaccaro personal collection\n\nLooking him straight in the eye, I laid out our vision and made our position clear: Nike wanted Michael. I told him that no other company his agent had spoken with would be putting more money and resources behind him. No one was going to make him the centerpiece of their brand marketing the way we would.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t hurt that around Los Angeles the atmosphere was crackling with Nike\u2019s \u201cI Love LA\u201d campaign created by marketing director Rob Strasser, creative director Peter Moore and Chiat/Day advertising. Nike was not the official shoe sponsor of the 1984 US Olympic team \u2014 Converse was \u2014 but in pure renegade style, Nike had hijacked the airwaves and mindset. Freeway billboards \u2014 even the sides of entire buildings \u2014 featuring pictures of Oakland Raiders cornerback Lester Hayes, Olympic sprinter Carl Lewis, Dodgers star Pedro Guerrero and tennis great John McEnroe were ubiquitous in spreading Swoosh imagery everywhere. The world\u2019s Olympic moment was Nike\u2019s \u201cI Love LA\u201d focal point.\n\nI made clear how you couldn\u2019t go anywhere without seeing Nike\u2019s marketing power in plain sight.\n\n\u201cThat kind of firepower will be behind you,\u201d I told him. We spoke of a signature shoe envisioned by Strasser and Moore, custom designed for him, which would be vastly different from anything else in the NBA, plus a complete line of apparel and products emblazoned with the Jordan name, and \u2014 not inconsequentially \u2014 how he would have a percentage of every shoe sold.\n\n\u201cMichael, you\u2019ll be a partner in the business,\u201d I said, sketching out a vision of the future and a package of star perks that no other company would even consider.\n\nAnd I made him this solemn promise: \u201cI will never lie to you \u2014 not about what I said today or about anything we might do in the future.\u201d\n\n6 From left: Howard White, Michael Jordan, Sonny Vaccaro and Sonny\u2019s wife Pam at dinner in Paris in August 1990. Sonny and Pam Vaccaro personal collection\n\nKids who played for Dean Smith knew when they were being told the truth \u2014 Smith was a man revered for his unassailable integrity. Though I did most of the talking, I could see in Michael\u2019s face that he was filing away every last detail. Falk had probably already told him at least four companies were interested, but I\u2019m not sure he expected the kind of deal I had laid out.\n\nStill, this was just the opening hand; to his credit, Michael wasn\u2019t hiding any of his cards.\n\nHe told me up front, \u201cI\u2019ll listen, Mr. Vaccaro, but you should know, I\u2019ll probably sign with Adidas. I\u2019ve never worn Nikes. If Adidas even comes close, I\u2019m going with them.\u201d\n\nI had assumed his bias would be in favor of Converse and was caught off guard by his personal preference for Adidas. But Michael was unequivocal in stating his admiration and preference for the brand\u2019s shoes and clothing. He was taken with their craftsmanship, European leather, and continental styling. He considered their product line \u201cclassy,\u201d especially after wearing Converse\u2019s old-school utilitarian gear during his entire time at Carolina and years before. More than once he repeated, \u201cI\u2019ve never been in anything Nike.\u201d\n\nThe contract highlights and Nike pitch were important, of course, but that was only half the purpose of the meeting.\n\nWhat about Jordan the person? His personality? His persona? The answers came easy: self-assured and smart. Though soft spoken, he was clear and direct with an easy laugh. His confidence and personal bearing were powerful, and I took an immediate liking to him.\n\n6 \u201cLegends and Soles: The Memoir of an American Original\u201d released on Feb. 25, 2025. HarperCollins\n\nRoma\u2019s was only a first-time lunch, but the young star and I had an effortless connection. I had interacted with a thousand young athletes from grassroots events and college basketball. I knew when the rapport was genuine.\n\nThe only hint of dissonance and caution in the whole conversation was Nike, the company. He wasn\u2019t \u201canti\u201d per se; he just had no frame of reference. At the time, Nike was a running and track shoe company to much of the world.\n\nAs we finished up, I turned to Michael and said, \u201cLook, just keep an open mind. That\u2019s all I ask. I\u2019ll send you a couple of pairs of Nikes. Not the custom kind we\u2019ll make for you, but you give \u2019em a try.\u201d\n\nI knew I had piqued his curiosity. And I\u2019d given this soon-to-be-rookie a rock-solid package and talking points he could also use to bargain for a better deal with Adidas.\n\nStanding out front on Santa Monica Boulevard, I hugged both Michael and George goodbye. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Adidas isn\u2019t going to come close to what Nike is putting on the table,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut if they do, it was still great meeting you, young man. God bless.\u201d\n\nHeading back home along Lincoln Boulevard, I had a good feeling. I knew Adidas wasn\u2019t going to approve a contract bigger than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s for a rookie who had yet to play in a single NBA game, no matter how infatuated he was with their brand. And Jordan having played most of his life in Converse gear \u2014 he\u2019d been wearing their shoes on national TV for the last three years \u2014 it was possible they\u2019d make a play too.\n\nWhen I called Strasser to fill him in on my impressions, he was also surprised by Michael\u2019s affinity for Adidas. He could have believed it if Jordan had been a track or soccer star, but basketball? I understood where the quality angle was coming from and explained it as well as I could: \u201cThis is about more than the money, Rob. Jordan doesn\u2019t know Nike from \u2018Schmike.\u2019\n\n6 A close-up look at Michael Jordan wearing his Nike Air Jordan shoes.

If we don\u2019t go all in, his shoes are gonna have three stripes on \u2019em in October.\u201d\n\nAnd if we did get him to another meeting, Strasser and Moore would need to put on a presentation unlike anything they\u2019d ever done before.\n\nWe hung up, with Strasser saying he had to go down the hall to share the news with Knight.\n\nA meeting was set with Falk at L\u2019Ermitage hotel in Beverly Hills, where the Nike contingent had been staying during the Games, to officially lay out the terms of the deal.\n\nFalk was keenly aware Strasser had moved the goalposts to construct an unequaled deal for his client. An all-encompassing package like no contract the company had ever offered an individual athlete. Eye-popping, incentivized, and guaranteed.\n\nSince I was the only person from Nike that had actually met Michael, Strasser thought it would be a good idea to have me in the room. And I already knew Falk from negotiating Georgetown coach John Thompson\u2019s singular Nike agreement a couple of years earlier.\n\nStrasser was the only one presenting. The contract structure and the main terms were already handwritten in marker on his customary easel set up at the far end of the room \u2014 figures, timelines, bonuses. One by one, he reviewed each item. I\u2019d done my share of negotiations with universities and coaches, but those were far less intricate than this five-year deal \u2014 one that would make Jordan one of the world\u2019s richest athletes at that time.\n\nThe terms: a signing bonus of $200,000; a base guarantee of $250,000 a year for five years, with a $25,000 bump each year thereafter; a 20-cent-per-pair royalty on a Jordan line of shoes; and $1 million in Year 1 in marketing and advertising.\n\nThe official shoe name: Air Jordan.\n\nCheck, check, check, check.\n\n6 Michael Jordan playing for the Bulls while wearing his Nike Air Jordans. Getty Images\n\nOne by one the details were agreed to by the affable Strasser and the canny Falk, who knew he was sitting on a gold mine.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Falk. \u201cThank you for putting together a solid offer, Mr. Strasser.\u201d\n\nHandshakes.\n\n\u201cNow let me just make a quick call, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nNaturally, our offer would be leveraged to his client\u2019s benefit with our competitors \u2014 especially one in particular.\n\nFalk left the room, presumably to make a call. Less than 90 seconds later, he returned and suggested a couple of changes to the deal.\n\n\u201cNothing major,\u201d he assured us.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Strasser commented, only half joking. \u201cWe shook hands two minutes ago, and you\u2019re changing the deal already?\u201d\n\nFalk requested a larger signing bonus: $250,000 instead of $200,000, with a base guarantee of $300,000 up from a quarter million.\n\nIn exchange, he was willing to accept a lower royalty amount, 10 cents per pair instead of 20. Falk wanted a larger cash outlay up front, with a smaller royalty on each pair of Jordans.\n\nStrasser, with a mind that could crunch numbers in milliseconds, jumped at the revised terms.\n\n\u201cWe can do that.\u201d\n\nTaking more up-front cash and lowering the royalty \u2014 \u201cFalk\u2019s Folly,\u201d as Strasser called it \u2014 would cost Jordan millions of dollars in revenue. Obviously, Falk didn\u2019t think Nike would sell a record $125 million worth of shoes in Year 1. Frankly, none of us could have envisioned the record-shattering sales Air Jordan would generate for Nike.\n\nBefore we could get Michael up to Oregon, we still needed Knight\u2019s final final blessing. He was often known to be mercurial \u2014 it was never final until it was final.\n\nIf Jordan didn\u2019t turn out to be everything I\u2019d laid my job on the line for, Knight was certain to make me pay up.\n\nExcerpted from \u201cLegends and Soles: The Memoir of an American Original.\u201d Reprinted with the permission of the publisher, HarperOne, an imprint of HarperCollins. \u201cLegends and Soles\u201d goes on sale Tuesday, Feb. 25.\n\nCopyrighted \u00a9 2025 by Sonny Vaccaro.",

So look, maybe you don\u2019t care about Foamposites and maybe you don\u2019t care that a very special pair is coming back today.\n\nBut if you do care\u2026\n\nWhew. Who\u2019d have thought we\u2019d see the day? Today, on this day that by my approximation somehow isn\u2019t a national holiday or a holy landmark in any world religion, sneakerheads are being blessed from above. There are no gods responsible, no pantheon of mythic figureheads demanding fruits and meat burned at an altar in exchange for the return of this colorway. No, this is a gift from the stars, from the skies, from another world. This is the Galaxy Foamposite, one of the most notorious sneakers of the 21st century.\n\nNike\u2019s original Galaxy Pack and dropped way back in 2012 to commemorate NBA All-Star Weekend, long the high point of the year in sneakers. A selection of out-of-this-world takes on basketball silhouettes were released in the pack, including the KD4 and a particularly dope pair of LeBron 9s.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to hear me talk about LeBron. You\u2019re not here to read about the KD4 (you probably weren\u2019t there to buy it, either\u2014the shoe got retro\u2019d last year and sat on shelves for weeks). You\u2019re here to read about the Foamposites. So let\u2019s talk about the Foamposites.\n\nThe centerpiece of the pack was an immediate first-ballot Hall of Fame sneaker colorway, one that depicted a hazy spread of stars and nebula across deep space, a radical portrait of the galaxy above us. The shoe\u2019s glow-in-the-dark green soles provided a finishing touch on an absolute work of art, a shoe designed to look like it came from the future finally ascending to its purpose. This isn\u2019t a sneaker, it\u2019s a Star Trek movie. It\u2019s for sure better than Nemesis, at least.\n\n2012 was pre-SNKRS, pre-StockX, pre-resale as we understand it today. This was a time when folks would still camp out in front of Foot Lockers for a chance at a pair of kicks they needed to add to their arsenals and boy, did they ever line the hell up for the Galaxy Foams. Too many people, in fact, lined up for the Galaxy Foams. It got dicey. It got dubious, it got violent. Some stores cancelled their release of the shoes, sending everybody home unhappy. The pairs that made it out into the world hit sneaker forum for-sale sections and eBay alike. The prices were steep, but so were the offers\u2014one dude said in exchange for a pair of the shoes he\u2019d trade a lucky buyer a used car. A car, a functioning automobile. You could use one of those to drive to a national park at night and see the galaxy for yourself, but you can\u2019t lace up the Milky Way.",

            "content": "Sonny Vaccaro has plenty to say in memoir covering his remarkable career\n\nMaybe the most remarkable thing about Sonny Vaccaro is that after thousands of interviews, a documentary and a feature film about his one-of-a-kind basketball life and decades worth of news stories that connect him to some of the biggest milestones in American sports, he still has plenty of new stories to tell.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough (material) for another one!\u201d Vaccaro told me in a phone conversation this week, shortly before his new book, \u201cLegends and Soles: The Memoir of An American Original\u201d is officially released by HarperOne publishing company. \u201cI hope God gives me the time.\u201d\n\nBut if this book is the last official account of how the now 85-year-old Vaccaro became the Godfather of summer basketball, the marketing executive who convinced Nike to bet everything on Michael Jordan and the man who took down the NCAA in federal court, it\u2019s more than enough to tell the story of how an immigrant\u2019s kid from a small mill town outside of Pittsburgh changed American sports forever.\n\n\"If it\u2019s the last thing I did, other than being with my wife all these years, it\u2019s the best story I could have left \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Vaccaro said.\n\nThough a typical conversation with Vaccaro is a high-speed, meandering journey of tangents and anecdotes that are often incomplete, his book is a straightforward, easily digestible series of key points in his life that explain exactly how he went from aspiring football player who thought he was headed to Kentucky on scholarship to basketball camp impresario to Nike, where he sold company executives on a plan to take over college hoops by paying coaches to outfit their teams.\n\n\u201cThe deal is this,\u201d Vaccaro writes in the book, recalling his pitch to UNLV\u2019s Jerry Tarkanian in 1978. \u201cI give you $10,000, and a lot of Nike merchandise \u2014 shoes, T-shirts, sweat suits, bags \u2014 and you do your part: Suggest to the kids that they wear Nikes. Practices, games, tournaments. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Tarkanian replies. \u201cAnd all I gotta do is suggest that the kids wear free brand-new basketball shoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Vaccaro, who made the deal and wrote Tarkanian a $2,500 check out of his personal account \u2014 money he didn't have at the time. But that was Vaccaro\u2019s deal with Nike in those early days: Once he got the handshake from the coach, only then would the company wire him the reimbursement.\n\nSome of these stories have been well-known for decades in the world of basketball and sports marketing. But they became more mainstream after Vaccaro was the subject of an ESPN \u201c30 for 30\u201d titled \u201cSole Man\u201d and then again in 2023 with the Ben Affleck-directed movie \u201cAir,\u201d which covers the 1984 pursuit of Jordan by Vaccaro (played by Matt Damon) and Nike, which at the time was nothing like the international behemoth it is now.\n\nBut many of the \u201cLegends and Soles\u201d anecdotes within those major events have never been written about before, Vaccaro said.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent involves a meeting at the 1984 Olympics that Vaccaro had arranged between Nike founder Phil Knight and Billy Packer, who was the most prominent college basketball analyst of his time.\n\nAccording to the book, Knight was still waffling on whether to put a massive deal in front of Jordan, who was originally more inclined to sign with Adidas. Keep in mind, Jordan was the No. 3 NBA draft pick coming out of North Carolina \u2014 not exactly a slam dunk to be the best player of his generation, much less all time \u2014 even though Vaccaro was convinced he was the guy Nike had to sign.\n\nSo Vaccaro asked Packer to come to Nike's post-Olympic party and sit down with Knight \u2014 not knowing exactly what he\u2019d say about Jordan. But by the end of the meeting, Knight was convinced.\n\n\"That was the coup de gras,\u201d Vaccaro told me.\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cBecause (Packer) was neutral,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cKnight wanted someone not involved.\u201d\n\nThis is important because, over the decades, Knight and even Jordan have disputed the genesis of the most important and lucrative deal in the history of sports marketing, downplaying Vaccaro\u2019s involvement.\n\nBut as Vaccaro started the process of writing his memoir several years ago, he reached out to some of the people involved in these stories and asked for their recollection to see if it matched his own.\n\nOne of them was Packer, who remembered it just as Vaccaro did.\n\n\u201cI said, 'Billy, would you mind writing this down so I have it? Because no one will believe it if something happens to me,' \" Vaccaro told me. \u201cSo he wrote me a letter, and it got lost so he wrote me a second one.\"\n\nPacker died in 2023, by which point Vaccaro had gotten serious again about putting his life story on paper \u2014 something his sister-in-law Mary Jo Monakee had encouraged and helped with until she passed away four years ago.\n\nAt that point, Vaccaro had 150,000 words and 20 hours of tape-recorded monologue that needed to be molded into a readable book. That\u2019s when Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, brought in noted journalist and author Armen Keteyian to put it all together \u2014 covering his bitter exit from Nike, his ill-fated pursuit of LeBron James on behalf of Adidas, the AAU sneaker wars and ultimately his role in convincing former UCLA star Ed O\u2019Bannon to be the lead plaintiff in an antitrust case against the NCAA.\n\nThroughout the book, Vaccaro notes how a series of coincidences and chance meetings defined his path. And while many former basketball players he knew from his camp agreed that the NCAA\u2019s monopoly over name, image and likeness rights needed to be challenged in court, none wanted the burden of being the lead plaintiff and all the publicity that would come from taking on amateurism.\n\nBut just a few days before Vaccaro called on him, one of O\u2019Bannon\u2019s colleagues at the car dealership where they worked told him about a video game his son was playing as O\u2019Bannon from UCLA\u2019s 1995 championship team. It was O\u2019Bannon\u2019s number, his shaved head and even his left hand \u2014 and he was getting nothing.\n\nThough it has taken many years, multiple court cases and been messy in implementation, Vaccaro\u2019s role in correcting that economic wrong is undisputed.\n\nWhat could be a better tribute to a man whose career started at the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic back in Pittsburgh with a simple principle: If you get the best high school talent to play the best high school talent, people will watch. And care. And eventually, everyone will make money.\n\nDespite all the controversies and \u201csneaker pimp\u201d accusations over his influence in college sports and youth basketball, Vaccaro was always right about that. And in \u201cLegends and Soles,\u201d it's his turn to tell us exactly how it happened.",

            "content": "Nike is set to expand its legendary Air Max lineup with a brand-new silhouette, the Nike Air Max Fire. Blending heritage design elements with modern construction, this latest addition offers a sleek, understated alternative for Air Max enthusiasts, particularly those who favor the Air Max DN8.\n\nLaunching in three debut colorways\u2014Triple White, Triple Black, and Black/Red\u2014the Air Max Fire draws inspiration from multiple Air Max models, incorporating a textured, curvilinear aesthetic with ballistic mesh and synthetic overlays. Set to retail at $100 USD, the silhouette is expected to land at Nike retailers and Nike.com later this season.\n\nA Fresh Take on Classic Air Max Design\n\nNike has long been known for reinventing its Air Max catalog, paying tribute to its historic sneaker lineage while integrating contemporary design elements. The Air Max Fire does just that, fusing subtle details from past iterations while introducing a distinctly modern feel.\n\nKey design features include:\n\nCurvilinear graphic ridges that extend from the forefoot to the heel, adding depth and texture\n\nA mixed-material upper constructed primarily from ballistic mesh, complemented by synthetic overlays for durability\n\nA Swoosh seamlessly embedded into the design, flowing into the heel panel for a streamlined look\n\nA low-profile, cushioned sole unit, reminiscent of the Tailwind series, offering comfort without bulk\n\nWhile Air Max models often highlight oversized Air units, the Air Max Fire takes a more refined approach, emphasizing design continuity and lightweight versatility.\n\nBreaking Down the Debut Colorways\n\nFor its initial launch, the Nike Air Max Fire will arrive in three versatile color options, catering to both minimalists and those who prefer a bold statement.\n\nTriple White\n\nA go-to for summer rotations, the Triple White edition keeps things crisp and clean, allowing the textured overlays and ridges to shine without distraction. This version is perfect for everyday wear and easily pairs with any outfit, from athletic wear to casual street style.\n\nTriple Black\n\nA stealthier option, the Triple Black colorway brings an all-business aesthetic, ideal for those who prefer a more subtle, low-maintenance sneaker. The monochrome look enhances the silhouette\u2019s layered textures, making it an easy choice for both performance and lifestyle settings.\n\nBlack/Red\n\nFor those who appreciate a pop of color, the Black/Red iteration combines a bold black base with striking red accents. The contrast highlights the curvilinear design details, adding a dynamic visual effect that echoes classic Nike heritage color schemes.\n\nThe Air Max Fire vs. Other Air Max Models\n\nNike has consistently introduced new Air Max models that either modernize classic silhouettes or introduce completely fresh aesthetics. The Air Max Fire fits into the latter category, providing a contemporary take on the Air Max DNA while retaining elements familiar to longtime fans.\n\nComparisons can be made to:\n\nAir Max DN8 \u2013 Shares a low-profile build and a streamlined design, making it an alternative for fans of minimalist Air Max silhouettes\n\nAir Max Tailwind \u2013 The ribbed detailing running across the upper is reminiscent of the Tailwind\u2019s structured approach to airflow and texture\n\nAir Max 270 & Air Max 720 \u2013 While the Air Max Fire doesn\u2019t boast oversized Air units, it still maintains a lifestyle-friendly aesthetic similar to these models\n\nRather than leaning on a futuristic aesthetic, the Air Max Fire focuses on subtle detailing, making it a versatile addition to the Air Max lineup.\n\nAffordability Meets Style\n\nNike has positioned the Air Max Fire at an accessible price point of $100 USD, making it one of the more budget-friendly Air Max models without compromising on design or materials.\n\nThis price range suggests that Nike is targeting everyday wearers, offering a sleek, functional sneaker that appeals to:\n\nLongtime Air Max fans looking for a fresh option\n\nCasual sneakerheads wanting an affordable, stylish model\n\nAthletic consumers seeking a lightweight, comfortable option for daily wear\n\nExpected Release and Where to Buy\n\nThe Nike Air Max Fire is set to launch later this season, with availability through Nike.com and select retailers worldwide. Given its versatile styling and affordable pricing, demand is expected to be strong upon release.\n\nNike\u2019s continued evolution of the Air Max lineage ensures that the Air Max Fire will find its place among sneaker enthusiasts, particularly those who appreciate subtle innovation without straying too far from tradition.\n\nA Sleek Addition to the Air Max Family\n\nThe Nike Air Max Fire is a testament to Nike\u2019s ability to modernize its Air Max lineup while maintaining affordability and everyday wearability. With its curved textures, lightweight build, and tonal colorways, it caters to both seasoned sneaker collectors and those looking for a go-to daily shoe.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the clean appeal of the Triple White, the stealthy presence of the Triple Black, or the bold contrast of the Black/Red, this silhouette delivers a fresh take on Nike\u2019s Air Max legacy. Expect the Air Max Fire to be a sleeper hit among those who favor subtle details over loud design choices.\n\nFor those looking to secure a pair, keep an eye on Nike SNKRS and authorized retailers for updates on the official release date.",

            "content": "In the middle of 2024, Bill Ackman's fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, took a new stake in the iconic footwear and apparel brand Nike (NKE -1.35%). While the brand carries tremendous recognition globally, the stock is down over 31% in the last year. Nike has struggled to keep up with competition and lost some of its marketing luster that for so many years captured the attention of the sports world.\n\nIn a recent presentation, Ackman and Pershing disclosed that Nike will soon look like it's disappeared from Pershing's portfolio when the fund files updated disclosures for Q1 2025 in a few months. However, Pershing doubled down on the embattled stock.\n\nConverting Nike shares to call options\n\nIn its investor update, Pershing disclosed that in early 2025 the fund converted its Nike equity position, valued at over $1.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, to deep in-the-money call options. A call option is a bullish bet that shares will reach a certain stock price, the strike, by a specific date. If the market price of the stock surpasses the strike price, Pershing will make money. Deep in-the-money call options are when the strike price on the option is significantly below the current market price, making it more likely the options will cash.\n\nPershing said this new structure will enable the fund to reap the potential upside and free up capital for new investments. The fact that the options are deep in the money also limits the downside potential, and the added leverage from the options makes the rewards potentially 2 times higher than owning the equity. However, if the stock somehow falls below the undisclosed strike price when the options expire, Ackman and Pershing would lose everything on the investment. More upside also comes with more risk.\n\nPershing also told investors that equity call options don't show up on the 13F filings that funds must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission each quarter. The next filing detailing Pershing's equity holdings will not show Nike, making the market believe the fund sold the stock. In actuality, Pershing has increased its exposure.\n\nNike's great turnaround will take patience\n\nIn the investor presentation, Ackman and Pershing said they believe Nike \"has the potential to be one of the great large cap consumer turnarounds.\" Still, that turnaround is likely to require patience, as Nike has recently pulled longtime veteran Elliot Hill out of retirement to once again run the company and execute a turnaround. While Pershing thinks Hill is the ideal candidate to right the ship, much work remains.\n\nHill's plan is to once again place the company's primary focus on sports and reduce its focus on its lifestyle products, which face steep competition. Hill also plans to pull back from Nike Digital, which the company promoted heavily, and refocus on its relationship with its wholesale partners, a reversal of strategies the company undertook during the height of the pandemic. Management believes this renewed strategy will elevate the brand and grow the size of its potential market.\n\nAckman and Pershing seem partially drawn to Nike because of its brand, which will likely always hold notoriety. This is something Warren Buffett has always valued: a brand with staying power that ends up creating a moat. Ackman and Pershing also think that Nike still has a dominant position in a footwear industry that has been consolidated, providing barriers to entry. They think the company could double its margins upon a successful turnaround.\n\nNike stock currently trades at about 22.5 times earnings, which is below its 32.5 average dating back to 2010. However, the stock trades at 35 times forward earnings, which still seems expensive based on history. There will likely need to be further evidence of earnings growth for investors to lean in. It's certainly possible but Hill is still early in his work, so I'm not sure investors need to rush into Nike just yet.",

            "content": "In comparison to its predecessor, the Nike StreakFly 2 delivers a more aggressive ride accomplished by reworking everything from the upper to the sole unit.\n\nThe same ZoomX foam cushioning found in the AlphaFly 3 and VaporFly 4 reprises its role, but folks across the internet have shared that its in-hand feel is bouncier, suggesting the Swoosh has used a new compound (perhaps PEBA instead of TPEE). The potential change has likely been a result of the FlyPate carbon fiber agent visible from the outsole. The original StreakFly only featured a PEBAX shank in the midsole, a design element that was easier on the feet during tough workouts, but left many runners wanting more. Together, the reworked ZoomX foam and carbon fiber plate firmly position the StreakFly 2 amongst Nike's super shoes.\n\nThe model also introduces a thinner, sticky substance across the outsole, which presents a clearer through-line to Bill Bowerman's legendary \"waffle\" outsoles. Most ZoomX foam underfoot is left exposed, but the forefoot features ample-enough coverage for shorter distances. Go fast-branded trips provide some protection on the heel, although the StreakFly 2 isn't oriented towards heel striking.\n\nUppers have also been updated on Nike Running's latest offering. The breathable, partly-engineered mesh that covers the top-half is reminiscent of that found on track spikes. Internal components have been reduced to maintain the second StreakFly as minimal and lightweight as possible. The change enables a \"disappearing\" feeling on-foot, allowing athletes to simply focus on their current stride.\n\nRunning Warehouse has shared that the StreakFly 2 comes in at 4.7 ounces (133 grams) in a Men's US 9. The Swoosh's official product page for the runner states a weight of approximately 5.1 ounces (145 grams) in a Men's US 10. In either case, the sequel is over an ounce lighter than its predecessor.\n\nThe shoe is set to debut sometime in March in the same 'Protoype' colorway ('Sail/Total Orange/White/Black') that's appeared on other top-of-the-line products from Nike Running. Follow-up styles include vibrant 'Bright Crimson,' 'Glacier Blue,' and 'Gridiron.' The StreakFly 2 is priced at $180.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the inaugural collection below. The 'Prototype' StreakFly 2 is set to release via Nike.com on Friday, March 14. Remaining styles are slated to release on Thursday, April 24.\n\nFor more from the Swoosh family, check out all remaining Air Jordan Releases in the year \u2013 including the Air Jordan 4 'White Cement' retro arriving in May.",

            "content": "Nike and Football Australia have partnered with renowned Kamilaroi artist Reko Rennie to create the first Australian National Football Team Collection designed by a First Nations artist, underscoring their commitment to harnessing the power of the game to bring diverse communities together.\n\nThe new collaboration is deeply rooted in Nike and Football Australia\u2019s shared pursuit of progress, cultural representation and inspiration, embodied in Rennie\u2019s bold kit design for the country\u2019s iconic national teams, including the CommBank Matildas; Subway Socceroos; and all senior, youth, Paralympic and futsal teams.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in the western suburbs of Melbourne, I saw firsthand how the game united the local community I was a part of and what it means to wear the national jersey, to feel part of something bigger,\u201d says Rennie. \u201cI am proud to have designed this kit. It is a bold statement of cultural visibility celebrating the diverse communities changing the game for the future \u2014 a message of unity from the oldest continuous civilization on earth to everyone, united through football.\u201d\n\nAt the core of the collection is a striking motif that draws inspiration from patterns commonly found in First Nations message sticks, traditionally used to pass messages between communities.\n\nThis symbol of connection, history and storytelling \u2014 drawn from a 2024 painting recently added to Rennie\u2019s REKOSPECTIVE exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria \u2014 reflects the partners\u2019 shared values and reinforces football\u2019s capacity to bring people together across generations, cultures and backgrounds.\n\nThe collection shares an empowering message of connection and elevates the visibility of the world\u2019s oldest continuous culture on the national and global stage, embodying the Matildas and Socceroos\u2019 shared brand identity: \u201cForever Forging Forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cFootball is Australia\u2019s most diverse team sport, and its multiculturalism is its superpower,\u201d says James Johnson, CEO, Football Australia. \u201cThe new national team kits reflect our commitment to inclusion, innovation and inspiring the next generation of footballers. \u2018Forever Forging Forward\u2019 is more than a brand identity \u2014 it\u2019s our guiding philosophy as we shape the future of Australian football.\u201d\n\nThis powerful statement on cultural visibility celebrates the impact of First Nations storytelling, speaking directly to the many communities driving football forward, from the grassroots to the national stage.\n\nNike and Football Australia placed significant importance on fan adoption, ensuring the collection\u2019s design would resonate with supporters. The distinctive artistic elements mark a bold new era for the national teams, with a style never seen before in Australian football.\n\n\u201cSince the brand\u2019s first support of the beautiful game, Nike Football has been a catalyst for change,\u201d says Ashley Reade, VP/GM, Nike Pacific. \u201cNike is proud to partner with Reko Rennie and Football Australia for this collection and looks forward to seeing Australians come together to support their national teams in the new green and gold.\u201d\n\nAll Football Australia national teams will be outfitted in the new collection, beginning with the Matildas during this month\u2019s She Believes Cup and the Socceroos during their Round 3 Asian Football Confederation Qualifiers in March.\n\nThe new Australian National Football Team Collection home and away jerseys will be available in men\u2019s, women\u2019s and kids\u2019 sizes February 21 at nike.com, the Football Australia online shop and select retail partners.\n\nNike proudly partners with and celebrates First Nations athletes*, organizations and communities. In Australia, Nike acknowledges that its employees live and work on the unceded lands of First Nations peoples.\n\n*If you have a body, you are an athlete.\n\n",

            "content": "Since 2023, United Students Against Sweatshops have advocated against alleged wage theft in Nike facilities producing apparel for the University of Michigan. Now, in 2025, USAS is still pushing for more significant action to address the wage theft and ensure justice for garment workers. At a protest held last week, USAS members reaffirmed their commitment to holding the University accountable for what they see as a lack of action to address garment worker conditions.\n\nIn 2020, workers in a Thailand factory producing U-M apparel for Nike, which has had an apparel agreement with the University since 2016, saw $600,000 of their wages stolen during work stoppages brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Thai law, employers are required to pay temporarily-suspended employees at least half of their wages during the period of suspension. Instead of honoring their wages, the factory pressured employees to sign up for unpaid leave against their will.\n\nIn an interview with The Michigan Daily at the protest, LSA senior Mark Tallents, USAS co-president, spoke about the University administration\u2019s response to this wage theft. In a letter to USAS in October 2023, University President Santa Ono wrote that he would have the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel contact Nike in response to a report from the President\u2019s Advisory Committee on Labor Standards and Human Rights, which noted wage theft violates the contract with Nike. Tallents said University leadership has yet to remediate the issue.\n\n\u201c(The committee) outlined the deadline at Oct. 31, 2023, but the president and the Office of General Counsel have sat on this report and they\u2019ve done nothing to remediate this violation of our contract,\u201d Tallents said. \u201cWe\u2019re here saying this cannot go on anymore, we\u2019re not going to stand for it, and we need to have our garment workers paid.\u201d\n\nUSAS members gathered Feb. 13 to protest the University\u2019s failure to address the wage theft, standing around the entrance to the Michigan Union Barnes & Noble with a variety of signs, including a banner made of sewn-together U-M apparel with the slogan \u201cMade with Wage Theft\u201d painted in bright colors.\n\nAt the protest, LSA senior Alifa Chowdhury told The Daily she believed the University failed to act due to the institution\u2019s emphasis on maximizing profit.\n\n\u201cBased on the other things that this University does, I think they ignore the rules when they can and follow the rules when they want to.\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cIt\u2019s very arbitrary, and at the end of the day it\u2019s all about capital accumulation and them making some money.\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Daily, Engineering sophomore Jonathan Zou, a USAS member, wrote that he believed standing against wage theft was something that the entire campus community should rally around.\n\n\u201cAll people among the community want U-M to cut the contract with Nike: students who pay tuition to an institution that is complicit, staff who are treated the same as how U-M treats workers abroad, community members who can no longer wear the U-M brand with good conscience,\u201d Zou wrote.\n\nTallents urged students at the University to be conscious of where their clothes come from and said they should take action to pressure the University to make more ethical decisions.\n\n\u201cI would say to all the students here, think about where your clothes came from,\u201d Tallents said. \u201cThink about what this university represents when they put Nike on the front of their T-shirts, and do something about it and take action, because we have agency as students here.\u201d\n\nThe University did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Glenn Hedin can be reached at heglenn@umich.edu.",

The earliest pairs in Blue Ribbon Sports' running arsenal (Nike's name before 1971) innovated with outsole rubber patterns, midsole geometry, and materials across the upper, but they pale in technology when compared to the VaporFly 4. Developed and launched throughout the mid-2010s, the original VaporFly NEXT% laid the groundwork for not only its fourth iteration, but also the rest of the performance-running industry by effectively introducing a super shoe into the market.\n\nPrior to 2016, the marathon racing landscape relied on low-to-the-ground, lightweight footwear to enable elite athletes' best performances. Once Eliud Kipchoge and other Nike-sponsored runners showcased just how effective their sponsor's innovative 4% and NEXT% lines were, competitors took notice, racing to deliver their own version of a \"super shoe,\" a lightweight running silhouette that aims to improve running efficiency through a combination of a carbon fiber stiffening agent (usually a full-length plate) and thick slab of responsive foam (under 40 milimeters of stackheight to comply with World Athletics). The VaporFly 4 carries on tradition in a lighter, more-propulsive package.\n\n\u201cNote\u201d Nike VaporFly 4 'Prototype.' Photo via Nike.\n\nSet to release throughout spring, the fourth Nike VaporFly offering improves on the VaporFly 3's winning formula. The Oregon-based institution has trimmed weight in the upper, midsole, and outsole without sacrificing performance. According to the brand's official product description, the VaporFly 4 weighs approximately 6.7 ounces (190 grams) in a Men's US 10. (By comparison, the adidas Adizero Adios Pro Evo 2, currently the lightest marathon racing shoe in the world, comes in at around 4.87 ounces (138 grams) in a Men's US 9.)\n\nThe original VaporFly debuted as the Swoosh's marquee footwear option for the marathon, but it was consciously phased out at the elite level with the AlphaFly series. Some of Nike's most impressive athletes, however, proved just how effective the VaporFly 2 was over the course of 26.2 miles. The line's third release has been virtually non-existent throughout the Abbott World Marathon Majors circuit, but the VaporFly 4 could return to the podium during this year's races.\n\nVisually, the silhouette appears faster than its immediate predecessor. The model's debut colorway \u2013 dubbed 'Prototype' \u2013 commemorates the thorough testing process all Nike performance products go through, especially those looking to break new records. The handwritten figures on the midsole salute the wear-testers that contributed to the VaporFly 4's journey.\n\nA full-length carbon fiber FlyPlate reprises its role, delivering the reliable forward-propulsion that arguably hasn't been matched by any competitor in the last six years. Nike has placed the FlyPlate at a higher angle than in the VaporFly 3, coupling it with a lower 6 millimeter heel-to-toe drop to improve the sensation underfoot. ZoomX foam offers the same responsiveness and energy return found on the AlphaFly 3, although its sculpting and cutouts provide a lighter cushioning setup.\n\nThe outsole has also been reworked on the VaporFly 4. A thinner rubber compound covers the entirety of the model's forefoot area, ensuring ample grip on any toe-off. Two protective components appear on either side of the ZoomX foam underneath the heel for reinforcement, although the shoe isn't optimal for heel-strikers.\n\nThe VaporFly 4 also introduces tweaks to the upper. A new, engineered mesh replaces FlyKnit construction throughout the top-half for improved comfort and a \"disappearing\" feeling atop the foot. Weight has also been shaved from the tongue and heel, although both feature sufficient padding.\n\nEnjoy official photos of Nike Running's inaugural VaporFly 4 collection below. The silhouette has showed up to the starting line at various races in the last few months \u2013 courtesy of several Japanese runners. A 'Prototype' colorway should hit Nike.com globally by April, followed by 'Bright Crimson,' 'Gridiron,' and 'Blue Void' styles.\n\nThe VaporFly 4 is priced at $260 and will be offered in Men's and Women's sizing.\n\nFor more from the Swoosh family, check out all remaining Air Jordan Releases left in the year \u2013 including the Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' retro landing on March 1.",

In this latest photo shared by Nike footwear designer Bryce Wong, Lara Croft\u2019s Tomb Raider gaming franchise could be the next low poly video game to influence an upcoming colorway of this reimagined \u201987 classic\n\nPossibly inspired by Lara Croft\u2019s signature green to and brown cargo shorts, this Air Max 1 Low Poly flexes a new colorway featuring dark green mudguards that match the polygonal Swoosh logo and tongue label. Gum soles add even more of an adventurous spin on the execution, while the same pixelated uppers screen onto the mesh toe-box, upper quarter, and heel.\n\nAn alternate colorway of the Air Max 1 Low Poly appears in the background bearing a light grey upper and light green Swoosh.\n\nWith the Nike Air Max 1 \u201cLow Poly\u201d set to arrive soon for those who pre-ordered the shoes back in October, Nike is gearing up for the annual Air Max Day festivities with this retro-forward take on the \u201987 classic.

But since then, Nike has actually figured out how to pay an even smaller portion of its retail sticker price to the workers who make its products.\n\nIn 2022, Nike authorized $18 billion in stock buybacks, which primarily benefit wealthy investors, while garment workers \u2014 the vast majority of whom are women in the Global South \u2014 faced massive wage losses and wage theft during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLeni, a member of the Indonesian union Gabungan Serikat Buruh Indonesia (GSBI), makes Nike shoes in a factory with thousands of workers, most of them women like her.\n\n\u201cI want the world to understand the truth of workers\u2019 lives behind these products,\u201d Leni told me recently. \u201cI had a baby and another small child when COVID hit in 2020. The factory slashed our wages and offered no support. We couldn\u2019t even put basic food on our families\u2019 tables. As we learned that Nike made record profits during the pandemic but offered us no relief, we were furious. There is no Nike and no profits without us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy factory has not even paid the mandated minimum wage increases in my region,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have had enough! We demand that Nike end wage theft in its supply chain and pay us what we deserve.\u201d\n\nLeni is part of a group of union activists from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and India with a plan to fight back. These brave workers have committed to speak publicly despite the risks of retaliation.\n\nThe Asia Floor Wage Alliance (AFWA) has brought together unions across our region. We are organizing across borders in a transformative fight for living wages and human rights protections. The \u201cFight the Heist\u201d campaign \u2014 coordinated by AFWA and Global Labor Justice (GLJ) \u2014 has focused its demands on Nike, with its supply chain of over 1 million garment workers.\n\nOur support in the U.S. labor movement has grown too. In July 2024, the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the Communications Workers of America Women\u2019s Committee joined GLJ to organize actions in eight cities across the United States. We\u2019re so excited to see allies in the U.S. relate to our fight against corporate greed and for the value of women\u2019s work.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the Fight the Heist worker activists ran hundreds of organizing meetings with their coworkers. They discussed the gross inequalities of Nike\u2019s supply chain \u2014 for instance, Nike\u2019s CEO got paid more than 24,000 times more than a worker in Sri Lanka making Nike\u2019s clothing in 2023.\n\nAt the end of those conversations, activists challenged their coworkers to join a public photo petition. Through the petition, workers are demanding that Nike recognize their essential work and provide the pay they deserve.\n\nNow, over 1,000 workers across the region have decided to stand up together. On March 21, their photos will go public as allies across the world share the petition and demand that Nike\u2019s executives look them in the eye.\n\nThese abusive practices only make it easier for corporations to lower wages and working standards in the United States as well. So will you join us?\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAbiramy Sivalogananthan is the South Asia Coordinator\n\nfor the Asia Floor Wage Alliance.

Their pivot away from that space doesn\u2019t surprise me, but Nintendo\u2019s lack of involvement as of now does. Okay, so there is no word of an official collaboration yet, but it sure looks like Nike drew inspiration from Donkey Kong for these new shoes. The new Nike Air Max 1 Low Poly colorway is allegedly nicknamed \u201cBig Head Origins,\u201d according to Sneaker News.\n\nNike\n\nThe drop seems very inspired by the ironically barefoot monkey. Considering Swoosh\u2019s tagline on its website: \u201d Swoosh is Nike\u2019s Home for Gaming,\u201d this is totally plausible. The shoes follow a brown and red colorway like Donkey Kong himself. The shoe\u2019s upper features brown fuzzy brown suede\u2026or should I say hairy. Of course, this mimics Donkey Kong\u2019s fur.\n\nThe iconic Nike Swoosh is red with a polygonal design, making it less smooth and more Nintendo 64 vibes. The tongue of the sneaker says Nike Air Max in a pixelated design keeps this same old-gen game theme. On the back of the shoe, there is a yellow circular rubber Nike Air badge that screams banana coin.\n\nNike\n\nSpeaking of the Nintendo 64, I think this sneaker takes some graphics from Donkey Kong 64 because of the insoles. Which features a ground pattern similar to the one from the game. Additionally, the coins that are so close to DK but say DS for DotSwoosh. I don\u2019t know about you, but with all the other details, the banana peel is giving Donkey Kong Country 2.\n\nThe shoe collaborations are ramping up as of late with Red Hulk clogs also releasing recently. There is currently confirmed no release date. However, the shoes will likely drop in Spring or Summer 2025 with a retail price of $150.",

            "content": "This week, we take a look at the recently-announced joint venture NikeSkims, including how it may be boosted by the rise of women\u2019s sports and whether it can compete in the crowded women\u2019s activewear space.\n\nNike has been a dominant player in activewear for decades, but its market share has been slipping in the face of new competitors. Meanwhile, the Kim Kardashian-backed Skims has meteorically risen in the women\u2019s shapewear space. Now, the two titans are joining forces in a bid to conquer the growing market for women\u2019s activewear.\n\nThe unexpected announcement came on Tuesday morning. The two companies are joining not for a one-off collaboration or even an ongoing partnership, but rather for a full-on new independent brand called NikeSkims. It will be run as its own company with its own staff, much in the way the Nike-owned Jordan Brand operates semi-independently from its parent company. The new brand will focus on women\u2019s activewear \u2013 think gym-ready apparel like leggings, as opposed to Skims\u2019s usual everyday underclothes. The first collection drops this spring.\n\nIt\u2019s the first full-on collaboration of its nature between Nike and an outside company in Nike\u2019s history. The question is whether the combined powers of the two megabrands will be enough to unseat other dominant women\u2019s activewear brands.\n\nBut the partnership makes sense for both brands. Six-year-old Skims has grown rapidly to be valued at $4 billion but is still a relatively new company with only a handful of stores around the country. Meanwhile, Nike has a massive, global distribution chain and a network of hundreds of stores and retail partners.\n\n\u201cBy creating a new brand, rather than simply launching a collaboration, the teams behind NikeSkims created opportunities to significantly expand the brand in the future,\u201d said Maura Regan, president of Licensing International, the trade organization representing the brand licensing industry. \u201cFor example, this joint venture can be licensed moving forward, allowing it to reach categories where neither Nike nor Skims have expertise. And while it will benefit from the support of both companies, this brand can evolve separately from Nike and Skims to connect with new consumers.\u201d\n\nThat combination of skillsets will be necessary if NikeSkims wants to compete with powerhouses like Lululemon.\n\n\u201cNike\u2019s expertise in performance engineering and fabric technology, blended with Skims\u2019s understanding of how to accentuate and celebrate the female form, could create an assortment that truly resonates with women,\u201d said Kristen Classi-Zummo, director and apparel industry analyst at Circana. \u201cThe joint brand approach effectively feminizes Nike in a way that a limited collaboration couldn\u2019t achieve. While many women feel Lululemon was created specifically for them, this new sub-brand has the opportunity to speak more authentically to women.\u201d\n\nOther experts echoed similar predictions about Nike and Skims\u2019 complementary skills and assets, most notably Skims\u2019s high profile among women consumers for its understanding of appealing feminine silhouettes.\n\n\u201cNikeSkims is entering the market with the best of both worlds: Nike\u2019s technical innovation and Skims\u2019s cult following for understanding fabrics, inclusive fits and, generally, the female form,\u201d said Fallon Ryan, a branding expert and founder of FallonPR. \u201cI think this brand has the potential to be a disruptor, especially if they focus efforts on filling gaps in the market like offering better inclusive sizing, elevating compression without compromising comfort and maybe introducing new seamless performance fabrics.\u201d\n\nThe presence of Kim Kardashian as a face of the brand has undeniably helped Skims to grow. She\u2019s featured heavily in Skims\u2019s marketing, and her social media following, with over 350 million followers on Instagram, has already been beneficial to NikeSkims. Her simple post of the logo of the new brand on a lanyard racked up 450,000 likes within 24 hours of posting. It\u2019s unconfirmed if Kardashian will be featured in NikeSkims\u2019s marketing as heavily as she is for Skims. Skims co-founder Jens Grede was unavailable for an interview on the brand\u2019s future plans.\n\nNikeSkims\u2019 competitors are large in their own right. Lululemon brings in over $10 billion a year, while Athleta brings in $1.4 billion, and Fabletics aims to hit $1 billion in the next two years.\n\nThe partnership also comes at a time when interest in women\u2019s sports is on the rise. The WNBA, which Skims is already a partner of, had its most-viewed season ever last year. And women\u2019s sports athletes at the college and professional level are becoming household names.\n\nThe NikeSkims announcement, released by Nike on Tuesday, makes special note of how NikeSkims will serve the female athlete, including using women-centric insights from Nike\u2019s Sport Research Lab in Oregon and continuing to partner with women\u2019s sports leagues. Women\u2019s sports grew in viewership by 300% between 2021 and 2024, finally breaking the $1 billion mark.\n\nNike\u2019s competitor, Adidas, has also invested in women\u2019s sports, sponsoring events like this year\u2019s AIG Women\u2019s Open, a major women\u2019s golf tournament, and creating the kits for the 2025 Women\u2019s Euro soccer championship. Ivy Park, Adidas\u2019s women\u2019s-focused active line in partnership with Beyonc\u00e9, folded in 2023 after declining sales.\n\n\u201cNike has always had an unrivaled belief in and commitment to women athletes,\u201d said Amy Montagne, vp and gm of Nike Women\u2019s, in a statement. \u201cNo footwear or apparel brand delivers the level of support Nike provides to women\u2019s sport and movement. With NikeSkims, we\u2019re deepening that support, listening to the voices of our athletes and women around the world and meeting their needs with a unique and disruptive point of view rooted in strength and style \u2014 and fueled by two powerhouse brands known for innovation and cultural disruption.\u201d\n\nTeemu Suviala, global chief creative officer at the brand consulting firm Landor, said that both companies possess \u201cpowerful brand narratives and fiercely loyal customer bases.\u201d That, combined with the proven marketing value that comes from a Kardashian backing your brand, puts NikeSkims in a very good position to compete in a crowded space.\n\n\u201cThere are clear strategic advantages for both brands,\u201d Suviala said. \u201cFor Nike, this partnership signals an evolving strategy under new leadership, demonstrating a renewed focus on women as a key driver of growth. For Skims, it represents continued expansion, solidifying its position as a major player in the lifestyle space. There\u2019s genuine synergy, and groundbreaking ideas often emerge when seemingly unrelated concepts, ideas and even brands converge.\u201d\n\nStat of the week\n\n70%: The percentage of all incoming customer inquiries to GoodwillFinds that are now handled by AI, according to the company\u2019s CEO, Matt Kaness.\n\nGoodwillFinds, the online thrift store, offers tens of thousands of products on its site every day. That\u2019s required a heavy investment in AI to help sort through all the product listings. GoodwillFinds\u2019 in-house AI agent, which the company calls Gem, was built in two months and introduced this past December.\n\nNews to know\n\nForever 21, after being rescued from bankruptcy by Authentic Brands Group and its Sparc Group joint venture with Simon Property Group, is back in the danger zone. The company nears a second bankruptcy and will likely close hundreds of stores in the coming weeks.\n\nThe E.U. is getting closer to implementing a waste tax that would require producers of products like apparel and food to contribute financially to the waste collection of their own products. It\u2019s part of a long-running effort by European lawmakers to make companies take more responsibility for what happens to their products after they\u2019re sold.\n\nSwatch Group reported a difficult 2024, with profits falling 75%. Part of the cause of the drastic decline was a drop in sales in China and Southeast Asia, where revenue was down by 30% last year.\n\nCheck out Glossy\u2019s fashion coverage\n\nBurberry\u2019s return-to-office mandate sparks employee backlash\n\nExecutive Action Items: Create a \u2018win-win-win\u2019 influencer strategy\n\nInside The RealReal\u2019s latest marketing bet: a new Gossip Girl-esque Substack newsletter",

And its new effort probably won\u2019t be cheap.\n\nThe Oregon sportswear giant announced a partnership Tuesday with Kim Kardashian\u2019s shapewear line Skims, with a new line launching in the U.S. this spring, and a global rollout next year.\n\nAimed squarely at women, the joint label is called NikeSKIMS and comes with an air of high-end branding that Nike has been grasping for. The move also comes as part of a broader turnaround effort, led by new CEO Elliott Hill, after struggling with too many discounts and too little innovation in the last couple of years.\n\nThe market for global women\u2019s activewear is projected to grow from $193 billion in 2024 to $304.4 billion by 2032. And Nike is trying to tap into that market with help from one of the most famous celebrity entrepreneurs in the world with a colossal social media following.\n\nNike has a large women\u2019s business already, \u201cbut it\u2019s not really seen as a premium women\u2019s athleisure brand. I think it\u2019s an attempt to separate Nike Skims merchandise as higher quality and higher price than normal Nike women\u2019s gear,\u201d says David Swartz, retail analyst at Morningstar.\n\nNot to mention Kardashian\u2019s involvement will bring some heat\u2014and relevance\u2014to a brand that needs it.\n\nWith brands like Alo Yoga, Vuori, and Lululemon surging in popularity, the move shows Nike is \u201cback on offense,\u201d says retail analyst Matt Powell. \u201cThis collaboration won\u2019t be a huge game-changer, but definitely a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nMaking Deeper Inroads With Women\n\nNew sneaker brands like Hoka and On\u2014as well as older names like Asics\u2014pushed Nike off its perch in the sneaker world over the last few years as the sportswear and footwear markets have grown ever more fragmented.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar situation with women\u2019s activewear as female-oriented upstart brands win over younger customers\u2014whether they run marathons or do an occasional Pilates class. Lululemon had 13.7% of market shares for women\u2019s sportswear in the U.S. in 2024, compared with just 5.3% for Nike, according to market research firm GlobalData. Athleta is at 3.6%.\n\nYes, Nike has a sizable women\u2019s business, coming in at $8.5 billion in sales for fiscal full-year 2024. But the portion of Nike\u2019s overall sales in the women\u2019s category fell to 21% in 2024 from 23% in 2020 because of the fast growth of the Jordan brand, which is primarily men\u2019s, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, wrote in a note Tuesday. During this period, Nike has lost share to women\u2019s focused apparel brands like Lululemon, Athleta, and Alo Yoga.\n\nLululemon, which began with apparel focused on yoga, has been notable: From 2020 to 2024 annual revenue exploded by 118%, increasing from $4.4 billion to $9.6 billion. Nike also likely sees Lululemon\u2019s strong growth in China as a threat it needs to respond to. The brand\u2019s net revenue from China surged 34% in the fiscal second quarter, compared with a 1% gain for the Americas region. Alo Yoga is a private company, so it doesn\u2019t have to make financial results public, but reports have put its valuation at around $10 billion.\n\nThe joint brand approach \u201cfeminizes\u201d Nike, says Kristen Classi-Zummo, apparel industry advisor at Circana. While many women feel great about wearing Lululemon, this new brand \u201chas the opportunity to speak more authentically to women,\u201d she says.\n\nNike is ramping up its investment in women\u2019s products: It ran a 90-second Super Bowl commercial featuring a slew of women athletes, and is releasing A\u2019ja Wilson\u2019s A\u2019One signature shoe in May.\n\nThe Kim K. Boost\n\nHooking up with Kardashian is a no-brainer for Nike. She has 358 million Instagram followers and 9.8 million TikTok followers; Nike has 302 million Instagram followers and 7.2 million on TikTok.\n\nSkims, which she launched in 2019 with serial entrepreneur Jens Grede, reportedly has a $4 billion valuation. Kardashian was the top social media influencer for fashion in the U.S. in 2024, according to marketing platform Traackr.\n\nThe Nike partnership is logical given Skims\u2019s previous alliances. Skims collaborated with The North Face in December on a skiwear line (including jackets, leggings, and balaclavas) that sold out online within minutes and had thousands on a wait list. Skims has also done collaborations with the likes of Fendi, Swarovski, and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nSkims, which sells a $158 \u201cpush-up butt enhancing padded mid thigh bodysuit\u201d and underwear in the $20 range, also has a men\u2019s line. In 2023, it became the official underwear partner of the WNBA, NBA, and USA Basketball. The Nike partnership appears to be much greater in scope, BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note Tuesday, \u201caiming to create a new brand\u201d\u2014and lend Nike some of the cultural relevance and validation it\u2019s been missing.",

With a shared, long-term vision that celebrates every dimension of athleticism, from the elite to the everyday, NikeSKIMS will create covetable products meticulously crafted to fit the body\u2019s every curve, enhancing its natural form.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energized by the opportunity to build a new brand and shake things up for the next generation of athletes with NikeSKIMS,\u201d says Heidi O\u2019Neill, President of Consumer, Product and Brand, NIKE, Inc. \u201cThis partnership brings together the best of both brands and unlocks an incredible opportunity to disrupt the industry with our shared passion and commitment to innovation. We will invite even more athletes into sport and movement with product that makes them feel strong and sexy.\u201d\n\nThe origin of NikeSKIMS is rooted in a desire to bring something new and unexpected to an industry that is craving something different, and to invite a new generation of women into fitness with disruptive product designed to meet their needs in both performance and style. While exploring options within the NIKE, Inc. portfolio \u2014 spanning Nike, Jordan Brand and Converse, along with the ACG and Nike SB brands \u2014 SKIMS proposed a shared product line rooted in the brands\u2019 commitment to innovation, inclusivity and breaking boundaries.\n\nNIKE, Inc. saw an opportunity for something even bigger, making way for NikeSKIMS. More than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories. The products\u2019 design will be both functional and flattering, meeting the unique needs and preferences of women athletes around the world and revolutionizing the way they experience sport and style.\n\n\"Over the past five years, SKIMS has redefined the intimates and casual apparel landscape, championing inclusivity and confidence,\u201d says Jens Grede, Co-Founder and CEO, SKIMS. \u201cNow, by partnering with Nike, the undisputed leader in athletic performance and innovation, we\u2019re poised to create a new standard in the activewear market. This partnership will empower individuals to move with confidence and express themselves authentically, merging SKIMS' focus on body confidence and self-expression with Nike\u2019s relentless pursuit of athletic excellence.\u201d\n\nNikeSKIMS\u2019 approach to product design is inspired and informed by athletes, sport and the female form, enabling unsurpassed quality so women can move with confidence, from the gym to the studio to everyday life. To that end, the brand will make its premium-quality and style-forward designs available to all women through extended sizing.\n\nThat also means more women athletes can further benefit from Nike\u2019s distinct advantages across the marketplace, leveraging women-specific innovation from the renowned Nike Sport Research Lab, a growing membership and app ecosystem that serves millions of women around the globe, and partnerships with the world\u2019s greatest leagues, teams, federations and voices in art and culture.\n\n\u201cNike and SKIMS share a deep commitment to innovation, inclusivity and pushing boundaries, driven by an unwavering belief in the power of women,\u201d says Kim Kardashian, Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer, SKIMS. \u201cThis partnership is the culmination of that shared vision, delivering product that is meticulously designed to sculpt and perform for every body.

Nine of the 11 defendants, including Cecena-Castro, are Mexican nationals, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a news release.\n\nCourt records state that on Jan. 13, Cecena-Castro and 10 others were arrested for involvement in the Nike train robbery.\n\nAt around 11 a.m. local time, a BNSF train was stopped due to a cut air hose in Perrin, Arizona, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Shortly after the emergency stop, a BNSF police officer spotted several cases of Nike shoes beside the train.\n\nSeveral people were observed loading Nike cases into a U-Haul truck and a Ford Econoline truck nearby.\n\nWhen authorities found and searched both trucks, they found 1,985 pairs of unreleased Nike shoes, worth over $440,000, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nAll 11 defendants are in federal custody pending trial, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The defendants will be arraigned on the charges on Feb. 19.\n\nSeattle egg heist: Thieves strike cafe days after Pennsylvania theft of 100,000 eggs\n\nTrain heist uptick\n\nThe indictment follows a string of train thefts from northern Arizona and California over the past 15 years with a notable uptick in the last two years. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that the suspects are often part of transnational theft organizations originating in Sinaloa, Mexico, and operating out of California and Arizona.\n\nIn October 2024, two individuals were arrested after a Yavapai County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy responded to a train burglary report and chased four vehicles for miles along Interstate 40. Yavapai County is located just north of the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nIn December of the same year, a passing BNSF train spotted several Nike sneaker cases piled next to the tracks near Yampai, west of Williams along Route 66. Four U.S. citizens were charged with possession of stolen goods after the boxes were seized.\n\nUSA TODAY reported in 2022 that there was an increase in train thefts involving ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, California. One of the country's largest railroad companies, Union Pacific, said they had seen about $5 million in damages and thefts and noted on average, more than 90 shipping containers are looted per day.\n\nThe heists typically involve cutting air hoses to control where trains carrying valuable cargo stop. Criminal organizations specializing in train theft have used this dangerous method to derail cargo trains, some traveling at speeds of up to 70 mph.\n\nThis method involves multiple steps and separate crews to pull off a train theft. Once the train is stopped at a predetermined location, one crew breaks into specific container cars and unloads the cargo onto the ground next to the tracks.\n\nAnother crew then drives box trucks or other cargo vehicles to the scene, loading up the stolen goods for transport to California, where they are sold online.\n\nContributing Lane Sainty, The Arizona Republic; Thao Nguyen, Christal Hayes and Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY",

Sales are down, its stock has lost more than a quarter of its value over the past year and its new CEO needs some help turning around the aging athletic company. Enter Kim Kardashian.\n\nNike is partnering with Kardashian for a new brand called \u201cNikeSkims,\u201d the company and fashion mogul jointly announced Tuesday. The collection, which is based on her popular shapewear line, \u201cwill disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry with best-in-class innovation in service of all women athletes,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nFew details were initially made available, including pricing and images. However, the brand will first roll out in the United States this spring online and at \u201cselect retail locations,\u201d with a global launch planned in 2026.\n\nThe new collection is a first for Nike, which hasn\u2019t partnered with an outside company before to create a new brand, rather relying on acquisitions or tapping popular athletes (i.e. Michael Jordan) for apparel. Financial terms of the brand wasn\u2019t revealed.\n\nNike said that Skims \u201cproposed a shared product line,\u201d but suggested \u201csomething even bigger,\u201d thus the creation of NikeSkims. \u201cMore than a partnership, the new brand will set a new standard in the global fitness and activewear industry with an extensive line of training apparel, footwear and accessories,\u201d the press release stated.\n\nThe new brand will help Nike be more relevant in the activewear category, helping it compete against Lululemon and Alo, which is an area \u201cwhere it has been flagging and playing second fiddle,\u201d according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.\n\n\u201cIn theory, Nike should have all the skills needed to drive its own brand in womenswear, but the reality is it has lost some of its ability to story tell, innovate and wow consumers,\u201d Saunders told CNN. \u201cPartnering with Skims remedies some of those weaknesses.\u201d\n\nSkims has been a major success story for Kardashian with the privately held company valued at a whopping $4 billion as of July 2023. The brand is aimed at everyday wear expanding beyond women with a men\u2019s lineup and inking sponsorships with the NBA, WNBA and Team USA for the most recent Olympics in Paris.\n\nMeanwhile, Nike faces tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Plus, customers are changing their behavior, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike recently changed CEOs to help turn it around.\n\nNike (NKE) reported an 8% drop in sales in its most recent quarter, signaling the company is still struggling. However, shares perked up following the Kardashian news \u2014 rising nearly 3% \u2014 in early trading. Meanwhile, Lululemon (LULU) shares fell nearly the same amount.",

Or, rather, is NikeSKIMS, a new brand powered by Nike and SKIMS, merely the pinnacle of Kardashian's red-hot shapewear label?\n\nNike and SKIMS announced NikeSKIMS on February 18, weeks ahead of the first collection's digital launch in spring 2025. With an international release planned for 2026, it sounds like NikeSKIMS has world domination on the brain \u2014 in other words, just another day for SKIMS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energized by the opportunity to build a new brand and shake things up for the next generation of athletes with NikeSKIMS.,\u201d Heidi O\u2019Neill, President of Consumer, Product & Brand, Nike, Inc., said in a statement.\n\n\"This partnership is the culmination of that shared vision, delivering product that is meticulously designed to sculpt and perform for every body,\" added Kardashian, who co-founded SKIMS with Frame Denim co-founder Jens Grede. \"Every single detail has been obsessed over and carefully considered.\"\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nNikeSKIMS will be a lifestyle-leaning womenswear line encompassing clothing, accessories, and sneakers, the latter of which is a new category for SKIMS.\n\nIn the NikeSKIMS release, the word \"athlete\" was accompanied by an ampersand clarified in Nike's newsroom post: \"If you have a body, you are an athlete.\" Sounds like NikeSKIMS is a dedicated entry into the athleisure industry, which a November 2024 study estimated was worth nearly $400 billion.\n\nThat's old hat for Nike but fresh turf that SKIMS is keen to conquer.\n\nNike is currently on a quest to reclaim its cultural clout following a few quarters of wary revenues. New CEO Elliott Hill rejoined Nike in 2024 as part of a broader bid to restart the sportswear giant's winning streak, which began waning around 2023 when revenues began to plateau under former CEO John Donahoe and archrival adidas became the most vital name in sportswear (currently, at adidas, things are quite sunny).\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nSKIMS, meanwhile, may as well be fitted with rocket boosters.\n\nSince Kardashian and Grede founded the company in 2019, SKIMS has masterminded splashy celebrity campaigns and viral products, swiftly expanding its business from women's shapewear to all-gender underwear, swimsuits, and more. It's latest valuation? A cool $4 billion.\n\nNike remains the bigger company by far, but SKIMS is currently the hotter property. It's an interesting reflection of where Nike's contemporary brand positioning \u2014 the Swoosh was once undefeated in the marketing department. Now, Nike needs that SKIMS boost.\n\nNikeSKIMS represents both Nike's latent desire to claw back much-needed relevance and SKIMS' overarching interest in sportswear.\n\nSKIMS has demonstrated a growing interest in sportier fare, collaborating with The North Face to create earth-toned skiwear late last year and becoming the official underwear partner of the NBA in 2023 (Nike remains the NBA's longtime uniform and apparel provider).\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nBut what does SKIMS really get out the NikeSKIMS team-up? SKIMS is huge even without a Nike cosign and though SKIMS' debut Nike sneaker is a tantalizing proposition, you'd think that the company could've devised its own footwear sans Nike.\n\nDigital speculation points to Nike weighing an acquisition of SKIMS. Nothing official there, not by a long shot. Still, that'd be the most viable method of ensuring that the NikeSKIMS partnership remains ongoing, which seems to be the plan: NIke's release positions NikeSKIMS as a dedicated Nike family brand alongside Jordan and Converse.\n\nCertainly, Nike's short-lived acquisition of RTFKT implies that it's keen on \"owning\" changemakers in its space. This could be provide a much-needed infusion of \"cool\" that fuels Nike's redemption. And for SKIMS, that means the valuable backing of a household name.\n\nIt also means, in her own way, that Kim Kardashian is a modern-day Michael Jordan.",

She\u2019s a pioneer, creating space for girls to follow in her footsteps. And she\u2019s a role model, inspiring the next generation to dream big, then do everything it takes to turn those dreams into reality.\n\nAhead of Sabrina\u2019s campaign to defend her first WNBA title, she\u2019s embarking on her first Asia tour, visiting the Philippines and China to share this message of empowerment with young hoopers and further introduce herself to the global basketball community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to connect with basketball fans across Manila, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, especially young hoopers. You can feel their passion for the game, even from New York,\u201d says Sabrina. \u201cTogether we will celebrate the game, and I hope we inspire each other to achieve our dreams with dedication, commitment and hard work.\u201d\n\nSabrina will spend the first part of her tour in Manila, an international hoops hub with a longstanding connection to Nike Basketball. While there she will visit the Nike Fort retail store in Bonifacio Global City, join several youth basketball clinics, help launch a local Nike Sabrina 2 collaboration, and witness an electrifying showcase of some of the Philippines\u2019 best basketball talent at the famed Araneta Coliseum.\n\nSabrina will then continue to Guangzhou, where she will meet local athletes and visit some of their most hallowed courts \u2014 hosting a grassroots basketball camp for girls and sharing her messages of empowerment with female hoopers. She will also post up at a Nike Rise retail store to help female athletes select products that fit them correctly, powering their performance and helping them overcome a longstanding local barrier to sport.\n\nSabrina will conclude her tour in Hong Kong by experiencing street basketball culture in a local neighborhood and visiting two schools to help students learn to break through barriers in life and sport. In keeping with Sabrina\u2019s championship mentality, her final stop will be the Nike All Hong Kong Schools Jing Ying Basketball Tournament, where she will hype the next generation of Hong Kong athletes.\n\n",

The latest installment in this legacy arrives in the form of the Nike Air Flight '89 Low \"NAI-KE\", a vintage-inspired take on one of the brand\u2019s most storied basketball silhouettes.\n\nThe design starts with a light tan leather upper, but instead of following conventional color-blocking, Nike flips the script by layering crisp white leather overlays on top. Accents of chocolate brown land on the Swoosh, liner, and outsole trim, reinforcing the shoe\u2019s retro aesthetic. One of the most striking details is the semi-translucent midsole, adding a unique visual element not often seen on the model.\n\nAdditional nods to basketball heritage appear through jersey-style mesh collars, a Nike Basketball enamel lace lock on the vamp, and jock tag-inspired \"NIKE\" embroidery at the heel. Inside, NAI-KE-branded insoles cement its place in the collection, ensuring this release aligns with past tributes to China\u2019s basketball obsession.\n\nSet to release exclusively in Greater China, the Nike Air Flight '89 Low \"NAI-KE\" is expected to arrive in the Summer of 2025.\n\nElsewhere in the Nike universe, the Air Max 95 \"Neon\" returns in big-bubble form for Air Max Day.",

An enduring push behind the Nike Pegasus 2k5 is part and parcel of that, the \u201ccousin\u201d to the Vomero 5 appearing in a litany of new looks in the early goings of this year. Is the \u201cPearl Pink\u201d Pegasus 2k5 featured in this article one its best so far?\n\nAt least for our money, the answer is yes. While the neutral base / metallic overlay formula is so dominant because it remains popular, an off-speed pitch like this fully tonal treatment unquestionably brings some refreshed energy to the table. Even if those sorts of colorways still strike a chord with you, the closing details on the Nike Pegasus 2k5 \u201cPearl Pink\u201d capitalize on that atmosphere, chiefly with the bejeweled mini Swoosh that interrupts the quarter cage.\n\nThe Nike Pegasus 2k5 \u201cPearl Pink\u201d should land on Nike.com in short order, arriving in women\u2019s sizing for $150. Check out official images included below and check in to our Sneaker Release Dates page in the coming weeks for further updates on when to expect this colorway.\n\nElsewhere in the industry, we got official images of the upcoming Converse Shai 001.",

With pre-orders for that initial release completed in October and shipments expected to arrive for Air Max Day 2025, Nike is already setting the stage for its next chapter. This time, the Swoosh draws clear inspiration from the pixelated aesthetics of Donkey Kong Country, channeling nostalgic 16-bit visuals into a fresh new colorway.\n\nOfficially dubbed the Air Max 1 \u201cBig Head Origins,\u201d the sneaker is packed with playful references to retro gaming. The insoles feature golden coins marked with \u201cDS\u201d for dotSWOOSH, a clever twist on the DK Coins found throughout Donkey Kong Country 2. Additional details include a Low Poly banana icon and a low-resolution logo on the tongue, further reinforcing the sneaker\u2019s connection to one of gaming\u2019s most memorable titles.\n\nVisually, the sneaker blends light brown suede mudguards and quarter panels with a University Red Swoosh and Hem accents, creating a rich, earthy palette reminiscent of jungle-themed levels. The combination of textures and colors brings a vintage feel to the design while maintaining the classic appeal of the Air Max 1.\n\nNike's Air Max 1 'Big Head Origins' is set to drop in limited quantities on Friday, March 21, priced at $150.

Nine of the 11 defendants, including Cecena-Castro, are Mexican nationals, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a news release.\n\nCourt records state that on Jan. 13, Cecena-Castro and 10 others were arrested for involvement in the Nike train robbery.\n\nAt around 11 a.m. local time, a BNSF train was stopped due to a cut air hose in Perrin, Arizona, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Shortly after the emergency stop, a BNSF police officer spotted several cases of Nike shoes beside the train.\n\nSeveral people were observed loading Nike cases into a U-Haul truck and a Ford Econoline truck nearby.\n\nWhen authorities found and searched both trucks, they found 1,985 pairs of unreleased Nike shoes, worth over $440,000, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nAll 11 defendants are in federal custody pending trial, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The defendants will be arraigned on the charges on Feb. 19.\n\nSeattle egg heist: Thieves strike cafe days after Pennsylvania theft of 100,000 eggs\n\nTrain heist uptick\n\nThe indictment follows a string of train thefts from northern Arizona and California over the past 15 years with a notable uptick in the last two years. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that the suspects are often part of transnational theft organizations originating in Sinaloa, Mexico, and operating out of California and Arizona.\n\nIn October 2024, two individuals were arrested after a Yavapai County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy responded to a train burglary report and chased four vehicles for miles along Interstate 40. Yavapai County is located just north of the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nIn December of the same year, a passing BNSF train spotted several Nike sneaker cases piled next to the tracks near Yampai, west of Williams along Route 66. Four U.S. citizens were charged with possession of stolen goods after the boxes were seized.\n\nUSA TODAY reported in 2022 that there was an increase in train thefts involving ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, California. One of the country's largest railroad companies, Union Pacific, said they had seen about $5 million in damages and thefts and noted on average, more than 90 shipping containers are looted per day.\n\nThe heists typically involve cutting air hoses to control where trains carrying valuable cargo stop. Criminal organizations specializing in train theft have used this dangerous method to derail cargo trains, some traveling at speeds of up to 70 mph.\n\nThis method involves multiple steps and separate crews to pull off a train theft. Once the train is stopped at a predetermined location, one crew breaks into specific container cars and unloads the cargo onto the ground next to the tracks.\n\nAnother crew then drives box trucks or other cargo vehicles to the scene, loading up the stolen goods for transport to California, where they are sold online.\n\nContributing Lane Sainty, The Arizona Republic; Thao Nguyen, Christal Hayes and Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY",

After an initial release during ALL-Star Weekend at San Francisco\u2019s DLX Skateshop, Nike SB is ready to unleash the much-anticipated sequel colorway exclusively at skateshops. Following the Jordan 4 SB \u201cPine Green\u201d, these will not hit SNKRS and will be at local shops only.\n\n1 of 6\n\nNearly a unanimous selection for sneaker of the year in 2023, and one whose hardware changes are felt on the current Jordan 4 build, the Nike SB AJ4 is getting a sequel effort in 2025. Switching its \u201cPine Green\u201d edition for \u201cNavy\u201d tones, the shoe continues to come into a clearer view with new in-hand shots that just hit the newswire.\n\nAs we\u2019ve covered before, the 2025 pair is essentially a palette swap of its predecessor, inserting swatches of dark blue on the eyelets, heel tab, and midsole. The skate-minded hardware is expected to stick around, including more durable stitching, increased padding, and new flexible materials on the wings and heel tab.\n\nThis new update comes in the wake of PROJECT Las Vegas, a tech-in-fashion conference where Nike SB was exhibiting. Las Vegas store owners and skate shop owners were gifted pairs of the upcoming Nike SB Air Jordan 4 \u201cNavy.\u201d Alongside the shoes themselves, they also went home with some one-off promotional items, including a branded Nike SB golf ball and a more faithful tribute to Sin City, a set of royal blue dice also sporting the brand\u2019s logo.\n\nDavid Toole of South Carolina\u2019s Bluetile Skateboards is the one who provides this closer look at the shoe, sharing that his shop will be receiving the Nike SB Jordan 4 in navy. While we\u2019ll wait for official word on the matter, this hints at a reprise of the \u201cPine Green\u201d release strategy, in which skate shops were the primary way to get your hands on a pair. As of this writing, launches are expected sometime in March \u2014 retail is set at $225.

However, taking a step back to analyze the company's fundamentals can help you make that determination.\n\nIt's particularly challenging when it's a consumer discretionary company that relies on keeping up with customer tastes. Nike (NYSE: NKE) seemingly had the Midas touch for a long time. Once a high-flying company with booming sales and profit growth, it's fallen on more difficult days.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nCan Nike regain its momentum? Or are the company's best days behind it?\n\nBrand power fades\n\nNike had cool commercials and sports stars' endorsements. These included basketball megastar Michael Jordan. In fact, it seemed like every athlete wore Nike sneakers.\n\nThat added up to a powerful and popular brand. Footwear accounted for two-thirds of Nike's $23.9 billion in fiscal first-half revenue, which ended on Nov. 30, 2024. The company's offerings also include apparel and equipment/accessories (such as bags, balls, bats, and gloves).\n\nThe company produced high sales and profit growth for a long time. However, they've been faltering. Fiscal second-quarter sales dropped 9% after removing foreign-currency exchange translations, despite increasing marketing expenditures (demand creation expenses on the income statement) by 1%. Management cut overhead expenses, but diluted earnings per share still fell 24% to $0.78.\n\nThere have been several reasons for Nike's worsening revenue, including macroeconomic pressures, a lack of innovative new products, and intensifying competition. The last item is troubling as Deckers Outdoor's Hoka brand and On Holding, to name two, have grabbed market share from Nike.\n\nCan it win back customers?\n\nRecognizing the worsening situation, Nike brought back company veteran Elliott Hill as president and CEO last October. One of his strategies is to boost marketing and develop new products, particularly relying more on sports-related footwear and apparel than more fashionable merchandise.\n\nThe new CEO has also been pushing for better relationships with retailers while planning to de-emphasize Nike's own direct-to-consumer business. The return to Nike's roots sounds logical since that brought a lot of success in the past.\n\nHowever, Hill admits that the turnaround will take time. Moreover, it will likely cost more as management invests in product innovation and marketing. In the meantime, there's no guarantee Nike can win back customers that it will need to drive sales growth. In fact, it figures to be a major challenge.\n\nMaking the decision\n\nInvestors have recognized the challenges facing Nike. The stock has dropped nearly 32% over the past year. During this time, the S&P 500 gained about 21%. The stock's valuation has gotten less expensive. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22, down from over 30 a year ago. Large-cap stocks, measured by the S&P 500, have a P/E multiple of 30.\n\nBut long-term investors should be wary. While the valuation may seem tempting, remember, the stock sells at a discount for a reason. In this case, it's worsening results in the face of strong competition.\n\nHill may succeed, and sales and earnings may get back on track. However, that's a risky bet. I'd advise investors to avoid the stock for now, but keep track of the company. If you see sales improve in tandem with a better gross margin, you'll know the company's going in the right direction.\n\nUntil then, I'd stay away from the shares.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "11 indicted in Arizona train robbery for stealing nearly $5M worth of Nike shoes. What we know\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Light rail crosses into south Phoenix for the first time Trains crossed over the Salt River Bridge for the first time on Jan. 30, 2025, as testing expanded south toward the end of the line at Baseline Road.\n\nEleven individuals have been indicted for stealing over $440,000 worth of Nike shoes from a BNSF train traveling through northern Arizona, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona.\n\nCourt records state that on Jan. 13, Noe Cecena-Castro, a Mexican national, and 10 others were arrested for involvement in the Nike train robbery. Authorities believe they were working together to pack and transport about 1,900 pairs of unreleased Nike shoes.\n\nAbout 11 a.m., a BNSF train was stopped in Perrin, Arizona. Shortly after, a BNSF police officer spotted several cases of Nike shoes beside the stationary train.\n\nLaw enforcement later found a U-Haul truck and a privately owned Ford Econoline truck nearby, both seen near the site where the Nike shoes were stolen. Several individuals were observed loading the Nike cases into the U-Haul.\n\nBoth trucks were searched by law enforcement and found to contain 1,985 pairs of unreleased Nike shoes, worth over $440,000. The rest of the crew were transported in a nearby Chevy Tahoe, which had also been seen in the area.\n\nTrain heist uptick\n\nThis follows a string of train thefts from northern Arizona and California over the past 15 years with a notable uptick in the last two years.\n\nThe U.S. Homeland Security Department reports that the suspects are often part of transnational theft organizations originating in Sinaloa, Mexico, and operating out of California and Arizona.\n\nIn October 2024, two individuals were arrested after a Yavapai County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy responded to a train burglary report and chased four vehicles for miles along Interstate 40.\n\nIn December of the same year, a passing BNSF train spotted several Nike sneaker cases piled next to the tracks near Yampai, west of Williams along Route 66. Four U.S. citizens were charged with possession of stolen goods after the boxes were seized.\n\nOn Jan. 13, a BNSF police officer noticed Nike sneakers alongside the tracks, leading to the latest case.\n\nThe heists typically involve cutting air hoses to control where trains carrying valuable cargo stop. Criminal organizations specializing in train theft have used this dangerous method to derail cargo trains, some traveling at speeds of up to 70 mph.\n\nThis method involves multiple steps and separate crews to pull off a train theft.

And this time, it's got a new \"Midnight Navy\" makeover.\n\nTwo years after Nike SB whipped the sneaker community into a frenzy with the Jordan 4 Pine Green, an instant sell-out that had people queueing around the block outside skate stores, a follow-up colorway is coming.\n\nThe skate sneaker is set to get its second release and it has adopted navy blue paneling for the occasion. It\u2019s not quite the original Military Blue AJ4, but it looks mighty similar.\n\nAnd the similarities between this shoe and the OG Jordan 4 from 1989 go beyond just the colorway: it\u2019s also in the shape of the shoe.

We\u2019re turning the clock back to the early 2010s when the DMV-based rap artist was the go-to individual to bring energy to a pair of sneakers. Wale Folarin\u2019s feet were basically billboards for the Swoosh, and that fact that he wore the sample size 9 made it easier for this seemingly under-the-table partnership to continue. Whenever Wale wore a pair of upcoming Foamposites, it was front page news.\n\nRumors of a Wale x Nike collaboration were in perpetual circulation throughout the first half of the 2010s decade, but no such project ever happened (although he may have had involvement in the short-lived I-95 Posite Max Boot). The channel of sample products gradually slowed to a full stop as well as Nike went into the \u201cinfluencer\u201d route, choosing the likes of Bella Hadid instead of partnering with people who, you know, actually care about the brand. It wasn\u2019t until the DMV Foamposite launch in 2024 that Nike actually worked with the artist on an official level. Better late than never.\n\nDuring Friday night\u2019s Nike Future Game, Wale was spotted wearing a never-before-seen Nike sample-a throwback to the era of Wale providing first/early looks at Nike footwear coming down the pipeline. The photos were shared by @higherlxng as well as Frank Cooker on Instagram.\n\n1 of 3\n\nNot much is known about this model, but it appears to be some type of molded upper with the distinct ankle collar shape of the Zoom Hyperflight. It\u2019s got a bit of that early 2000s Nike Basketball energy championed by Eric Avar and Aaron Cooper. It is indeed confirmed to be a Nike Basketball product.\n\nNike is an all out fight to reclaim the energy it once held onto throughout the 2010s. It\u2019ll require the right combination of product, partnerships, pricing, and people-pleasing, a formula they\u2019re still trying to figure out in the post John Donahoe era. Good-looking performance product like the Pegasus Premium and teaming with actual sneaker fanatics like Wale will help right a lot of the missteps.",

Like its namesake, the new SHAI 001 signature shoe harmonizes comfort, containment, durability and style in a performance silhouette that delivers an exceptional experience on and off the court.\n\nSince becoming creative director of Converse Basketball in 2024, Gilgeous-Alexander has been instrumental in designing every facet of his signature logo and shoe, imbuing the project with his artistic vision and creative sensibility. From the outset, he shared several hand-drawn sketches with the Converse product and design teams that ultimately inspired the final design of the SHAI 001, his first signature shoe.\n\n\u201cWe gave Shai creative control over the design of the shoe in a way only Converse can. Then we went to work leveraging the resources of Converse and all the innovation of NIKE, Inc. to proudly deliver the SHAI 001,\u201d says Jared Carver, Converse CEO and President. \u201cConverse invented the first basketball shoe, and we have been there for so many of the sport\u2019s beloved moments over the last hundred years. We are confident the SHAI 001 will help inspire and inform the next wave of basketball footwear and return Converse to its rightful place at the heart of the game.\u201d\n\nThe SHAI 001 is engineered to deliver elite-level performance on and off the court, leveraging the full resources and innovation of Converse and NIKE, Inc.\n\nThe silhouette showcases Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s approach to design, blending worlds to create a signature model that\u2019s entirely original and uniquely him. Every detail has been meticulously crafted and curated to create a shoe as versatile as Gilgeous-Alexander himself \u2014 from materials and colors to a locking zipper that allows for multiple styling options.\n\n\u201cI poured my heart and soul into the SHAI 001, and I\u2019m proud to share it with the world,\u201d says Gilgeous-Alexander. \u201cFrom performance to design, every aspect of this shoe reflects my passion for the game and my commitment to pushing its boundaries. We made the SHAI 001 a versatile shoe for everyone \u2014 from the athlete who\u2019s in the gym three times a day to the kids who just want to express themselves on or off the court.\u201d\n\nThat expression shines through Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s personalized design details, beginning with his signature logo, which serves as a symbol of his duality as an athlete and creative, including a nod to his jersey number.\n\nIt also extends to the silhouette\u2019s zipper: a bold statement of customization that allows for multiple wear options. The zipper works in tandem with an inner bootie, webbing and ghillie lacing system to provide containment and adjustability that\u2019s equally suited for the hardwood and everyday life.\n\nA puffed upper features a winged shroud that adds dimension and volume to the silhouette, while additional padding in the tongue helps ensure a snug and comfortable fit.\n\nA unibody molded design offers a futuristic vibe, and a forefoot Nike Zoom Air unit provides spring with every step, ensuring peak court feel and connectivity. Meanwhile, a radial traction pattern is designed to deliver quick cuts, allowing for seamless changes in direction and explosive movement on the court.\n\nThe silhouette will debut at NBA All-Star Weekend in the Butter colorway and will be available in a limited global release at select retailers in fall 2025. Follow @Converse, @ConverseHoops and @Shai for more information \u2014 and keep your eyes locked on Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s feet as the NBA season continues.\n\n",

It also sent former staffers crawling out of the woodwork, eager to share\u2014albeit anonymously\u2014their negative experiences working for the couple.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Tom Sachs (@tomsachs)\n\nThe complaints, first published in Curbed and then in an article by this reporter, were serious, and Nike quickly took notice. One complaint was about Sachs wearing only his underwear in a Zoom meeting with Nike. (The branding Sachs used for Nike hinted at issues with the kind of work environment he maintained, such as the phrase \u201cwork like a slave\u201d initially appearing on the Mars Yard 2.0 box.)\n\nA guerrilla campaign on the streets of New York from artist Corey Escoto had encouraged the brand to \u201cJust Drop Him,\u201d a play on the Nike slogan written in Sachs-like lettering beneath a roughly drawn Nike swoosh.\n\nBefore the accusations, the Mars Yard 3.0 had been rumored for release over the 2023 holidays. But Nike expressed \u201cconcern\u201d about the reports and two months later confirmed that \u201cwe are not working with Tom\u2019s studio at this time and have no release dates planned.\u201d\n\nAt first, Sachs categorically denied the accusations against him. But after his Nike deal blew up, he expressed \u201cregret\u201d and promised to \u201cprofessionalize our operations\u201d with a formal HR\u2014while insisting \u201cI have never harassed anyone.\u201d\n\nSachs did not respond to my inquiries about whether he had learned anything from the complaints against him, or what changes he had implemented. But his track record with the company as a consumer favorite likely went a long way toward smoothing over any concerns about his behavior: Complex noted that the Mars Yard 2.0 \u201cis heralded as one of Nike\u2019s best models from the 2010s and unworn pairs can fetch thousands of dollars on the secondary market.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by HYPEBEAST (@hypebeast)\n\nJust 18 months after the allegations first surfaced, last September, the company announced plans to once again work with Sachs, issuing a statement that \u201cTom has demonstrated and recommitted to fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity. We can confirm that our work with Tom will continue and this next chapter of NikeCraft will uphold our shared passion for team, product, and storytelling excellence.\u201d\n\nTwo years on, Sachs and Hoover have clearly bounced back from the bad press. Hoover kept her book deal, and published The Motherload: Episodes From the Brink of Motherhood, about her struggles with postpartum depression (and a warts-and-all account of her marriage), in January. (The couple had a second child, a daughter, last year.)\n\nWithout directly addressing the way she and Sachs have treated their staff, Hoover recently spoke about hiring caretakers for her children to the New York Times, saying \u201cIsn\u2019t spending money to give someone a job and help make parenting more of a delight the whole point of working hard?\u201d\n\nThe resumption of the Nike partnership, and the glossing over of all the allegations of bullying, abuse, and harassment, feels like something of a sign of the times. In the year 2025, are there any repercussions for anything, ever, anymore?",

Underneath, a heavy dose of cream leather brings some earthy contrast, balancing out the vivid shades above.\n\nAs a true GR, expect the Nike Air Force 1 Low \u201cDoraemon\u201d to crop up on Nike.com and partnering retailers in the coming weeks. A $125 retail price is expected. Catch close looks included below, and keep an eye on our Sneaker Release Dates page for further info as it comes.",

The Nike campus was closed yesterday as the icy snow covered the streets, so we had to adjust plans for our final day of the Nike Trail Team summit. I\u2019m en route to my first race of the year on the island of Gran Canaria, but I\u2019ve been in Portland for the past five days.\n\nThis is the first time in recent years that I\u2019m aware of that the whole Nike Trail Team has converged on campus to meet together, and certainly my first time seeing everyone on the team in one place. I hadn\u2019t met everyone on the team yet, and one of the highlights was connecting with each member of the trail team and getting to know them beyond a quick hello at races. It\u2019s been action-packed, fun and productive, inspiring and tiring.\n\nWithout getting into all the specifics, here\u2019s what our days looked like. We\u2019d start the day off with a quick breakfast at the hotel before heading over to Forest Park or the Nike campus gym for a run or cross training. Media people were out and about in the forest getting pictures and videos as we ran. Some days we\u2019d toss on a pair of shoes we\u2019d talked about with product teams the previous afternoon to take them for a test loop. During those miles we\u2019d be focused on how the shoe fit, how the foam felt, if our steps felt stable and our feet secure, any feedback we might want to report back.\n\nA morning run through Forest Park with teammates Christian Allen and Anthony Costales.\n\nOur next stop would usually be the campus locker rooms for showers and then the Lebron innovation building for lunch. The Lebron building is insane. It\u2019s where some of Nike\u2019s brightest minds are spinning up new ideas and experimenting with what you may see athletes wearing in the future. Seriously so cool seeing some of what\u2019s being considered and iterated on that could be huge for trail running, it got me very excited about being able to use it when it\u2019s ready.\n\nThe rest of the afternoons were usually filled with meetings and labs. Product teams came prepared with discussion questions and samples for us to wear, jog around in, pick apart, and brainstorm about. I felt like our feedback was truly valued and was helping shape these products that will be released. In addition to collecting our thoughts and feelings about these products, for several of them they\u2019d have us hop on treadmills in various controlled environments where they could capture quantitative data. Sensors and cameras everywhere. How much did our efficiency change in these shoes vs those shoes, in this apparel vs what we\u2019d been using previously? Curiosity took over and I\u2019d ask questions about the rationale behind certain tests, and they\u2019d break it down for me and talk me through the data they\u2019d later analyze from my lab, giving me a live preview. I had never realized the amount of real science going on behind the scenes during the innovation and testing process, but it was intense.\n\nFashion is completely lost on me, but the past few days have also given me more of an appreciation for design. Nike has a dedicated color expert, and design is discussed frequently. I\u2019m learning that colors and designs are used strategically to highlight special features and technologies within shoes and apparel. Colors evoke feelings, and getting to know an athlete\u2019s mindset while training and racing shapes the feelings that are targeted in those designs.\n\nClearly Nike\u2019s got some experience having athletes around, because they knew we\u2019d want constant access to food and drinks. Healthy fresh juices, snacks, and frequent catered meals kept us happy and got us through to the evening, when we\u2019d go out for an activity and dinner with one of the Nike teams. We all watched the Super Bowl together, got some great Peruvian food with leadership teams, had pizza and got our competitive juices flowing racing Go Carts with the innovation teams, etc.\n\nOn our final full day in Portland, a snowstorm closed down campus and product teams came to our hotel instead. We commandeered the main floor with discussions of the Nike trail shoe lineup and more brainstorming. By then, I\u2019d started thinking about the next leg of this adventure\u2014the trip out to race Transgrancanaria. So that brings me to now, sitting on the tarmac while this flight is delayed, hoping that it can get de-iced and take off in time to make my connecting flight in New York. I\u2019ll be lining up a week from today for an epic cross-island showdown. Stay tuned for a little surprise dropping as the race starts\u2026",

The busy upper \u2013 inspired by models from the Nike Pegasus series \u2013 favors a pitch-dark finish that allows for the slightest contrast to revel in the spotlight. Vibrant 'Hyper Pink,' then, animates panels near the tongue, as well as ribbed components at the forefoot and heel. A matte 'Metallic Silver' also joins the mix via branding on the pair, but the P-6000's star is unquestionably the 'Black/Hyper Pink' duo.\n\nRIDELINER-assisted cushioning underfoot also indulges in a near-fluorescent shade of the titular rosy hue, further cementing the style as a fashionable option. The two-tone color scheme has no association with the original Air Yeezy from April 2009, but it's equally-worthy of the 'Blink' nickname.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the 'Black/Hyper Pink' P-6000 ahead.

The Air CB 34 was designed by the legendary Wilson Smith III, who is widely recognized as the first Black designer in athletic footwear. Along with Barkley\u2019s Air CB 34, Smith was responsible for iconic sneakers including the Air More Uptempo, Air Jordan 16 and Air Jordan 17, among others.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the \u201cTriple White\u201d colorway, the \u201cGodzilla\u201d Nike Air CB 34 is expected to be released during the second half of \u201925 with a SKU of 316940-001 and a holiday-timed launch expected. Images of the latest reissue have yet to surface, but the pair is expected to resemble previous retros.

            "content": "Absent in the raging debate over trade policy and tariffs is a truth about the economy that those of us in poorer countries know all too well: U.S. corporations and their billionaire owners profit from massive supply chains that exploit low-wage workers in the Global South.\n\nFor decades these unregulated supply chains have been praised as \u201cdevelopment.\u201d But in reality, they entrench low pay and disastrous working conditions, fostering a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d for workers globally as well as in the United States.\n\nPerhaps no company is a more influential offender than Nike.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, the anti-sweatshop movement forced Nike to end its use of child labor. But since then, Nike has actually figured out how to pay an even smaller portion of its retail sticker price to the workers who make its products.\n\nIn 2022, Nike authorized $18 billion in stock buybacks, which primarily benefit wealthy investors, while garment workers \u2014 the vast majority of whom are women in the Global South \u2014 faced massive wage losses and wage theft during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLeni, a member of the Indonesian union Gabungan Serikat Buruh Indonesia (GSBI), makes Nike shoes in a factory with thousands of workers, most of them women like her.\n\n\u201cI want the world to understand the truth of workers\u2019 lives behind these products,\u201d Leni told me recently. \u201cI had a baby and another small child when COVID hit in 2020. The factory slashed our wages and offered no support. We couldn\u2019t even put basic food on our families\u2019 tables. As we learned that Nike made record profits during the pandemic but offered us no relief, we were furious. There is no Nike and no profits without us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy factory has not even paid the mandated minimum wage increases in my region,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have had enough! We demand that Nike end wage theft in its supply chain and pay us what we deserve.\u201d\n\nLeni is part of a group of union activists from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and India with a plan to fight back. These brave workers have committed to speak publicly despite the risks of retaliation.\n\nThe Asia Floor Wage Alliance (AFWA) has brought together unions across our region. We are organizing across borders in a transformative fight for living wages and human rights protections. The \u201cFight the Heist\u201d campaign \u2014 coordinated by AFWA andGlobal Labor Justice (GLJ) \u2014 has focused its demands on Nike, with its supply chain of over 1 million garment workers.\n\nOur support in the U.S. labor movement has grown too. In July 2024, the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the Communications Workers of America Women\u2019s Committee joined GLJ to organize actions in eight cities across the United States. We\u2019re so excited to see allies in the U.S. relate to our fight against corporate greed and for the value of women\u2019s work.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the Fight the Heist worker activists ran hundreds of organizing meetings with their coworkers. They discussed the gross inequalities of Nike\u2019s supply chain \u2014 for instance, Nike\u2019s CEO got paid more than 24,000 times more than a worker in Sri Lanka making Nike\u2019s clothing in 2023.\n\nAt the end of those conversations, activists challenged their coworkers to join a public photo petition. Through the petition, workers are demanding that Nike recognize their essential work and provide the pay they deserve.\n\nNow, over 1,000 workers across the region have decided to stand up together. On March 21, their photos will go public as allies across the world share the petition and demand that Nike\u2019s executives look them in the eye.\n\nThese abusive practices only make it easier for corporations to lower wages in working standards in the United States as well. So will you join us?\n\nTake the \u201cOne Thousand Photos \u2014 One Thousand Shares\u201d pledge at ActionNetwork.org, share it widely, and support the union activists leading the fight to transform garment supply chains.",

            "content": "I am always on the hunt for the perfect pieces that match my lifestyle, which is why I've had my eyes on the Nike 24.7 collection ever since it was announced.\n\nAs a fashion editor, I spend a lot of my time at work, and because of that, I\u2019ve made it my life\u2019s mission to diversify my free time with workouts, dance classes, and my indoor volleyball league. That means I usually spend most of my time running between dinners and games and always lack the perfect post-activity outfit. This past week, I left my volleyball game wearing a hodgepodge of clothing items: The sweaty T-shirt I wore during the game, a pair of patterned comfy pants I pulled out of my closet for my 45-minute subway ride, shiny silver western boots, and a burgundy faux fur coat \u2014 pieces originally part of my NYFW outfit from earlier in the day.\n\nThis rather embarrassing outfit cocktail made me realize that I needed better, relaxed pieces that could work at any time of the day. So when I learned about the Nike 24.7 collection, worn by Serena Williams herself during Super Bowl LIX, I knew I had to try it. (What can I say? As a distinguished hater myself, born on the same day as Kendrick Lamar, I just couldn't resist seeing her skirt swishing through the wind as she crip walked while staring directly at the camera!)\n\nSerena Williams wearing the Nike 24.7 Collection while performing onstage during Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Emilee Chinn/Getty Images\n\nI opted for a tan sweater and matching pants because, again, I sadly am in the frigid winter in New York City, and skirts sans tights are just not on my list of things to wear right now. I decided to try out these pieces in the gym to see their durability and sweat levels. And then I wore it again to work, snazzy-ing it up to see if I could convince my bosses that sweats are, in fact, appropriate workwear.\n\nAiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue Aiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue\n\nThe Nike 24.7 collection is meant to support an athlete's complete lifestyle with an elevated and polished look \u2014 from sport to life, mindset to movement, daily grind to daily comfort. \u201cNike Training is dedicated to supporting all athletes to be better \u2014 whether for sport or life,\u201d says Jaclyn Safley, GM of global Nike training women's. \u201cThe Nike 24.7 collection embodies this commitment, delivering unmatched innovation with performance materials, ultimate comfort, and an elevated fit thoughtfully crafted for every body and every move.\u201d\n\nNike 24.7 unveiled two new technical materials that pair with the brand\u2019s industry-leading Dri-FIT technology to offer a new standard of comfort in elevated, polished athletic style. ImpossiblySoft is a refined, Spacer-knit fabric with a four-way stretch that offers everyday comfort with a luxurious feel. The material is featured in the Nike 24.7 collection\u2019s women\u2019s and men\u2019s half-zip and crew-neck silhouettes, as well as a women\u2019s jogger and men\u2019s pants. PerfectStretch is a tailored, four-way stretch fabric that delivers effortless comfort and a polished look and feel. The material is featured in the pleated skirt, wide-leg pants and woven shirt for women, and chino and five-pocket pants for men.\n\nAiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue Aiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue\n\nI\u2019m wearing the Women's Dri-FIT High-Waisted Loose Wide-Leg Pants and the Women's Dri-FIT Oversized 1/2-Zip Top in an XL in these pics. And while I couldn't tell you how exactly the clothes are engineered, I can tell you that the fit is great and very comfortable. They are also winter-approved. I layered a long-sleeved shirt underneath and wore a Canada Goose coat on top, and it was rather warm during my commute, which was a pleasant surprise. I received two sets, one in an XL and XXL, and both were comfortable with a relaxed fit. The material is uber soft and warm, and though I've yet to wash them, they withstood my busy days without any hurdles or smells.\n\nAiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue Aiyana Ishmael for Teen Vogue\n\nWhile I paired my picks with sneakers, which definitely toned down the look (sorry, it was snowing outside!), their design actually resembles very comfortable slacks, so with the right top and shoes, you can easily wear these as office pants as well. As someone who will always choose comfort first when getting dressed, these pieces will surely become my go-to moving forward.",

            "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) \u2014 Nearly a dozen people have been indicted in connection to a train heist that occurred in Northern Arizona.\n\nFederal documents obtained by Arizona\u2019s Family Investigates reveal most of those people were in the United States illegally, and several of them had previously been removed from the country.\n\nHow they were caught\n\nAuthorities say that on Jan. 13, a BNSF train reported a cut air hose near Perrin, Arizona, about 20 miles northwest of Williams. That alerted authorities because they say it\u2019s known that criminals often do it to force the train into an emergency stop.\n\nFederal agents say it\u2019s so the crooks can control when the train is stopped to steal the cargo, but it\u2019s dangerous because it can cause the train to derail.\n\nA short time later, a BNSF police officer drives by and notices about 200 to 250 \u201cmaster cases\u201d of Nike shoes next to the railroad. Agents say each master case contains six pairs of shoes of an unreleased style with a suggested retail price of $225 per pair.\n\nAbout eight miles away, a white Ford box truck marked with the word \u201cEddie\u2019s\u201d was seen with a temporary license plate registered out of Peoria. Arizona\u2019s Family spoke with the business owner with markings on the truck who said that he sold the truck in November. Later in the day, a blue Toyota Camry was spotted near where the truck was. Williams police conducted a traffic stop and identified the driver and the passenger.\n\nFour trackers had been placed within the Nike shoes. Later that evening, the Ford truck was seen headed toward the shoes, and not much later, a U-Haul was spotted speeding off in the same direction.\n\nCourt documents say the U-Haul was spotted near the shoes\u2019 site, and when law enforcement arrived again, only six boxes were left. Agents say one of the trackers matched the truck\u2019s location, and the other truckers matched the U-Haul\u2019s location.\n\nAuthorities maintained surveillance until state troopers pulled over the drivers of the Ford truck on Interstate 40 near Kingman, Arizona. At that location, the driver and his passenger got out of the truck, and the driver tried to run away, jumping over a barb-wired fence and hiding in a tree structure, but he was ultimately found injured by law enforcement.\n\nWhat charges do they face\n\nDuring the search, the agent found 150 master cases of the unreleased pair of shoes, with an estimated retail value of $202,500.\n\nAuthorities later found the U-Haul truck abandoned, but investigators were able to trace a large SUV traveling in the same area as the U-Haul. Coconino County sheriff deputies conducted a traffic stop that night in Williams, where Nunez-Mares was detained and identified as the driver with eight passengers.\n\nCourt papers say Nunez-Mares rented the U-Haul in Williams and was due to return it in Cudahy, California, near Los Angeles a few days after the heist.\n\nTen of the 11 people arrested were in the U.S. illegally, and four were previously removed from the country. All are facing possession of stolen goods from an interstate shipment and their respective immigration-related charges.\n\nArizona\u2019s Family previously reported about how bandits in December made off nearly $50,000 worth of Nike shoes bound for Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

I missed that experience this year, so I have slowly but surely been getting caught up.\n\nWe ran through some of the highs (Jeep, Uber Eats) and lows (Pfizer, Bud Light) with the guys from Crain & Company on Monday (you can watch that here). But there are a couple others I wanted to talk about that were specifically geared towards women.\n\nThe Nike Ad\n\nYou may know Jennifer Sey from her appearances on this show. She used to work at Levi\u2019s and was a star gymnast growing up. She started a company called XX-XY Athletics and has been pressuring Nike to publicly stand up for women and girls. Last fall, XX-XY Athletics released an ad called \u201cDear Nike\u201d with that exact message.\n\nMaybe Nike saw it because they did create a Super Bowl commercial about women. Great, we are halfway there. But is it about keeping men out of their sports? No, it is about\u2026 how America is full of sexist pigs. Watch:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win, so win\u201d? I\u2019m sorry, they missed the boat entirely. That is not today\u2019s issue. They are ignoring the elephant in the living room.\n\nI went to college from 1988 to 1992, and these were the messages they were telling me then about being a woman in America. It was, \u2018You can be emotional; you can be ambitious; you can stand out; you can win.\u2019 Hello, Nike, 2025 called and they want an updated ad that matches the issues of the day, like what is happening in girls sports.\n\nThe NFL Ad\n\nNot to be outdone, the NFL decided to drop its own ad \u2013 for a reason that remains a mystery to me \u2013 that it is completely consistent with what we just saw from Nike. They are also trying to highlight what a sexist society we live in. Watch:\n\nHelp me out here because, again, this whole thing seems to be set in the 1980s. They\u2019ve got the razor glasses; the guy has a mullet; he has the collar turned up; they\u2019ve got the rock band. They are also trying to pretend that this girl \u2013 when playing against a team of \u201cThe Brads,\u201d who are, of course, doofuses because the left loves to portray men, especially white men, that way \u2013 smokes them all. That is not how it would actually go.\n\nWhat is actually happening when girls are playing against boys is they are getting hurt, they are getting beaten, and they are in danger. They are in the pool with the likes of Lia Thomas and are getting absolutely crushed by full body lengths. That is what actually happens because women are at a physical disadvantage. But in this imaginary NFL world, women are crushing \u201cBrad\u201d and guys like him because\u2026 girl power?!\n\nAll of this, by the way, is meant to promote girls flag football, which is played against other girls. If the NFL wants to get girls playing flag football, why wouldn\u2019t they show girls playing against each other, and how fun it is, and how competitive and fierce it can be? Why do you have to make guys into the big loser oafs who are dumb and outdated? Why would you do that?\n\nThis is all part of wokeness, or the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d as Elon Musk calls it. The American people are over it, and we won a whole election in order to send that message.\n\nYou can check out Megyn\u2019s full analysis by tuning in to episode 1,006 on YouTube, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you like to listen.

            "content": "Mandy, Travis and I all wanted to see how the Alphafly 3 stood up to some tough workouts. Coincidentally, all three of us have been dealing with either illness or injury recently, so our test runs also served as our first workouts after taking a bit of time off. I knew I\u2019d need all the help I could get to run at my sub-threshold pace for the first time in over a month.\n\nMy workout was four sets of five minutes at 6:45 pace with 90 seconds of jogging recovery. With all the hype around this shoe, I wondered if they would feel like rockets on my feet and I wouldn\u2019t even need to try to hit my paces. Sadly, this was not the case. But I did notice, about a half-mile into my warm up, my pace was much faster than it would normally be. That was a good sign, I thought to myself.\n\nBeginning the workout, my first interval felt tough. It was hard to get down to the pace I wanted to be at and I was worried for the rest of the workout. But the next three intervals actually felt a lot smoother and I found myself faster than my planned pace! While the shoes don\u2019t feel like rockets on my feet, they do feel propulsive. They\u2019re really chunky looking, so part of me wondered if they would feel a little bit bulky underfoot, especially when trying to run fast and turn corners, but that was not the case. They felt nice and smooth, even when making tight turns in my neighborhood, and I was able to forget about my feet and zone in on the intervals.\n\nI\u2019d really like to test these shoes on a steadier effort, like a tempo run, to see how they feel. This is exactly what Travis did, although his tempo effort is much faster than mine!\n\n\u201cA great sign for a racing shoe like the Alphafly is when you look at your watch at the end of a workout and are surprised with how fast you went,\u201d he says. \u201cI was trying to run at my marathon/half marathon effort for a three-mile tempo. I\u2019m just getting back into the swing of things coming off a bout of bronchitis, so I don\u2019t feel sharp right now. I was running based on feel and not looking at my watch. I was expecting to be around 5:45 to 5:55 pace, but I was shocked to see that my average pace was 5:29. While the Alphafly 3 didn't feel like I had jet packs attached to my feet, it did feel like a super comfortable and snappy shoe. I can definitely see myself racing a half marathon or full marathon in these!\u201d\n\nTravis is the only one of us who had worn a previous version of the Alphafly, and he thought the latest version was a big improvement.\n\n\u201cI always felt like the original Alphafly was a bit too soft for me and I wished it was just a tad bit firmer to give it more energy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe extra softness felt like it tired out my legs at the end of long races. From the start of my warm-up in the Alphafly 3, I could tell that Nike read my mind and adjusted the foam a bit with some more responsiveness. I also felt the added support from the wider carbon-fiber plate, which made me feel like I could power through my stride more efficiently and not have to tire out my stabilizer muscles too much.\u201d\n\nMandy, an ultra-marathoner who detests shorter races, surprisingly found herself Googling \u201c5K races near me\u201d after her first test run.\n\n\u201cI did speedwork in these shoes and, my goodness, I felt as if I were flying,\u201d she says. \u201cI'm naturally a forefoot runner and these shoes really encouraged my gait. I felt a quicker turnover as I ran, the geometry of the shoe made it so that I wanted to quickly take off again after striking the ground. Part of me, okay most of me, hates speedwork and running fast but this shoe made it feel effortless.\u201d\n\nSo what exactly makes the Alphafly 3 so fast? There are three key technologies to know. First, Nike\u2019s proprietary Air Zoom Units. The Alphafly has two of them, both located in the forefoot. Inside the units are tensile threads that act as springs, contracting as you land and popping up as you take off.\n\nAnd if springs under your feet weren\u2019t enough, the Alphafly 3 also uses a full-length carbon-fiber plate. The plate works in conjunction with Nike\u2019s ZoomX foam, their lightest and most resilient foam, to provide even more of that responsive energy. These technologies combine to return energy back to you, helping you increase your efficiency and decrease the time it takes to fatigue.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself, but I think you\u2019ll see me wearing these on Marathon Monday this year!",

Consistent with reforms first announced by the league last May, the changes for this year\u2019s uniforms include:\n\nLarger numbers and letters for player names on jerseys\n\nIndividualized tailoring on uniform pants, instead of placing players into one of four preset fits\n\nHeavier fabric for road uniforms, with home ones to follow in 2026\n\nBetter wicking of sweat on road grays, as well as improved color matching of gray pants and jerseys\n\nJayne Kamin\u2014Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nBefore the shifts, the Nike Vapor Premier designs had a wide range of problems, including a see-through nature to the pants, the pooling of sweat on some players\u2019 uniforms, names that were harder to read, and pants that ripped more easily after sliding on the base paths.\n\nSolving a Problem\n\nMLB and Nike initially defended the Vapor Premier design last year, touting the lightness and breathability and insisting that it would soon become widely favored across the league. Not only did that not happen, but the uniform issue quickly became a national punchline, including on late-night talk shows.\n\nThe situation quickly grew so fractious that Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin\u2014whose company had been producing the Nike designs as essentially a subcontractor\u2014said last year, \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything as we\u2019ve been told, and we\u2019re getting the shit kicked out of us. So that\u2019s not fun. [The] biggest thing I probably learned is if we\u2019re involved in something, we need to make sure that everybody better be on board. \u2026 They got certain players on board, not all players on board.\u201d\n\nThe MLB Players Association then applied additional pressure to help make the changes happen. Ultimately, the entire saga represented a somewhat rare instance across the sports industry in which mistakes were publicly acknowledged with little qualification and substantive corrections made.\n\nMLB, meanwhile, is also returning this year to players wearing their own team uniforms in the All-Star Game, which had been done for more than 80 years before another widely criticized shift in 2019 to custom American and National League uniforms. That prior shift for the All-Star Game helped lead to the Vapor Premier design now being corrected.",

Ahead of Summer 2025, the \"presidential\" design has emerged in a handful of new styles \u2013 including a 'Light Khaki/Black' update.\n\nAkin to so many other makeovers of Kilgore's 42-year-old creation, the newly-surfaced Air Force 1 Low keeps things straightforward. The titular 'Light Khaki' tone covers the bulk of the leather upper and old school sole unit. Inner lining and tongue labels follow suit. Profile swooshes and other branding across the sneaker deviate in pitch-dark contrast, adding yet another tally to the AF1's expansive two-tone catalog. Stitching across the pair also indulges in a 'Black' finish, injecting more personality into the simple execution. Lastly, the tried-and-proven outsole dons a speckled pattern that indicates it forms part of Nike's upcycling initiative.\n\nEnjoy detailed photos of the 'Light Khaki' Air Force 1 Low ahead. An official Nike.com release date hasn't been disclosed by the brand as of yet, but expect pairs to land by May for around $115.\n\nFor more from the Nike, Inc. empire, check out the remaining Air Jordan Releases in 2025, which include the Air Jordan 4 'White Cement' retro expected in May.",

(Photo: U.S. Patent Office)\n\nThe patent also shows a bottom look at the unusual outsole, as well as an X-ray view of where the systems (and their connections) could be situated to control support via fluid chambers.\n\nThe February 11 filing indicates a design that will have \u201cadjustable foot pressure\u201d in the sole of the shoe. (Photo: U.S. Patent Office)\n\nInterestingly, the schematics also show a unique design that would provide a connection between the shoe and an external power source when at rest.\n\nNike\u2019s patent filing also includes designs to charge the systems built into the shoes. (Photo: U.S. Patent Office)\n\nThe document goes into great detail on every aspect of the design, including pumping systems, foot support systems, pressure sensors, geartrains, and even smaller concepts like seals, flow rates, and more.\n\nOutside Run has reached out to Nike for comment, but has not heard back as of this writing.

As far as eagle-eyed sneakerheads were concerned, however, KDot\u2019s biggest flex of all was just barely peeking out from beneath those flared cuffs: a clean pair of Nike Air DT Max \u201996s in black and white.

Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nThe Nike Air Diamond Turf Max \u201996, first released in\u2014you guessed it!\u20141996, was created by legendary Nike designer Tinker Hatfield as the third signature sneaker of NFL legend and all-around fashion icon Deion Sanders.

The shoe boasts a visible Air unit in the heel, an oversized strap over the laces, and a taller-than-normal tongue, all of which adds to the delightful \u201990s vibes.\n\nMore of a cult classic than a mainstream smash, the Nike Air DT Max \u201996 nonetheless has developed enough of a diehard fanbase that the Swoosh has seen fit to re-release it relatively frequently over the past several years. In fact, if you hurry, the the two-tone \u201cColorado Away\u201d version that Kendrick sported last night is still available right now for $170 at Foot Locker in a whole bunch of sizes.",

According to the company, a total of 37 million U.S. households saw the Nike logo\u2014which the company said was 99% of the Super Bowl\u2019s total audience\u2014at an average frequency of 371 times.\n\n\u201cNike\u2019s presence was unavoidable,\u201d Navin added. \u201cAt an average frequency of 371 views per household, this wasn\u2019t just brand exposure; it was a masterclass in brand visibility.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the brand\u2019s in-game presence, Nike\u2019s \u201cSo Win\u201d commercial, created by Wieden+Kennedy Portland, was one of the best-reviewed ads of the night among ad industry creatives canvassed by ADWEEK. Additionally, Business Insider reports the commercial helped the brand generate the most social media engagement of any advertiser, per data from social and consumer intelligence company Meltwater.\n\nBetween the logo exposure and the social media buzz, the night was a huge success for the company, especially considering the Super Bowl\u2019s extra pricey real estate in 2025.

The star appeared only a small number of times compared to 2024\u2019s Big Game.\n\nOf course, the very fact that there\u2019s a phenomenon called the Swift Effect means the singer will likely shake it off.\n\nWatch Nike\u2019s Super Bowl 59 Ad, \u201cSo Win,\u201d below.",

After being tipped off in June of 2024, official images of the Air Force 1 SK8 have finally emerged.\n\nAt first glance, the Air Force 1 SK8 looks awfully similar to your run-of-the-mill pair of Forces. The only obvious tweaks are thicker laces and a bit of extra padding in the tongue; Zoom Air insoles and other hidden tooling changes are unconfirmed at the time of this writing. Further alluding its skateboarding identity, the shoe doesn\u2019t feature SK8 branding or any other defining iconography.

So when Kendrick Lamar took the stage for the Super Bowl halftime show last night, it wasn't easy to deduce exactly what he had on his feet. (Plus, we were having trouble prying our attention away from his denim.)\n\nWell, thanks to the good folks over at Footwear News, we've now got a solid idea of the sneakers the Compton rapper wore for his performance of \"Not Like Us\" in New Orleans. While some outlets have reported that they're Diamond Turf 3's, the more plausible answer\u2014you've got to really focus on the shape of the paneling at the toe\u2014is that he was rocking the Air DT Max '96 in the \"Colorado Away\" colorway. First released in (you guessed it!) 1996, the Tinker Hatfield\u2013designed sneaker was made famous by Deion Sanders.\n\nThe version Lamar wore was released in September of last year and retailed for $170. But if you find yourself yearning to emulate his look from last night and can't splash out on Celine jeans or a custom Martine Rose leather jacket, you can find the sneakers for significantly less than their original price on StockX right now. Will the price creep up as Kendrick fans discover them and start buying? We can't say for sure, but it doesn't seem like an unreasonable prediction. Best to snag them now, while they're still flying a little under the radar. Fortune favors the bold.",

            "content": "Over the past 40 years, the Nike Dunk Low has surfaced in countless styles inspired by everything from Ben & Jerry's ice cream to the Grateful Dead's Dancing Bears. Recently, Peter Moore's iconic design has emerged in a few makeovers that nod to punk rock music and its historic venues, typical color palettes, and other touch points.\n\nThe 'Dunks Not Dead' and CBGB-inspired pair will soon be joined by a 'Pale Ivory'-covered option that also features a punk aesthetic. While the pair doesn't do much with its color palette, the distressed 'Off-Noir' panels around the heel seem at home alongside the aforementioned duo. Canvas and suede materials replace traditional leather construction across the upper, delivering a lighter package than normal. Branding on the tongue label and Achilles' heel overlay deviate from their surroundings in vibrant red, just as the Nike text on the insoles. Sock-liners also don a noisy black graphic, doubling-down on the rawness often associated with the punk genre.\n\nUnderfoot, Air Jordan 1-like outsoles indulge in a dark finish. Their speckled update, however, reveals that the shoe is part of Nike's Next Nature series, which aims to be more eco-friendly by upcycling materials.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the latest Dunk Low ahead. Firm Nike.com release details haven't been disclosed by the brand as of yet, but that's likely to change in the next two months. The pair is priced at $115.\n\nFor more news from the Swoosh empire, check out all remaining Air Jordan Releases in 2025, which include the Air Jordan 4 'White Cement' in May.",

Can\u2019t fill a stadium.\n\nThey can\u2019t speak up, flex or make demands. And they can\u2019t show off or break records.\n\nAs the leading champion of sport for more than five decades, Nike has a starkly different perspective, offering a call to athletes across the globe: Do it anyway \u2014 and redefine the expectations of sport along the way.\n\nThat mantra is at the heart of Nike\u2019s new brand anthem, \u201cSo Win,\u201d which speaks directly to athletes who win, lead and dominate despite constantly being told how they should act, what they can\u2019t do, and who they can\u2019t be.\n\nThe anthem, voiced by Doechii, also speaks to the driving story of today: the outstanding rise of women athletes. From record-breaking viewership to sold-out stadiums, women\u2019s sport isn\u2019t just growing \u2014 it\u2019s created an undeniable energy that\u2019s expanded the athletic landscape, showing a new picture of achievement and strength that reflects the power, skill and promise of these athletes putting in the work.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s sport isn\u2019t the future, it\u2019s right now. We\u2019re seeing it in packed arenas, in TV ratings, in the way people are showing up for the game like never before,\u201d says Nike signature athlete Sabrina Ionescu, who features in the anthem. \u201cCommanding attention isn\u2019t about being the loudest in the room. It\u2019s about making sure that when you step up, everyone takes notice.\u201d\n\nThrough \u201cSo Win,\u201d Nike\u2019s stance is clear: There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be the best.\n\nUnveiled during Super Bowl LIX, \u201cSo Win\u201d includes a 60-second anthem, athlete extensions, still photography and a social media campaign that illustrate Nike\u2019s unwavering belief in the limitless power of sport.\n\n\u201cAt Nike, we make sure the athlete is at the center of everything we do, from product creation to storytelling,\u201d says Nicole Graham, Chief Marketing Officer, NIKE, Inc. \u201cWe are at our best when we are representing the voice of the athlete and their voice becomes our voice. This brand anthem, featuring elite Nike athletes, is a perfect example of how we can inspire everyone to win, whatever that means for them.\u201d\n\nThe anthem draws on Ionescu, Jordan Chiles, Caitlin Clark, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, A\u2019ja Wilson, Sophia Wilson (formerly Smith) and several of their contemporaries from Nike\u2019s iconic roster of athletes, who together encourage everyone to block out the noise, dig in and let their hard work speak for itself.\n\nThrough the anthem, their everyday expression of confidence and their groundbreaking achievement in sport, these athletes prove what\u2019s possible when you embrace your full power.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t wait for attention, you take it. You put in the work; you stay ready; and, when the moment comes, you own it,\u201d says Chiles. \u201cWinning isn\u2019t just about medals. It\u2019s about overcoming, about proving to yourself that you\u2019re capable of more than you ever imagined. And doing it all authentically.\u201d\n\nSo win, whatever it takes.\n\n",

And it's an expensive bet: Some Super Bowl advertisers have spent more than $8 million to secure 30 seconds of airtime.\n\nNike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, detailed a turnaround plan in December. Hill rejoined Nike in October after a four-year hiatus. He was formerly the company's president of marketplace and consumer.\n\nSince taking the helm, Hill has called out Nike for certain missteps, such as offering too many discounts and shifting attention away from its relationships with wholesalers.\n\nThe company is also trying to make iconic sneaker brands like Jordans and Air Force 1s hot again by pulling back on supply to boost demand.\n\nNike's revenue slid 8% year over year to $12.4 billion during the three months ending November 30, the company said in December. Nike shares are down roughly 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nNike has also shaken up its marketing department in recent months to elevate its brand storytelling, as Adweek previously reported. Several company veterans returned to or were elevated in the marketing organization over the last year, including former vice president Nicole Hubbard Graham who was named marketing chief.\n\nNike seems to be banking on big cultural moments to get its brand back on track.\n\nThe company debuted a new ad timed around this month's Grammy Awards that highlighted the legacy of its 40-year-old Jordan Brand.\n\nJPMorgan analysts met with Hill and Nike financial chief Matthew Friend at an event on Thursday morning. In a research note recapping the meet and greet, the analysts said Nike execs cited \"excitement\" around Hubbard's return and the brand's representation at \"large consumer moments,\" including the Jordan campaign and a planned Super Bowl ad.\n\nHill told investors in December that Nike had to \"get back to putting sport at the center of everything that we do.\" He said the company would invest in \"big, bold brand marketing efforts\" and important sports moments.",

It was directed by lauded commercial director Kim Gehrig, and the soundtrack is Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d\n\nRapper Doechii\u2014whose recent Grammy Awards acceptance speech about defying stereotypes went viral\u2014provides the ad\u2019s voiceover. She addresses the fact that female athletes are often told how they can\u2019t behave or do certain things, before saluting their audacious dreams and relentless pursuit of winning.\n\nThe film concludes: \u201cYou can\u2019t win, so win.\u201d\n\nNike\u2019s focus on female athletes comes as women\u2019s sports experience an unprecedented surge in attention, support, and investment.\n\nThis year, women\u2019s sports will constitute an estimated 20% of all sports coverage across broadcasts, streaming, social, and digital media in the U.S.\u2014an increase from 6% in 2019, according to research from Wasserman\u2019s The Collective and RBC. Meanwhile, 82% of brands plan to increase their women\u2019s sports budget this year, according to Sports Innovation Lab\u2019s 2025 Women\u2019s Sports Media Benchmarking Survey.\n\nSmith Wilson said at a press screening of the film on Thursday that the commercial will hopefully \u201creach new audiences who don\u2019t watch women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Nike, the athlete is at the center of everything we do, and we know one thing to be true: no matter how hard you work, how much you prove or how many barriers you break, there will always be doubters. There will always be someone telling you what you can\u2019t do or who you\u2019re supposed to be. If you can\u2019t win in everyone\u2019s eyes, win in your own,\u201d Nicole Graham, chief marketing officer of Nike, said in a statement.\n\n\u201c\u2018So Win\u2019 is a celebration of the athletes who do just that. The ones who refuse to play by someone else\u2019s rules, who turn doubt into fuel and who show the world that the only limits worth listening to are the ones you shatter.\u201d\n\nGetting its swagger back\n\n\u201cSo Win\u201d airs at a crucial time for Nike, which is trying to turn around its business after three consecutive quarters of declining revenue. In the quarter ending Nov. 30, its net revenue fell by 7.7% to $12.35 billion.\n\nNike president and CEO Elliott Hill, a brand veteran who came out of retirement in September to replace John Donahoe in the top job, unveiled his turnaround strategy on the company\u2019s last earnings call. He said the brand would put sport back at the center of everything it does, while reinvigorating its marketing with athlete-focused storytelling.\n\nLast year, Nike appointed Nicole Hubbard Graham as its new CMO and overhauled its marketing division to put a greater emphasis on the brand storytelling that made its name.\n\nAfter those changes, Nike\u2019s first significant campaign was its Paris 2024 Olympics ad, \u201cWinning Isn\u2019t For Everyone,\u201d which marked its biggest-ever media investment for the tournament. The spot featured athletes including LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson.\n\n\u201cSo Win\u201d echoes the swagger of the Olympics ad, by unapologetically championing victory, ambition, and greatness. But this time, that attitude is depicted squarely from the female perspective.\n\nThe brand\u2019s return to the Super Bowl also comes after the National Football League (NFL) recently renewed its contract with Nike as the exclusive uniform provider through 2038.\n\nCorrection Feb. 9 at 11:15am ET: An earlier version of this story used the wrong surname for A\u2019ja Wilson.",

So WIN.'\n\nby Amy Corr February 9, 2025 9:00 pm 2 min read Share:\n\nIt\u2019s been 27 years since Nike ran a Super Bowl spot. Tonight, the brand returned with \u201cSo Win,\u201d a :60 celebrating women athletes that also examines the pressure they face as they strive to succeed.\n\nNarrated by Doechii and directed Kim Gehrig, the ad from Wieden+Kennedy describes things women athletes supposedly can\u2019t do, such as stand out, fill stadiums, put themselves first and break records. On screen, we see female competitors who do all that and more, including Sabrina Ionescu, Jordan Chiles, Caitlin Clark, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, A\u2019ja Wilson and Sophia Wilson.\n\nThe ad closes with the line, \u201cWhatever you do. You can\u2019t win. So WIN.\u201d\n\nBecause at the end of the day, women\u2019s sports aren\u2019t going anywhere but up.\n\n\u201cAt Nike, we make sure the athlete is at the center of everything we do, from product creation to storytelling,\u201d says CMO Nicole Graham. \u201cWe are at our best when we are representing the voice of the athlete and their voice becomes our voice. This brand anthem, featuring elite Nike athletes, is a perfect example of how we can inspire everyone to win, whatever that means for them.\u201d\n\nThe work amplifies Nike\u2019s hard-nosed exploration of the winning mindset from last year. Which, in turn, updates the brand\u2019s famous \u201cJust Do It\u201d ethos.\n\nAdds Chiles: \u201cYou don\u2019t wait for attention, you take it. You put in the work, you stay ready. aAd, when the moment comes, you own it. Winning isn\u2019t just about medals. It\u2019s about overcoming, about proving to yourself that you\u2019re capable of more than you ever imagined. And doing it all authentically.\u201d\n\n(Which brand will take home the 2025 Super Clio for the Big Game\u2019s best ad? We\u2019ll find out on Feb. 10.)",

An off-white leather base provides the foundation, complemented by neutral suede overlays that add texture and a subtle contrast. A crisp white midsole keeps things classic, while a gum rubber tread reinforces the shoe\u2019s timeless appeal. To round it all out, Psychic Blue accents bring a refreshing pop of color, appearing on the liner, Swoosh overlays, and midsole branding.\n\nThough the hype may have started on the wrong foot, the Nike Air Force 1 Low \"Photon Dust/Psychic Blue\" is shaping up to be a clean, versatile addition to the Air Force 1 catalog.\n\nExpect a Summer 2025 release via Nike.com and select retailers.

            "content": "Nike (NKE -1.35%) stock was a monster winner in the five years leading up to its peak in November 2021, soaring by 255% during that time frame. But it has been wildly disappointing since then as softer demand hurt its financial performance, and it now trades about 58% below that record high.\n\n\n\nHowever, investors who can look past the near-term headwinds at the bigger picture will see some traits to be optimistic about. Here are three reasons to buy this consumer discretionary stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Nike has unmatched brand strength\n\nNike has a wide economic moat that comes from its powerful brand. No business has comparable mindshare in the sports apparel and footwear market. This provides it with strong pricing power, which has been reflected in its 44.6% average gross margin over the past 10 years.\n\nThe brand's strength is also obvious when you look at Nike's international appeal. In its fiscal 2024, which ended May 31, 58% of its revenue was derived outside North America. This is truly a global outfitter.\n\nCredit goes to Nike's unrivaled competency in the marketing department. Inspiring advertisements, as well as high-profile endorsements from top athletes and contracts with major sports leagues, have kept a spotlight shining on it.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 Q2, which ended Nov. 30, Nike spent $1.1 billion on \"demand creation expenses\" (i.e., marketing). None of its rivals can afford to spend that much on such an important expense. Nike's scale -- exemplified by the $49 billion in trailing 12-month sales it generated -- is a key advantage.\n\nYet competition remains fierce in the apparel and footwear industries. Nike will need to stay on top of its game if it's going to drive excitement and demand from consumers. The company's long-standing dominance definitely demonstrates that it's still held in high regard.\n\n2. Management has the right priorities\n\n\n\nAll businesses encounter setbacks. The great ones are able to figure out what their specific problems are, identify solutions, and then get back on track. What emerges from the other side of such turmoil can be a much better company. Perhaps Nike is on its way to just such a transformation.\n\nNew CEO Elliott Hill is another reason investors should buy the stock. Leadership is critical when sizing up any investment opportunity. In my opinion, so far, he's doing the right things to improve Nike's situation.\n\nHill understands how important it is to have strong distribution partners, something the previous leadership team might not have appreciated. Hill wants to build back the trust of wholesale accounts and once again develop Nike's presence in brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nProduct innovation is another area getting a lot of attention. In recent years, Nike leaned too heavily on fashion-forward styles instead of focusing on sports-centric apparel and footwear. \"Our clear priority is to return sport to the center of everything we do,\" Hill said in the latest earnings release.\n\n3. Shares are on the discount rack\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have been on incredible runs in the past couple of years, and both benchmarks are trading in record territory. That makes it more difficult to find great deals in the stock market.\n\nHere's where Nike stands out. Its valuation is at a bargain level today. Specifically, it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 23.7 -- near its cheapest level by that metric in the past decade.\n\nInvestors' patience will likely be tested. Nike's turnaround will take time, as its revenue dropped by 0.3% in fiscal 2024 and analysts project an 11% decline in fiscal 2025. Because of this, earnings are under pressure, too. But the combination of the brand's strength, the new CEO's sharp focus, and that cheap valuation adds up to a compelling thesis for buying Nike stock now.\n\n",

(NYSE:NKE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

The company is taking a high-stakes risk, as a 30-second Super Bowl ad spot can cost more than $8 million.\n\nAs per the report by Insider, newly appointed CEO, Elliott Hill, who returned to the company in October after a four-year hiatus, had presented a recovery plan in December. Hill has been critical of some of Nike\u2019s previous strategies, such as heavy discounting and neglecting relationships with wholesalers.\n\nThe sportswear behemoth is also trying to reignite interest in its iconic sneaker brands like Jordans and Air Force 1s by limiting supply to stimulate demand.\n\nAlso Read: Nike\u2019s Options Frenzy: What You Need to Know\n\nOver the past year, Nike\u2019s shares have dropped approximately 30%, and the company reported an 8% year-over-year decrease in revenue to $12.4 billion for the quarter ending November 30.\n\nIn recent months, Nike has restructured its marketing department, promoting several company veterans, including former vice president Nicole Hubbard Graham, who was appointed as marketing chief.\n\nThe company seems to be leveraging significant cultural events to rejuvenate its brand, as seen by a new ad launched during the Grammy Awards this month, celebrating the 40-year legacy of its Jordan Brand.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nike\u2019s return to Super Bowl advertising signifies a major shift in its marketing strategy. This move could potentially attract a larger audience and boost sales, which is crucial for the company given its recent financial performance.\n\nHowever, the high cost of Super Bowl advertising also adds a significant risk to this strategy.\n\nThe success of this move will largely depend on how effectively the company can leverage this platform to connect with its target audience and rekindle interest in its products.\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

Having increased access to all three hubs will help athletes to push the boundaries of performance, giving them opportunities to train both at altitude and sea level.\u201d\n\nWith unfiltered access to top coaches, resources, innovation and guidance in sport performance and recovery, Nike distance athletes will be equipped to perform at their highest level. Whether they\u2019re based in one of the three Swoosh TC hubs or primarily train elsewhere, every athlete will have the opportunity to tap into the power of the Swoosh TC network.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about the Swoosh TC model is that the athlete is at the center of all that we do,\u201d says Diljeet. \u201cThe program\u2019s commitment is centered around the athlete and their needs, and we\u2019re committed to supporting them at every step, building a strong culture of community, and giving them the best possible opportunity to succeed.\u201d\n\n",

But close observers of the GQ Bowl livestream might have noticed that there was a whole other story on Chase\u2019s feet: a striking new version of the piping hot Bode x Nike Astro Grabbers.\n\nJesse Grant / Getty Images for GQ\n\nChase attended LSU, but he clearly had no problem donning the colors of a certain Pacific Northwest football juggernaut: his all-green leather Grabbers call to mind the Oregon Ducks dynasty located right in Nike\u2019s backyard. Other models wore a version made of all-black cotton mesh, with distinctive pewter-y football charms dangling from the laces.\n\nJesse Grant / Getty Images for GQ\n\nYou may recall that Emily Adams Bode Aujla first found the long-forgotten 1970s silhouette deep in the Swoosh\u2019s Beaverton archives. Introduced to help players take on newfangled Astroturf surfaces, the original Astro Grabber enjoyed a brief spell of popularity among the gridiron greats of the day. (It has the distinction of being the first Nike shoe to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2014in 1974 courtesy of USC star Anthony Davis.)\n\nBut the Grabber\u2019s professional heyday had nothing on the sensation it caused last year when Bode Aujla revived the silhouette in a sleek, timeless package. \u201cI wanted to create something where you could take a picture of it and not really know when it\u2019s from,\u201d the designer told GQ at the time. Immediately spotted on street style heroes like Kaia Gerber and Jeremy Allen White, the first release sold out faster than Chase can sprint a 40 yard dash.\n\nJesse Grant / Getty Images for GQ\n\nMost surprisingly, all these years later, the league is officially obsessed with the Astro Grabber again. Chase\u2019s runway moment is just the latest example of pro ballers embracing the kicks. In fact, the first person to rock the Bode Recs in the tunnel last year was the receiver\u2019s defensive nemesis: Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith.\n\nBode and Nike were coy on official details, but expect the new colorways to drop this spring.",

Why Trust Us?\n\nDiljeet Taylor, who has spent eight seasons leading the women\u2019s team at Brigham Young University, now officially has a second job\u2014as a Nike pro coach.\n\nShe\u2019s one of three head coaches of Nike\u2019s new , which a company spokesperson described as a network of athletes and coaches geared toward creating a top professional running team and community for current and future athletes.\n\nAll Nike distance runners, regardless of where they are currently located and who coaches them, can access the facilities and coaches of Swoosh TC at one of its three hubs in Provo, Utah; Flagstaff, Arizona; or Eugene, Oregon. For instance, Conner Mantz, Grant Fisher, Cole Hocker, and Sinclaire Johnson are four athletes who have their own coaches but could access any of the Swoosh TC resources.\n\n\n\nThe other two Swoosh TC coaches are Mike Smith, 44, who will be starting with Nike in July after leaving his head coaching position at Northern Arizona University, and Jerry Schumacher, 54, who remains the head track coach at the University of Oregon and was the head coach of the pro branch of the Bowerman Track Club in Eugene. (The Bowerman pros will now be part of Swoosh TC; Bowerman Track Club remains in Portland, Oregon, as a youth, masters, and post-collegiate community club.)\n\nC. Morgan Engel // Getty Images Mike Smith coaches the NAU Lumberjacks in 2022. He will step away from college coaching in July to focus on pros.\n\nSmith will be assisted by his wife, Rachel Smith, a 2021 Olympian in the 5,000 meters who is expecting the couple\u2019s second child in April, although she is expected to return to competition as well after giving birth. Schumacher will continue to work with Shalane Flanagan in coaching pros and college athletes.\n\nBalancing college and pros\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, not much about Taylor\u2019s job will change. She has already been coaching college and pros for the past three years.\n\nSince she arrived at BYU in 2016, Taylor has led the women to two national cross-country championships\u2014most recently, in 2024\u2014and two runner-up finishes. Whittni (Orton) Morgan won the individual title in 2021. Taylor also coached Courtney Wayment and Anna Camp-Bennett to NCAA titles on the track.\n\nAll three turned pro after graduating and have been coached by Taylor for the past three years under the team name TaylorMade Elite.\n\n\u201cUp to that point, I had never envisioned being on the pro scene as a coach,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe opportunity just came up with those three women, and as I did it, I really just fell in love with that aspect of it, kind of a different domain.\u201d\n\nMorgan and Wayment competed at the Olympics in Paris last summer and made the finals in their respective events\u2014Wayment ran 9:13.60 for 12th in the women\u2019s 3,000-meter steeplechase, and Morgan\u2019s 14:53.57 in the 5,000 meters placed her 14th.\n\nTaylor is open to coaching men, and she\u2019s also willing to coach runners who are geared toward the roads, up to the marathon distance. Collegiate athletes who sign with Nike for their pro careers will be encouraged to visit each of the three hubs, talk to the coaches, and see which location and coach best fit.\n\nIn search of medals\n\nThe collective wisdom of the Swoosh TC will improve performance for all the athletes, Taylor said. \u201cI feel like as we bring our own expertise together, it\u2019s only going to strengthen our coaching so that we can be better suited to serve our athletes,\u201d she said of working with Smith and Schumacher.\n\nThe hope is that women distance runners will win medals\u2014at various world championships and the Olympics in 2028. American male distance runners scored five medals in Paris 2024, but the women came home empty-handed, despite having runners in every distance final from 800 on up.\n\nRelated Story Why the U.S. Distance Men Have Been Killing It\n\n\u201cI think in 2028 you\u2019re going to see more women, not just knocking on the door, but walking through the door,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cWomen are not men,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd so the timeline might look a little bit different. Nothing happens overnight, and even though we may think that it does, it\u2019s years and years of perfecting your craft and getting the right support system around you. I do strongly feel that this new collaboration and the sense of community and belonging that the athletes are going to feel is going to give women the opportunity.\u201d\n\nTaylor puts in full days. Her pros tend to do workouts on Mondays and Wednesdays; her college athletes do them on Tuesdays and Fridays. She still runs between 3 and 7 miles per day herself, although she jokes that now, at 47, it takes her longer than it used to. Her sons, who are 16 and 13, need her less than they used to, but she likes to wrap up work in time to make it to their basketball games at night.\n\nShe\u2019s also something of a trailblazer for Nike in the pro space. Although women have coached elite groups with other brands, they remain in the minority, both for pro athletes and in the college coaching ranks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that this inspires more women to get into coaching,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a goal of mine, and one of the legacies that I hope to leave the sport is to be an inspiration and pave the way for other women to see that it is possible.\u201d\n\nTaylor has made a name for herself for the individual attention she gives her athletes. She\u2019s known for the handwritten notes she writes to each before important races.\n\n\u201cI feel like if I\u2019m purposeful and intentional about the things that matter the most to me, which is that athlete connection, then I\u2019m going to make sure that that\u2019s at the forefront,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd in conversations from day one with my family, with Nike, a very high level of importance has been placed on doing it this way, with that personal touch. I feel like that\u2019s kind of our magic. And so, yeah, I will continue to make sure that I\u2019m operating at a level where my athletes feel super valued.\u201d\n\nQuestions ahead\n\nTaylor\u2019s first three pro athletes are sponsored by other brands: Morgan and Bennett are sponsored by Adidas, and Wayment by On. Taylor has since started coaching Nike pros Ella Donaghu, Sadie Sargeant Mitchell, and Simone Plourde.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Smith coaches several Nike pros and athletes from other brands, including Olympians Nikki Hiltz (Lululemon), Luis Grijalva (Hoka), and Nico Young (Adidas).\n\nA Nike spokesperson confirmed to Runner\u2019s World that non-Nike athletes can continue training with Taylor and Smith\u2014but only until their current contracts end. They will not have access to the physical therapists and strength coaches that Nike has assembled in each location.\n\nKirby Lee // Getty Images Jerry Schumacher remains the head coach of track and field and cross country at the University of Oregon, while also coaching pros.\n\nAfter their contracts end, Runner\u2019s World has learned, those athletes would have to either sign with Nike or find coaching elsewhere. It is not known how long each athlete\u2019s current contract with a rival brand lasts.\n\nAnother question mark is Shelby Houlihan, who recently returned to racing after a four-year ban for doping. Before the ban, Houlihan trained with Bowerman Track Club. A Nike spokesperson said Houlihan is not a part of Swoosh TC. Houlihan is currently not sponsored by any brand.\n\nAt one point, the Bowerman Track Club was the most prestigious choice for athletes who signed with Nike coming out of college, and more than two dozen athletes were on the team at one time. But the high-mileage, non-customized approach of Schumacher wasn\u2019t for everyone. Some athletes left and enlisted new coaches. After news of Houlihan\u2019s ban emerged in 2021, the exodus accelerated, leaving no natural home for young Nike distance runners. The addition of Taylor and Smith to the coaching roster could make Nike appealing to top college talent.\n\nCindy Kuzma contributed to this report.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story said that Rachel Smith was an Olympian in the 10,000 meters. It was the 5,000 meters.\n\n",

Neither sales nor earnings forecasts were as good as Citi hoped for, and \"Nike's sales pressures seem likely to continue as it manages down key franchises further in fiscal 2026,\" reports The Fly.\n\nAnalysts duel over Nike\n\nCEO Hill apparently warned Citi that Nike lacks sufficient \"product\" to hit analyst sales targets next year, and needs to invest in \"demand creation\" for its existing products -- which sounds like Wall Street-speak for holding sales and cutting prices, hurting gross and operating profit margins. As a result, Citi is losing confidence the shoemaker will turn around its business within the next year or two, and the bank simply lacks \"patience or conviction to wait another year.\"\n\nThat's the bad news. Now here's the good:\n\nAt least two other investment banks attended the same CEO meeting, and came away more optimistic. As StreetInsider.com reports, Bernstein SocGen analyst Aneesha Sherman is doubling down on her outperform rating on Nike, and Piper Sandler analyst Anna Andreeva is reiterating her overweight rating.\n\nBoth of these analysts acknowledged the same concerns that worried Citi, but Piper emphasized Nike's success in cost-cutting and \"grassroots marketing.\" At Bernstein, the emphasis is on Nike's performance (sport, running, soccer, and basketball) shoes potentially doing \"better than you might think,\" albeit at worse margins.\n\nIs Nike stock a buy?\n\nUltimately, Bernstein concludes \"the risk-reward remains attractive\" at Nike. But I'm not so sure that's true.\n\nOn the one hand, yes, in a market where the average S&P 500 stock sells for 30 times earnings, Nike's 22 P/E ratio looks reasonable, and Nike's 2.1% dividend yield is above average. On the other hand, most analysts forecast subpar 4% long-term earnings growth for Nike. And now Citi is saying Nike might underperform on growth, and the other analysts don't disagree?\n\nSeems to me that's bad news for Nike stock.",

The 'Gold Medal' KD 4 first launched in 2012 to celebrate Durant's first top finish at that year's London Olympics. The Washington D.C.-native has gone on to win three other gold medals since then, but the special Nike Basketball offering continues to hold a special place in Durant's accolades for being the first.\n\nNews of the 'Metallic Gold/University Red/Obsidian/White' retro arrives after Durant's fourth signature model has already been reissued in iconic colorways like 'Aunt Pearl' and 'Nerf.' It's unlikely that the Swoosh will update any component on the retro, allowing fans of the original design to indulge in nostalgia. Newcomers to Durant's signature Nike line can also have a chance to experience a piece of an important part of Nike Basketball's history.\n\nEnjoy photos of the 2012 'Gold Medal' pair ahead. A firm Nike.com release date hasn't been disclosed by any party involved, but that's expected to change before summer ends.

            "content": "This morning, Nike introduced Swoosh Track Club, a distance pro network featuring several of the best coaches in the sport and three training hubs.\n\nThe club will be led by Diljeet Taylor in Utah, Jerry Schumacher in Oregon and Mike Smith in Arizona. Each location will host a \"physical hub\" and training resources where its athletes will live and train.\n\nNike has essentially launched a super-team of coaches and suspected athletes, programming a premier track club. As reported by Runner's World, Bowerman Track Club will essentially merge with Swoosh Track Club. The Bowerman pro runners will now be a part of Swoosh TC, but Bowerman Track Club will remain as an independent club for youth, masters and post-collegians.\n\nDiljeet Taylor will continue to serve as the women's head coach at BYU. It is also reported that she will continue to coach a handful of athletes that aren't currently sponsored by Nike. Courtney Wayment (On) and Whittni Morgan (adidas) were coached by Taylor when the coach led Taylor Made Elite.\n\nAccording to the Nike release, Jerry Schumacher will lead the Oregon-based club in partnership with Shalane Flanagan. Flanagan is an assistant cross country/distance coach at Oregon University.\n\nMike Smith will lead the Flagstaff, Arizona club beginning in July. He will coach in partnership with his wife, Rachel Smith. Smith is currently the head coach at Northern Arizona University, and in the summer of the 2024, he announced that the 2024-25 academic year would be his last at NAU.\n\nThe club's focus will supposedly keep the athletes at the center of its mission. By creating a network of locations and athletes for individuals to train with, Nike is creating a West Coast powerhouse.\n\nAs part of the program, all Nike distance runners, regardless of club affiliation, will have access to the club's facilities and coaches.\n\nThis new program is a huge step for Nike as the brand has recently started to lose its stranglehold on American distance running, particularly with the emergence of international brands and indie brands.\n\nJoin the Conversation on Social\n\nFollow us on Twitter @FloTrack.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @flotrack.\n\nLike us on Facebook.",

            "content": "Unveiled to the world in November 2024 with the help of Corteiz's Javel Berlin, the Nike Air Max Dn8 is finally set to debut in February.\n\nRooted in heritage but inspired by the future, the silhouette leverages the Swoosh's industry-leading Research & Development efforts on the performance front to create a stylish, comfortable product. A sequel to last year's Air Max Dn, the upcoming design goes all-out with its cushioning solution, offering a full-length Dynamic Air setup for the first time in the brand's history. The sneaker's two visible Air units and eight tubes (hence the 'Dn8' name) work in-tandem to deliver a sustained, pressurized ride underfoot. A similar experience has been developed for the Pegasus Premium running shoe.\n\n\"For the Dn8, we wanted to be lower to the ground,\" said Jonathan Kosenick, Lead Designer, Men\u2019s Sportswear, in a press release for the model. \"We wanted to feel more Air...to improve transition. All of those goals led us to design the shoe with eight Air chambers directly in contact with the ground, which allows the chambers to more effectively compress and be way more flexible, delivering a much bouncier, springier sensation that channels a Nike performance footwear approach into a shoe you want to wear every day\".\n\nAlthough it's been designed through a performance lens, the Air Max Dn8 is firmly a lifestyle offering. The San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama has put some milage into the sneaker, as has Central Cee. The design's breathable upper pairs well with the innovative Dynamic Air system underfoot. Elevated materials inject a premium feel into the latest member of the Swoosh's expansive Air Max catalog.\n\nEnjoy detailed photos of the Air Max Dn8 'Hyper Pink below. The sneaker's debut colorway arrives via the Nike SNKRS app on Wednesday, Feb. 6, in unisex sizing. More styles for Adults and Kids will begin rolling out globally on March 6. The model is priced at $190.\n\nFor more from the Nike, Inc. empire, check out the complete Air Jordan Releases calender.",

Revisiting their most reliable silhouette when it comes to playful colorways, Nike is trotting out a \u201cBeach\u201d themed version of the Dunk Low exclusive to the GS crowd, getting in early on the Summer slate a few months ahead of time.\n\nWhile the fern frond, palm tree and beaded lace charms are surely the headliners, it\u2019s a comprehensive embodiment of vacation season with this shoe. A tropical horizon gradient overtakes the tongue tag, further lending its sunset palette to the Swooshes and a matte counterpart at the heel. To finalize the summer-ready vibe, a sprightly build of pure white and \u201cCoconut Milk\u201d takes up the rest of the real estate.\n\nThe Nike Dunk Low \u201cBeach\u201d should land sometime in the Spring/Summer \u201925 window, retailing for $100 in kids sizing.

Of course, this celebration included a special edition of his Nike signature sneaker, the Nike Book 1, made exclusively for Devin, the pair mimicking Davis\u2019 old Converse Startech Mid PE. The latest ultra-limited Book 1 is launching to the public as part of Nike Basketball\u2019s Black Label collection.\n\nLike other pairs in the collection, which includes models from the likes of Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Ja Morant, Sabrina Ionescu, and more, Booker\u2019s sneaker is primarily coated in a black finish with a cream accent appearing on the outline of the midfoot Swoosh. Construction opts for a full denim build, switching from the usual mixture of nubuck, canvas twill, and leather, with the denim frayed on the edges of the paneling. Along the tongue sits Black Label branding, with the reverse hosting Book text in red stardust.\n\nNike Book 1 Black Label\n\nBack on the heel, the Book 1 Black Label forgoes its signature book spine-inspired heel tab, aligning with other pairs like the recent homages to Flagstaff and Sedona and the Sunrise and Sunset colorways. Finishing the sneaker is a blacked-out rubber midsole and outsole, the latter featuring a red Swoosh.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 Black Label will release on February 14, 2025, through Nike SNKRS and Foot Locker in San Francisco as part of NBA All-Star Weekend. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $170.

Whether the bells and whistles are required is a moot point\u2026the main thing is you get a grippy shoe with good stability and a high degree of support/comfort.

The design of the TW '13 began when Tiger asked Nike for a design of a golf shoe that was the same as the shoes he ran in. The result was a combination of comfort and performance that changed golf shoes as we know them.\n\n\n\nThe shoe has been rereleased and enhanced to match up with some of the modern golf shoes on offer. The outsole is designed to mimic the natural movement of your foot through the swing, harnessing the energy produced from you to the ground. The sole features updated spikes and receptacles for great grip.\n\n\n\nWith the TW '13, you can really see the ideas of Tiger all over the shoe and why it has been so successful. The style is iconic and the lacing system in the shoe helps secure the foot.

Nobody quite does futuristic underbellies like Nike and this a classic example of a molded spikeless grip that is total unique.\n\n\n\nIt is certainly a golf shoe for the summer but with that comes a large degree of comfort \u2013 the injected foam midsole does a great job in that respect \u2013 and it is also extremely lightweight.

The Nike Air 270 golf shoe does look like it is designed for the basketball court but their supremely-sleek shoe has a lot more going on than that. The flexible-yet-substantial upper will keep you dry.\n\n\n\nHowever, as is the case with many Nike products, it is the lower half of the shoe that really contains all the stardust.\n\nThe sole is, again, like nothing else you have seen before with its jagged edges and more conventional center portion.\n\n\n\nAnd, as you would expect from an Air product, the comfort is considerable with a giant Air Max unit combined with a foam midsole to make every step a comfortable one. Pros & Cons Specs Pros Can easily wear them all-day\n\nGreat looking\n\nAmazing grip Cons The tongue system creates a tight fit to start off Sizes 3 \u2013 14 Colors 4 BOA No Waterproof Yes\n\n8 Nike Infinity G Golf Shoes Great quality at a great price Price: $75 www.pgatoursuperstore.com View Offer This is one of the best-value golf shoes from Nike in recent times, the Infinity G is packed with everything you want in a premium shoe at a less so premium price. For less than $70 you're getting a classic-looking Nike golf shoe that is fully waterproof and offers plenty of traction with soft foam cushioning.\n\n\n\nThe sleek-looking Infinity G has eye stays that have been reinforced for longer durability, the shoe features spikes that have been integrated into the sole itself and do provide great traction but I'd be worried after months of wearing how they'd look and whether they'd perform the same.\n\n\n\nOverall, this golf shoe is great to look at and will go with most outfits, looking good with either shorts or trousers. This shoe wouldn't look out of place amongst some double its price and for golfers who want quality but don't want to pay the premium price, the Infinity G from Nike is ideal for you.

The latest version of any product always comes with more tech and this is no different. The Victory Pro is made from recycled materials all in Nike's push toward being carbon neutral.\n\n\n\nThe shoe is perfect for casual and committed golfers alike, the low-profile look with the two-tone colorway is easy on the eyes, and along with the iconic swoosh it makes for a great-looking shoe.\n\n\n\nThe Victory Pro is super comfortable and provides excellent traction, thanks to its Hybrid outsole which performs well in poor weather conditions. The synthetic upper makes the shoe super easy to clean which is a necessity for golf shoes especially here in the UK.

Still, essentially there is a lot of the \u2018old\u2019 in the ADG4, especially the premium leather upper, which looks like a Footjoy model from the 80s or 90s (apart from the laces).\n\n\n\nThe lower down the shoe you go the more modern it gets and certainly, the sole is very 21st-century with its dramatic molded edges. They certainly generate lots of grip. Add in the waterproofing and you are left with a shoe that will work well all year round.\n\n\n\nThe ADG 4 has Jordan styling everywhere you look and there are clues in the outsized tongue and the eyelets. That said the overall package, visually, is relatively understated which means it should have mass appeal.

The sole is very different from the original to aid with grip, but the overall package is relatively conventional.\n\n\n\nThe stitched leather upper is pure classic, while the heel is supported by encapsulated air. Could almost be one for the growing number of shoe collectors.

Having tested tens of thousands of products over the years, we know exactly what to look for. We will ask every possible question about each product that we review. With a range of everyday golfers testing products you can rest assured that if it\u2019s a situation that can arise for you on the golf course, we\u2019ve already put the product through that scenario before recommending it.\n\nWith golf shoes, testing means wearing them for multiple rounds so we can determine the out-of-the-box performance in a variety of conditions. The overall performance of a product will depend on variables such as grip, durability, versatility, comfort, and fit.\n\nWe are lucky enough to attend product launches and meet the manufacturers to understand why they release a new product and its benefit to the consumer. The TG team pride ourselves on the fact that we understand and test all of our products to give you our honest and in-depth opinion on whether it is worth buying or not. The reviews and recommendations are there with you the readers as our highest priority, so we can recommend products that will help you improve your game.\n\nSee a full guide to how we test golf equipment.\n\nHow to choose a golf shoe\n\nOne of the most important things to get right for the golf season is your golf shoes. There are a number of different variables to consider when picking what\u2019s going to be on your feet out on the course. To assist you along your shoe-buying journey we have put together what we think are key points to consider when buying your next pair.\n\nBudget\n\nThe first thing we advise when buying any golf product is to set yourself a realistic budget and stick to it. You can spend anything from \u00a350 to \u00a3250 on golf shoes, depending on the brand, style, tech, and materials.\n\nWith hundreds of different models available, setting a budget for your next golf shoes will help to narrow down your search.\n\nIf the brand isn\u2019t important to you then you\u2019re more likely to be able to spend less money than if your heart is set on a pair of current FootJoy or Ecco shoes for example.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out in golf, this is your first pair of golf shoes, or you only play occasionally we\u2019d recommend setting a lower budget. Firstly, there\u2019s no point in blowing a fortune on the shoes if you\u2019re going to discover you don\u2019t actually like the game as much as you hoped or only get on the course a couple of times a year. Secondly, the money you save on shoes can be spent adding other equipment, paying for some rounds, or getting yourself some lessons.\n\nSpiked or spikeless\n\nMany of the best golf shoes seen above and across the best brands now are split evenly between spiked and spikeless which both have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSpiked\n\nGolf shoes with spikes tend to give better grip/traction out on the golf course with them having soft spikes placed around the outsole. Spiked shoes are the more durable option as they have replaceable spikes, meaning if you look after and replace them there should be no reason they won\u2019t last a long time.\n\nWith spikes on the outsole, the shoe has added pressure points on the foot which can result in a slightly less comfortable fit. Spiked golf shoes are less versatile as they aren\u2019t designed to be worn both on and off the golf course.\n\nSpikeless\n\nThe Spikeless option may not give golfers as much traction as spiked golf shoes but they have come a long way in recent years. Spikeless golf shoes tend to feature small rubber molds on the outsole to aid grip, however, with technological advancements, companies are finding new ways to improve spikeless traction.\n\nThe use of compounds such as TPU has allowed brands like Under Armour and Ecco to produce a spikeless shoe that, when partnered with rubber molds, gives arguably as much traction as a spiked shoe. Spikeless shoes are becoming more and more durable, and modern styling makes them more attractive as an everyday shoe. With brands using tech from their running shoes in golf shoes, they are often uber-comfortable too.\n\nSpikeless shoes are lighter and much more versatile. They\u2019re a shoe that you can drive in and hit drives in.\n\nWaterproofing\n\nSome of you may live in an area of the world that gets a lot of rain, making a waterproof shoe a must. Or you may be a golfer that likes to prepare for any outcome on the course and doesn\u2019t want to be left with soggy feet from an unexpected shower.\n\nIn the UK waterproof shoes can be a sensible option when picking out what to wear on the course. Many golfers buy a waterproof pair for winter, and a more breathable lightweight shoe for summer.\n\nBuying a pair of shoes that are guaranteed waterproof can cost a little more so if you live in a part of the world where rain rarely falls (hello Dubai), then you can save yourself a bit of cash with a non-waterproof model.\n\nCorrect fit\n\nArguably the most important part of picking out a new golf shoe is getting something that fits your feet correctly. This will help prevent blisters and stop your feet from moving around, which can limit your control during the swing.\n\nWhen putting on a shoe for the first time always make sure there is no pinching or movement. When your foot slides in you always check your toes fit at the end of the shoe and have a walk around in them to make sure they feel comfortable. We\u2019d even recommend making a few golf swing motions to ensure they are fit for purpose.\n\nUnder Armour use \u2018normal\u2019 laces throughout their range of shoes. But most brands including FootJoy, adidas, Nike, and Ecco use a system called BOA. This lets you twist a dial to tighten the specially formulated laces and can provide a better fit that doesn\u2019t loosen when playing. While BOA often creates a more secure fit, the look and feel aren\u2019t for everyone and BOA models tend to be more expensive.\n\nComfort\n\nWith your average round of golf being more than four hours, comfort is king when buying golf shoes. If your shoes are uncomfortable and hard-wearing on your feet, your mind will be distracted from playing good golf.\n\nTry to find a shoe with good cushioning for the bottom of your foot and around the heel. Good heel and ankle support will keep your foot secure and will help with your golf swing.\n\nYou want to make sure that the shoe isn\u2019t too soft as that may also hinder you in the long run as it won\u2019t be as supportive. Finding a balance of support and comfort is what you should be looking for to make the most out of your new golf shoes.\n\nStyling\n\nModern golf shoes come in many styles. It\u2019s not all about the traditional look on the golf course anymore. A classic-looking shoe can now be seen next to the latest pair of sneakers on the tee box.\n\nThere are golf shoes out there for everyone, from brogues to lightweight, knitted models. You need to consider what shoes you wear and like wearing off the course and then you should have no trouble getting a style that suits you on the course.\n\nWe\u2019d always recommend you thoroughly research all of the options and create a shortlist to try.\n\nBest Nike Golf Shoes: FAQs\n\nWhat are the best golf shoes?\n\nAll of the shoes on our list will provide a comfortable and supportive fit for you out on the golf course. The main thing you need to focus on when picking a new pair of golf shoes is something that fits well, is supportive, suits your style, and is ideal for the conditions you play golf in.\n\nIf you are somewhere cold and wet it would be better to pick a spiked waterproof pair than someone who lives somewhere hot and dry they may need a spikeless breathable shoe.\n\nDo any pro golfers wear spikeless golf shoes?\n\nMost of the golfers on tour will and do wear spikeless golf shoes due to the fact each event chases the sun and rarely do they have adverse weather conditions.\n\nAll of the courses at tour events around the world will offer up some of the best conditions to play golf in so spikeless shoes will offer pros enough grip to play at their best. Spiked shoes will make an appearance on tour if the weather takes a turn for the worst.",

That release date? NBA All-Star Weekend, a fitting mecca for all things sneakers and style.\n\n(Nike)\n\nNew images of the covetable set of kicks just dropped, with rapper Travis Scott sporting the shoe in one image. The planned All-Star Weekend drop is a fitting crescendo after several fits and starts following an originally planned October 2024 release date. They were originally set to hit shelves back on October 18th, with glimpses of the sneakers dropping on social media accounts as far back as mid-2023. In fact, according to Hypebeast, rumors had chased the release of the fresh-looking high-tops since late 2022.\n\n(Nike)\n\nIn the meantime, sneakers like the Air Jordan XXXIX have dropped, along with a \u201cYear of the Snake\u201d collection and of course, the Air Jordan Holiday lineup (which the High OG Reimagined version was slated to join). All the classic hallmarks of the Air Jordan 1 High are present, including MJ\u2019s iconic red-black-and-white color scheme, a la the Chicago Bulls. This time around, \u201cAir Jordan\u201d branding at the heel adds a design swerve sneakerheads will surely appreciate. Helpfully (or perhaps unhelpfully for those looking to snag a pair), these sneakers are priced more than fairly at $180.\n\nAs Hypebeast further reported at the time rumors first dropped, the sneakers carry on the Jordan tradition of tweaking a classic, noting the sneaker legends have \u201cshown an increased willingness to play with material composition in its forthcoming 2024 lineup.\u201d In fact, the release of the latest twist on the Air Jordan 1 High OG was at one point postponed indefinitely late last year, bringing hype to a fever pitch.\n\n(Nike)\n\nAnd in yet another swerve, the latest set of classic Nike sneakers was then set to go on sale on February 1st. So, February 15th it is, with sneakerheads and sports enthusiasts eagerly awaiting these jealousy-inducing kicks.",

That means the KD 18 will only get 1,988 pairs for its launch colorway, as Durant was born in 1988. Each of the sneakers features slight flourishes deviating from the dark theme, the KD 18\u2019s being a silver Swoosh and turqoise KD logo.\n\nFor now, what can be seen is all that\u2019s been revealed about the KD 18. The performance specs haven\u2019t yet been revealed, but the wavy overlays leading up to the eyestays are clearly derived from the Air Terra Humara.

            "content": "Sneaker industry sources tell Complex that Nike is planning a retro release for its ancient \u201cMoon Shoe,\u201d an early Nike runner from 1972 that set a then-record-high price for sneakers sold at auction in 2019, when a vintage pair went for $437,500 at Sotheby\u2019s. Nike has reissued versions of the Moon Shoe before\u2014there was a release in 2004 that differed significantly from the original, and the bastardized Moon Crepe from 2009\u2014but the upcoming retro is a truer recreation of the \u201872 shoe.\n\nThe Nike Moon Shoe retro could land as early as Holiday \u201825, which would put its release between October and December, but the sneaker\u2019s release window is subject to change.\n\nNike will release a standard, inline Moon Shoe as well as a collaboration on the model with French fashion label Jacquemus, which quietly debuted the project at its Spring 2025 runway show in Paris on Jan. 26. Jacquemus did not announce the sneakers, but models at the show wore what appear to be the retro of the original colorway and the Jacquemus iteration.\n\nNike confirmed to Complex that Jacquemus will be working on the Moon Shoe.\n\nThe Nike Moon Shoe was a creation of Bill Bowerman, the sneaker brand\u2019s co-founder. It is a foundational Nike design, the first to use Nike\u2019s waffle pattern for traction. The shoe\u2019s nickname comes from its distinct sole tread, which Bowerman created by pouring rubber into a waffle iron. The resulting rubber nubs on the bottom of the shoe would leave a clear imprint in the ground, like those left by Apollo 11 astronauts landing on the Moon in \u201869, just a few years before Bowerman\u2019s innovation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the reissue of the model will be billed as the \u201cMoon Shoe,\u201d which was more of a nickname than an official designation.\n\nWhile the Moon Shoe is a decades-old model that hails from Nike\u2019s first years as a fully-fledged company, it\u2019s an appropriate sneaker for the moment. Footwear brands are betting big this year on the continued popularity of slim, low-profile cuts, meaning that the Moon Shoe\u2019s racing flat silhouette is on trend. The shoe has clearly already made its way to the moodboard of at least one designer brand\u2014Maison Margiela just released its $820 \u201cSprinter\u201d sneaker, which is a near replica of the Moon Shoe sans Swoosh.",

The upper pattern of each boot is inspired by shattered glass, signifying the new generation of athletes breaking through to the next era in football. Individual athletes\u2019 names appear alongside the Nike United logo at the heel, and a custom sock liner pays homage to all members of the collective.\n\n\u201cFeeling strong in your gear makes a difference when you step onto the field,\u201d says Salma. \u201cI\u2019m into bright, bold colors, and it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a color like this.\u201d\n\nThe Nike United pack of football boots will be available at nike.com and select retail locations starting February 5.\n\n",

Originally built out to increase the strike zone on the boot and allow for more power generation and finer precision handling, in this lifestyle application it\u2019s vestigial and presents solely as an off-kilter characteristic.\n\nFootball fans at large celebrated the news of the Total III SP\u2019s return in the past two SNKRS previews, but likely to fill all of Nike\u2019s hopes for this retro, it\u2019ll have to strike a chord with a wider audience than simply that niche. The Samba has risen precipitously in the lifestyle power rankings without sacrificing its original football ethos, but whether that overrides the wonky (albeit very charming) design language of the shoe at hand is another question entirely. Conversely, this will only heighten the calls for an true boot retro, but as of right now, these everyday applications are the only versions totally confirmed.\n\nTo that end, the Nike Total III SP \u201cSail\u201d arrives in women\u2019s sizing in the coming weeks. A return for the orange/gum and burgundy/black is likely not too far behind. Expect a $100 retail price upon release.",

            "content": "The Air Force 1 has done it all. Arguably Nike\u2019s most ubiquitous silhouette of all time, the AF1 made its debut in 1982 as a basketball performance sneaker. But it wasn\u2019t long before the silhouette transcended the sport entirely, becoming one of the most inescapable and culturally relevant sneakers ever produced\u2014a favorite of rappers, hoopers, and NYU students alike. There are cultural debates around which city gets to claim them (New York and Baltimore are the main contenders, and both would be offended at the implication that it\u2019s even a question) and how many times you should wear a pair before they\u2019re fully cooked. They\u2019re at the center of sneaker culture and have been for longer than just about any other silhouette.\n\nOver the years, some of the biggest collaborators in Nike history have left their stamp on the Air Force 1. There have been killer general releases, Friends & Family exclusives, and Player Editions that became the stuff of sneaker legend. Any list of the best of the best tends to run long and ours is no different. Here are our picks for the best Nike Air Force 1s of all time.\n\n21. Nike Air Force 1 Low \u2018Kobe Bryant\u2019\n\nWhile you probably most closely associate the Mamba with his iconic signature line at Nike, Kobe was lacing up all kinds of wild kicks during his now-legendary season as a sneaker free agent. Among them were a pair of Forces decked out in Lakers colors. Those shoes saw a public release for the first time ever late in 2024, and alongside them dropped these gems: Black AF1s embossed with the Mamba logo and finished with Lakers purple-and-gold on the Swoosh, limited to an appropriate 8,000 pairs.\n\n20.

The upper showcases an intricate lacing system with lace locks extending from each loop toward the midsole, creating a dynamic look while ensuring a snug fit.

            "content": "Sign up for the Big Think Business newsletter Learn from the world\u2019s biggest business thinkers Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nIn the foreword to George Raveling\u2019s 2025 book, What You\u2019re Made For, Michael Jordan writes: \u201cI\u2019m proud to call George a mentor and a friend \u2026 We can all learn from him.\u201d It\u2019s a testimonial that speaks volumes to anyone interested in leadership, success, and \u2014 frankly \u2014 the game of life.\n\nRaveling was born in Washington, D.C., in 1937, won a scholarship to Villanova in 1956, and worked as a marketing analyst for Sun Oil Company (now Sunoco) before joining the sports staff at the University of Maryland as the first African-American coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nHe was an assistant coach on the US Men\u2019s Olympic Basketball team that won gold in 1984 and featured a 21-year-old Jordan \u2014 who would be persuaded to sign with Nike in a game-changing deal later that year. Raveling was instrumental in those negotiations (he explains his strategy below) and went on to become Director of International Basketball at Nike, at the age of 63. Big Think asked Raveling about his longevity, legacy, and success, and discovered exactly why his experience in sports and business carries such weight. Coach, over to you.\n\nBig Think: Michael Jordan writes in the foreword to your book: \u201cIf not for George there would be no Air Jordan.\u201d What was the crucial element or skill that enabled you to bring Jordan to Nike?\n\nCoach Raveling: Moments that withstand the test of time often gain their true meaning when placed in the right historical context. Back in those days, it took longer to learn about extraordinary players and remarkable human beings. It wasn\u2019t a culture of instant connectivity and information like it is today. When I first met MJ as an assistant coach for the 1984 United States Men\u2019s Olympic Basketball Team, led by Coach Bob Knight, I didn\u2019t know much about him. But by the third week of training camp, it was clear that MJ was special and different.\n\nThe service mindset is not about hierarchy; it\u2019s about humanity.\n\nUnderstand, this was a time when there was no such thing as a signature shoe or a Black man being the face of a Fortune 500 company. While I teased MJ during training camp for not wearing Nikes, bringing him to Nike wasn\u2019t my focus. My focus was on serving MJ and every athlete on that Olympic team \u2014 on being of service in a way that helped them succeed. MJ and I developed a unique bond during that time, a connection rooted in relationship-building, trust, and loyalty forged through shared moments, experiences, and a partnership. As great of a player as MJ was, he was an even greater human being.\n\nThe truth is, none of us are simply in the business of our respective sectors \u2014 be it shoes, sports, or technology. At the core, we\u2019re all in the people business. And the relationship I\u2019ve built with MJ over the years is one I deeply admire and cherish. It\u2019s a sacred bond, and I hold it in the highest regard.\n\nBig Think: Are great leaders born or made?\n\nCoach Raveling: The answer lies in knowing that we are all born to lead. What makes us great is the courage to step into that role and the willingness to nurture it through our journey. Too often, we fail to trust ourselves and our own story, which limits our ability to trust others and to lead effectively. But the truth is this: every one of us is a leader. The first step is to believe it \u2014 to embrace the fact that we are born with the ability to guide, inspire, and serve others. Leadership begins with self-belief, and from there, it can evolve into something transformative. True leadership starts with empowering others to see their own potential and pursue their dreams with greater conviction. Belief isn\u2019t just a slogan on the wall or a phrase in a mission statement \u2014 it\u2019s the driving force behind human progress, mental breakthroughs, and extraordinary performance. Belief fuels everything.\n\nBig Think: You say that the \u201cservice mindset\u201d is key to effective leadership: what are the key principles behind this mindset?\n\nCoach Raveling: The service mindset is not about hierarchy; it\u2019s about humanity. It\u2019s about focusing on creating a culture where others can thrive and grow, where their voices are heard, and where their contributions matter. Ultimately, it\u2019s about leading with the belief that leadership is not about personal gain but about collective progress. When we embody this, we empower not only those we lead but also ourselves to achieve something far greater than we could alone. The key principles behind this mindset begin with a deep and consistent investment in the hearts, minds, and souls of the people we lead. Leadership is about elevating others, showing up with empathy, and fostering trust. It requires awareness, a relentless pursuit of truth, and the courage to be honest \u2014 even when it\u2019s difficult.\n\nTry Big Think+ for your business Engaging content on the skills that matter, taught by world-class experts. Request a Demo\n\nBig Think: What are the other cornerstones of your brand of leadership?\n\nCoach Raveling: Self-leadership and self-discipline have been foundational cornerstones of my leadership journey. Too often, leadership discussions center on teams and groups, overlooking the critical importance of self-leadership and the inward journey of self-discovery. True leadership begins within \u2014 with our willingness to reflect, evolve, and grow from our own experiences. At its heart, leadership is about positively transforming the lives of others. That transformation starts when we choose to lead ourselves with intention, authenticity, and self-awareness. By leaning into our inner work, we become better equipped to show up as leaders who are genuine, vulnerable, and courageously transparent. When we lead from this place of authenticity, we unlock the power to connect deeply with those we serve.\n\nBig Think: You mention that Phil Knight \u2014 co-founder and Chairman Emeritus of Nike, Inc. \u2014 is a master of the art of filtering the signal from the noise. What other exceptional business/leadership qualities did you pick up from Knight?\n\nCoach Raveling: Mr. Knight stands as one of the greatest visionaries and most dynamic leaders our society has ever known. Joining Nike after my coaching career and brief stint in sports commentary was nothing short of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \u2014 a masterclass in life, leadership, human behavior, and the relentless pursuit of greatness. Leading Nike\u2019s global basketball division allowed me to witness firsthand the art of vision-driven leadership and what it means to shape the future before others even imagine it.\n\nThe lessons Mr. Knight imparted continue to resonate with me to this day. From his iconic philosophy that \u201cThere is no finish line\u201d to his unwavering belief that settling for the status quo stifles growth, his words have shaped my approach to both leadership and life. \u201cLife is growth. You grow, or you die,\u201d he would say. And perhaps most profoundly, he reminded us that, \u201cSometimes, knowing when to give up \u2014 when to try something else \u2014 is genius. Giving up doesn\u2019t mean stopping. Don\u2019t ever stop.\u201d\n\nCoach Raveling (left) holds the attention of Michael Jordan.\n\nBig Think: Which lessons from sport are most applicable to business?\n\nCoach Raveling: Regardless of your age or ability, the beauty of sports lies in its ability to showcase some of the most profoundly human qualities \u2014 discipline, courage, strategy, and teamwork. These themes transcend the playing field, offering lessons that are just as applicable to business as they are to the game of life. As Nelson Mandela once said: \u201cSport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.\u201d The lessons are everywhere, if only we are present enough to see them.\n\nBig Think: Were there instances in your career where trying to apply sporting lessons to the business arena proved disastrous?\n\nCoach Raveling: Leadership, like life and sports, is a journey filled with triumphs and trials. Along the way, I\u2019ve made my fair share of mistakes \u2014 some that proved disastrous. Moments where I didn\u2019t trust my intuition, myself, or the situations I was tasked with leading. In those moments, we take the \u201cL.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: the \u201cL\u201d can stand for a Loss, or it can stand for a Lesson.\n\nThere\u2019s incredible beauty in the losses we experience in life and leadership. Yet, we live in a society that often stigmatizes failure, defeat, and setbacks \u2014 urging us to fear them rather than embrace their potential. The truth is, these moments of adversity are chapters in our story, not the conclusion. When things fall apart, we\u2019re left with a choice: Will we use the obstacle to find a way forward, or will we let it become an excuse? Our response is always within our control. And that, in itself, is the essence of what makes both leading and living so profoundly beautiful.\n\nBig Think: As a young man you \u201cdevoured biographies of great leaders\u201d \u2014 which writers had a lasting impact on you?\n\nCoach Raveling: My grandmother once shared a powerful story with me: \u201cGeorge,\u201d she said, \u201cback in the days of slavery, plantation owners would hide their money in books and place them on the shelves. Their banking system wasn\u2019t like it is today, and they knew the slaves wouldn\u2019t take the money because they couldn\u2019t read the books.\u201d I asked her, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t they read, Grandma?\u201d She replied, \u201cBecause they weren\u2019t allowed to. If someone controls your mind, they can control your body. That\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nHer words struck me deeply. From that moment on, I made a vow: I would never allow ignorance to become a chain. I would never be in a position where someone could control my mind \u2014 or my body \u2014 because of what I didn\u2019t know. I committed myself to a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, understanding that intellectual freedom is a form of power, and that respect is often earned through the depth of your mind.\n\nThe truth is, none of us are simply in the business of our respective sectors \u2014 be it shoes, sports, or technology. At the core, we\u2019re all in the people business.\n\nJames Baldwin nurtured my love for reading and for the flow of words that breathe life into existence. He taught me the beauty of stories \u2014 the kind that don\u2019t just sit quietly on a shelf but demand to be read, felt, and lived. Through his work, I found the courage to embrace the complexity of my own story and the conviction to honor the stories of others. Baldwin\u2019s legacy is a reminder that books hold more than just words \u2014 they hold liberation, transformation, and the keys to worlds waiting to be explored.\n\nBig Think: Is there one leader in particular who you would have followed to the end of the earth?\n\nCoach Raveling: Without a doubt, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He embodied the true essence of courage. Every morning, he kissed his wife and children goodbye, fully aware that each farewell could be his last. This daily act reflected a profound bravery \u2014 a willingness to face danger in pursuit of a higher calling. Dr. King was more than a leader; he was a master of words, a visionary, and arguably one of the most trusted figures of the 20th century. His voice inspired multitudes to risk everything for a shared dream. When he spoke, people didn\u2019t just hear him \u2014 they felt him. His words resonated in their hearts, minds, and very souls. His unwavering courage and integrity were a beacon for all who sought justice and equality.\n\nHonoring Dr. King\u2019s life and legacy reminds us that the dream doesn\u2019t end with him; it continues with us to live boldly, lead with integrity, and embrace the work of building a better future \u2014 for ourselves and for generations to come.",

            "content": "A\u2019ja Wilson has earned two WNBA rings, two Olympic gold medals, an NCAA crown and three WNBA MVP awards.\n\nAnd that was all before leveling up with her Nike signature shoe, which is designed to support her game and push her performance to new heights.\n\nEnter the Nike A\u2019One: a standout silhouette that puts competitors on notice with a curated mix of performance benefits engineered to help Wilson lace up, lock in and leave defenders in the dust.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019ve seen my best, think again,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWe worked for over two years to create the Nike A\u2019One to help me redefine the limits of greatness and advance the game to another level. My signature shoe is worth the wait \u2014 engineered for my game and my style, and built to motivate the next generation to go big. Just wait to see what we do with it.\u201d\n\nThe A\u2019One is designed to deliver the comfort and versatility required by one of the greatest players in the world, offering Wilson, other elite athletes and fans of the game an optimal combination of cushioning, traction, fit and support.\n\nThe silhouette\u2019s Cushlon 3.0 foam works with a firmer base to deliver explosive responsiveness and smooth, cushioned landings so hoopers stay ready for every play. A reimagined traction pattern lets athletes cut, pivot and move side to side with precision, while a supportive insole and breathable mesh upper help athletes lock in for unstoppable, dynamic movement.\n\n\u201cThe A\u2019One is meant to go the distance, taking control from the jump and dominating the floor on every play,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cFrom the beginning, we designed the shoe to both support my game and to provide young hoopers a tool to help them level up. The A\u2019One aces that assignment, and we took the time to really get it right in order to deliver exactly what I need to push my performance and inspire the next generation to give it their all on every play.\u201d\n\nWhile the A\u2019One\u2019s performance is undeniable, its bold look further distinguishes the silhouette as a reflection of Wilson\u2019s influence on the sport, with personalized design details that recall her family history and carry forward the vibrancy and unapologetic realness central to her style.\n\nPearl motifs and finishes define the silhouette and signature collection, nodding to the necklace Wilson\u2019s grandmother gifted her as a child, providing her a wearable symbol of strength. The outsole of Wilson\u2019s signature sneaker pays additional tribute to her grandmother, including her message from Wilson\u2019s book: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nCeltic symbols representing the names of Wilson's mom and dad pay homage to her parents, further harking to her belief that family means everything. A postgame quote that speaks to her trademark tenacity is immortalized on the heel: \u201cWeakness, weakness. We don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d\n\nThe Pink A\u2019ura launch colorway symbolizes Wilson\u2019s ability to lead with confidence, loyalty and passion, with layers of pink creating a gradual ambiance that's flush with Leo energy and lights up the court in her favorite color.\n\nRounding out the silhouette is Wilson\u2019s new signature logo, inspired by the star she draws inside the \u201cA\u201d of her signature while referencing her role as an \u201cA1\u201d hooper who inspires kids to reach for their dreams. With that motivation in mind, the Nike A\u2019One will be available in kids\u2019 sizes as small as 1Y.\n\n\u201cIn A\u2019ja, the next generation has a beacon to look to \u2014 an inspiration point,\u201d says Ben Nethongkome, lead designer for the A\u2019One footwear. \u201cShe wants to lead the charge for young hoopers to strive for greatness. We designed the Nike A\u2019One so that when girls lace up, they channel A\u2019ja\u2019s encouragement through her footwear, knowing they can be like her one day.\u201d\n\nThat confident yet stylish vibe carries over to Wilson\u2019s signature apparel collection, which speaks to her personal style across eight pieces for women, men and kids. The collection conveys a contemporary aesthetic that pairs high fashion with bold looks and classically timeless sports style for a system of dress that can be worn together or combined with other pieces.\n\nAt the center of the collection is Wilson\u2019s A\u2019Symmetric tight, which mirrors her distinctive DIY look that was originally born from her pursuit of on-court comfort following an injury during her rookie year and has since evolved into a one-legged aesthetic adopted by competitors across the athletic landscape.\n\nA cropped women\u2019s hoodie includes a sateen-lined hood to keep athletes\u2019 hair styled and on-point, along with premium metal drawstring finishes for an elevated touch. An identical drawstring treatment extends to sateen shorts, while cropped and full-length T-shirts offer everyone an entryway into Wilson\u2019s bold aesthetic.\n\nCompleting the collection are kid-right offerings to help serve and inspire the next generation of hoopers, including the A\u2019Symmetric tight, hoodie, mesh shorts and T-shirt.\n\n\u201cWhen athletes wear my shoe or any of the pieces from my collection, I want them to feel the power behind that logo: the power to dream big, then put in the work \u2014 in style and confidence,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nWilson was named to Nike\u2019s roster of signature athletes in spring 2024, joining a growing team of women who have partnered with the brand to develop signature collections with deeper meaning. A longtime Nike athlete, Wilson has been a part of Nike\u2019s Athlete Think Tank since 2022, helping inform how the brand creates innovative products, meaningful experiences and supportive communities for women and girls.\n\nWilson also recently partnered with Nike and other elite athletes to craft a vision for the future of Nike Air by harnessing cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence in collaboration with the Nike innovation team.\n\nThe Nike A\u2019One sneaker, apparel collection and Calm slide will be available at SNKRS, nike.com and select retail locations in May 2025.\n\nClick into the gallery below to learn more about the Nike A'One signature footwear and apparel collection, and hear directly from A'ja Wilson in an exclusive conversation with Issa Rae.\n\n",

            "content": "The leading athletic footwear and apparel brand faces formidable challenges.\n\nNike (NKE -1.35%), one of the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel makers, was once considered a resilient blue chip stock. But over the past 12 months, its stock declined 25% as the S&P 500 advanced 24%. Its revenue growth stalled out as it struggled with a sluggish North American market and tough competitive headwinds.\n\nSo will Nike's stock finally bottom out and climb higher over the next 12 months? Let's review its main challenges, its turnaround plans, and its valuations to find out.\n\nWhat happened to Nike over the past decade?\n\nTen years ago, Nike claimed it could grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% from $30.6 billion in fiscal 2015 (which ended in May 2015) to $50 billion in fiscal 2020. It planned to accomplish that by expanding its Nike Direct channel (which houses its own e-commerce website and brick-and-mortar stores) and its overseas businesses to reduce its dependence on its more saturated markets.\n\nHowever, Nike only grew its revenue at a five-year CAGR of 4% to $37.4 billion in fiscal 2020. The weakness of its Converse brand and its weak sales in North America and Europe offset the growth of its namesake brand and its robust expansion in China. It also struggled with the bankruptcy of Sports Authority in 2016, which flooded the market with excess athletic footwear and apparel, as well as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of fiscal 2020.\n\nBut from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023, Nike's revenue rose at a CAGR of 11%. Its business warmed up again as it expanded Nike Direct to curb its dependence on wholesale retailers and gather more first-party customer data for its design and marketing strategies. Nike Direct accounted for 42% of its Nike's total revenue in fiscal 2023, up from 33% of its revenue in fiscal 2020.\n\nSo why did the market turn against Nike?\n\nNike's business seemed to grow at a steady clip again, but its revenue growth flatlined in fiscal 2024 as its declining North American sales offset its recovery in China and its robust growth in other overseas markets.\n\nAt the same time, Nike Direct's growth cooled off as consumers pivoted back toward wholesale retailers. It also faced intense competition from resilient competitors like Adidas, On Holding, and Anta Sports, which owns the Chinese rights to FILA. Even Lululemon has been evolving into a competitor by expanding into the footwear market over the past three years.\n\nOn a currency neutral basis, Nike Direct's revenue declined year over year for the past three consecutive quarters as its total revenue growth stalled out. It expects its downturn to deepen with a low double-digit revenue decline in the third quarter.\n\nMetric Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Nike Direct Revenue Growth (YOY) 4% 0% (7%) (12%) (14%) Total Revenue Growth (YOY) (1%) 0% 0% (9%) (9%)\n\nWhat are Nike's turnaround plans?\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect Nike's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to decline 10% and 48%, respectively. Its digital sales are still soft, its inventory levels are elevated, and it's relying more heavily on markdowns to flush out its older inventories.\n\nNike is addressing those issues with three main strategies. First, it's trying to rebuild its relationships with more wholesale retailers to reduce its dependence on Nike Direct. However, that strategy probably won't pay off anytime soon because its wholesale revenues still declined year over year throughout the first half of fiscal 2025.\n\nSecond, it's trying to sell a higher mix of premium and full-price products to offset its ongoing markdowns. But that strategy is also unpredictable: Its gross margin expanded year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, but declined in the second quarter as it sold a higher mix of marked down products. It expects another gross margin contraction in the third quarter, which implies its full-year gross margin will decline from fiscal 2024.\n\nLastly, Nike is ramping up its spending on the development of new products and fresh marketing campaigns. However, those strategies could compress its operating margins as its sales growth stagnates.\n\nIn other words, investors should brace for at least a few more quarters of tepid top line growth with elevated operating expenses. The strong dollar will also exacerbate that pressure by gobbling up its overseas sales.\n\nWhere will Nike's stock be in a year?\n\nIf Nike's turnaround plans gradually pay off, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 2% and 19%, respectively, in fiscal 2026. But based on those estimates, Nike's stock still looks a bit too expensive at 38 times forward earnings. Its forward dividend yield of 2.1% also probably won't attract any serious income investors.\n\nBased on these facts, I believe Nike's stock will either stagnate or slip lower over the next 12 months. This iconic brand isn't down for the count yet, but it won't command a higher valuation until its turnaround efforts bear more fruit.",

            "content": "A'ja Wilson's just-revealed signature Nike 'A'One' shoe reflects her values. And fondness for pink\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 While A'ja Wilson was growing up in Columbia, the South Carolina State Fairgrounds was usually the place to see cattle or consume fried food.\n\nOn Monday, it was way more.\n\nThe three-time WNBA MVP who had her University of South Carolina jersey retired less than 24 hours before was there to film a sit-down interview.\n\nWilson sat on a production set draped in her custom pink hue and discussed with award-winning actress, producer and writer Issa Rae her new Nike signature shoe, the \"A\u2019One,\" the design of which was revealed for the first time at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe shoe highlights a collection that includes signature athletic shorts, sandals, T-shirts and a sweatshirt which will all be available for purchase in May. Prices have not yet been disclosed.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" Wilson said after filming ended. \"It's a big moment to have Issa here ... to talk and have real conversations about my collection. It's a lot of fun, and that's what I wanted it to be like. That was my vision for my whole collection, to be fun, vibrant, but also a lovely journey along the way.\"\n\nDawn Staley tells A'ja Wilson about her signature Nike shoe\n\nLast May, Wilson walked into Colonial Life Arena for a WNBA preseason game with the Las Vegas Aces wearing a shirt that read, \"Of Course I Have A Shoe Dot Com.\" Anticipation grew as the two-time WNBA champion revealed she was getting a Nike signature shoe.\n\nSouth Carolina coach Dawn Staley was the one who broke the news to Wilson.\n\n\"I blacked out. I don't really know what she said afterwards,\" Wilson said. \"Everyone knows my relationship with her \u2014 she coached me in college, we won a gold medal together, she's my second mom. The bond that we have is forever. So for her to be the one to tell me, it was just a full-circle moment.\"\n\nWilson is just the 13th woman to have a signature shoe. Staley was the fourth when her \"Nike Zoom S5 and S5 II\" were released in 1998-99 as she began her WNBA career with the Charlotte Sting.\n\n\"(That moment) felt like I was doing it for them, doing it for her,\" Wilson said. \"The ones that laid the foundation down for me to be able to stand here with a Nike collaborator ... (they laid) those bricks down, but now it's my turn for the next generation. It was truly special.\"\n\nWhy honesty, individuality is key for WNBA star A'ja Wilson\n\nWilson talked Monday about hating basketball as a youth, about being turned away because of the sweat and was open about her lack of desire even to play, painting a picture of her awkward teen years.\n\nHer athletic journey isn't filled with clich\u00e9s. She didn't have a basketball in her hand as a toddler and was instead a self-described \"normal kid\" who loved the couch. She even admitted that when thinking about picking a college, she thought about boys.\n\nShe's human. She's who she is. So especially on days like Monday, a celebration of a monumental moment in her career, that didn't change.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm maybe too honest, but that's what I try to give to people so they understand the realness of it,\" Wilson said. \"People get blinded by the accolades and the uniform and say 'Oh, you make it look so easy and effortless' but they tend to forget how it wasn't just pretty all the time. I hope that I can always show that to people because I'm human, I go through things, I have feelings ... I'm so glad that I can be honest, so I can hopefully open up doors for people to be honest with themselves.\"\n\nHumanity bleeds through her Nike shoes. It's footwear painted in Wilson's personality, crafted by her roots.\n\nThe shoe's tongue features the tattoos she has on each arm. The bottom is engraved with her favorite quotes. She said she doesn't just want basketball players to wear them, but any and everyone which is why a key aspect was making youth sizes, to include and inspire the next generation.\n\nHer grandmother always told her \"pretty girls wear pearls,\" so at the height of her self-consciousness, she wore pearls then became the most confident version of herself. The various pink tones of the shoe represent her confidence, passion and favorite color, with the lighter shade a reminder of what opening a pearl looks like\u2014a nod to her grandmother.\n\n\"I try to help people understand that it's never just about me, it's always bigger than what it may seem in the moment,\" Wilson said. \"My signature is on it but the messages behind it, the journey of how we got here. It's so much bigger than basketball ... this is everyone's journey. You can live your own journey through your own way, but look cute while doing it. You can have fun while doing it. So I hope that's what this collection shows.\"\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network.

            "content": "Out of all the major players in the golf shoe world, Nike seems to remain the most nonchalant when it comes to design. When I say nonchalant, I\u2019m not talking about a lack of effort, mediocrity, or subpar golf shoes. I\u2019m talking about simple, streetwear-inspired or retro golf kicks that heavily appeal to the 18\u201345 year old age group. Take a glance at our reviews of the Air Jordan 9 G, the Nike Air Max 1 86 OG G, or the Jordan 1 Low G to see what I mean.\n\nNike continues this trend with the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G, and oooooooooh boy, am I here for it. I fall into the above-mentioned age group, so I\u2019m a sucker for the simple retro design of the Pegasus 89 G. Nike (and other brands) continue to take retro running and basketball shoes and turn them into functional, and comfortable, performance golf shoes.\n\nLet\u2019s head to the first tee and swing away.\n\nNike Air Pegasus 89 G Price: $120 Sizing: True to size but snug Buy at Nike\n\nTraction\n\nThere\u2019s nothing too special about the rubberized traction of the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G. Like a mom loving Diet Coke, it\u2019s pretty typical.\n\nIt\u2019s not spike-level quality, but it performed on par with other spikeless models we\u2019ve tested. The rubber traction is multi-shaped with different tread patterns on various parts of the shoe. We mainly see square and rectangular treads, but there\u2019s a mix of other shapes as well.\n\nFor golfers in dry climates, this is a wonderful option. Golfers in wetter climates can find better spikeless traction, but I still wouldn\u2019t turn down a couple of rounds in the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G in the rain. It\u2019s good enough to hang tough.\n\nSo, while there\u2019s better spikeless traction available on the market, there\u2019s also much worse.\n\nFit\n\nThe Nike Air Pegasus 89 G is true to size but fits more on the snug side. It gripped the bridge of my foot a lot tighter than I prefer, but I didn\u2019t notice it until after the third hour on my feet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t tight enough to recommend sizing up, but it\u2019s worth noting that you may feel some tightness on the top of your foot. Those who prefer a roomier fit may want to steer clear of the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G for optimum comfort.\n\nCushion\n\nThe Nike Air Pegasus 89 G is a comfortable option if you\u2019re looking for something that works both on and off the course.\n\nThe midsole features two densities of foam in the forefoot and heel. On top of that, it includes an encapsulated Air bag in the heel, which was easy to feel and added some much needed softness for my heel.\n\nWhether you walk or ride, you can count on solid comfort underfoot from the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G. It\u2019s also \u201ccomforting\u201d (dad joke intended) to know the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G can be worn off the course as well. At the time of writing, I\u2019m at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, [Editor\u2019s Note: that\u2019s an impressively bougie name drop mid review] and the Pegasus 89 G has been wonderful as a hybrid casual and golf shoe.\n\nSupport\n\nThe foam from the middle of the foot to the heel is a higher durometer (firmer) to reinforce the midsole and features a small guiderail to support the heel.\n\nThe extra rearfoot support helps the most when tackling more aggressive terrain, where the elements press against the sides of your feet. It helped keep my feet centered and balanced through my swing.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the greatest benefit on hilly courses with plenty of climbing. If you\u2019re anything like me, you hit a few shots off target throughout your round. The support of the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G will help golfers navigate diverse terrain with ease.\n\nPrice\n\nThe colorway I tested is currently $120 on Nike\u2019s website, with a couple of other options closer to the $80 price point.\n\nAt $120, the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G is one of the most affordable golf shoes in Nike\u2019s arsenal. The price is fair and makes this model worth every penny \u2013 especially since it\u2019s durable and can handle more than just golf.\n\nNike Air Pegasus 89 G Summary\n\nTo tell you the truth, I thought the Nike Air Pegasus 89 G would be \u201cjust another Nike golf shoe.\u201d I was wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and feel of the Pegasus 89 G.\n\nThe feature I\u2019ll tout the most is its convenience both on and off the course. There are plenty of golf shoes that perform well in both settings, but the Pegasus 89 G does so while maintaining a signature stylish look.\n\nAside from the convenience and style, the cushion and support are consistent with what I\u2019ve experienced while wearing other Nike shoes. While there was some discomfort on the bridge of my foot, it was minimal. When I took the Pegasus 89 G off, my feet still felt good. The discomfort on my foot was due to the tighter fit. The cushion of the Pegasus 89 G is solid with no complaints from me.\n\nThis shoe is designed for all types of golfers looking to enjoy a casual round of golf. This is a solid spikeless option but I\u2019m still keen on recommending spiked shoes for competitive players. The Nike Air Pegasus 89 G is the perfect golf shoe for a quick nine holes before work without needing to swap shoes after your round.\n\nconnorlwt 8.5 / 10 Total Score\n\nHow the Author Golfs\n\nTyler Allred (19 handicap): Golfs 2-3 times a week spending the bulk of his time playing actual rounds. Mostly pushes himself to improve every part of his game, but also enjoys a casual round of golf every now and then.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWhile Nike did send a pair of the Air Pegasus 89 G to facilitate this review, the company had no involvement in this review, didn\u2019t receive an advance look at it, and has not attempted to influence it.",

Their unwavering commitment to the WNBA has them at the front lines of the ongoing battle for equal opportunity, and through 2037, they\u2019ve made it a point to have the Swoosh as the league\u2019s exclusive on-court uniform and apparel provider. Where the brand can really change the landscape is through their product, doing so putting women at the forefront of the competitive signature shoe business. A roster that includes Sabrina Ionescu, Caitlin Clark, and A\u2019ja Wilson is giving the men a run for their money, and the newly unveiled A\u2019One is sending stronger ripples that can force waters into once uncharted territories. Typically, the Hall-of-Fame career comes after the first signature shoe, but that\u2019s only a testament to just how insanely special A\u2019ja is. At her current trajectory, the Aces superstar could go down as the GOAT. If she stopped right now, she\u2019s already a Top 10 OAT. But greatest-of chatter aside, A\u2019ja is excited, emotional, and giddy to start her journey as a Nike signature athlete. Today, Nike officially unveils the first A\u2019ja Wilson shoes, the Nike A\u2019One. Debuting in the \u201cPink Aura\u201d colorway, the newest Nike Basketball women\u2019s signature shoe is confirmed to launch on SNKRS and select retailers in May; MSRP is established at $110 for Adult Unisex sizes and $90 for Grade School.\n\nThe overhanging motif of the design is that of a pearl, nodding to an heirloom necklace gifted to A\u2019ja by her grandmother. The design of the upper features a gradation of protective layers echoing outwards from the precious gem represented by the pearlized Swoosh. Another nod to the pearl, and perhaps by coincidence, is that A\u2019ja private Instagram burner account features the word pearl (we tried to find the account, but to no avail). More hidden elements include a special quote on the outsole that reads \u201cAs a matter of fact, the best is yet to come,\u201d, a message from her grandmother taken from A\u2019ja published book Dear Black Girls. Behind the tongue is A\u2019ja special tattoo; it\u2019s placed there specifically so she can see it every time she laces up her shoe. On the tech side, the A\u2019One features a Cushlon ST2 foam encased by an injected phylon midsole carrier featuring an oblong-shaped bezel frame; this mimics the hard shell of a clam protecting the pearl inside. Read on below for a quick one-on-one interview with A\u2019ja Wilson and Nike Senior Designer Ben Nethongkome and a closer look at the A\u2019One.\n\n\u201cI would love to see LeBron in my shoe just because of the mutual respect we have for one another.\u201d A\u2019ja on who she\u2019d like to see wear her shoe\n\nSneaker News: You\u2019re a great, confident communicator and so you\u2019re able to literally write down your thoughts in a book, but a shoe is so different because it\u2019s so abstract. What are some of the things that you told Nike that you needed in your shoe?\n\n\n\nA\u2019ja Wilson: Number one, I wanted it to be a shoe where you can instantly identify it as my shoe right out of the gate, that you knew it was the A\u2019One. Secondly, I wanted it to be really comfortable. I wanted it to be light. Thirdly, I wanted durability. I wanted it to be able to sustain four quarters of play. That was my biggest thing And finally, I wanted it to look good!\n\n\n\nPrior to the A\u2019One, it\u2019s been well documented that A\u2019ja has been wearing LeBron\u2019s signature shoes, so it seems that that style of hoops shoe has been resonating with her. Considering LeBrons are higher priced and have more tech, was that a challenge in the A\u2019One creation since it is a lesser-priced model?\n\n\n\nBen Nethongkome: I wouldn\u2019t see them as challenge, but as opportunities. We identify that there indeed models out there that she likes, and from there we can extract and reverse-engineer. Prior to LeBron, she was also wearing the Cosmic Unity, so we also learned from that chassis, we took all those learnings and crafted the A\u2019One. We were able to tie in those past models that she was playing in and winning in, and making her signature shoe from that.",

            "content": "Nike (NKE -1.35%) has been a top stock to own throughout its history. However, the business has struggled in recent years, and the stock has floundered.\n\nUnder former CEO John Donahoe, the company took its eye off the ball. It prioritized technical strategies, like performance marketing and its direct-to-consumer business. However, it lost sight of long-term priorities, such as developing new products, maintaining retail relationships, and building the brand.\n\nThe company replaced Donahoe with Elliott Hill in September. Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, came out of retirement for the job. He has held several high-level positions with the company, including overseeing products and a range of geographies.\n\nNike stock hasn't responded to the change in leadership yet, but the discount offers a good buying opportunity if the company can get back on track. Keep reading for three reasons Nike is a good buy for long-term investors.\n\n1. Nike's problems are fixable\n\nIn the last few years, Nike's sales growth has stalled, even turning negative as it's lost market share and profits have fallen. However, Nike's challenges are mostly due to unforced errors it should be able to resolve.\n\nIt's lost market share to smaller fast-growing brands like On Holding and Deckers' Hoka in running. However, Nike's running business returned to growth, led by the Pegasus franchise, in the second quarter, even as overall revenue fell 10%, and new products are coming down the pipeline as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Nike continues to dominate basketball and has an unmatched roster of athletes to promote the brand and launch new signature shoes. That includes phenom Caitlin Clark, with whom Nike has yet to roll out a shoe or ad campaign.\n\nHill, who has worked closely with Nike's retail partners before, is working to rebuild those relationships and regain shelf space for Nike. Nike expects sales to be down for the next few quarters as it repairs the business. It's focused on scaling back on inventory and moving back to a pull model to achieve a premium brand and avoid markdowns. That playbook looks promising.\n\n2. Sports remains a growth market\n\nThe money pouring into sports entertainment continues to grow. Athletes are signing contracts in the hundred-million-dollar range, and sports broadcasting rights continue to become more inflated.\n\nThat business reflects the end demand among audiences around the world for sports, which feeds demand for Nike products. Live sports act as an advertisement for Nike, the athletes who are its sponsors, and the game itself.\n\nThe sports entertainment business is only going to get bigger as Disney launches its flagship ESPN streaming app and Netflix finally taps into the demand for live sports. In other words, the underlying demand for the storytelling Nike's brand is associated with and its products is as strong as ever and continues to grow.\n\nIf Nike can fix the nuts-and-bolts issues with its business mentioned above, tapping into demand for sports apparel, footwear, and streetwear shouldn't be difficult.\n\n3. The stock is cheaper than it looks\n\nNike's stock is now down 56% from its peak in 2021, but its valuation isn't as low as you might expect, as it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25. However, there's a lot of potential growth in Nike's earnings because margins have fallen significantly, and revenue is now declining as well.\n\nOperating income is down roughly 30% since its peak in 2021, and Nike has taken advantage of the sell-off by buying back its stock. Analysts expect the next year or two to be challenging for Nike, meaning the bar is low for a recovery.\n\nAt this point, Nike can start to engineer a recovery for the stock by just beating estimates, even if it takes a few quarters for the business to return to growth. Given its history and clear leadership in its industry, Wall Street is likely to give it the benefit of the doubt if it starts moving in the right direction.",

            "content": "Nike KD 17 Summary KD 17 English Review KD 17 Spanish Review The Nike KD 17 is very similar on paper to the KD 16, with some tweaks here and there, but is it worth upgrading to the new model? 9 / 10 Total Score Buy from Nike Asia #nike_FJ9487-800 Pros: Top-notch cushioning\n\nReasonable price\n\nGreat traction Cons: Synthetic build\n\nImprovable containment\n\nKevin Durant\u2019s signature line has been absolutely elite since the Nike KD 12 wich coincided with the introduction of the full-length Zoom Air Strobel to Kevin Durant\u2019s signature line. The KD 12, 13, 14, and 15 have all been great all-around basketball shoes. They leveled up thanks to the plush yet responsive cushioning that the great Zoom Air Strobel provides.\n\nWell, the Nike KD 16 switched things up in a big way. Instead of the setup that we have come to know and love in the past years, the KD 16 brought us something very comfortable, but very different. In fact, the KD 16 was one of the best basketball shoes of last year. All of this to say that the Nike KD 17, on paper at least, is very similar to the Nike KD 16.\n\nBoth shoes feature a lot of the same tech integrated into two different packages. But, implementation is everything when we are talking about performance basketball shoes, so let\u2019s dive into the review to see how the Nike KD 17 performed on court.\n\nUPDATE: The Nike KD 17 made it on our list of the most comfortable basketball shoes of the year, our list of the best pink basketball shoes, our list of the best basketball shoes for volleyball, and our list of the best basketball shoes in terms of traction.\n\nNike KD 17 Review\n\nNike KD 17 Traction\n\nTraction on the KD 16 was great. It worked great indoors and was above average in terms of durability, so it was also a decent outdoor option. The KD 17 features a very different traction setup but it offers similar, top-notch, on-court performance. In this colorway of the shoe the rubber of the outsole is translucent and is etched with a radial, heatmap-style traction pattern (reminiscent of what was on the KD 7).\n\nThis setup worked great on even the dustiest of indoor surfaces. The rubber is grippy and bites the hardwood very well. There\u2019s enough space between the lines of the traction pattern so that debris doesn\u2019t accumulate to a point where it affects performance and it provides excellent multi-directional coverage.\n\nAnother positive of this setup is that the rubber feels firm enough to withstand moderate outdoor use. We wouldn\u2019t suggest making the Nike KD 17 your go-to for the blacktop but it can handle a couple hours outdoors here and there. If you can get your hands on a pair that features an XDR rubber outsole, then the KD 17 could be considered a great outdoor option.\n\nNike KD 17 Cushion\n\nThe Nike KD 17 features the same exact setup as the KD 16. Instead of a full-length Zoom Air Strobel, the KD 17 again features a dual-density setup. From the midfoot to the heel we have an Air Strobel, very similar to the one that was featured in the Jordan Zion 2. In the forefoot, we have a large Zoom Air unit that covers most of that area.\n\nThese two units are housed within a lightweight foam midsole. As in the KD 16, this is a very comfortable setup with a considerable amount of compression. Is it as comfortable as a KD model with a Zoom Air Strobel? No, but it\u2019s still a very nice, smooth, and well-balanced configuration.\n\nThis setup is another reason why the KD 17 will be a good outdoor option as it provides enough impact protection and compression to offset the the lack of shock absorption that you find on the blacktop.\n\nOne issue Chris ran into was that the insole on the left shoe of his pair did not adhere correctly to the Air Strobel. So, every time he went to play in the shoe, the insole would roll underneath his foot. We are going to chalk this up to a fluke, but keep an eye out just the same.\n\nNike KD 17 Materials\n\nThe materials on the Nike KD 17 are what we have come to expect from a KD shoe. We have a combination of a textile mesh and \u201cleather\u201d, all of which are synthetic. The build flexes well, it conforms and contains your foot, it\u2019s very well-ventilated, and requires little to no break-in time. Nothing is premium on the shoe but everything should perform well.\n\nThe shoe features a TPU wrap on either side of the shoe (inspired by the Nike Air Max Plus) to boost lateral containment. The mix of synthetic leather in the heel and mesh in the mid and forefoot give the KD 17 a nice in-hand feel and a very 2000-ish vibe all around.\n\nNike KD 17 Support\n\nThe most prominent support feature on the KD 16 was the Penny 2-esque TPU panels on either side of the shoe. These two pieces provided very solid lateral containment, and, as you can see, they aren\u2019t featured in this year\u2019s model. This is one aspect where the KD 16 outperforms the KD 17. There were situations on court where these portions of the shoe were overstretched, which didn\u2019t happen in the KD 16.\n\nYou can fix this to a certain extent by tightening the laces on the shoe, but it\u2019s an issue, especially for heavier players who generate a lot of force when they play. If your foot sat within the midsole this might not have been a problem.\n\nWe get a very wide base and a super stable cushioning system that creates adequate all-around support on the KD 17.\n\nNike KD 17 Fit\n\nThe KD 17 fits very similarly to the KD 16, so go with whatever size you used in last year\u2019s model, and, if you didn\u2019t play in the KD 16, go with whatever size you usually use with Nike and you should be good to go. It is a nice snug 1 to 1 fit which is optimal for performance but if you have had issues with this type of fit in the past, we suggest trying these on in-store.\n\nNike KD 17 Overall\n\nTo keep things short and sweet, the Nike KD 17 is basically the same shoe as the Nike KD 16. If you like that shoe, you\u2019re going to enjoy this one. The Nike KD 17 is a top-tier and super versatile performance basketball shoe that will work well for almost every playing style and position on the floor. The KD 17 also gets extra points for being a \u201cbetter than average\u201d outdoor option, especially if you can find an XDR version.\n\nNow, is it worth upgrading from the KD 16 to the Nike KD 17? Not really. If you already have a pair of 16 that are still in good condition or you can find the KD 16 on clearance, that will give you more bang for your buck. But, if you want to rock the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d on court, the KD 17 will be a great performance model.",

The shoes are expected to release on SNKRS and Jordan retailers including Foot Locker, Finish Line, Champs, JD Sports, Sneaker Politics, CNCPTS, Extra Butter, and more.

See our Jordan Release Dates page in the meantime for the latest updates on this year\u2019s new Jordans.\n\nAir Jordan 4 Black Cat History\n\nThe Black Cat 4s first launched in 2006; it was the first-ever all-black colorway of the Air Jordan 4 and was given that specific nickname as a nod to Michael Jordan\u2019s animalistic alter ego. Not a trace of another color was on the shoe, which at the time was quite uncommon for Jordan Retro footwear. In 2020, Jordan Brand brought back the Black Cat 4s back into the Retro circuit to much fanfare; pairs today command close to $1,000.\n\n1 of 5\n\nInfo via @zsneakerheadz/Sneaker Files",

From a Lakers' point of view, it's obvious this move is preparing the franchise for life without LeBron James whenever the 40-year-old retires.\n\nDavis is a 10-time All-Star, and still one of the top players in the world when healthy, but having been plagued with injuries and Father Time not taking any days off, it's an odd move from Dallas' perspective.\n\nREAD: Conspiracy Theorists Claim Donald Trump Called For The Luka Doncic To Lakers Trade To Distract From Tariffs\n\nGiven that Nico Harrison is the president of basketball operations and the general manager of the Mavericks, he signed off on the trade. As fans were left scratching their heads in the aftermath of the deal, a story about Harrison's time as an executive at Nike, where he spent 19 years working with some of the biggest names in NBA history.\n\nOne player Harrison most definitely did not work with during his tenure at Nike was Steph Curry, and he played a major role in the company's unfortunate reality.\n\nIn 2013, when Curry was 25 years old and had yet to win an NBA title, he sat down with Nike about signing what would have been his second shoe deal with the swoosh brand. Under Armour had offered him a $4 million per year deal plus a signature shoe while Nike offered him $2.5 million.\n\nA $1.5 million gap is a significant one, but it's safe to say money wasn't the only reason Curry ultimately went with Under Armour.\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated, Nike completely botched the pitch meeting, and Harrison was at the center of it. One Nike executive reportedly mispronounced Curry's name calling him \"Steph-on\" instead of \"Steph-en.\" Meanwhile, a repurposed powerpoint with a picture of Kevin Durant, not Curry, was displayed on the screen during the meeting.\n\nIn 2022, Harrison finally addressed the rumors that he was the one who mispronounced his name, and during his explanation, he actually dug himself in an even deeper hole.\n\n\"There is an article out. And the article says I mispronounced his name. It wasn't me. It absolutely wasn't me. But they didn't know the other person, they knew me. So, they say I mispronounced his name because it's sexy. But I'm like, first of all, I've known this guy forever, like since he was in high school. I used to represent his dad. How am I going to mispronounce his name? I might have called him Seth, but I wasn't going to mispronounce his name. So yeah, Nike made a mistake,\" Harrison said on the Point Forward podcast in 2022.\n\nSo, instead of mispronouncing his name, Harrison called Steph Curry \u2018Seth,\u2019 who is Steph Curry's younger brother who spent time in the NBA.",

            "content": "Nike is adding a new rendition to the Air Max Plus series, known as \"Mink Brown.\" It is said to present a classy but muted colorway to the game for those who like neutral and earthy hues. As of now, the company has not divulged anything about the specifications, but rumors and early leaks have begun giving sneakerheads an idea of what is on its way.\n\nKnown to continue the signature aesthetic from Air Max Plus, the \"Mink Brown\" iteration is expected to carry similar elements like wavy cage overlays with a gradient effect. Since this is still an unreleased model, any speculation should be approached with caution until Nike announces confirmation.\n\nDesign and Aesthetic Of Nike Air Max Plus \u201cMink Brown\u201d sneakers\n\nAccording to the reports by sneakernews and kicksonfire , the Nike Air Max Plus \"Mink Brown\" will feature a brown mesh base that will be the foundation of the shoe's structure. The cage overlays are supposed to have a gradient shift from the bottom, which would be deeper in mink to a lighter beige tone closer to the laces. This will add depth without overwhelming the whole look.\n\nThe midfoot shank will also feature subtle beige details tied with the rest of the shoe's neutral color motif. Hence, the total effect of the combination is relatively muted to the aesthetic point and provides a very versatile option for different outfits.\n\nThe midsole would probably be a sail-tinted finish to go well with the brown tone in the upper for visual balance. The outsole would feature a solid brown rubber construction to deliver durability and grip. This model maintains the classic silhouette's structure.\n\nExpected Comfort and Performance with Nike Air Max Plus \u201cMink Brown\u201d sneakers\n\nThe shoe is supposed to inherit the Air Max Plus model's cushioning system. The midsole is constructed with visible Tuned Air units designed for better support and impact absorption. This makes it feasible for long-term use.\n\nMesh on the upper material allows breathability with airflow to cool the feet in movement.\n\n\u200b\n\nAvailability Release Date Of Nike Air Max Plus \u201cMink Brown\u201d sneakers\n\nAlthough no exact release date has been set for this particular shoe, words on platforms like sneakernews and kicksonfire claim that it may arrive this coming Summer, 2025, and will be sold for around $180.\n\nThe \"Mink Brown\" has not yet been priced but will probably cost in the range of most other Air Max Plus. As the demand for this silhouette is pretty high, the resale price varies.\n\nAs per the reports from sneakernews and kicksonfire , the earth tone color palette is versatile but not as bold as many of the stronger Air Max Plus releases. Many sneaker-heads that need bright color profiles will find the Mink Brown relatively bland.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs always, would-be buyers should keep on the ball with the release announcements from Nike for the best possible information about the release date. With comfort, style, and signature Air Max technology, the \"Mink Brown\" edition should appeal to silhouette fans who like understated aesthetics.\n\n\u200b",

If, however, you're willing to take a chance on a beaten-down stock, then the payoff could be much more attractive in the long run.\n\nNike (NKE -1.35%) could be that type of stock right now. It's in the early stages of a turnaround, and it may take years before its financials improve. It'll require patience from investors, but it's an option worth considering, especially at a time when the broad market looks inflated and many stocks are trading at high valuations.\n\nCould now be an opportune time to load up on Nike stock?\n\nNike stock is trading near multiyear lows\n\nTo say things haven't been going well for Nike would be a massive understatement. It has been a top athletic and footwear brand for decades, but over the past three years, its market cap has fallen over 50%. A slowing growth rate and uninspiring economic conditions have weighed on the consumer goods stock so much that it's not only trading near a 52-week low, but it's also getting closer to the levels it fell to in early 2020, during the COVID-19 crash.\n\nAs a result of the its extended decline, the stock is currently valued at 23 times its trailing earnings, which is near its lowest level in the past decade.\n\nCan the business get back to growth?\n\nNike stock looks cheap, but any upside potential hinges on its outlook. If the business continues to struggle with growth and profits, the stock likely has further to fall.\n\nAnd that's the big test for new CEO Elliott Hill, who took over in Oct. 2024. With more than 30 years of experience at Nike, Hill came out of retirement to take over the role from John Donahoe.\n\nNike experienced a surge in revenue during the pandemic, but that is far from the situation today. The company has had to grapple with supply chain disruptions and poor inventory management. An overly aggressive focus on the direct-to-consumer business resulted in growing pains as well.\n\n\n\nRevenue has declined in the three most recent quarters, which is why a turnaround may not be quick or easy for the new leadership. But Hill is looking to rebuild Nike's relationships with its wholesale partners, who have historically been a key part of the company's success.\n\nIf you believe in the brand, you should believe in the stock\n\nNot all of the company's problems have stemmed from operational missteps. Consumers have been scaling back on discretionary purchases due to inflation and challenging economic conditions too.\n\n\n\nThat said, this is still the top brand in athletics and footwear, and Nike has seen its fair share of market cycles. It might take a while before new leadership can build momentum with its turnaround, but buying and holding Nike stock at its current price should feel like a steal in a few years.",

While we know of multiple signature sneakers dropping around the event and even a PE edition of the GT Hustle 3 for Victor Wembanyama, an ultra-limited set of signature sneakers is joining the lineup as part of a Black Label collection. This includes a pair for LeBron James on his LeBron 22 silhouette.\n\nLuxurious materials grace the silhouette, swapping out the typical leather or suede construction for a mixture of faux croc skin and black pony hair. The latter of the two materials is on the Swoosh cut out on the lateral side that wraps back to the heel and takes over parts of the medial midfoot. The black look is contrasted by metallic gold details on the tongue, the left hosting a Nike Black Label logo and the right featuring LeBron James\u2019 crown logo.\n\nNike LeBron 22 Black Label\n\nAnother hit of Black Label branding is found on the lateral collar, with a small tab for the collection featured, while the left pair comes with a numbered label indicating that the pair is limited to 1,984. The luxe feel continues onto the sockliner, where LeBron\u2019s crown logo is subtly debossed into the mesh material. Below, the midsole, containing a Zoom Air unit, Cushlon 2.0 foam, and a Zoom Turbo unit, has its Swoosh logo made up of an iridescent material. The black rubber outsole finishes the design with a blue Swoosh painted near the toe.\n\nThe Nike LeBron 22 Black Label will release on February 14, 2025, though exactly how the drop will go down is a mystery. Considering it is limited to 1,984, expect a SNKRS drop and maybe a small release in or around the San Francisco area for NBA All-Star. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $210.

For the outdoors, we like the ones currently in the ACG lineup. They\u2019re lightweight but warm gloves built from a polyester-spandex blend, using Nike\u2019s proprietary Dri-FIT fabric to move sweat away from your skin. Available in a trio of colorways, the gloves also have touchscreen-compatible fingertips and palms.\n\nNike ACG Izy Baroque Brown and Black\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nMoccasins with a twist, Nike\u2019s brand-new ACG Izy just dropped in this Baroque Brown and Black colorway, providing a mature look to these impossibly comfortable shoes that you can take from town to trail. Secured with a zippered top, your feet will love the enhanced midsole cushioning for all-day wear but can go a little farther thanks to the rugged outsole.\n\nNike ACG Air Exploraid\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nNike\u2019s more sports-focused ranges shouldn\u2019t have all the fun when it comes to reissues. Recently, the ACG line revived a popular \u201890s silhouette called the Air Exploraid, which is more than just a hyper-stylish pair of sneakers with a layered upper that combines mesh, suede, and textiles. The town-to-trail hikers have unique extended forefoot lacing for a more secure fit and a Max Air unit in the midsole for cushioning.\n\nNike ACG \u201cCanwell Glacier\u201d Therma-FIT ADV Windproof Jacket\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nProving you can still be stylish when traversing the wilderness, Nike ACG\u2019s \u201cCanwell Glacier\u201d half-zip windbreaker sports a unique pattern inspired by leaf cutter ants found on the research team\u2019s trip to Costa Rica. Made with a Jacquard polyester knit that\u2019s fabric dyed for longevity, the jacket also benefits from Therma-FIT ADV tech that helps regulate temperatures in colder weather.\n\nNike ACG \u201cChena Vortex\u201d Storm-FIT ADV GORE-TEX Jacket\n\nPhoto: Nike\n\nPart windbreaker, part rain jacket, this Chena Vortex silhouette \u2014 named after an Alaskan river \u2014 is really for adventurers who find themselves in the wettest, perhaps snowiest, conditions thanks to Storm-FIT ADV technology. Sporting an idiosyncratic look with its asymmetrical zipper and bold colorway, the polyester jacket is also built with a waterproof-breathable GORE-TEX membrane for good measure. The unique crossbody zipper also helps with ventilation during times when you don\u2019t necessarily want direct airflow inside, while a zipper on the opposite side gives you an additional ventilation option.",

At one point the dominant Air Max sportswear model across the globe, the silhouette has shown some signs of slowing as it enters its 35th birthday in 2025.\n\nIt being generally inactive in the collaborations and energy product department has factored into it being on the back-burner for the most part. Instead, Nike has chosen to expand its universe with off-shoot models through its Drift line as seen on this silhouette and the Air Max Plus.\n\nThe Air Max 90 Drift is a bit robotic looking, adding sharper, acute angles as if the Japanese mecha aesthetic was the goal. The toe-box is completely redesigned as well, swapping the classically beautiful sport mesh with a transparent synthetic film. The sole remaining consistent with the OG is understandable for cost reasons, but it looks a bit disconnected with the updated upper.\n\nNow nearly a dozen colorways in, this alternate-dimension model is set to arrive again in Spring 2025 in a few new colorways. With the white upper and black mudguard, it reminds us of the OG colorways that made the shoe an icon in the first place. Stay tuned for a release on Nike.com for $160.",

Outside of the mini Swoosh on the midsole and the 12:AM text on the heel, the rest of the upper takes on a black finish, coating the suede and mesh panels.\n\nSwarovski x Nike Ja 2 Scratch Bling\n\nNods to the Nike Black Label collection are found on the left shoe's insole, coated in a metallic silver finish to mimic the Swarovski crystals on the upper. The same design is applied to the Ja logo on the insole of the right shoe, tying together the luxury theme. The blacked-out midsole and outsole are finishing the design, the latter hosting a blue 12 logo.\n\nThe Swarovski x Nike Ja 2 Scratch Bling was released on February 14, 2025, and is available now through Nike SNKRS and online. In men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $150.

            "content": "Editor\u2019s note: This release was updated January 30, 2025, to include retail information for the Nike Pegasus Premium and additional photos of the silhouette.\n\n\n\nAir is Nike\u2019s most versatile and performance-enhancing cushioning technology, and the company is constantly innovating how the proprietary platform can better serve athletes. Never taking its eye off the future, Nike is raising the bar with the unveil of the Nike Pegasus Premium, which features Nike\u2019s first sculpted, visible Air Zoom unit. Designed with the same ambition that\u2019s inspired Nike\u2019s boldest Air creations, the Pegasus Premium optimizes Nike Air to deliver an efficient, responsive sensation unlike any other Air Zoom cushioning system to date.\n\nThe visible Air Zoom unit is sculpted from the forefoot to the heel, contoured to carry a runner\u2019s power efficiently from their heel strike to their toe-off. The unit cushions a runner\u2019s landing and smoothly transitions them into their next step. For decades, Nike innovators have designed around flat Air Zoom units to deliver full energy return. But with Nike\u2019s mastery of emerging tools like computational design, AI engines and rapid prototyping, designers can contort Air units into new curvatures that more closely resemble the shape of the foot, leading to new levels of efficiency.\n\nThe addition of Nike\u2019s proprietary ZoomX foam in the midsole and ReactX foam in the heel creates a new cushioning system \u2014 a smooth, propulsive ride mile after mile \u2014 that optimizes energy return for runners. In fact, with its unique Air Zoom unit and strategically placed foam, the Pegasus Premium returns more energy to the runner than any other model in the Pegasus franchise to date.\n\nFor Kathy Gomez, Nike VP NXT Footwear, the Pegasus Premium is significant not only for its technological breakthroughs, but also for the access it presents to all runners by bringing them world-class cushioning systems \u2014 along with a brand-new way to unlock Air Zoom.\n\n\u201cAir is Nike\u2019s separator in the footwear industry \u2014 no one can create cushioning innovations like we can,\u201d says Gomez. \u201cIn running, when we combine Air with components like midfoot plates and with platforms like our proprietary foams, we create superior systems for performance. For the Peg Premium, we wanted runners to get the most energy return possible out of the sculpted Air Zoom unit. Not only does it double as a spring-like mechanism, the Air unit is also designed to engage with the entirety of your foot, no matter your gait pattern or stride length.\u201d\n\nNike\u2019s designers, engineers and scientists at Nike Air Manufacturing Innovation, the Nike Running team, and the Nike Sport Research Lab worked together to deliver an entirely new underfoot Air sensation for runners. Digital capabilities such as finite element analysis, a computerized method for predicting how a product will react to physical forces, helped Nike teams test the sculpted Air unit to predict how it would react to the repeated pounding of running.\n\nTo create a secure fit over the footbed, the upper is engineered with a circular knit. Together with the same dynamic midfoot system used in the Pegasus line, the upper is reinforced in specific areas of the lateral and medial forefoot that need more support during a run.\n\nBoth a signal of Nike\u2019s innovation super cycle and proof of the power of its proprietary Air, the Pegasus Premium embodies the company\u2019s ability to listen to and serve athletes.\n\nThe Nike Pegasus Premium is now available globally at nike.com and select retail partners.\n\n",

            "content": "I mentioned above that the Pegasus Premium uses three key technologies in the midsole. First is Nike\u2019s ZoomX foam, a firm compound that sits right underfoot to provide a responsive ride. It\u2019s used in Nike\u2019s top-tier racing shoes like the Vaporfly and Alphafly, as well as speed work shoes like the Zoom Fly 6.\n\nUnderneath the ZoomX is a full-length Air Zoom unit embedded in the midsole and shaped to mimic the contours of the foot. The Air Zoom Unit essentially acts as a spring, with tensile threads inside that contract and pop up as you land and take off.\n\nThis is the same technology used in the Alphafly, although the Pegasus Premium\u2019s Air Zoom unit runs throughout the entire midsole versus the pods in the forefoot of the Alphafly. This is done because running at faster paces, like you would in the Alphafly, encourages a forefoot landing while running at slower speeds encourages a midfoot or heel landing. The full-length Air Zoom unit ensures that runners can enjoy the benefits no matter how they land.\n\nAnd remember that React X foam I mentioned earlier? This plush, bouncy midsole foam is used underneath the Air Zoom unit in the heel to add a bit of softness to the ride.\n\nAll of these technologies combine to create a rather unique ride.\n\n\u201cRunning in the Pegasus Premium was the equivalent of riding a magic carpet, because the experience felt as if I were in a whole new world,\u201d Mandy says. \u201cIt felt as if I strapped a pair of springs on the bottom of my feet. I went out for a long run over the weekend and was excited every step of the way. Walking, running and just moving felt effortless, efficient and effervescent.\u201d\n\nLike Mandy, Kate and I both wore our shoes for some walks before trying them out on our runs. We both noticed how stiff the cushioning felt while walking.\n\n\u201cFor walking, this shoe felt weird,\u201d Kate says. \u201cIt has a really springy sensation, but it\u2019s completely stiff and the outsole is flat. There is no flexibility to this shoe\u2019s midsole or outsole whatsoever. Stiffness is common in most speed shoes these days, but the difference is that most speed shoes have a rocker shape to help propel you forward. With a totally flat outsole, the Peg Premium is springy, but I wonder why Nike didn\u2019t choose a shape that makes it more propulsive.\u201d\n\nI definitely thought the shoe felt stiff while walking, and I was a little disappointed in anticipation of what that would mean for my runs. I really dislike firm shoes, and I was hoping these wouldn\u2019t feel like bricks on my test run. However, I broke out into a huge grin as soon as I started running. I finally understood the hype around these shoes. They instantly transformed from stiff slabs into bouncy springs.\n\nOkay, that may be a little dramatic, but they definitely felt responsive. They still felt firm on the run, but not in a bad way. It felt like the firmness of the ZoomX foam and the springiness of the Air Zoom unit were combining to give me some extra pep in my step. I don\u2019t know if it was the chilly weather, the fact that I hadn\u2019t run for a few days prior, or the delightful underfoot sensation but I found myself needing to constantly remind my legs to slow down.\n\nThe Pegasus Premium is rounded out with a waffle traction outsole, designed to deliver superior grip on the roads. I live in South Florida, so I have no winter weather to contend with right now, but Mandy mentioned the shoes felt nice and grippy despite having to run on some remnants of snow.",

Soon enough, a 'Green Gradient' finish will join the Air Max Plus' catalog. Official color names haven't surfaced yet, but the mesh base opts for varying shades of green, while profile swooshes and Tuned Air units at the heel indulge in what seems like 'Barely Volt' flair. Whale tail-shaped shanks at the mid-foot also favor a gradient update, while accompanying components anchor the look in a classic 'Black'.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Air-branded top of the tongue seemingly features a felt material, which adds another lifestyle touch to the silhouette originally designed for performance-running.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the Air Max Plus below. No firm Nike.com release date has been disclosed by the brand as of yet, but that's likely to change by April. Expect the pair to arrive with a price tag of $180.\n\nFor more from the Tuned Air family, a 'Black' Air Max Plus VII is rumored to release during the Holiday 2025 season.",

Today, the Swoosh has revealed the kicks in question to be the latest iteration of the athletic giant\u2019s iconic Air Max line: the Nike Air Max Dn8.\n\nCourtesy of Nike\n\nA direct sequel to last year\u2019s Air Max Dn, the Dn8 builds upon its predecessor\u2019s foundational \u201cDynamic Air\u201d technology, which employed a new four-tubed Nike Air unit in the heel to provide the wearer with an effortlessly smooth ride. The Dn8 expands that design outward, stretching the Dynamic Air along the full length of the foot through eight air chambers that make direct contact with the ground, delivering even more responsiveness and bounce.\n\nCourtesy of Nike\n\nThe idea, Nike lead designer Jonathan Kosenick explained in a statement, was to offer up \u201ca Nike performance footwear approach into a shoe you want to wear everyday,\u201d one with serious \u201c\u2018go anywhere, do anything\u2019 character.\u201d Part of nailing that brief, of course, meant making the shoe look cool enough to match up to all that powerful tech beneath the hood.

            "content": "Nearly a year after debuting a new type of cushioning in the Air Max Dn, Nike is now doubling its use of Dynamic Air technology for its successor.\n\nThe Nike Air Max Dn8 extends its use of Dynamic Air from just the heel to the entirety of the underfoot. Both the forefoot and heel Air unit consist of two pressurized chambers with two tubes each, making for a total of eight tubes to give the shoe its name. In the heel, the back two tubes are tuned to 15 psi (pounds per square inch) while the front two are at a lower pressure of 5 psi. The forefoot Air unit is then a mirror image of the heel, with the two 15 psi chambers closer your toes and the 5 psi chambers nearer to your midfoot.\n\n\u201cFor the Dn8, we wanted to be lower to the ground. We wanted to feel more Air. We wanted to improve transition,\u201d Jonathan Kosenick, Nike lead designer of Men\u2019s Sportswear, said in a press release. \u201cAll of those goals led us to design the shoe with eight Air chambers directly in contact with the ground, which allows the chambers to more effectively compress and be way more flexible, delivering a much bouncier, springier sensation that channels a Nike performance footwear approach into a shoe you want to wear every day.\u201d\n\nWatch on FN\n\nAlthough Nike is approaching innovation in the same way it does for performance footwear, the Air Max Dn8 is intended for everyday, or lifestyle, wear like its predecessor. Its upper also forms a more cohesive look with its sole unit, as the cavernous lines of the former carry over to the ridges of the latter.\n\n\u201cWhen designing the Dn8, we kept thinking about what makes some of our favorite classic Air Max models so great: that you can put them on and go, and no matter what happens over the course of the day, that shoe is not only going to succeed, it\u2019s going to exceed expectations,\u201d Kosenick said. \u201cWe wanted to build a shoe that had the same sort of, \u2018go anywhere, do anything\u2019 character \u2014 an impulsivity, a versatility that will perform under any circumstance by harnessing the capabilities of Dynamic Air.\u201d\n\nThe Nike Air Max Dn8 will make its debut in a \u201cHyper Pink\u201d colorway releasing February 6 through the Snkrs app and select third-party retailers. A red colorway will then follow March 6 with more to come in the immediate weeks after.

            "content": "Nike Running's Pegasus Premium has hit 2025 in stride.\n\nUnveiled to a select group early last year, the silhouette has finally arrived to the market, promising one of the most dynamic underfoot-feelings from the Swoosh in ages. The sneaker's gradually building out its roster of styles, and will add a 'Black/Bright Crimson/Metallic Silver' colorway for Men and Women come March.\n\nAs the brand's marquee daily running shoe, the modern runner builds upon legacy, elevating the 'baseline' Nike Pegasus 41's experience through a future-forward lens. Zoom Air appears on the Pegasus Premium, but in a full-length package much more reminiscent of the Air Max series. The model's forefoot rocker promotes forward propulsion while the layers of foam that round out the cushioning system ensure runners have ample impact absorption.\n\nPreviously seen in 'White' and 'Persian Violet', the modern Pegasus has recently taken on a one-two punch of 'Black/Bright Crimson'. The bulk of the mixed-materials upper opts for a stealthy finish, while the dynamic Air unit underfoot indulges in a bold red that's sure to turn heads on the track. Profile swooshes complete the package with glossy 'Metallic Silver' attitude.\n\nThe pair is scheduled to hit Nike.com on Friday, March 6, for $210. While you wait, enjoy official photos of the shoes ahead.\n\nAway from running, the Swoosh has just prepared a number of Nike Dunks for spring.",

            "content": "Nike has returned to professional surfing. The American athletic footwear and apparel company signed Italo Ferreira.\n\nThe story of Nike in competitive pro surfing is turbulent.\n\nIt all started in 1990 with Nike Aqua Gear, a segment that targeted surfers and volleyball players, with the support of Laird Hamilton.\n\nThe project lasted only two years.\n\nIn 2002, the large conglomerate multinational bought Hurley International, a surf brand founded by Bob Hurley, which at the time had sales of $70 million.\n\nThe decision surprised some people in the industry, but for Bob, it was part of the natural process.\n\n\"It was easy. It felt like destiny. I don't mean to sound glib, but it just seemed like it was meant to happen. We just always loved Nike,\" Hurley told the OC Register in 2013.\n\n\"We grew really fast within three years. Then, we started needing capital. Should we take the company public, or should we get a partner?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to take the company public because I would have been fired within about six months, guaranteed.\"\n\nIn 2015, Bob Hurley stepped down as CEO of Hurley, and soon, Nike was planning an exit strategy from surfing.\n\nThe surf industry had struggled to emerge from the aftermath of the global financial recession of 2007/2008, and consumers were resetting their preferences.\n\nSurfwear was no longer a priority, even for hardcore surfers; Quiksilver and Billabong, two Big Four iconic brands, were in troubled financial waters.\n\nIn 2019, Nike abandoned the surfing segment by selling Hurley to the Bluestar Alliance, a brand management firm with over $3 billion in combined retail sales.\n\nNike 6.0\n\nMeanwhile, in 2005, Nike introduced a sub-brand or segment named 6.0.\n\nIt was targeted at extreme action sports, including BMX, snowboarding, wakeboarding, skateboarding, surfing, and other radical outdoor pastimes.\n\n6.0 had footwear, apparel, and accessories. It presented itself as \"a mash-up of dirt, waves, street, water, and snow.\"\n\nThe low-cost insignia released products inspired by classic hits - the Nike Dunk 6.0 and the Nike Mavrk 6.0 shoes were some of them.\n\nCarissa Moore, Lakey Peterson, Julian Wilson, and Kolohe Andino were surfers on the team.\n\nNike 6.0 also sponsored French bodyboarder Pierre-Louis Costes. But just for a year, leaving the bodyboarding community angry and frustrated by the short-term support of their sport.\n\nHowever, in 2013, Nike discontinued the division, perhaps with the vision to create specific independent divisions for each sport, similar to what Nike SB stands for.\n\nSo, for eight years (2005-2013), Nike 6.0 and Hurley co-existed in the Nike world.\n\nSwoosh: Just Surf It\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus - the time between the sale of Hurley and 2025 - Nike's relationship with surfing and surfers has resumed, even though it has not been announced formally.\n\nThe company's famous \"Swoosh\" logo was introduced in professional surfing via the 2019 World Surf League (WSL) champion, Italo Ferreira.\n\nThe Nike sticker is featured on his boards for the 2025 Championship Tour season.\n\n\"Fulfilling another dream: having one of the most coveted brands in the world on my board,\" wrote Ferreira.\n\n\"This is more than a personal achievement; it is about connecting with the history of great sports heroes and a truly powerful family. This is a very special moment in my professional career!\"\n\n\"Joining this team gives me strength and courage to continue facing obstacles and paving the way to the top.\"\n\nItalo Ferreira, 30, showcases the Swoosh logo alongside many other sponsors.\n\nActually, the 2020 Olympic surfing gold medallist is one of the most sponsored athletes on tour.\n\nHis surfboards feature brands like Red Bull, Ford, Oakley, Vivo, ADCOS, Banco do Brasil, M\u00e3e Terra, Integralmedica, Aquacoco, Silver Surf Boards, Creatures, T. Patterson, JHSF, and now, Nike.\n\nWhy a Comeback?\n\nNike has not officially commented on the return to surfing.\n\nHowever, despite this relatively quiet soft relaunch, the company's Brazilian distributor unveiled one of the reasons why the time is now.\n\n\"The arrival of Italo Ferreira to our portfolio of partner athletes represents our commitment to supporting talents that share the brand's values \u200b\u200band inspire new generations,\" explained Gustavo Viana, marketing director at Fisia, Nike's official distributor in Brazil.\n\nItalo's manager sees the move as a win-win strategy.\n\n\"Having Italo wearing the brand's clothing in and out of the water will bring even greater notoriety to surfing, especially among young people who do not yet consume surfing products or who are not familiar with the sport,\" added Marcos Castelouber, marketing manager at IF15, the company responsible for Italo Ferreira's image usage rights and career management.\n\n\"This partnership is incredible not only for Italo but for the entire surfing community, which is only growing in Brazil.\"\n\nNike is expected to sign additional sponsorship deals with male and female surfers.\n\n\n\nWords by Lu\u00eds MP | Founder of SurferToday.com",

            "content": "The Nike Motiva is designed with a lot of cushion and a snug fitting upper. The steep rocker profile helps to maintain forward momentum, while the tread patterns keep your feet securely planted.\n\nPerformance Comparison\n\nThe Nike Motiva takes an interesting approach to walking shoes, with a large rocker and thick, cushioned sole. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nComfort\n\nOut of the box, I quickly noticed a very different rocker profile on the Nike Motiva. The rocker starts about halfway down the shoe, appearing almost like a half circle instead of the mostly flat shoes I am used to. The shoe is designed to strike the heel first and then roll forward to the toe for push-off, but the impact was felt closer to the midfoot region. The cushion is thicker in the midfoot in front of the heel, which is likely the reason for that feeling. The shoe definitely took some adaptation during my 10,000-step testing period, and it felt like I had a gait adjustment every time I laced them up. The Comfortgroove cushion is an uneven pattern designed to absorb impact on uneven surfaces and has a wavy uneven appearance. Once we adjusted to the shoe it felt quite comfortable and offered a lot of cushion, there were no hot spots or pressure areas from the knit mesh upper which fit snug.\n\nThe Nike Motiva has a very aggressive rocker, designed to keep you moving forward. Credit: Natalie Kafader\n\nLacing up the Nike Motiva, they fit true to size with appropriate width and length. The shoe easily slides over the foot, and the lightly padded tongue is attached to an inner bootie, which keeps it nice and snug. A soft foam collar encircles the ankle and prevents movement and blisters, and the heel cup feels secure. The toe box feels snug with the inner bootie and knit upper. The toes can move up and down freely, but toe splay is quite limited. It is worth mentioning the shoe only comes in regular width, so if you require a wide shoe, you will have to look elsewhere. It is possible to slide the shoes on without using your hands, but you still have to lace them for a snug feel.\n\nThe rocker is very pronounced in the heel. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nSupport\n\nThis moderately stabile and moderately flexible shoe has good support when walking on various surfaces. The dense foam resists pressure well and is more noticeable in the heel than the forefoot. In the flexibility test the shoe flexed at the toe box which is indicative a supportive shoe. However, I found lateral movements to be lacking stability. The thick, soft sole, paired with the drastic rocker, made these less ideal for side steps. The rocker profile of the sole allows more side-to-side motion than we would like, so these are better suited for forward motion.\n\nShoe Exterior Shoe Interior The Nike Motiva has a thick sole, measured at 35 millimeters at the heel. Enlarge Comparison\n\nThe shoe has five eyelets for standard lacing with an optional sixth for additional heel lock. The eyelets are reinforced, and the bottom three rows have containment loops in the middle of the tongue. Lacing the Motiva is fast and simple as the laces easily glide through the eyelets and hold a knot securely. When securely tied, the upper comfortably hugs the midfoot, and there are no gaps around the padded ankle. No adjustment was needed during use and the laces remained as tight as when they were tied.\n\nLacing up the Nike Motiva is fairly standard. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nThe twist test examines how well the sole resists torsion and provides support for the user. The easier to twist, the less support the shoe provides. The Motiva did very well resisting torsion during the twist test, which is a characteristic of a good walking shoe. However, during my walk tests, this shoe wanted to roll towards the inside, especially at the end of my stride. Those with a neutral gait will likely be okay, but those who pronate may want to avoid this model.\n\nThe Nike Motiva offers good support in the twist test. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nTraction\n\nThe Nike Motiva has adequate traction for most indoor and urban uses. The heel and toe have a waffle pattern, while the mid-outsole has a wavy tread pattern. The shoe offered impressive traction on most surfaces like tile, carpet, or concrete but had less grip on gravel and dirt but was still adequate. Wet conditions did not seem to hamper the ability to maintain traction, and no slipping was noted.\n\nThe outsole has a combination of a checkered and wavy pattern. Credit: Natalie Kafader\n\nWeight\n\nEven with a thick cushioned sole the Motiva weighed in at 12.16 ounces per shoe for men's size 10.5. This was about average for the testing group. The weight of the shoes is not noticeable during use and has no impact when going up and down stairs. On longer walks, the shoes did not cause any tiredness or fatigue and were still light and mobile at the end of the day. That said, we still needed an adjustment period to get used to the rocker.\n\nThe Nike Motiva weighs 12.16 ounces per US men's 10.5. Credit: Natalie Kafader\n\nDurability\n\nThe Nike Motiva has some nice features that add to the durability and life of the shoe. The eyelets are reinforced inside and out and loops on the tongue help to prevent premature wear from the laces. The knit mesh upper may not be the most snag or rip-resistant, but the inner bootie prevents underside wear on the mesh upper. The only toe protection is the very front, where the sole terminates, and the remainder of the toe area is exposed. The unprotected toe raises concerns about wear, but we did not notice any issues during testing. The rubber outsole held up to repeated use but did shoe some wrinkles in the foam. To prolong the life of walking shoes, most manufacturers recommend cleaning them intermittently or when they are visibly soiled. Nike recommends hand washing the shoes and allowing to air dry.\n\nA bit odd shaped this shoe produces good results. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nShould You Buy the Nike Motiva?\n\nThe Nike Motiva is an ideal choice for those looking for a well-cushioned walking shoe who are willing to experiment with a new design. The comfort and stability of the shoe, combined with a durable sole, make this a good option for those wanting a rocker sole. The shoe may not be suitable for those who tend to pronate or struggle with ankle or gait stability, as it can take some time to accommodate this design.\n\nYour feet will appreciate the thick cushion during long shifts. Credit: Travis Reddinger\n\nWhat Other Walking Shoes Should You Consider?\n\nIf you are looking for a shoe with plenty of cushion, the Brooks Ghost Max 2 will offer all the comfort you can ask for. The Hoka Transport is a good choice for durability and stability, while the On Cloud 5 is a lightweight and comfortable alternative.",

Most prominent in that category is the special retooling of the Air Jordan 6 and Air Trainer III for Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman Returns. The Nike Air Max 90 slips into its Batman costume, appearing in the classic black and yellow (or \u201cBuffed Gold,\u201d as Nike calls it) colors most commonly associated with DC Comics\u2019 Caped Crusader.\n\nCertainly additional gold-on-black monikers would\u2019ve applied here, but the addition of ripstop panelling as a foundation makes the grungy, crime-fighting lean all the more fitting. Flashes of \u201cBuff Gold\u201d on branding hits throughout the shoe, including a forefoot mini-Swoosh and the \u201cNike Air\u201d tag on the heel, further reinforcing the comic book ties and brightening up the profile a bit in the process.\n\nMoreover, this mainline look lands among a crowded group of colorways coming to light, a major push no doubt aligning with the silo\u2019s 35th anniversary. Taken alongside the Air Max 90 \u201cCamo Pack\u201d and Air Max 90 \u201cRacing,\u201d this \u201cBatman\u201d do-up ensures that there\u2019ll be plenty of options for Air Max 90 purists throughout 2025.

Nike's official policy on animal-derived materials explicitly states that it does not use skins from any domesticated or feral dogs or cats.\n\nThe rumor spread on numerous social media platforms, including Reddit, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. It likely originated from videos that appear to have been AI-generated. Below is a full transcription of one such video:\n\nNever buy Nike shoes again and here's why. They are not just shoes, they are dog skin. Yes, you heard right. Dogs brutally sacrificed in illegal breeding farms. A recent investigation has uncovered that Nike uses dog skin in its products. Especially in the models distributed in New York. And they don't do it by accident. Behind words like \"eco leather\" and \"synthetic material\" lies a cruel and repulsive system. Did you know that thousands of dogs are raised in unsanitary conditions, fed with scraps, and then sacrifice just to make your shoes? That strange texture and odd smell are not coincidences. You are walking with the suffering of an animal that should never have ended up this way. And Nike is not the only one, but it is at the epicenter of this practice across the United States, especially in New York. How much longer will you continue supporting this cruelty? If you're as outraged as I am, comment \"Nike\" and follow me right now. It's time to expose this truth and stop letting big brands deceive us.\n\nThe English-language version of the video transcribed above seemingly originated from @mysterycarson TikTok account, which posted the video in December 2024. In the past, the user has shared numerous other videos with a similar style, often displaying telltale signs of being AI-generated, such as out-of-sync lip movements and exaggerated imagery. The video also appeared to be linked to Billy Carson, the founder and CEO of media company 4BiddenKnowledge Inc. However, a search of Carson's official social media accounts and website for entries about Nike did not yield relevant results.\n\nThe rumor has also spread via Spanish-language videos with identical text and seemingly AI-generated imagery. The earliest instance of the video being shared we found appeared on TikTok and was posted by user @ocultotartaria in late December 2024.\n\nThe profile's description read: \"The secrets that the elite wants to hide from you.\" The account featured numerous similar videos that appear to be AI-generated.\n\nWe have reached out to both users mentioned above to determine whether they were the original creators of the Nike videos and will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nNike's Written Policy on Animal Skins\n\nNike has a publicly available Animal Skins Policy, part of its broader \"Sustainability Policies,\" which applies to all Nike brand and affiliate brand products containing \"animal skin materials.\" The policy, dated 2024, explicitly prohibits the use of dog skin. It states (emphasis ours):\n\nRESTRICTIONS Animal Skins Animal Skins (specifically cow) must not be sourced in the Amazon biome.\n\nAnimal Skins must not be considered exotic or protected. Examples include, but are not limited to, alligator, cheetah, crocodile, elephant, fish, horse, kangaroo, leopard, lion, lizard, marine mammals, ostrich, shark, snake, tiger, rays, rhinoceros, etc.\n\nAnimal Skins must not be derived from any species of domesticated or feral dog or cat.\n\nAnimal Skins must not be \"fur,\" except that cow \"hair-on\" hides or sheep shearling are permitted as provided above.\n\nYou can access Nike's full Animal Skins Policy document here.\n\nDog Skin Use in China Not Tied to Nike\n\nUnder one TikTok post featuring the claim, users referenced a Guardian article titled \"Is your leather from China? It might be made of dog or cat skin,\" which discussed the possibility of dog or cat skin being used in leather products. However, the article did not mention Nike or any other specific brands.\n\nAccording to the article, despite the U.S. Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000, which prohibits such imports with penalties up to $10,000, the difficulty in distinguishing these leathers from those of cows or pigs poses enforcement challenges. A 2014 Congressional Research Service report indicated that the U.S. imported $8.5 billion in leather goods from China, with an unknown portion potentially derived from dogs or cats. Moreover, it reported that an undercover investigation by PETA Asia in 2014 revealed that facilities in China were killing 100 to 200 dogs daily for leather production.\n\nNike Once Used Kangaroo Skin\n\nFinally, while there is no evidence Nike has ever used dog skin in its products, the company has used kangaroo leather in the past. In March 2023, Nike announced it would stop using kangaroo leather, replacing it with a proprietary synthetic material. \"Nike is the latest global brand to stop using kangaroo leather in shoe production,\" The Guardian reported.\n\nOther claims regarding Nike we have investigated include a rumor that the company ended a $20 million partnership with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for being \"a tad too woke.\" We have also looked at claims that the Union County Sheriff's Department in Arkansas dressed arrestees in Nike shirts for their mug shots as a jab at the company.",

The first retro to hit shelves features a Y2K-friendly 'Metallic Silver/Anthracite/Volt/Black' color scheme. Much of the perforated upper is covered in the shimmering hue of the bunch, which offers a futuristic aesthetic despite having launched 20 years ago. Other components across the upper and Cushlon sole unit keep things mostly understated, but the traction pods under the forefoot introduce bold 'Volt' flair that's emerged on modern running products like the Alphafly 3 marathon shoe.\n\nThe retro performance silhouette will return in other original colorways throughout 2025. Nike athlete Sha\u2019Carri Richardson could potentially receive her own special pair of the Air Superfly given that she helped the Swoosh reintroduce the design.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the women's Air Superfly ahead. The retro sneaker arrives to select Nike retail partners across the globe on Jan. 28 for a price of $100.

Although this is a rarity for sportswear giants like Nike, the brand has visited the country for multiple collections and special releases. 2025 will mark yet another Made in Italy Nike product, as the Tiempo Legend 10 Elite Luxe soccer cleat gets constructed in Montebelluna, Italy.\n\nMontebelluna is well-known for its footwear manufacturing industry, with many elite and specialized outdoor and athletic sneakers produced in the city. Nike even has a team of craftsmen in the city who produce custom soccer cleats for the sports\u2019 top athletes, going as far as producing pairs down to 1/4 and 3/4 sizes for precise fits. In 2022, the team created pairs of the Nike Tiempo Legend 9 Elite Luxe, with this Tiempo Legend 10 following up on this release.\n\nUnlike the Legend 9, this pair opts for a rich burgundy red hue dubbed port wine for its primary shade, covering the premium leather paneling. Embroidered details along the toe harken back to classic Nike soccer boots, taking on a tonal finish that matches the leather and mesh portions of the upper. Metallic crimson red lands along the midfoot Swoosh and the Legend Tiempo logo on the heel, contrasting the port wine shades surrounding it.\n\nNike Tiempo Legend 10 Elite Luxe FG Montebelluna Leather Port Wine\n\nNods to Italy and Montebelluna are on the collar and insole, the former hosting an Italian flag tag and the latter coming with a custom Nike-branded crest for the city. Down below, the cleated outsole comes in a striking iridescent finish. This comes in a special box containing a custom leather pouch to carry the cleats.\n\nThe Nike Tiempo Legend 10 Elite Luxe FG Montebelluna Leather Port Wine is limited to 5,000 pairs and will release on January 30, 2025, through Nike. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $265. Download the Sole Retriever mobile app to stay updated on the latest releases, raffles, news, and more in the sneaker and streetwear world.",

            "content": "Episode Highlights:\n\nThe following excerpt has been edited lightly for clarity. You can listen to the full episode with Emily Infeld on the CITIUS MAG Podcast.\n\nRecently signing with Brooks and meeting other Brooks sponsored athletes in San Diego:\n\n\u201cI'm really excited to share the announcement! It's so funny \u2013 Aliphine [Tuliamuk] and I were messaging on Instagram and texting a little bit about it like, \u2018We can't wait to share our news!\u2019 We missed her since she unfortunately couldn't be [in San Diego] post-surgery. She's doing the best to get herself recovered and whatnot. But outside of that, it was a really fun trip. Everyone is so kind and it's a great group of people. I knew some of the athletes and got to meet a lot of the other [independent Brooks] athletes that aren\u2019t in the Hansons or Beasts [groups]...\n\nIt was just fun. We did a cooking class, we did some runs together, and I convinced CJ [Albertson] to do my morning workout on Friday with me\u2026 It felt nice to be kind of like a team even though we don't all live and train together.\u201d\n\nThoughts on turning to the marathon in the future:\n\n\u201cJess [McClain] and Erika [Kemp] especially were like, \u2018You should do a marathon soon. You'll be great.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Now I'm nervous!\u2019 Those women are so incredible. All those athletes \u2013 they're incredible. I just really respect the marathon. I don't want to act like it's easy, because it's not. It looks really hard! I've done some long runs in the past. Last year, I was doing some 16 and 17 mile runs, but I haven't done much more than that since 2016 or 2017.\n\nErika gave me a lot of confidence. She was like, \u2018You don't have to do that high of mileage.\u2019 I think Jess as well [agrees]. Hearing that makes me feel good because I don't think I'll ever do 130 [mile weeks]. I tried to run 100 to 110 and I just couldn't. I felt awful, I wasn't training well, and I just didn't feel good. I'm like, \u2018Maybe that's just my body. I just can't do the high stuff.\u2019 So I'm like, \u2018If you guys think in the 80s would work, then maybe I can make this work!\u2019\u201d\n\nHow her training has shifted over the past few years:\n\n\u201cIt just gives me confidence that I've been in so many different programs, have done lots of different training styles, and just seeing the results that have come from that. For me, it's looking at the long stuff and threshold stuff \u2013 doing short rest seems to really benefit me. Some speedwork too, but with lots of speed and long rest I just feel flat. Doing three miles of work, I just feel like I need more than that\u2026\n\nI'm an older athlete now. When I was young in 2015, I could rip 300s with Jerry [Schumacher]. I would do like six 300s and some 150s. I'd be running all the 300s under 45. I'm like, \u2018I can't do that anymore\u2026\u2019 But it gives me confidence to look back on last year. I did some fast 600s and [Chris Miltenberg] saw that and was like, \u2018All you did going into Millrose was two fast 600s that weren't even that fast. Outside of that, everything you were running was like 78 to 85 pace.\u2019 He was like, \u2018How did you run that millrose time? It's because you're good!...\u2019\n\nAll that is to say that I think we do evolve as athletes, but I think for me it sometimes helps to see what I've done in the past to remind myself that I'm more than just this last six month block and to be like, \u2018That stuff wasn't as far off as I thought it was.\u201d\n\nHer race plans for 2025:\n\n\u201cI'm planning to run a 5K indoors\u2026 Then I\u2019m doing The Ten at the end of March. Then I think I'll take a little reset. I want to mix it up on the track and roads. It's nice because USAs is later, so in an ideal world, I would be qualified for USAs and feeling confident after the 5K and 10K to mix up my races and do some shorter road stuff \u2013 like 5Ks and 10Ks on the road. Maybe the 5K qualifier for the World [Championships] on the road. If that seems like it fits, I would like to do that. Depending on how USAs goes, I would maybe be geared towards more track stuff or maybe even try to do a half [marathon].\n\nIn my head, I'd like to do the Valencia Half or something like that next fall and then maybe do another half or [full] marathon. I want to do the marathon, I want to be running the road stuff, but I have this bad taste in my mouth from the track that I want to get out. I don't want to end on a note of having dropped out of more races than I finished last year\u2026 I want to feel like I\u2019m putting together solid performances, feeling healthy, and feeling like myself, whatever that looks like this year on the track.\u201d\n\nWhat she learned from last year\u2019s season:\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I think it's way better to be 100% healthy and 70% fit than being 100% or 95% fit but only 50% or 70% healthy. [Last year] felt frantic. I\u2019m just kicking myself because I really should\u2019ve taken time. But instead, I was trying to make sure I got a qualifier because the last year hadn't gone well. We moved to L.A. and I ended up not really racing in the summer. I felt like I was running out of time and it felt like chaotic, stressful energy. I think that clouded my judgment and made me not make the best decisions. I wish I would have let myself get healthy. I might not be that fit, but at least I would have been able to race beyond the Trials\u2026\n\nA lot of it was the pressure we put on the Trials and just being like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get there.\u2019 I'm a veteran, I'm an old enough athlete that I shouldn't have let that happen, but I'm also not perfect. I think a lot of people do that, so it's unfortunate \u2013 but for anyone younger listening, don't do that. You'll be fine. If you focus on getting healthy, you're going to have a better season than trying to force something.\u201d",

            "content": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York is the stage for a $60 million fight between Nike and a cult customizer in a headline-making lawsuit that pits trademark rights against alleged artistic expression in the sneaker market. Nike\u2019s legal battle against the Shoe Surgeon centers on allegations of counterfeiting, trademark infringement, and unfair competition, according to Nike, whereas the custom footwear company argues that the lawsuit is an effort by the sportswear titan to monopolize the customization market and stifle independent creativity under the guise of trademark enforcement.\n\nA Bit of Background: In the complaint that it filed with a New York federal court in July, Nike alleges that the Shoe Surgeon and its founder Dominic Chambrone (collectively, the \u201cShoe Surgeon\u201d or \u201cdefendants\u201d) have engaged in the unauthorized use of Nike\u2019s trademarks to produce and sell counterfeit sneakers. Nike claims that the defendants are in the business of manufacturing and selling goods \u2013 including sneakers created \u201centirely from scratch\u201d \u2013 that bear counterfeit trademarks. It also maintains that the defendants are offering up \u201cinfringing customization workshops,\u201d where they teach others to create counterfeit Nike sneakers.\n\nIn a public statement that was picked up by an array of media outlets, Nike framed its lawsuit against the Shoe Surgeon as a necessary step to protect its brand integrity and consumers. The company highlighted its respect for artistic creativity, drawing a distinction between lawful customization and the mass production of counterfeits.\n\nThe Shoe Surgeon has responded with a defamation and/or trade libel counterclaim, arguing that Nike\u2019s statements, both in its legal filings and public communications, mischaracterize their actions. They contest Nike\u2019s use of terms like \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and \u201cfrom scratch,\u201d maintaining that their work involves customization of existing Nike sneakers. They also claim that Nike\u2019s public statements, amplified through media coverage, were designed to harm their reputation and business. They further contend that these statements were presented as fact rather than as allegations, a key point in their defamation claim.\n\nNike\u2019s Motion to Dismiss\n\nWith the ball back in its court, Nike is looking to shake the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s counterclaim. Counsel for the Swoosh argues in a filing on January 21 that it should be shielded from the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s defamation and/or trade libel counterclaim on the basis that its allegedly improper statements are privileged, as they are statements pertinent to the overarching litigation. In accordance with Second Circuit precedent, Nike states that \u201cstatements by parties and their attorneys are absolutely privileged if, by any view or under any circumstances, they are pertinent to the litigation.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Nike maintains that \u201cout-of-court statements, such as demand letters or statements to the public or media, are also subject to privilege under Section 74 of the New York Civil Rights Law \u2018to the extent that they represent fair and true reports of what occurred in the proceeding.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, Nike argues that the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s claim should be dismissed with prejudice \u2026 [because] the statements in Nike\u2019s complaint are absolutely privileged as a matter of New York common law, [and] Nike\u2019s press statement, which is no more than a fair and true report of allegations in its complaint, is likewise absolutely privileged under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 74.\u201d\n\nCounsel for Nike also addresses \u201cthe narrowly construed and rarely successful \u2018Williams\u2019 exception,\u201d that the Shoe Surgeon raised in a filing of its own. The exception is applicable in the event that a party \u201cmaliciously institute[s] a judicial proceeding alleging false and defamatory charges\u201d and \u201cthen circulate[s] a press release or other communication based thereon and escape liability by invoking the statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cCritically, this exception requires that the legal action was brought \u2018solely\u2019 for the purpose of defaming the opposing party,\u201d Nike asserts, stating that the Shoe Surgeon has failed \u201cto allege anywhere in their 141-paragraph Counterclaim that Nike\u2019s lawsuit was filed solely for the purpose of defaming them.\u201d In addition to the allegations in the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s Counterclaim, Nike claims that its \u201ccomplaint also amply demonstrates that [it] filed this litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, not to defame.\u201d\n\nThe case is Nike, Inc. v. S2, Inc. d/b/a The Shoe Surgeon, et al., 1:24-cv-05307 (SDNY).",

Whether you intend to wear the AF1 for nefarious or innocuous activities, a material change for the infamous shoe will make it a whole lot tougher.\n\nThe Nike Air Force 1 Low \u201cCarbon Fiber\u201d sees its namesake material take over the upper while maintaining the all-black look. This makeover is straightforward, as the woven fabric forms the entirety of the upper except for the tongue, which now appears in nylon rather than leather. The sole unit then remains unchanged, while the usual silver-tone lace dubrae also returns.\n\nAlthough it came much later than the Air Force 1s reign on the hardwood, carbon fiber has now been a feature of many Nike basketball sneakers for some time. The Air Jordan 11 made history as the first basketball sneaker to use carbon fiber in 1995, and that same year also saw it included on the Zoom Flight 95, a shoe you may know best for its midsole\u2019s \u201cbug eyes\u201d and which has also influenced Drake\u2019s Nike Nocta line.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nOn the Air Force 1 Low today, carbon fiber may not offer much more in the way of performance \u2014 but it could very well end up being more durable than the usual leather.\n\nThe Nike Air Force 1 Low \u201cCarbon Fiber\u201d will release February 5 through Nike\u2019s website and select third-party retailers.

Even the front signage was removed.\n\nOn the official Nike website, the store is still listed, along with its hours.

Those \u201cSpecial Hours\u201d are listed as \u201cClosed.\u201d The website claims the store will be open this Saturday at 10 a.m.\n\nWhile on-site security and Nike store staff declined to comment, and Nike representatives could be not reached, the store does have a history of shoplifting. The New York Post reported in 2023 that shoplifting incidents happened \u201cat least four days a week,\u201d with regular thefts of items worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nOne user on Instagram claims the store was robbed multiple times a day and that shoplifters could be seen carrying out handfuls of stolen clothes. Some users are sad to see the store go; others point out how close the 19th Police Precinct House is to the site of the shopliftings.\n\nThe property manager, Vornado Realty Trust, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe closing of a Nike store in New York City is not a first for the company. In 2022, it was announced by Complex that the famous SoHo sneaker hub, NikeLab, would close in 2023. Another store, Nike by Flatiron, also closed in 2023.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, Nike stores have been getting the ax in places like Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles, where losses from shoplifting were reported in excess of $1 million.\n\nIt is unknown whether the sports-apparel giant will open a new location in the neighborhood, but for now, the Upper East Side will be without a Nike store.",

            "content": "The Nike Air Max DN might not have taken off exactly how the brand would've liked, but it continues to enjoy a cult-like following.\n\nA special collaboration with Supreme shortly after its debut in 2024 gave the silhouette some cachet, as did co-signs from the likes of Corteiz's Clint419. The bulk of the sneaker's appeal, however, has come from its own merit, as a slew of colorways have allowed people of all style preferences to enjoy the futuristic design. A newly-surfaced 'Dark Smoke Grey/Red Orbit/Black/Sweet Beet' option will surely join rotations of some bold dressers.\n\nAkin to other Air Max DN releases (and the impending Air Max DN8 that'll 'replace' it as the line's marquee product), the unreleased style takes on an eye-catching makeover across its breathable upper. 'Red Orbit' and 'Sweet Beet' come together to form an abstract pattern partly-reminiscent of heat maps and other scientific presentations. The remainder of the shoe keeps things simple in 'Dark Smoke Grey', with Dynamic Air bubbles underfoot deviating in a bold yellow.\n\nEnjoy official photos of the pair ahead. Its inspiration has yet to be disclosed by the brand, but that and a firm Nike.com release date is likely to change by April.\n\nFor more from the Nike, Inc. family, check out the Air Jordan 1 '85 'Bred' set to return on Feb. 14 in limited quantities.",

Completing the look is the iconic pink detailing on the Swoosh, heel tab, and Nike tongue branding, delivering the unmistakable charm that has defined the \"Linen\" aesthetic.\n\nUnderfoot, the timeless Air Force 1 midsole appears in white, with the \"AIR\" text highlighted in pink to tie together the colorway.

It is additionally shielded by industry-leading Cerakote technology to guarantee that it withstands the most demanding gym conditions. Additionally, a 28-millimeter curved shaft lessens wrist strain while enabling alternative grips.\n\nPart of Nike\u2019s Larger Plan\n\nLast month, on his first quarterly analyst call, Nike\u2019s new CEO Elliott Hill committed to cease competing against wholesale partners while making sport \u201cour North Star\u201d again to boost product innovation and marketing reach.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longtime executive was recruited back in October after a digital-led direct-to-consumer (DTC) push and weak innovation led to market share losses to longstanding competitors (i.e., Adidas, New Balance, and Skechers) and upstarts (On and Hoka). The five near-term reset actions Hill proposed included:\n\n\u201cIgnite our culture through a focus on obsessing sport and getting back to winning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccelerate a complete product portfolio driven by athlete-insights through sport-led fields of play.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncrease investment in our brand to deliver big, bold marketing statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvest in and empower our teams in key countries and cities to win the ground game.\u201d\n\n\u201cElevate the marketplace, through a more premium Nike direct and an unwavering commitment to our wholesale partners.\u201d\n\nHill asserted that the biggest sportswear company in the world had shed its \u201cobsession with sport\u201d and declared that Nike will shift its product development to meet the gender-specific needs of sport-focused athletes better.

            "content": "Suns' Devin Booker channels Forrest Gump in Nike ad, has a shoe giveaway across Phoenix\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Nick Richards goes over what it has been like to adjust to the Suns New Phoenix Suns center Nick Richards explains his transition to the Suns. He is 2-1 to start his Suns career, averaging 11 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nRun, Book, run!\n\nPhoenix Suns star Devin Booker released his new Nike Book 1s \"Forrest Gump\" shoe edition on Friday. In the shoe's commercial released on his Instagram story Friday, Booker did an amusing voiceover emulating the 1994 Academy Award-winning film's lovable protagonist Gump and his memorable Southern drawl.\n\n\"It turned out good, huh?\" Booker said when he was asked about the voiceover during the Suns' shootaround Saturday.\n\nThis is the second official Nike ad for his shoe. The Book 1s' first TV ad was in April 2024.\n\nThe low-cut 'Forrest Gump' shoe colorway is inspired by the Nike Cortez model's white and red colorway originally released in 1972. Those are one of nearly 20 different Book 1 shoe colorways since the first pair came out in February last year.\n\nThe ad re-enacted multiple scenes with Booker's face seamlessly blended over the face of Tom Hanks, who played Gump in the original film. One of the scenes shows Booker being given a pair of his shoes by the film's fictitious wife \"Jenny,\" played by actor Robin Wright.\n\nThe ad closes with Booker dressed up in Gump's long beard and tattered Bubba Gump shirt -- with a mob of people following him on his cross-country run that ended on the landmark Highway 163 in Monument Valley, Arizona.\n\nHis teammate Royce O'Neale called the ad spot \"hilarious,\" and fans raved about it on social media. However, O'Neale made a flippant dig at Booker saying \"he got some work to do\" regarding his voice-acting skills.\n\n\"It was funny,\" Booker said. \"It was a great reaction, too. Everything turned out well.\"\n\nBooker also showed clips on his IG story of his \"Gump\" shoes with his autograph and inscription that read \"Finders Keepers\" across Phoenix. In the form of an Easter egg hunt, he placed a few pairs in random locations, including a bus stop along Camelback Road, downtown at McKinley Avenue and under a trailer in front of the Footprint Center.\n\nHe's done the same thing in early January upon the release of his pink \"Sedona\" shoe edition at Red Rock State Park at a McDonald's restaurant in Sedona. When his shoe's initial \"Mirage\" editions were released during the 2024 Indianapolis All-Star Weekend, some were placed on a pedestrian signal.\n\n\"I think that was actually the first one in the Phoenix area, and there's people running all over for them,\" Booker said. \"Something I plan to continue to do in the future.\"\n\nBooker said earlier this season that giving the shoes away hand-to-hand is \"the best way to do it\" for his grassroots marketing campaign. He repeated that message at the shootaround Saturday.\n\n\"Nothing's better than free shoes,\" Booker said. \"I know that as a kid growing up. And it just makes everybody feel involved. I've seen people reaching out to me that were late to the shoes that still had a family experience of trying to hunt them down and move throughout the city and get outside a little bit.\"",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nThe Nike LeBron business is at a unique juncture. The signature models, despite drawing attention from hoopers worldwide, may be priced too high relative to the market as full size runs for every LeBron 22 colorway are currently sitting, bound for markdowns. There isn\u2019t much promise around the Retro business either, because Nike already ran through the most popular models in recent years.\n\nOne strategy has been to combine those two streams into one. The LeBron NXXT Gen depicts that new-meets-old package, capturing the Air Zoom Generation essence with modern performance and design touches. Worn by Bron, his son, and several NBA players, the NXXT Gen series certainly has promise as long as the brand keeps the consumer in mind.\n\nSneaker News debuted a first look at the LeBron NXXT GENISUS last November revealing two upcoming colorways for Spring 2025. Keeping to the NXXT Gen AMPD style with the double-Swoosh uppers, the GENISUS features a simplified upper while staying reliant to a patterned upper across four colorways. Official images of four pairs reveal a color theme to each; the red pair features a thermometer in water, the black/grey boasting a crown and crossbones, the platinum violet alluding to science, and the teal featuring the crown floating in water.\n\nAs of the publishing of this article, the \u201cPlatinum Violet\u201d and \u201cTeal\u201d colorways are confirmed to release at Nike Basketball retailers on February 7th, 2025. The remaining two colorways are expected sometime this Spring 2025 season. All four versions carry an MSRP of $150, which is a $20 reduction from the LeBron NXXT Gen model.\n\n1 of 9\n\n1 of 9\n\n1 of 9",

            "content": "Fans have always sought out movie memorabilia for the satisfaction of owning a part of pop culture history. Be the prop insignificant or something as grandiose as the Batmobile, bids will accrue. One prop that's been elusive and a grand prize to comic book fans everywhere are the Air Jordan VI's worn by Michael Keaton in Batman Returns.\n\nIn 1989's Batman, Nike came in to design a pair of Air Jordans for the Caped Crusader. Warner Bros. grafted on accents to make the basketball-style shoes more akin to boots. They replicated the design for Batman Returns, except for that movie, the design team crafted boot collars and shin guards to go along with the base shoe.\n\nOn the set of Batman Returns | Sunset Boulevard/GettyImages\n\nWhat's interesting is where the shoes wound up after production wrapped. They were seemingly lost to dealers over the years and eventually came up on an eBay auction. And while that pair goes from owner to owner, at least one other pair is in a celebrity's collection.\n\nMichael Keaton appeared on a fan's podcast to talk all things Batman, going back to his beginnings. During the interview, the Beetlejuice actor spoke about the illustrious Air Jordan VI's from the movie, confirming that Nike came in and designed them just for the production. He concluded his statement by saying he has the boots \"stashed away.\" Such a disclosure would be a massive reveal since memorabilia seekers have focused entirely too much on the 1989 pair when Keaton had the more refined kicks from Batman Returns in his collection.\n\nSadly, the pricing doesn't sound like they're all that highly sought after. The 2017 auction only got up to $2500\u2014a small sum for a piece of cinematic memorabilia. Perhaps the price is due to only one shoe going up for sale.\n\nOn the set of Batman Returns | Sunset Boulevard/GettyImages\n\nAs for the pair in Keaton's collection\u2014they may be up for sale, too. He joked about selling them to his podcast host, all in jest, but who's to say Keaton wasn't semi-serious? He'll presumably request a much higher sum than a measly $2500. The fact that they've been in Keaton's possession this whole time would also increase their value. Props gain even more acclaim when a famous person/celebrity owns them.\n\nIf we were to estimate the shoe's potential market value, they'd probably be in the twenty-to-thirty-thousand-dollar range. A pair from the 1989 Batman movie went on sale in 2022 for around the same price. As long as they're still in fair condition, they would haul in a fair amount.\n\nBatman (1989) and Batman Returns are currently streaming on MAX.",

A pink and red colorway was unveiled during the most recent SNKRS preview, and black and white colorways have since surfaced in the lead-up to February 14th.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day is a time to celebrate love, but Nike\u2019s trio of Air Max 1s deliver a different message; one you might be familiar with if you\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a break-up convo. The laces feature text reading \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d as well as \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you,\u201d two phrases the accomplish the same mission, albeit the latter one is far colder.\n\nDiving into each of the three colorways, the headlining member features glossy pink leather panels over a red mesh base. The black and white colorways are far less eccentric by comparison, but there\u2019s still lots to love. Both looks feature alternating red and pink Swoosh logos on the lateral and medial sides, as well as pink Air units underfoot. All three colorways come with metallic \u201cNIKE\u201d lace dubraes, further tying in with commonly gifted mylar balloons.\n\nThe \u201cValentine\u2019s Day\u201d Air Max 1 pack doesn\u2019t have a release date yet, but all three colorways are expected to arrive in February.",

As of Friday afternoon, the sneakers were sold out on the Nike site and at several other shoe retailers including Finish Line and Sneaker Politics.\n\n\"The Air Diamond Turf takes the iconic cross trainer from 1994 and gives it a street-ready refresh,\" Nike's description for the sneaker says. \"This version features Air units in the heel and forefoot, plus durable leather and a midfoot strap for a secure fit. And that colorway? Same as the original.\"\n\nNike confirmed the reunion with Sanders, who is now the head football coach at the University of Colorado, in 2023 in an email to USA TODAY Sports. \u201cWe welcome Deion Sanders back to the Nike family,\u201d the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nDeion Sanders on his Nike Air Diamond Turf 'Sellout'\n\nIn an Instagram post on Friday, Sanders shared a picture of him wearing the sneakers with the caption, \"Nothing is new under the sun, I rocked these PRIMES\u2019 & #24 at the Pro Bowl waaay back when. I also heard from @nike that I sold out and I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t saying imma 'Sellout' they were talking about me 'Selling Out' ! Think about that baby! I\u2019m PRIME! REAL since u 1st heard of ya boy! #CoachPrime.\"\n\nWhy were Deion Sanders and Nike at odds?\n\nSanders and Nike were at odds for years with the former Atlanta Falcon and Dallas Cowboy telling Complex's Joe La Puma in 2017 that he was \"upset with them right now.\"\n\n\"We created these together, but they don\u2019t want to seed me. They don\u2019t want to direct deposit,\" Sanders told La Puma during the interview.\n\nSanders' issues with Nike continued into 2019 when he was a guest on a former Complex-owned sneaker talk show, Full Size Run. His gripe with Nike this time stemmed from them not helping fund youth sports leagues, which is something rival brand Under Armour was doing, Sanders said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to have a plan to sustain the shorties, with the youth leagues and all that, and they weren\u2019t with it,\u201d Sanders said on Full Size Run. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful how you treat people because you never know,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Sanders signed with Nike in 1992, he said he's never met Phil Knight, Nike's co-founder and former CEO.\n\nWhat are Deion Sanders Nike Air Diamond Turf sneakers reselling for?\n\nSince the Air Diamond Turf sneakers are sold out, those looking to grab a pair will have to pay resell prices for them.\n\nFlight Club, a consignment sneaker retailer, is selling the sneakers for more than $200, depending on the size.\n\nGoat and Stock X, both popular online sneaker resell marketplaces, have the Air Diamond Turf sneakers for prices ranging from about $200 to a little over $600, depending on the size.\n\nContributing: Brent Schrotenboer.",

            "content": "REI Co-op has tapped Mary Beth Laughton, a seasoned retail executive who has held roles at Nike, Athleta and Sephora, to serve as its next CEO.\n\nLaughton will assume the role of REI\u2019s president on Feb. 3, the retailer announced, before transitioning to full CEO responsibilities on March 31. She succeeds Eric Artz, who has served as REI\u2019s president and CEO since 2019. Artz plans to retire in March, the company said.\n\n\u201cEric has led and stabilized REI through some of the most challenging years the retail sector and our co-op ever faced,\u201d said Chris Carr, chair of the REI board of directors, in the announcement. Carr added that Laughton \u201chas the ideal experience to build on this foundation and to lead REI forward into our next chapter.\u201d\n\nThe leadership change comes as the 87-year-old outdoor retailer works to chart a fresh path following financial challenges after the pandemic.\n\nREI \u2014 with 18 million lifetime members \u2014 is the largest customer-owned retail co-op in the U.S., according to the National Retail Cooperative Association.\n\nThe company ranks No. 58 in the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s database of the largest North American e-retailers by web sales. In the Top 1000, Digital Commerce 360 classifies REI as a Sporting Goods retailer.\n\nREI web sales by year\n\nWho is REI\u2019s new CEO?\n\nLaughton brings with her more than two decades of retail leadership experience, having worked with some of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands.\n\nMost recently, Laughton led Nike\u2019s global direct-to-consumer business, overseeing stores, Nike.com, apps and loyalty programs, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nBefore joining Nike, Laughton was president and CEO of Athleta, Gap Inc.\u2019s activewear brand, from October 2019 to April 2023.\n\nLaughton also spent over seven years at Sephora, where she held several leadership roles, including executive vice president of omni retail, overseeing both U.S. stores and digital operations.\n\nHer connection to REI predates her new role. Laughton was a member of the co-op\u2019s board of directors from 2017 to 2019. She has also served on the boards of Instacart and Impossible Foods, per her LinkedIn profile.\n\nDuring the leadership transition at REI, Laughton will visit stores and distribution centers to connect with employees, partners, and community members, the company said.\n\n\u201cFrom my time on the REI Board, I know how incredibly talented and passionate REI employees are,\u201d Laughton wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to join them in the next phase of this journey and build on the positive momentum already underway.\u201d\n\nArtz\u2019s leadership and REI\u2019s uphill battle\n\nArtz departs REI after more than a decade. He joined the co-op in 2012 and was named CEO in 2019. Before joining REI, Artz served as chief financial officer at Urban Outfitters and held leadership roles at VF Corp., the parent company of The North Face.\n\nIn a letter to employees, Artz expressed gratitude for his time at REI.\n\n\u201cServing you and this enduring organization has been the honor of my professional life,\u201d Artz said. \u201cBeing outside means something different for everyone and our job is not to tell people what that looks like. It is to show one another and to welcome others, always making time outside more accessible to more people in more ways. That is worth fighting for.\u201d\n\nArtz\u2019s tenure included progress on sustainability goals. According to REI, the co-op\u2019s emissions in 2023 were 10% lower than in 2022 and 6% lower than in its 2019 baseline year.\n\nArtz\u2019s time at the company was also marked by financial challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The co-op reported $3.76 billion in revenue in 2023, a 2.4% decrease from 2022, and a $311 million net loss for the year. According to the company, the loss stemmed from ongoing investments in employee hourly pay, member rewards, and a $169 million non-cash valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\n\nRecent layoffs at REI\n\nREI has responded with various cost-cutting strategies, including layoffs. Earlier this month, the co-op announced it would discontinue its REI Experiences program, which offered outdoor classes, tours, and adventure travel. The decision resulted in the elimination of 428 jobs.\n\nDespite the setbacks, REI remains optimistic about its financial outlook. Earlier this week, the company said it is on track to achieve its 2024 goals of break-even operating profit and near-break-even free cash flow, describing them as \u201ca significant improvement\u201d over 2023.\n\nThe company added: \u201cAs REI moves through this transition, the board and executive leadership team remain focused on ensuring stability for its employees, members, and partners while building on the growth the co-op saw at the end of 2024.\u201d\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

Hachimura and Nike collaborated on the shoes\u2019 design.\n\nIn addition to sakura and cranes, the shoes are distinguished by black/metallic gold swoosh and insoles with the letter H, stylized in a manner evocative of Japanese brushstroke calligraphy.\n\nSeeing as how the Air Jordan 1 Low OG Rui Hachimura Cranes are low-tops, Hachimura is unlikely to suit up in them next month during the Lakers/One Piece game night collaboration. However, the stylish and unique design is sure to turn heads whenever and wherever you wear them.\n\nThe sakura Air Jordans go on sale January 25, priced at 23,650 yen (US$150), and will be available through the Nike online store here.\n\nSource: Nike via Japaaan\n\nImages: Nike\n\n\u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

Between its unique presentation and rich storytelling, the project clearly resonated with many. Now, after both colorways dropped to close out 2024, we have a look at a third \u201cConcrete Sky\u201d pair.\n\nWhile it has not been made clear as to whether this is merely a sample of a pair the duo opted not to put into production or if it\u2019s a teaser of what\u2019s to come later this year, it\u2019s an exciting reveal nonetheless. It notably sports a gradient not at the upper\u2019s base, but at the unique gridlines that the two applied to the sneaker, shifting from light to dark blue. An \u201cOlive Grey\u201d base is joined by yellow at the lateral heel\u2019s small Swoosh, violet appears at the heel tab and black covers the sole unit.\n\nAt the time of writing, neither Kids of Immigrants nor Nike have indicated whether or not the duo will return to the Air Max Sunder this year. Stay tuned for updates, including a better look at this \u201cConcrete Sky\u201d pair, as it may end up releasing via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at the same $190 USD price point of its predecessors.",

Breathable and durable Flyknit construction across the upper indulges in varying shades of the titular hue, coupling with leather panels along the tongue and profiles to bring heritage to the forefront.

In late 2013, it unveiled the Kobe 9 Elite, an unexpectedly super high-cut sneaker boasting Flyknit uppers for the first time in hoops performance. The debut colorway known as the \u201cMasterpiece\u201d hit retail that following season of Spring 2014, and now eleven years later, this iconic model is set to change the landscape of basketball footwear once again.\n\nDespite being over a decade old, the Kobe 9 Elite still looks ahead of its time. The multi-colored Flyknit created one of the most dazzling uppers in Nike Kobe history, while the signature Eric Avar design touches seem to look better than anything else that\u2019s out in the market today. This forward-thinking design is why the Kobe Retro movement continues to stay strong, and why the future is bright for the fallen hero\u2019s legacy in footwear.\n\nOfficially unveiled earlier in January as part of the Year Of The Mamba collection, the Kobe 9 Masterpiece surfaces once more via official brand images. Adult ($240) and GS ($140) sizes have been confirmed to release on February 8th, 2025 via SNKRS and select retailers.\n\n1 of 8",

Even with the absence of their longtime face, Tiger Woods, leaving in 2024 to start his brand, Sun Day Red, the resurgence in the sport has kept The Swoosh on top of its game. As we near the second month of 2025, one of the first PGA Tour events of the year, the Waste Management Phoenix Open (WMPO), is set to take place. With that, Nike and Waste Management have joined forces to follow up on their successful collaboration from the year prior.\n\nWaste Management has put its unique twist on the Nike Roshe Golf 2 for this year's collaboration. This release marks the debut of the Roshe Golf 2, which looks identical to previous Roshe Golf shoes but has some slight differences. Dubbed Prickly Pear, the Waste Management x Nike Roshe Golf 2 comes in a cactus-themed key lime, light green spark, barely volt, active fuchsia, and black colorway.\n\nInspired by the cacti found around the course located in the Sonoran Desert off the fairways and greens, the shoe plays fun on the fact that if you hit the ball out of bounds, you might encounter cacti or even scorpions as you enter the hazard and succumb to the penalty. An embroidered green cactus Swoosh adorns the sides to remind you of the elements that sound you, should you veer off course. Inside, the sockliner is lined in leather for plush comfort, while custom-printed insoles further the warning of what lurks out of bounds.\n\nA custom sticker accompanying the sneakers alerts golfers that \"venture into the prickly pears at your own peril and put your shot back where it belongs in this special Roshe Golf 2.\" The joke here is that only the best survive the Phoenix Open, and if you mess with the elements that lurk around the fairways, be careful. Also, get your golf game better so you don't have to worry about what might happen.\n\nThe Waste Management x Nike Roshe Golf 2 Prickly Pear is set to release on February 5, 2025, through Waste Management, Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, retail is $110.

Nike (NKE-1.67% ) had secured a crucial contract extension with the NFL for its uniforms, narrowly avoiding the loss of one of its most important partnerships, Fortune first reported.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRoger was my first phone call when I took over,\u201d Hill told the magazine, referring to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Nike had dodged a major blow, nearly losing the deal to a competitor helped Hill see the scale of the sportswear giant\u2019s crisis \u2014 and the bigger picture was grim. Nike faced its worst year in decades in 2024. Sales had dropped globally, and the stock had fallen nearly 60% from its 2021 highs. The sportswear giant\u2019s troubles weren\u2019t just financial; they were cultural and strategic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer CEO John Donahoe\u2019s aggressive push into e-commerce had backfired. In April 2024, he stated that he was fed up with remote work and that a \u201cboldly disruptive shoe\u201d couldn\u2019t be made on Zoom. In a push to boost online sales, Nike severed ties with major retailers, including Macy\u2019s, DSW (DBI+3.70% ), and Foot Locker (FL+0.45% ). Meanwhile, Nike laid off hundreds of employees, including senior executives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill, who has over 30 years of experience at Nike, seemed to waste no time confronting the issues. During a December earnings call, he laid out a plan on the company\u2019s core \u2013 sport and performance \u2013 and to repair damaged retailer relationships. The road to recovery won\u2019t be quick, but Hill has emphasized the importance of a long-term strategy over short-term pain.\n\nWall Street, though cautious, shared similar sentiments and remained optimistic about Hill\u2019s leadership, given his role in growing Nike to over $39 billion in annual revenue. When the company reported its second-quarter earnings, results came in better than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNike\u2019s current plan is to pivot. The company is cutting back on taste-making street teams across 12 cities globally, and leaning on Air Jordan and Dunk nostalgia. Sneaker innovation, once a key driver, has taken a backseat, according to Fortune.\n\nWhether AI will play a role, or how President Donald Trump\u2019s looming tariffs may impact this pivot, remains to be seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking ahead, Nike is also focusing on personalized gear and unearthing new ways to connect with consumers in the age of social media. Whether AI will play a role, or how President Donald Trump\u2019s looming tariffs may impact this pivot, remains to be seen.\n\n",

The shoe was widely praised at first for its simplicity, approachable price point and fluidity for different colorways. But once the word got out, the adoption by folks far removed from sneaker culture killed the appeal \u2014 and the Roshe has never really recovered, even after being brought back out of the archives in 2023.\n\nThe WMPO x Nike Roshe Golf 2 \u201cPrickly Pear\u201d could be the version of the sneaker that once again shifts the perspective on it. Made for the Waste Management Phoenix Open in February, this cactus-themed Roshe features a fuzzy green upper with wales that looks a lot like corduroy. Embroidered spikes appear throughout as part of a largely tonal green makeup, while the Swoosh gets its own texture to invoke cacti along with a black outline and spikes. A pink outsole features a tread tailored to the golf course, and on one of the insoles you\u2019ll find a scorpion graphic atop the Nike Golf logo.\n\nFor last year\u2019s Phoenix Open, Nike leaned into the sponsor rather than the location by making a Pegasus \u201989 Golf that looked like it was made out of trash. In 2019 and 2020, grass-like uppers also graced the Air Max 1 and Air Max 97, respectively, making the tournament a sleeper occasion for themed releases.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nThe WMPO x Nike Roshe Golf 2 \u201cPrickly Pear\u201d will release February 5, the day before the tournament begins, through Nike\u2019s website.

Nike started the fiscal year with a 50-50 split of full-price and discounted items, he said during the second-quarter 2025 earnings call in December.\n\n\"Being premium also means full price.

The brand's signature swoosh can be seen everywhere from basketball courts and major marathons to elementary school playgrounds.\n\nIn fact, in a 2021 report of the top global sneaker brands from shoe news site Sole Supplier, Nike easily secured the No. 1 spot (and ranked at No. 2 as well, with its Jordan line). All that's to say, there's no denying that Nike is a global superpower, and its sneakers are known for being sleek, on-trend and high-quality.\n\nBut since our team is always on the lookout for shoes that will feel just as good on our feet as they look, we had to know: Are Nike shoes good for your feet? A podiatrist shares everything you need to know, below.\n\nAre Nike shoes good for your feet? | The best Nike shoes for your feet | Why are Nike Air Jordans so popular? | Nike sneaker accessories | How we chose | Meet our experts\n\nAre Nike shoes good for your feet?\n\nOne of the best things about Nike is that they offer a wide variety of shoes at different price points, especially when it comes to sports shoes. \"They definitely do rule the market in basketball shoes and cleats,\" says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist in Silver Spring, Maryland. \"There's so much variety, especially for kids and basketball players, and at a better price point than their competitors.\"\n\nWhile Nike isn't a brand that Parthasarathy recommends in her practice, as some of their shoes don't offer enough structure or support, that doesn't mean that they don't have some good options for people who are enticed by the brand. Generally, Nike's shoes tend to be pretty narrow \u2014 the sleek design is part of what adds to the appeal \u2014 so, she says \"If you have a narrow foot, you would find them more comfortable.\"\n\nTwo specific styles that she calls out as being good options for those hoping to add a pair of Nike sneakers to their closet are the brand's Pegasus and Tempo sneakers. \"Both of them have good shock absorption and responsiveness when running,\" Parthasarathy says. She adds that those can also be good options for anyone looking for a walking or everyday sneaker. Plus, because the upper is made of mesh as opposed to leather, \"that makes it breathable,\" she adds. \"And although the toe box is narrow at least it will give you a little bit more room.\"\n\nTo check to see if any given pair of sneakers are supportive enough, Parthasarathy recommends doing a fold test. \"If the front of the shoe can touch the back of the shoe, then they are not supportive enough.\"\n\nHere, some of the best shoes from the brand, according to experts.\n\nThe best Nike shoes for your feet\n\nThe latest version of Nike\u2019s Pegasus sneakers, the shoes are said to have medium cushioning and high responsiveness to provide a springy feel with each step. Compared to the previous versions, the brand says that this model features improved comfort and responsive midsoles. They also come in a wide version, for those who are concerned that the shoe might be too narrow.\n\nShop TODAY's deputy editorial director Alexandra Deabler owns a previous model of these sneakers. \"I love these shoes,\" she says. She originally bought a pair in 2017 because they were on sale. And then, in 2020, when it came time to buy a new pair of shoes, she tried multiple brands and pairs and still, these were her top choice. \"As soon as I put them on, it felt like I was coming home. They have the right amount of cushion and toe box width. Just a good basic sneaker you can wear walking or running.\"\n\nThese sandals are said to combine the cushioned sole of a running sneaker with the trendy style of a slide, so you get the best of both worlds.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had these sandals for three or four years now and I won\u2019t let them go until they absolutely fall apart,\" shares associate SEO editor Kamari Stewart. \"These are some of my favorite sandals for summer because they work with everything, in my opinion. I\u2019ve worn these for long days in Disney in the middle of the summer and I was the only person whose feet didn\u2019t hurt by the end of the day.\"\n\n\u201cI used to train with the wrong lifting shoes years ago and the difference it has made has changed my workouts forever,\u201d fitness influencer Sophie Sanguedolce previously told us about switching to Nike's Metcon shoes. \u201cI now feel more mind to muscle connection when using Nike Metcons on lower body days, less back pain from trying to stabilize myself, and I have better form for those reasons as well since I can control the movement of my lifts more.\u201d\n\nMade to be worn during a range of activities, from cardio to weightlifting, they feature a lightweight foam material that the brand says won't weigh you down.\n\nThe men's version of the Pegasus 40 running shoes won a TODAY Wellness Award in 2023. They're said to provide responsive cushioning, so your steps feel springy and light as you run.\n\nWhy are Nike Air Jordans so popular?\n\nIn 1984, Nike gave up-and-coming basketball star Michael Jordan his own line of clothing and shoes, signing a $500,000-per-year contract with the athlete, a record-breaking number at the time. The first style under the Jordan brand, the Nike Air Jordan 1, debuted in 1985 and in just a few months Nike had sold $70 million worth of the shoes, ESPN reported. Through the years, the popularity of the Jordan brand has only grown, with iterations being named the most important and influential sneakers of all time by multiple publications while attracting a legion of celebrity fans.\n\nThe brand's long history in pop culture and status as a collector's item seems to help with its timeless popularity. Earlier this year, a pair of Michael Jordan's own Nike Air Jordan 13 sneakers became the most expensive sneakers ever sold, going for $2.2 million in an auction.\n\nWhile there is now a range of styles and options that the Jordan line offers, from an expert standpoint, the classic shoes are probably better suited for the court than for being an everyday sneaker. \"They're really made for basketball players,\" Parthasarathy says. Though the one big benefit of the shoes off the court would be that they could be helpful for anyone with weak ankles, as the mid-height collar could provide extra support. \"I think that they're absolutely fine for basketball, because they're a mid-height shoe which provides stability around the ankle. And I'm sure that those shoes would not fold in half and provide some good arch support and traction on the court. But, again, we want to watch out for the width because some people can have issues with their baby toes rubbing against the shoe, especially with the lateral movement of basketball. So you want to make sure that they fit well.\"\n\nNike sneaker accessories\n\nSneaker Cleaner $ 6.99 Amazon What we like Portable size\n\nEasy to use Something to note May need to use brush\n\nNike sneakers are an investment, so you want to keep them looking their best for as long as possible.

Here we have a Nike Pegasus 41 designed by Tima Sviridenko; an 11-year-old bone marrow transplant recipient diagnosed with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP).\n\nRight off the bat, the inspiration behind the design is clear as day. Tima\u2019s Pegasus 41 is inspired by his love for cats, particularly his family cat Murka as well as his favorite feline stuffed animal. Murka can be spotted hanging off the lateral Swoosh logo, while his favorite cat stuffie, Murzik, shows up as a lace-hanging patch. These also come with custom outsoles featuring cat paws so you can leave prints everywhere you go, and moreover, when you hit the lights, the embossed paw print detailing over the forefoot glows in the dark.\n\nAs for the rest of the design, the tropical color palette was chosen to honor Tima\u2019s bone marrow donor Dylan, who resides in Florida. The date of Tima\u2019s bone marrow transplant appears on the ends of the laces, one of which reads \u201cMarch 4th\u201d while the other reads \u201cMarch Forth\u201d in a clever reinterpretation. The lace tips are also customized, featuring text reading \u201cDylan\u201d and \u201cTima\u201d as another nod to the 11-year-old\u2019s donor.\n\nTima\u2019s Pegasus 41 will release January 25th alongside five other shoes designed by Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital patients, with all proceeds of course going to benefit the hospital.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWeeks after the retailer shuttered its experiences business, REI on Wednesday announced that CEO Eric Artz will retire in March as part of a planned succession process. Mary Beth Laughton, a former REI board director and one-time Athleta CEO, will take on the role, per a press release emailed to Retail Dive.\n\nLaughton, who most recently led Nike\u2019s global retail and digital direct-to-consumer business, will become president of REI on Feb. 3 and take over full CEO responsibilities on March 31. Artz spent 12 years with the company and six as its CEO, per a letter the executive shared with employees.\n\n\u201cWhile there is never a good moment to step away from an organization you love, we have positive momentum in the business and are in a much better position,\u201d Artz told employees. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the fruits of our labor and have a solid foundation for a new leader to come in and take the co-op forward.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nREI is looking to a new CEO to guide its next phase as it works to regain solid financial footing. The outdoors retailer said in its announcement that it expects to reach breakeven operating profit (pre-dividend) and nearly breakeven free cash flow for the year, which is a \u201csignificant improvement\u201d over 2023.\n\n\u201cEric has led and stabilized REI through some of the most challenging years the retail sector and our co-op ever faced. REI is in a strong position today because he always kept our purpose, values, and people as his north star,\u201d Chris Carr, REI\u2019s board chair, said in a statement. \u201cMary Beth has the ideal experience to build on this foundation and to lead REI forward into our next chapter. The world needs a strong REI, and we are confident Mary Beth will hit the ground running.\u201d\n\nMary Beth Laughton is a former REI board director and one-time Athleta CEO. Permission granted by REI\n\nIn Artz\u2019s letter to employees, he also praised Laughton as the right leader for REI and noted that the two would work closely together during the transition period. Laughton plans to spend her initial couple of months with the business traveling to stores and distribution centers to build connections with employees and others. She will be based in REI\u2019s office in Issaquah, Washington, according to a letter from Carr to employees and co-op members.\n\nIn addition to her experience at Nike, Athleta and as a board member at REI, Laughton also previously ran Sephora\u2019s North American stores and digital operations. She takes over at REI after the retailer underwent two years of considerable layoffs, including 357 in January last year, 275 as part of a store operations overhaul in October 2023 and the more than 400 employees that were let go as the experience business closed this month.\n\nAmid the cost-cutting, REI also changed its return policy in November to curb misuse by a small number of members.\n\nIn addition to Laughton, REI has a new chief marketer, who joined the company just a few months ago. The outdoors retailer remains focused on expansion as well, with six stores planned for this year and at least two in 2026.\n\nIn his farewell to the business, Artz highlighted the importance of the outdoors to everyday life and the retailer\u2019s customers.\n\n\u201cBeing outside means something different for everyone and our job is not to tell people what that looks like. It is to show one another and to welcome others, always making time outside more accessible to more people in more ways,\u201d Artz said to employees. \u201cThat is worth fighting for and why I believe the world must have a strong REI.\u201d",

Thirty-one Washington employees were laid off.\n\nIn a press release, Artz said the closure decision was based on preliminary financial results showing that the company was close to breaking even for 2024.\n\nArtz thanked the Experiences team and told employees the team had done nothing wrong. The division had been a part of REI for 40 years.\n\nBut that part of the business only served 40,000 customers in 2024\u2014less than 0.4% of all co-op customers\u2014and costs more to run than it brings in.\n\nThe REI Union said it was looking forward to a new CEO at the company.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement reflects the feelings of REI Co-op members and workers alike, that it\u2019s time for a change,\" the union said in a statement to KOMO News.\n\n\u201cWe call on the incoming CEO, Mary Beth Laughton, to come to the table and work with us on ushering in a new chapter for REI that better represents its founding values and workers\u2019 voices,\" the union added.\n\nSince 2022, ten REI stores have voted to unionize, including the store in Bellingham. Other unionized stores include Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and New York City.\n\nThe REI Union told KOMO News that it believes the retailer has used union-busting tactics in an attempt to squash an ongoing wave of organizing.\n\nREI executives expressed confidence in Laughton's ability to lead the major outdoor retailer.\n\n\"Mary Beth has the ideal experience to build on this foundation and to lead REI forward into our next chapter,\" Carr said. \"The world needs a strong REI, and we are confident Mary Beth will hit the ground running.\"\n\n\"No other company balances purpose and performance quite like REI, and we must ensure it thrives for generations to come,\" Laughton said. \"That is a big responsibility\u2014one I embrace with utmost respect for our millions of members and the thousands of employees whose passion for life outside and deep expertise set the co-op apart.\"\n\nREI executives said they remain focused on maintaining stability for employees, members, and partners while building on the growth achieved at the end of 2024.\n\nThe co-op said it expects to meet its 2024 goals of break-even operating profit, marking a \"significant improvement\" over 2023.",

Perforated medial and lateral quarter panels stay true to the initial Superfly design, promoting breathability and lightweight performance, and distinctive green dots on the original outsole mimic 2000s-era track spike placement.\n\nA hidden Nike Air unit and Cushlon foam midsole deliver comfort that\u2019s central to Nike\u2019s running-inspired sportswear silhouettes, and a leather and synthetic suede upper offers a premium look and feel accentuated by the metallic silver launch colorway shared with the Air Max Muse, another new Nike Air style for women.\n\n\u201cThe most exciting part of bringing the Air Superfly back to life was landing on the colors and materials that the shoe is going to take on,\u201d says Thomasin Hummerstone, Director, Footwear Product Creation, Women\u2019s Sportswear. \u201cThis shoe has an amazing chameleon-like quality that, depending on how you color and materialize it, can take on so many different personalities. That begins with the metallic silver launch colorway, which is a modern evolution of the silver anthracite look from the original design.\u201d\n\nThe Nike Air Superfly will be available beginning January 27 at select Nike retail partners and February 7 globally on SNKRS.\n\n",

We\u2019re currently in a bit of a lull period in between racing seasons, but that\u2019s not stopping Nike from teeing up fresh colorways. This white and \u201cGridiron\u201d look is the Beaverton brand\u2019s latest, and if its special markings are any indication, runners should expect a late Spring 2025 release.\n\nOfficial images reveal a white knit upper, save for a \u201cGridiron\u201d Swoosh that dips down into the midsole. The heel portion introduces a \u201cPure Platinum\u201d gradient, hosting a text box reading \u201cRoad Racing AF\u201d and \u201c2025-03,\u201d therefore hinting at a potential March 2025 release. Those same markings appears on the insoles, capping off all the notable design highlights. As far as performance goes, the AlphaFly 3 brings three key innovations to a helm; stacked Air Zoom units appear in the forefoot, ZoomX foam makes up the midsole, and a full-length carbon fiber plate enhances forward propulsion. It\u2019s Nike\u2019s lightest AlphaFly shoe to date and the sneaker of choice for elite runners like Eliud Kipchoge and Kelvin Kiptum, both of whom have broken world records in the shoe.\n\nScroll through detailed images of the Nike AlphaFly 3 \u201cWhite/Gridiron/Pure Platinum\u201d below and visit our Sneaker Release Dates page to preview more upcoming Nike Running shoes.",

Over the last few years, nods to various US cities have emerged on the sneaker, including pairs Philly, NOLA, ATL, and Los Angeles pairs. Now, Nike looks to NYC\u2019s punk rock scene to pay homage to the city and the iconic CBGB club.\n\nInitially opened in 1973, CBGB transformed from a dive and biker bar to an iconic part of NYC\u2019s music scene. More specifically, the club hosted some of the most famous punk rock and new wave artists of the late 20th century, including Ramones, Beastie Boys, and, outside of these genres, even Madonna. After serving the community for decades, the club, located near Bleecker St and Bowery, closed on October 15, 2006.\n\nNike Dunk Low NYC CBGB\n\nAs for Nike\u2019s tribute to the club, they\u2019ve translated punk rock aesthetics onto the Dunk Low by applying a cracked leather finish with a worn-in black and grey look to the overlays. An earth-tone leather is present on the toebox and midfoot, with a darker panel located on the collar. One of the first homages to the club itself is found on the Nike branding of the tongue tag and heel tab, written in the same font and color as the CBGB club\u2019s logo.\n\nInside, the insole features a collage of punk-inspired Nike logos and nods to NYC, with a direct nod to the location of the club found on the reverse of the tongue. The left pair features a street sign-inspired green tag that reads \u201cBleeker\u201d (a misspelling of Bleecker St.) while the right reads \u201cBowery,\u201d a nod to the location of the CBGB club. Finishing the design is the tonal rubber midsole and outsole.\n\nThe Nike Dunk Low NYC CBGB will release in Spring 2025 through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is set at $130.

Contrarily, Nike is objecting to that with this upcoming release that ties in one of the most important eras in music history.\n\nIf you still love Nike Dunks, then now\u2019s the best time to go in and scoop up some solid releases for what will likely be all-time lows in pricing. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the trend cycle makes a full revolution, because let us remind you, the Dunk \u201cdied\u201d once before in the mid-late 2000s, only to come back stronger than ever.\n\nWhile this upcoming release isn\u2019t a direct commentary on the history of Dunk trends, the \u201cDunks Not Dead\u201d certainly brings up the conversation. Punk music and fashion itself was a statement against the mainstream, with tattered military gear sending the provocative message.\n\nIn the case of this Dunk, you\u2019ll find familiar olive green shades across the nylon overlay, while black leather and rip-stop on the tongue add to the surplus aesthetic. Tattered laces and army-style font continue the theme, while pins and patches add the final touch to punk-themed design.\n\nWith the recent surfacing of the Dunk Low \u201cCBGB\u201d, Nike could also be working on a music-themed pack of Dunks for Spring 2025.",

            "content": "Nike (NKE -1.35%) is a ubiquitous sportswear brand with a trailing 12-month revenue of $49 billion. But after a decade of market-beating returns, Nike's stock has been crushed over the last year by weakening sales trends.\n\nThe stock trades down 60% from its previous peak, which looks tempting for value investors. The lower share price means that investors can buy the stock at a lower multiple of Nike's sales and earnings. Plus, Nike is still paying dividends, so the stock's haircut has brought its dividend yield to a 15-year high.\n\nThese indicators suggest that the shares are undervalued, and it's attracting investment from some of the smartest investors around. Billionaire Bill Ackman and other notable fund managers started positions in Nike stock last year.\n\nIs it time to buy this beaten-down sportswear leader?\n\nA turnaround could take time\n\nNike's sales were down 8% year over year in the November-ending quarter, and analysts who cover the company on Wall Street expect full-year sales for the May-ending fiscal year to be down 10% year over year. Lower sales are also taking their toll on the bottom line, with Nike's earnings expected to be down 45% for the current fiscal year.\n\nSome of Nike's problems are self-inflicted. For example, new CEO Elliott Hill is implementing a strategy to reduce the reliance on promotional discounts to drive more full-price sales. This should lead to stronger profitability over the long term. The company is also boosting investment in sports, which should benefit Nike's core products like running and basketball shoes.\n\nThere is a trade-off in the near term. As Nike reduces promotional sales, people who have gotten used to Nike's discounts may turn to other brands, and that could further pressure sales. Because of this, it could take several quarters before Nike starts showing a significant improvement in financial results.\n\nIncreasing competition\n\nInvestors should also be aware that Nike is facing greater competition in the marketplace, which raises uncertainty about the timing of a turnaround. Over the last few years, competitors like Lululemon Athletica (LULU 0.44%), On Holding (ONON 0.15%), and Deckers Outdoor's (DECK 1.40%) Hoka have all delivered stronger sales growth than Nike.\n\nLululemon's revenue grew 9% year over year last quarter, and while Lululemon is mostly focused on premium apparel, management has noted success in growing its new footwear line.\n\nMeanwhile, On's footwear is gaining wider appeal, with sales soaring 32% over the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Deckers reported a 20% year-over-year increase in sales last quarter, as it continued to report strong demand for its Hoka running shoe.\n\nIn comparison, sales of Nike's footwear tumbled 11% over the year-ago quarter. Nike's running shoes performed better, with sales flat in the men's category and up single-digit percentages in women's, but it seems to be losing market share to competitors.\n\nNike can win, but it may get worse before it gets better\n\nBut it's not game over for Nike. The one advantage it has that these other brands don't is massive scale and global reach. The company's marketing expense was almost double On Holding's total revenue over the last year. Obviously, that didn't prevent the company's sales from falling, but historically, Nike has demonstrated that it knows how to build brand awareness better than anyone. Marketing and innovation are why Nike is the industry leader. As it adjusts its product strategy and marketing message, Nike can energize sales again.\n\nThat said, investors may want to wait to buy the stock until there is better visibility on sales. The stock is sitting close to new lows at the time of this writing, and there is a real risk that Nike could struggle to grow sales in the near term, which could send the stock down to new lows before it rebounds.",

            "content": "Michael Jordan is not only popular for his excellence in basketball but also for his cool and athletic shoes. His Air Jordan signature sneakers have been major milestones of his career, on and off the court, defining his moments and the moments of basketball history. The first pair he wore broke the rules of the NBA; the others, which he wore while winning championships, each had a story to tell.\n\nLet's walk through ten of the most memorable Air Jordans Michael Jordan wore at pivotal moments of his career.\n\nNike Air Jordan 1\n\nSan Diego Padres v San Francisco Giants - Source: Getty\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 1 is the sneaker that started it all. The shoe was a bold move as it came out in 1985 with the red-and-black colorway. It was contrary to the then-uniform policy of the NBA; Jordan was wearing them for his rookie season. He won the Rookie of the Year award but challenged the norms of the league.\n\nThe league fined him $5,000 each game, but Nike saw this as an opportunity to launch a marketing blitz. The \"Banned\" storyline made the shoe an instant classic. Jordan's high-flying dunks and fearless gameplay in these sneakers laid the foundation for a legacy that extended beyond the court.\n\nNike Air Jordan 3\n\nNike Air Jordan 3 (Image via NIKE)\n\nMichael Jordan had become, by 1988, a name everybody knew and respected. Nike Air Jordan 3 brought so much innovation that this shoe came with the first-ever visible Air unit and an already iconic Jumpman logo. These were what he wore when he made history with the memorable free-throw line dunk at the 1988 NBA Dunk Contest.\n\nIt was also during this model that elephant print detailing first appeared to mix performance and style. In addition to the Dunk Contest, Jordan's dominant season in these shoes included winning the NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards, making the Air Jordan 3 a symbol of peak performance.\n\nNike Air Jordan 4\n\nRami Almordaah, AKA @Ramitheicon, has social media fame as a sneaker buyer at Cook Kicks, on Melrose Ave, in Los Angeles, CA - Source: Getty\n\nOne of the most iconic moments in Jordan's career is when Nike Air Jordan 4 debuted in 1989 during \"The Shot\" against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Playoffs. These were designed for flexibility and airflow. Mesh panels, along with interchangeable lacing, made up these shoes.\n\nNot only did the jumper from Jordan ensure the Bulls would win, but the shot at the buzzer made it one of the longest-lasting images of his clutch gene. This makes the Air Jordan 4, which married performance with style, a classic, and \"The Shot\" assured its place in the pantheon of basketball legend.\n\nNike Air Jordan 5\n\nRami Almordaah, AKA @Ramitheicon, has social media fame as a sneaker buyer at Cook Kicks, on Melrose Ave, in Los Angeles, CA - Source: Getty\n\nAggressive as Jordan was in his play in 1990, so was the Nike Air Jordan 5, which was inspired by WWII fighter planes. This shoe featured reflective tongues and translucent outsoles, and it was at once functional and eye-catching.\n\nOne of Jordan's most remembered games was against the Cleveland Cavaliers when he wore the shoes and had a 69-point game. The Air Jordan 5 is the epitome of his unyielding drive and athleticism. Its bold design and association with such a historic game make it a lasting icon of greatness.\n\nNike Air Jordan 6\n\n2009 Air Jordan VI (6) Retro sneakers are pictured in the photo studio Tuesday evening. The sneakers were brought in by Jessica \"Brooklyn\" Teo, 31, of West Reading. Photo by Natalie Kolb 9/9/2014 - Source: Getty\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 6 represents a special moment for Michael Jordan: it was his shoe when he won his first NBA championship back in 1991. That shoe had an added toe cap and two-hole pull tabs with comfort and utility.\n\nJordan was the Finals MVP against the Los Angeles Lakers that started the dynasty of the Bulls, so success is synonymous with the Air Jordan 6. Its role during one of Jordan's most prominent moments in career history cements it as something of an institution in basketball annals.\n\nNike Air Jordan 7\n\n2010 Air Jordan VII (7) Retro sneakers are pictured in the photo studio Tuesday evening. The sneakers were brought in by Jessica \"Brooklyn\" Teo, 31, of West Reading. Photo by Natalie Kolb 9/9/2014 - Source: Getty\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 7 stands out not only with its design but also with its association with two major benchmarks in the career of Jordan. He wore these when the Bulls went into their consecutive second championship and when he was with the Dream Team during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\n\nThe shoe was revolutionary not only with its inspiration from African art but also with sock-like footwear. Jordan dominated both the NBA season and the world, making the Air Jordan 7 a worldwide phenomenon. He represented not just individual brilliance but also team success, epitomizing the champion spirit.\n\nNike Air Jordan 11\n\nPortland Trail Blazers v Golden State Warriors - Source: Getty\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 11 has to be the most iconic sneaker in sneaker culture. When Jordan returned to basketball in 1995, he released the \"Concord\" colorway. The patent leather construction and sleek appearance were an innovation at that time for sports shoes.\n\nA year later, Jordan wore the \"Bred\" edition in the 1996 NBA Finals. Jordan led the Bulls to an NBA-record 72 wins in the regular season and a championship that year. The Air Jordan 11 is more than just a sneaker; it's a testament to Jordan's ability to elevate his game and his brand.\n\nNike Air Jordan 12\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers v Chicago Cubs - Source: Getty\n\nPerhaps the most iconic visual of the Nike Air Jordan 12 is \"Flu Game,\" Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals. At this point, Michael Jordan was looking very unwell, having fallen ill with the flu. That didn't keep him from producing 38 points to secure victory for the Bulls. The \"Flu Game\" black and red color scheme has since gone down in the books as only something Jordan can muster up through sheer will.\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 12 is \"Flu Game,\" Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals. At this point, Michael Jordan was wearing this performance shoe that combined style with a sleek, Rising Sun-inspired aesthetic. Its association with such an iconic moment places it in the history of basketball and sneakers.\n\nNike Air Jordan 13\n\nMelbourne United v Los Angeles Clippers - Source: Getty\n\nInspired by a panther, the Nike Air Jordan 13 was created to symbolize Jordan's predatory instincts on court. The outsole in the shape of a cat's paw and eye that was holographic made this shoe stand out in style.\n\nWorn by Jordan in the 1998 NBA season that ended with the sixth championship for the Bulls, the \"He Got Game\" colorway came into the limelight when Spike Lee used it for his film of the same name. The Air Jordan 13 is a representation of a player at the height of his powers, delivering unforgettable moments with every step.\n\nNike Air Jordan 14\n\nAir Jordan 14 (image via StockX)\n\nThe Nike Air Jordan 14 marked the end. Jordan donned them to play his last game in the Chicago Bulls' 1998 NBA Finals. The jumper over Bryon Russell, known as \"The Last Shot,\" gave the Bulls their sixth championship.\n\nChiseled from the inspiration of Jordan's taste for luxurious sports cars, the sneaker was a Ferrari prototype of design. Its association with this historic moment consigns it to a legendary status in the folklore of basketball and the world of sneakers.\n\nMichael Jordan's Air Jordans are more than just sneakers; they are part of sports and cultural history, in which each pair tells the story of skill, resilience, and memorable moments on the court. From the rebellious Air Jordan 1 to the championship-clinching Air Jordan 14, these shoes represent an unparalleled legacy.\n\nFor the fans of the game and sneaker enthusiasts, they remind everyone of what could be achieved by talent, hard work, and innovation. The legacy of Jordan lives on not only in the annals of basketball but in the soles of these iconic sneakers.\n\n\u200b",

On Jan. 19, 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly-anticipated matchup.\n\nThe Lakers were coming a season that ended in a disappointing loss to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The Cavaliers themselves were title contenders, and both teams entered the night with 31 wins and single-digit losses.\n\nAt the time, Bryant and James represented two of Nike\u2019s standout pillars. As such, Bryant was outfitted with what became one of his most recognizable sneakers in a long-running signature shoe line with Nike \u2014 the Zoom Kobe IV \u2018MLK\u2019 colorway.\n\nA white-based model featured a purple toe box, gold swoosh, gold color and snakeskin detailing. The shoe was later released in limited quantities on May 8, 2009.\n\nAs for matters on the court, Bryant dislocated the ring finger on his right hand while diving for a loose ball a mere two minutes into the game. He of course returned, and proceeded to score\n\n20 points, to go along with six rebounds and 12 assists in 41 minutes.\n\nBryant scored nine points as part of a Lakers 16-7 run to open the fourth quarter. James finished with 23 points, nine rebounds and four assists.\n\nWhile Bryant helped drive the engine, it was Pau Gasol (22 points and 12 rebounds) and the rest of the supporting cast that led the way in a Lakers 105-88 win. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak and prevented the Lakers from suffering their first stretch of three consecutive losses that season.\n\nLeBron James reflects on first matchup against Kobe Bryant\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that James and Bryant squared off as that came all the way back in 2004.

During last night\u2019s game against the Detroit Lions, the number one seed many assumed would pull away with the victory; rookie QB Jayden Daniels put up a historic performance. Daniels channeled his inner Mamba Mentality as he took the field in a custom pair of Nike Vapor Edge Kobe 6 Cleats in burgundy and gold hues of the Washington Commanders.\n\nDaniels employed his long-time customizer, Joe Castro, who goes by @arts_undefined on Instagram, to create these cleats for the NFC Divisional game. This isn\u2019t the first time Daniels laced up some heat as last week, in the Commanders\u2019 first playoff win in 19 years, Jayden rocked a custom pair of Nike Vapor Edge Pro 360 cleats in his team\u2019s colors. In the weeks prior, Jayden rocked more \u201chype\u201d designs like his custom Travis Scott-inspired Air Jordan 1 Low cleats and Kobe 5-inspired cleats, but decided he wanted to channel Kobe Bryant\u2019s \u201cMamba Mentality\u201d against the Detroit Lions.\n\nBecoming the second rookie QB to defeat a number one seed in the playoffs, Daniels\u2019 performance last night included 22/31 passing attempts, 299 yards, two touchdowns, and 51 rushing yards. His first-half performance also set a new record, as his 242 yards in the first half were the most ever by a rookie QB in an NFL playoff game.\n\nAs for the cleat\u2019s design, the pair is a burgundy-and-gold customized version of the Nike Vapor Edge Kobe 6, which was released in the Grinch colorway in November and a mismatched Grinch and Reverse Grinch color in December. On top of these released colors, Mole gave multiple NCAA programs PE colors for their football teams, including the Oregon Ducks, who wore a pair during the Rose Bowl.\n\nNext up for Daniels and the Commanders is the Eagles and Rams game-winner, which will go down today at 3:00 PM ET. Hopefully, whatever pair he wears next week will help propel him and the team to a shot at the Super Bowl.

Torn and grunge-inspired textures cover the upper, reminiscent of the club\u2019s poster-laden walls. Branding at the heel and tongue nods to the iconic CBGB logo font, while inner tongues feature street signs for Bleecker and Bowery\u2014the intersection where the club once stood, cementing its place in New York history.\n\nThough official release details remain under wraps, the Nike Dunk Low \"CBGB\" is expected to drop soon.

After all, every popular lifestyle shoe on the market was at once a piece of athletic wear. The Pegasus Premium is poised to joined that exclusive group.\n\nDebuting at the Nike\u2019s On Air innovation summit in Paris last April, the Pegasus Premium instantly wowed the crowd with its simplicity. To its benefit, Nike kept the upper design rather pedestrian; nothing about it strikes as new. However, the full-length Zoom Air bag at the midsole is what had us excited for the first time in a while.\n\nNike opted for full-length visible Zoom Air on a running shoe on just one other occasion (the Zoom All Out Flyknit). The ergonomic shape of the unit on the Pegasus Premium is what makes it so much more attractive to the eye. Upon testing the shoe, the Pegasus Premium is a medium-distance runners dream. For commuters, you may never want to take these off.\n\nOn January 30th, the Swoosh will launch the Nike Pegasus Premium in the grey/orange colorway for $210 in both mens and womens sizes. More colorways will arrive later this Spring and into Summer, like this women\u2019s exclusive \u201cAtmosphere\u201d colorway that features the Zoom Air in a metallic silver.

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNike was the best-selling sneaker brand on StockX for the third year in a row in 2024, according to the online resale platform\u2019s newly released Big Facts: Current Culture Index report.\n\nJordan, Adidas, New Balance and Asics rounded out the top five sneaker list in that respective order, with all of them maintaining their positions for a third straight year. Ugg and Crocs ranked first and second in non-sneaker shoe sales for the second straight year, followed by Timberland. Fear of God was the most popular apparel brand for the third straight year.\n\nEssilorLuxottica\u2019s recently acquired brand Supreme remained in first place for accessories, a spot it has kept since StockX began releasing its rankings in 2020. Supreme kept its spot as the second most-popular apparel brand. It has held that position since Fear of God took the top spot for the category in 2022, per the report.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe annual report from StockX covers 2024 trends and makes predictions about 2025. In addition to tracking which brands see the most sales, StockX also tracks growth.\n\nChina-based brand Anta was the fastest growing sneaker label on the platform in 2024. The report said Kyrie Irving\u2019s signature shoe, called the Kai 1, helped drive the brand to a staggering 1,901% year-over-year increase in platform sales, which StockX refers to as trades.\n\nMaison Margiela was the second fastest growing sneaker brand, with trades up 425% year over year. Meanwhile, Saucony was the fifth fastest-growing sneaker brand, with trades up 120%. This marks the first time the brand has landed in the top 5 for growth, which the platform attributed to the company\u2019s big investments and high-profile collaborations including those with Jae Tips, Bodega and Minted New York.\n\nGucci and Timberland were the fastest growing non-sneaker shoes brands, with trades up 410% and 237%, respectively. StockX credited Gucci\u2019s sandals and pool slides for the brand\u2019s growth, and said Timberland\u2019s collaborations with Louis Vuitton, Supreme and JJJJound were pivotal. Also relevant was The Notorious B.I.G. Wheat, which Timberland released in September in honor of the late musician\u2019s \u201cReady To Die\u201d album, which celebrated its 30th anniversary.\n\nIn apparel, Polo Ralph Lauren sales were up 600%, making it the fastest growing brand in the category in 2024. StockX said the growth was due to \u201cthe emergence of Ralphcore on TikTok,\u201d which led to a new generation of consumers who \u201cembraced and even redefined what the label stands for.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, StockX said new brands would take hold in the competitive sneaker resale market. Creativity would also win over consumers, as evidenced by the popularity of New Balance\u2019s 1906 sneaker loafer, the Simone Rocha collab with Crocs, and the enduring appeal of MSCHF\u2019s Big Red Boots, per the report.\n\nNewer apparel brands, such as Hellstar and Revenge, \u201care seeing rapid growth, suggesting streetwear is not dead as some have reported over the last year,\u201d StockX said. In addition, Tremaine Emory\u2019s Denim Tears streetwear brand is the platform\u2019s third fastest-growing apparel label.\n\nThe report also said there could be a recovery in terms of resale prices and price premiums with respect to Nike and Jordan Brand, \u201cassuming the sportswear giant honors its promise to return to a model centered around scarcity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resale market proved its resilience in 2024, with more than 100 brands closing the year with record sales on StockX,\u201d Greg Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of StockX, said in the release. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly optimistic about the year ahead. Whatever 2025 has in store \u2014 whether that be new names in streetwear, viral collectibles brands, or a fresh set of players in the sneaker space \u2014 our product offering will continue to diversify to serve our customers as new trends take hold.\u201d",

            "content": "Less than 400 meters from the Santa Monica coastline, curious runners lined the corner of a vacated parking lot. It was February of 2022. Blaise Williams, PhD, MPT, remembers the conditions well. He was ushering runners who were competing in a Redondo Beach 10K race through a pop-up experience of NSRL Form, the Nike Sport Research Lab\u2019s newest movement-analysis tool, which was still in beta testing. Williams, a Principal Sport Scientist in the NSRL, had brought his team to gauge interest among the participating runners.\n\nTo the naked eye, the testing area featured a tent, a treadmill and 10 high-speed cameras mounted onto struts. But the reality was much more rigorous, culminating years of professional research inside and outside the lab. The cameras tracked an athlete\u2019s biomechanical gait as they jogged for two minutes on the treadmill. Afterward, they\u2019d receive a one-on-one consultation and a customized head-to-toe report on their movement pattern once it was fed through an NSRL-generated algorithm. The report was supplemented with running form suggestions, salient NTC workouts, and shoe recommendations based on the runner\u2019s current profile to help them achieve their goals.\n\nThat day, things were not going to plan. The computer monitors tracking the data inputs were fizzling out in the sun. The cameras were overheating. Later that night, Williams and the team would stay up until 3 a.m. trying to help bulletproof the equipment against the mid-afternoon heat for the following day\u2019s testing. They woke up that morning exhausted, struggling to keep their eyes open, which made the sight in front of them that much more remarkable: a line of runners trailing outside the tent, ready to get in on this first-of-its-kind feedback tool.\n\nThe moment sealed the notion that NSRL Form was a tool athletes wanted, says Williams. \u201cEven though everything seemed to go wrong, to see that kind of curiosity from runners \u2014 we knew we were onto something.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "Classic Nike Free technology has found its way to Nike golf on the Nike Free Golf NN. Of course we had to review it. Let\u2019s find out how this beloved tech translates to golf.\n\nNike Free Golf NN Price: $130 (some colorways at $78) Sizing: True to size Buy at Nike\n\nNike Free Golf NN Testing Process\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN was the only time I\u2019ve put over 20 miles on a golf shoe\u2026and I intend to keep it that way (I\u2019ve never been more tired).\n\nI decided to do my testing while spending the week covering the Black Desert Championship in Saint George, Utah.\n\nAn article posted by Glenmuir claims the average golfer walks roughly five miles per round. I put five miles on the Nike Free Golf on day one, and somewhere close to fifteen more throughout the rest of the week.\n\nI experienced all types of terrain and slopes, so I can confidently tell you how the Nike Free Golf felt and whether or not they\u2019re worth your hard-earned cash.\n\nAt first glance, the Nike Free Golf NN might make you think you\u2019re preparing for a quick run under the city lights. It brought me back to my junior high days with its simple design, reminiscent of the Nike Free Run models.\n\nEnough reminiscing, though\u2014let\u2019s dive in.\n\nTraction\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is spikeless and was built specifically to perform well in wet climates.\n\nThe traction is a mix of different rubberized shapes, with the heel having the most consistent ridge-like structure. As I mentioned earlier, I put twenty miles on the Nike Free Golf NN and never experienced slippage.\n\nOn top of the intense walking at Black Desert, I also made sure to get a quick round in while the weather was nice. The Nike Free Golf NN performed great on the course\u2014even though I shot a below-average round.\n\nI noticed the best traction on the fairway and felt no struggle with more powerful shots on the tee box.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say this is the best spikeless traction on the market, but I would recommend the Nike Free Golf NN to any casual golfer looking for a solid starter shoe.\n\nFit\n\nI went all in by wearing the Nike Free Golf NN to the Black Desert Championship. It was pretty risky to show up to a tournament in a shoe I hadn\u2019t worn yet.\n\nHow did it turn out for me? Just fine.\n\nI wear an 11.5, and the 11.5 Nike Free Golf fit perfectly. No slippage, blisters, or need to re-tighten throughout the day. The Nike Free Golf NN felt great and ran true to size.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this in previous articles, but if you\u2019re new here, I\u2019ll say it again: My feet are somewhere between narrow and wide. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself to have wide feet, but they\u2019re definitely not narrow either.\n\nThat being said, the fit was nice and roomy for me. Honestly, they could\u2019ve given me even less room around the toes, and it would have been fine.\n\nMy recommendation to our wide-footed readers is to look for the \u201cwide\u201d option on Nike\u2019s website. When a direct wide option is available, go with your normal size but in wide.\n\nCushion\n\nNike Free Run shoes were created to give athletes a shoe that mimics the feeling of being barefoot as Nike struggled to keep up with the ultimately doomed barefoot running craze that was happening at the time.\n\nHonestly, the midsole was great considering what I put it through during week one. My feet were tired, but I was impressed by how good they felt overall. It was a little bit stiffer than I would\u2019ve liked, but this helped on the different types of terrain I encountered on the course.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve ever worn a shoe designed to mimic barefoot movement, and I took note of the slight increase in flexibility and natural feel.\n\nThe only downside was slight soreness on my heels. The Nike Free Golf NN felt a little tall at the heels, which led to mild soreness from the heel to the midfoot.\n\nIt\u2019s a trivial issue and not a major concern, but it\u2019s worth noting if you\u2019re someone with sensitive heels.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you can put twenty miles on a golf shoe in seven days without major blisters or pain, it\u2019s safe to say the support is solid.\n\nNike added a bulky plastic clip around the heel, extending up to the start of the midsole, which contributes to excellent support.\n\nOn top of that, Nike reinforced the upper to securely attach it to the outsole, adding extra stability.\n\nThis is a great shoe with multiple elements contributing to strong support.\n\nStyle\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is an adaptation of the Nike Free Run line, making it recognizable right off the bat.\n\nThe original Nike Free Run was released in the early 2000s, and the most recent Free Run model came out several years ago.\n\nSome may find it odd that Nike decided to release a Nike Free Golf model in 2024, but as I mentioned, the Nike Free Golf NN is both recognizable and familiar. I remember a TED Talk by Derek Thompson in which he discusses the importance of creating something new while still maintaining a sense of familiarity.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Nike did with the Nike Free Golf NN.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Nike Free Golf NN is currently on sale on Nike\u2019s website. At $78 and $92 (at the time of publication) for some colorways, it ranks among the top five budget options for Nike golf shoes. When comparing price to performance, I feel the Nike Free Golf NN is priced appropriately, and you\u2019ll definitely get your money\u2019s worth.\n\nIt\u2019s not the flashiest golf shoe of all time, but it gets the job done for the golfer focused on casual performance.\n\nConsidering its similarities to the Nike Free Run shoes, the price is in line. The biggest difference is the golf-specific traction, which justifies the slightly higher price compared to the regular Nike Free Run shoes. Nike gets an A+ on this one.\n\nNike Free Golf NN Summary\n\nFor anyone who plays golf casually, the Nike Free Golf NN will suit your game well. If you\u2019re an aspiring tournament golfer, I\u2019d opt for a spiked shoe.\n\nThe Nike Free Golf is the perfect shoe for new golfers, but it\u2019s also a safe and comfortable choice for seasoned players. I\u2019m currently a 14.4 handicap, and I felt the Nike Free Golf suited my game just fine.\n\nFor its performance, the Nike Free Golf would make a great addition to your golf closet, especially if you\u2019re just getting into golf and looking for your first pair.\n\nconnorlwt 9 / 10 Total Score\n\nHow the Author Golfs\n\nTyler Allred (19 handicap): Golfs 2-3 times a week spending the bulk of his time playing actual rounds. Mostly pushes himself to improve every part of his game, but also enjoys a casual round of golf every now and then.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWhile Nike did send a pair of the Free Golf NN to facilitate this review, the company had no involvement in this review, didn\u2019t receive an advance look at it, and has not attempted to influence it.",

Co-signs from her former boss and other figures in the hip-hop, fashion, and streetwear scenes grew the brand\u2019s recognition, but the collaboration with Nike on the VaporMax in 2019 put the brand on the map for sneakerheads.\n\nFollowing this, the duo worked on various Nike products, including two Swarovski-covered Dunk Lows, the Overgrown Flea 1, the CPFM Air Flea 2, and most recently, new colorways of the AF1. Now, CPFM is working on a new silhouette in Fall 2025 dubbed the Swamp Sponge Dunk.\n\nCPFM's Nike Blazer Mid Sponge By You from 2019\n\nWhile no images of this new CPFM silhouette have appeared, we can confirm that this sneaker will have three different colorways. One takes on a tonal Sequoia finish, another mixes photo blue, digital pink, and sequoia, and the last one combines psychic purple, photo blue, and gold suede. We should expect an avant-garde design that defies the typical Nike design language as CPFM\u2019s previous two Nike models, the unreleased Flea 1, Flea 1 Overgrown, and Flea 2; all turn heads with their wild design details.\n\nPreviously, CPFM worked with Nike on a Nike By You Blazer Mid called Sponge By You, featuring a mixture of spongy and natural materials that one could choose from. With this new Dunk model bearing the same sponge moniker, the spongy material found on the Blazer Mid will likely appear here.\n\nThe CPFM x Nike Swamp Sponge Dunk Collection will release in Fall 2025 through CPFM and Nike SNKRS online. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $150.

As its full release cycle for 2025 continues to unfold, the presidential silhouette has emerged in a 'Black Tiffany' makeover.\n\nWhile not an official collaboration with the renowned jeweler, the newly-surfaced pair draws heavy comparison to the Air Force 1 by Tiffany & Co. from March 2023. 'Robin Blue'-reminiscent hues have landed on other offerings from the Swoosh, but the brand's latest use of 'Aurora Green' on the iconic AF1 is too spot-on to be coincidental. An Air Max 90 recently appeared in a similar color scheme, which suggests Nike Sportswear has prepped a 'Black Tiffany' collection for the new year.\n\nThe upcoming Air Force 1 Low features traditional construction throughout the upper and sole unit. A muted 'Black' tone sets the stage for eye-catching 'Aurora Green' flair. Just like Tiffany & Co.'s update to Kilgore's design, the unreleased proposal covers its iconic profile branding in a spring-ready flavor; logos on the tongue and spine follow suit. Contrast stitching across the upper, however, marks a stark difference between this pair and the collaborative one.\n\nOther details sure to set the inline 'Black Tiffany' Air Force 1 apart from 2023's Sneaker of the Year contender are price and accessibility: This style should be readily available at a large number of retailers for about $110 USD instead of the hundreds Tiffany's collaboration fetches on the after-market.\n\nEnjoy an initial look at the pair ahead, as you wait for official Nike.com launch details. And for more from the Swoosh conglomerate, check out the Air Jordan 1 '85 'Bred' set to release in February.",

Most prominent in that category is the special retoolings of the Air Jordan 6 and Air Trainer III for Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman Returns. Additionally, the Dark Knight\u2019s ineffable black and yellow combination continues to drape Nike seasonal product with regularity, once again the case with the Nike Air Max 90 \u201cBatman.\u201d\n\nCertainly additional gold-on-black monikers (\u201cSteelers\u201d chief among them) would\u2019ve applied here, but the addition of ripstop panelling as a foundation makes the grungy, crime-fighting lean all the more fitting. Flashes of \u201cBuff Gold\u201d on branding hits throughout the shoe, including a forefoot mini-Swoosh and the \u201cNike Air\u201d tag on the heel, further reinforcing the comic book ties and brightening up the profile a bit in the process.\n\nMoreover, this mainline look lands among a crowded group of colorways coming to light, a major push no doubt aligning with the silo\u2019s 35th anniversary.

The all-new Air Max sneaker hasn't gotten the big Nike push you'd expect of a flagship shoe but, then again, it did only just debut in proper.\n\nIn mid-2024, first looks at Nike's Air Max Muse emerged thanks to, of all people, Nike athlete and Olympian gymnast Jordan Chiles.\n\nCertainly, Chiles is deserving of the title of \"Muse\" but that she would be the Nike ambassador tapped to introduce a fresh Air Max sneaker speaks to the crossover appeal that the Muse is intended to foster.\n\nYou can see the appeal, either way: Nike's Air Max Muse debuted in a smart black and metallic silver colorway that infused flashy Y2K appeal into a covetable dad shoe shape.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nThe Air Max Muse has all the hallmarks of a wholly different sleeper Nike hit, in fact. Compare the Muse to Nike's famously thicc Air Monarch and its stylish M2K Tekno cousin. The comparative chunk is all too obvious.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy Subscribe to Highsnobiety on YouTube\n\nAs such, the Air Max Muse may be more intended to slowly rev up in demand as opposed to suddenly explode with vitality, akin to the Air Monarch's patient buildup in hype.\n\nThat'd at least explain why Nike is being so deliberate with its rollout of new colorways for the thus-unreleased Air Max Muse.\n\nNow, the Air Max Muse is quietly releasing in a statement design that dresses the thicc sneaker in a variety of contrasting hues.\n\nBesides the familiar black base, there's also a smattering of \"University Red\" (on the Swoosh), \"Metallic Silver\" (on the heel's Air bubble), and most plainly, \"Oil Green,\" which gives the Air Max Muse a real visual weight.\n\nnike 1 / 3\n\nNot that it needed much help in that department.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nConsidering the recent Air Max innovations and delightful colorway contrivances that've recently come out of Nike's design HQ, the new Air Max Muse isn't even the wildest sneaker to step onto the streets but it is, if anything, a sign that the weighty dad shoe is poised for great things in 2025.\n\nMakes sense that the oily green colorway is releasing alongside the more classic silver Air Max Muse on January 10 via Nike's website and SNKRS app, kicking off what could be a very big year for the very big shoe.",

You\u2019d think Georgia would just be a short sprint school, but it\u2019s not.\n\nWhat was your experience in Paris like on your first senior national team?\n\nI was nervous, but I wasn\u2019t really nervous because I know I have more chances to make Olympic teams. It was a learning experience for me to know what to do when I go again to another Olympics. I was learning from other people that are professionals and have been there and done that before, getting to know them and getting advice, and getting that information so I can take it along all the way to the next Olympic Trials.\n\nWhen you come back to the NCAA this season, two of your biggest competitors in the collegiate scene this season [Bella Whittaker and Kaylyn Brown] were your teammates in Paris. Does seeing them up close and how they worked through relay camps and situations like that get you a little more excited for coming back home and going head-to-head against them this season?\n\nYes, I definitely think we all can do something really special in the 400m. They\u2019re training together right now, and I know when we go head-to-head it\u2019s going to be something special.\n\nWe\u2019re here to announce your NIL deal with Nike. Could you talk a bit about what appealed to you about Nike and what has you most excited about what is to come from this partnership?\n\nI\u2019ve been a Nike girl since I was born and it\u2019s always been Nike for me. I\u2019ve never worn any other brands so when Nike came to me and wanted an NIL deal it was a no-brainer. Being with Nike, how they treat their athletes is really good and seeing what they do for their professional track athletes right now. I knew it was Nike all the way.",

In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite; the more popular a silhouette, the more likely is to receive some sort of retooling, reimaging or offshoot. It\u2019s why we were unsurprised at the top of last year to catch wind of the Air Max Plus Drift, a TPU-heavy offshoot of the Tn proper that later became a wider theme with the release of the Air Max 90 Drift.\n\nWe wondered aloud whether additional Air Max models would join those two in changing shape, something that still hasn\u2019t come about, but one of those standard bearers is marching on with a chaotic new colorway. It\u2019s an inherently clashing palette atop the mechanized model, blending neutral notes of black, cream, brown and grey on the foundation and TPU extensions at the quarter.\n\nTwo accent shades play in the space in between, with aquamarine tonality taking over the Swoosh and two pull-tabs down the midline, while a yellow ribbon weaves throughout the profile to match the vamp Air Max branding. Buying any pair of the Nike Air Max 90 Drift requires a love for the unconventional, likely making this half-earthy edition a strength-on-strength sort of pair.\n\nLook for this Nike Air Max 90 Drift hitting shelves in the coming weeks, projected to carry its standard $160 retail price.\n\nAcross the hall in Beaverton, we\u2019re starting to see tangible 2025 Jordan Releases, including the Jordan 11 Low \u201cYear of the Snake\u201d and Jordan 5 \u201cEarth,\u201d both expected towards the end of January.",

Over the last two years, fans of the Tuned Air-laden model have been blessed with retros of OG colorways, like the Sunset, Voltage Purple, and Hyper Blue, with the latter also joining a new variant to the Air Max Plus family in 2025. Alongside the Sunset colorway, the Air Max Plus Golf will launch in the Hyper Blue colorway.\n\nOn its base, the sneaker retains its mesh base, with a blue gradient color scheme that transitions from a light blue near the toe and tongue down to a darker blue near the edge and heel. Wavy, black TPU overlays inspired by the palm trees designer Sean McDowell saw on his vacation in Florida are placed across the upper to help with durability, matching the black lace set, sockliner, and the top of the tongue tag. Like the OG Hyper Blue variant of the Air Max Plus, this pair retains its yellow pops along the Nike Air logo on the tongue, the midfoot Swoosh, and the Tuned Air logo on the insole and heel.\n\nNike Air Max Plus Golf Hyper Blue\n\nThe midsole is slightly different from the standard Air Max Plus. Instead of the traditional tooling, the Air units near the forefoot, which are yellow on this pair, resemble those found on the Air Max Plus Ultra. However, the same white foam midsole and blue TPU shank remain. Finishing the sneaker is the black rubber outsole with a spikeless, course-ready traction pattern engineered for the greens.\n\nThe Nike Air Max Plus Golf Hyper Blue will release on January 24, 2025, through Nike and select Nike Golf retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $185. Download the Sole Retriever mobile app to stay updated on the latest releases, raffles, news, and more in the sneaker and streetwear world.",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nThe Nike-Doernbecher partnership, a sneakers-meets-cancer-care initiative that\u2019s raised nearly $50 million dollars over its lifespan, is ringing in its 20th anniversary in just a few days\u2019 time. While the requisite Air Jordan model arrives as a part of the capsule, so too does a range of the Swoosh\u2019s latest offerings. When it comes to basketball shoes, there\u2019s no better representative of their recent chapter than the Nike Sabrina 2, the choice for 9-year-old osteosarcoma survivor Sophia Jenkins.\n\n\u201cHappy go-lucky\u201d is the term attached to Sophia by her care team at Doernbecher, and clearly the guiding principle across her version of the Sabrina 2. Look to the sole unit for proof; smiley faces, hearts and flowers adorn the underfoot section, with some clever branding inserted via a Swoosh mouth. Some of Jenkins\u2019 favorite keepsakes also make appearances, with Nike recreating the print from her favorite fuzzy blanket on the sock-liner and planting her favorite pickle stuffie on the vamp.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s hard not to feel the love that went into this design, owing in no small part to the dominant purple and pink tonality that defines this shoe. We finish with a truly one-of-a-kind touch: each pair of Sophia\u2019s Sabrina 2 from the Doernbecher 20 collection comes with a friendship bracelet kit, reflecting Jenkins\u2019 love for Taylor Swift and the hobby\u2019s synonymous status in the fandom in the wake of the Eras Tour.\n\nThe Sophia Jenkins Nike Sabrina 2 \u201cDoernbecher\u201d drops via SNKRS on January 23rd, the same day all the pairs from this year\u2019s collection will land. Be ready for a $130 retail price upon arrival.\n\n1 of 11\n\nAdditional Retailer Images",

            "content": "Nike plans to launch new running shoes this year.\n\nIn 2024, Nike trailed competitors like ASICS and Adidas in running-shoe launches.\n\nBMO analysts are optimistic about Nike's 2025 lineup despite past performance challenges.\n\nNike's shoe competitors were on a tear in 2024, so expectations are high for the sportswear giant this year.\n\nData from BMO indicates most footwear brands launched at least six shoes in 2024. ASICS, Adidas, Brooks Running, and Hoka led the way in running-shoe launches, but Nike had fewer than six.\n\nAs part of its moves to improve sales, Nike is getting back to basics. That includes redefining itself as a running brand. To keep up with the competition, it will have to prove that in 2025.\n\nAccording to BMO, ASICS launched new models or updated performance running models 11 times last year, while Adidas and Brooks launched or updated 10 and nine models. Nike only updated its running shoe lineup and released no new models.\n\nNike has said it will launch the Pegasus Premium in late January and the Vomero 18 in late February. It said the Vomero Plus, the Vomero Premium, and the new Structure model would come \"later in 2025.\"\n\nRetail analysts at BMO say that with this running lineup, Nike's launch schedule in 2025 \"looks more promising.\" Its new product line received a positive response from consumers and industry watchers when it was announced at The Running Event, a trade show held in November.\n\n\"We believe NKE's inflection is a question of 'when' compelling product begins to roll in rather than 'if,'\" BMO analysts wrote.\n\nBrands like On Running and Hoka have been growing in popularity over the past few years. Brooks said this summer that it reached a quarterly revenue record, adding that its North American sales in the second quarter grew by 19%.\n\nIn October, Nike brought a veteran employee, Elliott Hill, out of retirement to take over as CEO, and he has his work cut out for him. Revenue for the Nike brand grew by only 1% in the latest fiscal year, dragged down partially by declines in North America.\n\nThe company has acknowledged that it will take time to see its desired results.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time, but we see early wins \u2014 from momentum in key sports to accelerating our pace of newness and innovation,\" Matthew Friend, Nike's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said during its first-quarter earnings call.",

            "content": "A swoosh appeared at the World Junior Championships in the Philippines this week.\n\nAdhered to the rail halfway up Sierra Kerr\u2019s JS Industries tractor, the Nike logo designed in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student at Portland State University who received a measly $35 for her now-iconic swoosh (and later stock options), marks the return of the footwear giant to surfing after a multi-year long hiatus.\n\nFollowing ABG\u2019s licensing beef with Liberated Brands, which had major implications for brands: Volcom, Billabong, Quiksilver, RVCA + more, Volcom\u2019s star Gen Z talent has shifted Red Bull to the nose position as a mark of their strong support.\n\nNike, with whom Sierra has had a footwear partnership for two years, is now elevating her to their Global Athlete Roster and adding their iconic Swoosh to her board\u2019s mid-rail. Discussions are ongoing for her apparel sponsorship, however Volcom are reportedly still in the mix. We\u2019ll keep you posted on the wash up.\n\nWhen Nike first entered surfing in 2006, it seemed like an absurd pairing at the time. Nike stood for everything that was athletic and elite. Surfers, for the most part, still despised anything that might be perceived as either athletic or elite. The brand\u2019s failed attempt at making aqua socks a thing didn\u2019t help its street cred.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like outsiders coming into this industry thinking they\u2019re smarter than us,\u201d said former Billabong CEO Paule Naude in HSGP, recalling their first USD $750K gamble on a pubescent Kolohe Andino. \u201cThey wanted the youth to be the face of the brand,\u201d explained photographer and Nike staffer, Jason Kenworthy. \u201cNot the established guys like Andy, Bruce, Cory and Wardo, which I was initially apprehensive about.\u201d\n\nYou can deep dive into Nike\u2019s complicated 20-year relationship with surfing here. For now, let\u2019s focus on the present, and what this latest deal suggests about the industry\u2019s health and Nike\u2019s revised playbook.\n\nIn his 2025 Predictions podcast, NYU business professor Scott Galloway listed Nike, Intel, Boeing, and Target as prime candidates for acquisition or privatization, describing them as companies that have been \u201cbeaten up\u201d in the public markets. Simultaneously, private equity\u2019s capital has boomed, he notes, \u201cPrivate equity firms have almost $3 trillion in capital that they need to deploy. They\u2019re just going to go shopping.\u201d\n\nOver the past three years, Nike\u2019s market capitalization has declined significantly. At the end of 2021, Nike\u2019s market cap was approximately $263.55 billion. As of January 8, 2025, it stands at around $105.31 billion, representing a decrease of about 60%, making it an attractive target for private equity firms, who are in a strong position to pursue large-scale buyouts of these \u2018fallen angels\u2019.\n\nIn October 14, 2024, Nike appointed Elliott Hill as its new President and Chief Executive Officer. Last month, Hill announced his \u2018turnaround plan\u2019\u2013citing reigniting the brand\u2019s \u201cobsession with sport\u201d by prioritizing athlete-focused innovation, product segmentation, and bold marketing.\n\nWhile none of that screams \u2018pouring cash into surf culture will dig us out of this financial rut,\u2019 Nike\u2019s renewed focus on action sports and strategic athlete partnerships suggests a calculated effort to rebuild its brand beyond the track and field.\n\nBy backing emerging talents like Sierra Kerr and reentering the surf market with a (hopefully) revised playbook, Nike may be signaling its intent to reestablish credibility and tap into niche but influential communities. Whether this move proves to be a savvy long-term investment or another misstep remains to be seen, but it underscores the brand\u2019s willingness to take risks as a shadow of its former self.\n\nErgo: Just Do It.\n\nPer Nike\u2019s Brand of Athletes description, \u201cNike exists to serve the complete athlete, and shares their winning mentality.\u201d\n\nDecorated with winning the WSL 2023 World Junior Championships, ISA World Juniors, Stab High Lakey Peak (with the best full-rote ever documented by a female), and 4/7 events listed on the 24/25 QS calendar, all while releasing groundbreaking films such as \u2018Pre-Kerrsor\u2019 on the side, Sierra aligns perfectly with Nike\u2019s unapologetic quest to support cream talent.\n\nYou can read our Stab Interview with Sierra Kerr here.",

Of particular note is that the leather heel overlay, unlike its counterparts, is not stitched to the base. Instead, it hangs loose, supplying breathing room to the heat-applied midfoot Swoosh. Further details include hiking boot-esque rope laces with flecks of reflective material and a two-tone midsole. Three colorways of the design were shown in the feature, namely a mostly black version, a black-and-white version and a navy/white iteration.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be interesting if I could connect the midsole of the sample I tried directly to the upper, but it seems to be quite difficult,\u201d Fujiwara is quoted as saying. \u201cHowever, this first sample was comfortable to wear and was fairly well made. I feel like with a little more trial and error I could make something even better, but that\u2019s for another time.\u201d\n\nThough this pair won\u2019t see a retail release, you can check it out above. fragment design also recently linked with Nike for two takes on the Air Zoom Spiridon.",

The sportswear brand is resurrecting some serious Swoosh classics for 2025, including the Air Max Craze, Nike's wildly techy sneaker from the early 2000s.\n\nSpecifically, the Nike Air Max Craze debuted around 2001 as a cross-training sneaker, as branded on its rubbery, rugged toe cap. The sneaker's incredible design was anything but quiet, as several advanced details helped it live up to the \"craze\" name.\n\nThe Air Max Craze explodes with innovative tech, from visible Air windows in the chunky soles to the zipper \"lace\" closure similar to Nike's Air Max Sunder, another zip-tastic Swoosh shoe that recently got another chance at life. But this ain't a Sunder.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nThe Air Max Craze isn't a Air Huarache, either. However, it does have a heel strap detail like the Nike runner. Indeed, the biggest standout on the Nike Air Max Craze is its heel cage, which is quite literally the only part holding the shoe (and your heel) back from being another great mule-sneaker hybrid.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nEven still, with no real shoelaces and some slide-in appeal, the Air Max Craze can still easily pass as a slip-on sneaker. And so that's what it shall be!\n\nAdding to the retro fervor, Nike has prepared the sneaker in one of its OG colorways, a navy blue and orange color scheme known as \"Bright Citrus.\" Just a little something to get the OG Craze heads amped up.\n\nNike will also launch the reborn Air Max Craze in a spotless \"White/Gold\" color option, expected to land sometime in the spring.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nCollecting dust? Nah, Nike's archival models will continue to see more action this year. In addition to the Nike Air Max Craze, Nike confirmed the return of its dressy Superfly, Deion Sanders' Air Diamond Turf, and those wonderfully weird Aqua Turf water shoes.\n\nGather your coins, Nike lovers.

Some recent and upcoming colorways have been able to harken back to classics in Nike\u2019s archives, like the Forrest Gump and Mowabb renditions, and recall some of Book's interests, like hiking in Sedona. This theme of the great outdoors was also explored on previous Book 1s and will continue with the all-new Flagstaff colorway.\n\nPaying homage to Flagstaff, Arizona, the pair follows in the footsteps of the aforementioned Sedona pair in referencing a region of Arizona where Booker calls home during the NBA season as a member of the Phoneix Suns. We see a reworked construction, swapping out the usual canvas twill and leather for an all-over nubuck finish covered in topographic-inspired embroidery. This look, alongside the embroidery, comes in a single shade of fir green to reference the forests that surround the city.\n\nNike Book 1 Flagstaff\n\nContrasting the deep green shade is a white outlined Swoosh on the midfoot and the textile surrounding the topmost eyelet, the former working back to the heel tab that removes the usual book spine-inspired pull tab. Here, we find the phrase \u201cNo Service\u201d on the left pair and \u201cFlagstaff\u201d on the right, cementing the connection to the Arizona city. Like the Sedona pair, the tongue tag contains a custom mountain graphic depicting a serene sunset alongside Book branding and a nod to Humphreys Peak, the highest mountain in the state of Arizona. The tonal green rubber midsole finishes the design and is paired with a gum rubber outsole.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 Flagstaff will release on February 15, 2025, through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $140.

            "content": "Piper Sandler has recently shifted its stance on Nike (NKE), upgrading the stock from \u2018Neutral\u2019 to \u2018Overweight\u2019, with an increased price target from $72 to $90. This optimistic revision comes amid a backdrop of negative buy-side sentiment but is predicated on an \u201cintensified urgency\u201d from Nike\u2019s CEO, Elliott Hill, to address marketplace issues. The firm acknowledges the timing of this call might be premature, yet they see it as a precursor to a more tangible recovery narrative for Nike as the company approaches fiscal 2026.\n\nCurrently, Nike\u2019s shares have shown a slight increase, opening at $71.85 after closing at $71.29 the previous day, now trading at $71.91, up by $0.63 or 0.88%. Despite this modest uptick, the company, valued at a $105.45 billion market cap, has experienced a significant depreciation, losing over 32% of its value year-over-year. The stock\u2019s 52-week range indicates a low of $70.75 and a high of $107.43, reflecting considerable volatility. Nike\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio as of January 08, 2025, stands at 21.23, which, while not unusually high, suggests the market\u2019s expectation of future earnings growth considering the current stock price.\n\nThe all-time high for Nike\u2019s stock was $170.84, recorded on November 05, 2021, which underscores the steep decline the company has faced in recent years. This downgrade in stock value can be attributed to various factors, including supply chain disruptions, shifts in consumer behavior, and intensified competition within the sportswear sector.\n\nPiper Sandler\u2019s upgrade is based on the belief that CEO Elliott Hill\u2019s strategy to clean up the marketplace will pay off by making Nike\u2019s recovery story more evident to investors. This strategy likely involves streamlining operations, optimizing product offerings, and enhancing brand value to counteract the negative sentiment currently prevailing among investors. The firm\u2019s decision to raise the price target by 25% to $90 a share suggests confidence in Nike\u2019s potential to navigate through these challenges effectively.\n\nHowever, the market\u2019s reaction, with only a slight increase in stock price post-upgrade, shows that investors are cautious. The negative sentiment might stem from skepticism about the speed and effectiveness of Nike\u2019s turnaround strategy, especially in a market where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving and competition is fierce.\n\nThis scenario places Nike at a crossroads, where the execution of its recovery plan under Hill\u2019s leadership will be crucial. If successful, it could see Nike not only regaining lost ground but also setting a new course for growth. For investors, the current stock price and Piper Sandler\u2019s optimistic outlook might present an opportunity to buy into Nike at a potentially undervalued price, with the caveat of closely monitoring the company\u2019s progress in implementing its strategic initiatives.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Made in partnership with Hyperice, these boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain.\n\nRead more: These are the official CES 2025 winners, awarded by CNET Group\n\nThe innovative footwear, which we saw in person for the first time in Las Vegas, takes the idea of heating pads and compression socks as part of physical recovery for feet and calves and it makes that idea mobile. Instead of you being laid up on the couch with heating pads, or sliding into compression socks with no additional heating element, these on-the-go boots put heat and compression both into footwear that works on you while you walk around.\n\nWhat's more, buttons let you adjust the compression to your feet and calves as well as the amount of heat blasting into your weary muscles. There are three settings for each.\n\n\"You can definitely feel the heat in here,\" Eadicicco said as she walked across a demo room in Vegas. The boots massage and compress your ankles and feet, and in our test we could especially feel the heat around the ankles.\n\nWatch this: New Nike Boots Include Compression and Heat for Post-Workout Recovery 02:38\n\nThough the Nike x Hyperice shoes first debuted at the Paris Olympics this past summer, we jumped at the chance to try them for ourselves, as a preview of what's ahead in the space where electronics help with active recovery and not just with monitoring your vitals.\n\nThe boots are battery-powered and are intended to be used for both warm-ups and postworkout recovery. Nike says a \"system of dual-air Normatec bladders bonded to warming elements\" spreads heat evenly throughout the boots, aiming to warm the muscle and tissue in your feet and ankles.\n\nWithout testing them longer, it's hard to tell how effective the shoes would be as a workout warm-up or recovery system. But at first use, the features are definitely noticeable.\n\nThe shoes have Velcro straps, felt soft and comfortable to walk in, and for now come in a size range rather than individual sizes -- so men's size 10-12 for example. Nike is working on a consumer version to go on sale, but there's no word yet on when it'll launch or how much it'll cost.\n\nNike is also developing a compression and heat vest as part of the wearable line.\n\nFor more from CES 2025, check out the most innovative products from the show that you can actually buy now.",

Marc Graupera Aloma/Europa Press via Getty Images\n\nThe agreement was ratified by members at an emergency meeting called in December and has helped improve the club's financial situation.\n\nGuiu was one of four vice presidents and was in charge of marketing.\n\nDuring his time at the club he played a key role in bringing several new sponsors on board, including Spotify, who are Bar\u00e7a's main sponsor and have also bought the naming rights to Camp Nou.\n\nHis resignation comes as off field issues continue to make headlines at Bar\u00e7a, with Spain's sports ministry the Consejo Superior de Deportes (CSD) this week allowing temporary player registrations for Dani Olmo and Pau V\u00edctor.\n\nThe CSD's decision goes against ruling made by LaLiga and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), which said Bar\u00e7a had missed a deadline to prove they were compliant with financial fair play regulations (FFP) and could not register players for a second time in the same season.\n\nThe decision has been met with incredulity by LaLiga sides, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Las Palmas condemning the ruling, but sources said the saga has nothing to do with Guiu's departure.",

Most of these pairs have been worn by Booker on the court, with some, like the Forrest Gump, coming to retail. Joining the PE-to-retail train is the Book 1 Mowabb.\n\nInspired by the Nike ACG Mowabb, the silhouette directly translates the color palette used on this '90s model onto the Book 1, specifically the OG Twine colorway. Traditional construction for the sneaker is present, using a workwear-inspired canvas twill on the midfoot panel, perforated suede on the collar and tongue, and leather panels on the mudguard and eyestays. A sesame shade is present on most of the upper, with aqua-blue pops on the collar and tongue.\n\nNike ACG Mowabb Twine\n\nMore accenting hits are located on the Swoosh, which takes on a black finish and is outlined in bright mandarin, the mini Swoosh on the lateral toe, and the lace aglets. Back on the heel, we see a book spine-inspired pull tab resting above the dark green suede patch. The speckled rubber midsole finishes the design and is paired with a blue and black rubber outsole.\n\nThe Nike Book 1 Mowabb was released on March 1, 2025, and is available now through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. In men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $150.

            "content": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) \u2014 At least 100 trains roll through Arizona communities daily, often carrying valuable cargo. Valley rail expert Scott Jones says that makes them easy targets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really created a market for a lot of these gang organizations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says long trains with miles of cars are especially vulnerable to crime in what\u2019s become the Wild West.\n\n\u201cThey wait until the train gets out into a more desolate remote area where you have fewer law enforcement and people that could report any type of suspicious activity,\u201d said Jones.\n\nThis week, four people were indicted after being caught with nearly $50,000 worth of Nike shoes en route to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stores.\n\nAll were stolen from a BNSF train and hidden near tracks in the northern Arizona desert.\n\nThe frequency of these kinds of robberies has been on the rise over the past two years.\n\n\u201cJust bad people that want to do bad things and it\u2019s a money maker for them,\u201d said Jones.\n\nHomeland Security says it commonly involves transnational theft groups working throughout the Southwest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well planned,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWell-orchestrated.\u201d\n\nCourt records reveal how it usually happens, and it usually starts with thieves scouting out containers carrying high-dollar goods.\n\nOnce they find one with electronics, tools, and footwear, they hop onto the moving train and break high-security locks with saws and bolt cutters.\n\nThe criminals cut the train\u2019s brakes and signal control wires to complete their heist, causing an emergency stop.\n\nThe crooks decide when and where this happens, looking for places to remain undetected as they unload the loot, hide it in nearby fields, and brush.\n\nThose on the train communicate with accomplices in vehicles that act as surveillance.\n\nLater, box trucks come to pick up the merchandise and often take it to California to be sold online on Amazon or eBay.\n\n\u201cHow are they doing this? Is there somebody on the inside? I mean, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019d like to think not, but we don\u2019t know that,\u201d said Jones.\n\nJones says this is dangerous; Abruptly stopping trains can cause derailments and risk the lives of crew members.\n\nHe hopes these suspects are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and he\u2019s calling for added security measures and rail safety legislation to address this growing issue.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

The Mamba\u2019s sneaker legacy has carried on well since his estate re-partnered with Nike back in 2022 to revive the late athlete\u2019s iconic footwear line. In keeping with the spirit of Bryant\u2019s \u2018Protro\u2019 revivals (retros refitted with updated tech, a favorite of players across the NBA), the Swoosh has actually been fairly averse to out-and-out revivals of iconic Kobe colorways. They don\u2019t stray from the path entirely, but they\u2019re far more prone to exciting new makeups tied to the Mamba legacy. Starting this week, the brand kicks off the Year of the Mamba in style with a quartet of beautiful new colorways tapping into the spirit of Lunar New Year\u2014and harkening big things ahead.\n\nThe Year of the Mamba starts out with the Kobe 5 Protro in a special pair of colorways designed to commemorate the Lunar New Year. The wide release sees the silhouette wrapped in an eggplant purple upper with black midsole and translucent blue midsoles. What really makes it pop is the primary detailing, a gold snake wrapped around the entirety of the upper and finished in a textured snakeskin pattern. Purple and gold? Pretty good combo\u2013somebody should deck out an NBA team in those colors. China is getting an exclusive play on this colorway, which preserves the snake detailing and switches things up with a black sole and a vibrant red upper (perfect for the holiday) to play off the gold snake.",

            "content": "Like an athlete going through a slump, Nike (NKE -1.35%) finds itself at a critical juncture. The sportswear giant's shares have tumbled nearly 30% over the prior 12 months, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%) has delivered total returns of 27.5%, including dividends.\n\nDespite the sharp decline, Nike's stock still commands a premium valuation at 30.8 times forward earnings. Let's break down the athletic apparel giant's fundamentals to determine if this contrarian setup presents a buying opportunity at the onset of 2025.\n\nAn unmatched legacy in transition\n\nNike's dominance of the global sportswear market remains unrivaled, with a 16.4% market share, according to Euromonitor. This commanding position stems from decades of brand-building and marketing excellence since the company's founding in 1964.\n\nThe company's financial strength shows in its consistent dividend growth. Nike has increased its dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, with a robust five-year annualized growth rate of 10.7%. This performance puts Nike firmly in the elite category of dividend growth stocks.\n\nRecent missteps create an opportunity\n\nNike's recent challenges stem primarily from its aggressive push toward direct-to-consumer sales at the expense of wholesale relationships. This strategy backfired as post-pandemic shopping habits normalized and consumers returned to physical retail stores.\n\nThe company also stumbled in product innovation by overly relying on classic footwear lines, while competitors like On and Hoka (owned by Deckers Brands) gained ground in key categories such as running shoes. These setbacks contributed to declines of 8% in sales and 26% in net income during the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nFresh leadership charts a new course\n\nNew CEO Elliott Hill brings deep institutional knowledge from his 32-year tenure at Nike. His strategy focuses on rebuilding wholesale partnerships and revitalizing product innovation to reconnect with core customers.\n\nHill's planned investments in global sports partnerships target Nike's historical strength while implementing cost reductions in other areas. This balanced approach aims to restore the company's mid-teens operating margins through increased full-price selling and expansion in high-margin markets.\n\nMarket expectations and valuation\n\nNike stock commands a premium valuation at 30.8 times projected earnings, notably higher than the S&P 500's multiple of 21.7. This elevated valuation suggests investors remain confident in the company's strong brand equity and potential for margin expansion under its new leadership initiatives.\n\nThe company continues to prioritize shareholder returns through multiple channels. Its 2.08% dividend yield is well-protected by a conservative 46.6% payout ratio, offering investors steady income during the ongoing business transformation.\n\nNike has also maintained an aggressive capital return program, exemplified by its $1.1 billion share repurchase in fiscal 2025 Q2, demonstrating its commitment to creating shareholder value beyond dividends. Over the prior 10-year period, the athletic apparel company has reduced its outstanding share count by a healthy 13.5%.\n\nIs Nike stock a contrarian buy?\n\nWhile Nike faces near-term headwinds, its dominant market position, proven dividend growth, and fresh leadership create an appealing opportunity for patient investors seeking both income and capital appreciation potential. The company's renewed focus on product innovation and wholesale partnerships under Hill's leadership could catalyze a return to form, or as Hill noted in the fiscal 2025 Q2 press release, \"Nike being Nike again.\"\n\nHowever, the stock's premium valuation at 30.8 times forward earnings suggests investors might need considerable patience while the turnaround plays out. So, all things considered, Nike screens as a compelling watch list candidate at the start of 2025, but not exactly a must-own stock. For contrarian investors focused on dividend growth and multiyear turnaround stories, though, the athletic apparel giant offers an intriguing entry point despite its premium valuation.",

The 10K plan spans six weeks, and the half marathon plan includes 12 weeks of instruction.\n\n\u201cGetting athletes to the starting line knowing that their coach believes in them is the best race day preparation,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI am so excited to be part of this journey where I have the opportunity to motivate and train an entire community of runners that maybe wouldn\u2019t have sought out a goal like this, and I get to be someone who helps them set and chase that goal and cross the finish line. To me, that\u2019s very humbling and fulfilling.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to race day, the Nike Run Club App will help athletes connect with friends and other runners through experiences and challenges in their neighborhoods and across the globe. The Nike Run Club App now provides with athletes localized tips before they head out and allows them to share their real-time location with friends and family during their run.\n\nNike is also enabling the full training journey and race day experience with the latest innovations and running essentials, which are purpose-built to help women train and compete at their peak.\n\nThe After Dark Tour begins April 12 in Sydney and concludes June 21 in Mexico City.

In what will hopefully kickstart a trend of more projects on the Air Max 90, British-Nigerian artist Slawn is slated to work on the silhouette, with images of two Slawn x Nike Air Max 90s appearing online.\n\nWhile retailer Asphalt Gold posted the two colorways with no branding or mention of Slawn being connected to the releases, Brendan Dunne of Complex reported that the artist was, in fact, the reason behind the wild redesign of the classic Air Max model. For those unfamiliar with Slawn, whose real name is Olaolu Akeredolu-Ale, the 24-year-old artist and designer first began to make moves as a teenager when he created the brand Motherlan with a group of friends, which caught the attention of the legendary Virgil Abloh. Later, he began to paint and showcase his work on social media, eventually gaining enough recognition that at 22, he designed the statues and sets for the 2023 Brit Awards.\n\nImages via Asphalt Gold\n\nAs for Slawn\u2019s two Air Max 90s, we see a splatter paint finish applied to the front half of the sneaker, which is relatively untouched compared to the back half. From the midfoot panel back to the heel, including the Swoosh, we see a molded and textured leather that appears almost handcrafted. A direct reference to one of Slawn\u2019s art pieces, Ugly Bastard, is found on the heel tab, replacing the usual Nike Air Text. Another detail unique to Slawn\u2019s AM90 is found on the top eyelets, in metallic silver on the Black pair and metallic gold on the Sail pair.\n\nThe Slawn x Nike Air Max 90 Pack will release in March 2025 through Nike and select retailers online and in-store.

            "content": "Nike is collaborating with Slawn, the irreverent British-Nigerian artist known for his bold characters and spray paint work, on two pairs of Air Max 90s that are set to release in March, sneaker industry sources tell Complex. Nike hasn\u2019t announced the project, but images of the collab circulated online this week.\n\nSneaker News unwittingly leaked the Slawn shoes on Tuesday, posting two previously unseen colorways of the Air Max 90 that were listed for sale online at German retailer Asphalt Gold. The store likely did not realize the Air Max 90 was a special project intended for a later release.\n\nNeither Sneaker News nor Asphalt Gold made mention of Slawn in their descriptions of the shoes.\n\nA close look at the details on the sneakers reveals their origin. The heel badges feature a Slawn-like face with long semicircular eyes. It\u2019s tough to make out from the Asphalt Gold photos, but the uppers on the Air Max 90s appear to feature Slawn drawings embossed on the leather. The shoes have redone mudguards, paint speckles, and imperfectly-shaped Swooshes on their uppers. The Slawn x Nike Air Max 90s come in black (style code FD6492-001) and white (style code FD6492-100).\n\nAt least one pair of shoes already made it out into the wild. On Tuesday, a YouTube user from the Netherlands published a barely-viewed video featuring the black Air Max 90. Like Sneaker News, the user did not make the connection to Slawn, but the clip shows the words \u201cAir Slawn\u201d written on the box in graffiti lettering.\n\nAsphalt Gold, no doubt realizing it accidentally previewed the first collaboration from an artist that\u2019s new to the Nike roster by posting the shoes early, has pulled the Air Max 90s from its website.\n\nNike and Slawn did not respond to requests for comment about the collaboration.\n\nWhile Nike hasn\u2019t made its partnership with Slawn public, there have been quiet signals pointing to their alignment. At Art Basel in Miami last December, Slawn spent time with Nike employees who work on the brand\u2019s collab product. He attended the pre-launch party for the Stash x Nike \u201cBlue Is Back\u201d pack at Concepts wearing the upcoming Air Max DN8, a 2025 shoe that Nike is in the early stages of building hype around. Weeks later, on Dec. 19, he posted a photo that appeared to show him on a conference call with Nike as part of a carousel on Instagram.\n\nUPDATE (02/27): Slawn has officially unveiled his two Air Max 90 collabs on Instagram today. Additionally, the artist announced the opening of a pop-up space at the Truman Brewery in London this Saturday, March 1, for his Air Max 90s. At the time of writing, a wider release for the project has not yet been announced by the brand.",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nBefore the Air Max 95, Air Max TL 2.5 and other bubbled icons became smash hits as casual lifestyle shoes, Nike\u2019s Running shoes were entirely meant for\u2026running. It\u2019s the crossover from track to street that provided the roots of what the Swoosh calls its Sportswear division, and as design and performance engineering became more and more technical, so did the shoes that were meant for the sport.\n\nRunning shoes of the modern day look nothing like the aforementioned Air Max classics. You won\u2019t find leather, suede, or mesh, but rather super-thin skin-like synthetics and state-of-the-art foams to keep the sneaker as light as possible. The AlphaFly 3 and upcoming Nike VaporFly 4 may be concept cars in sneaker form, but realistically, they look absolutely goofy when worn with anything but running shorts or tights.\n\nThat\u2019s why when Nike unveiled the Pegasus Premium in Paris last April, many sneaker media folks reported experiencing a visceral reaction. For myself, it was similar to the one I felt when I first laid eyes on the Air Max 93 at the Foot Locker on Roosevelt Ave. in Flushing decades ago.\n\nFull length Air will never not grab attention, despite various iterations coming to market. But the Pegasus Premium is different. It\u2019s not exactly a thick, fat bubble like you see in Air. It\u2019s not the first time full-length visible Zoom was done either (see: Air Zoom All Out Flyknit).\n\nBut the ergonomic shape, the choice in Total Orange, and the orange \u201ceye-liner\u201d to enhance the dimensions is all I needed to start budgeting for several pairs upon its retail arrival. Above the technical aspects, the Pegasus Premium brings us back to the era when wearing performance kicks was the preferred choice.\n\n1 of 9\n\nWhere To Buy The Nike Pegasus Premium\n\nOnto the brass tax: The Nike Pegasus Premium is set to release on January 30th, 2025. The pair pictured above reflects both mens and womens release, although they have different SKUs. Several colorways are also planned for Spring 2025 and on, including a grey pair with a full-length Zoom Air unit in Volt neon. According to an official Nike release calendar, the MSRP is expected to be $200.\n\nNike\u2019s Road Running Footwear Line-up\n\nThe Pegasus Premium is part of Nike\u2019s new Road Running Footwear Line-up category. Obviously under the Pegasus family, the top-level Premium version offers the utmost in Responsive Cushioning via the full-length Zoom.\n\nWithin each of these columns exist an icon silhouette, an elevated Plus option, and the super-powered Premium. As of now, only the Pegasus family has iterations on all three tiers. The below infographic best lays out how Nike\u2019s simplified structure can help you pick the right road running shoe.",

            "content": "As we begin 2025, Nike NKE shares have hovered near 52-week lows while Adidas ADDYY stock is not far from its highs. Surely, investors may wonder if a sharp rebound is in store for Nike shares or if Adidas stock can reach higher highs.\n\nThis makes it a worthy conversation of which iconic shoe and retail apparel company is the better investment at the moment.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhy NKE is Down and ADDYY is Up\n\nAttributed to what has been a constant need to revamp its product line, Nike is dealing with increased competition outside of Adidas from the likes of Under Armour UAA and New Balance. Correlating with such, slower sales growth and inventory issues have weighed on investor confidence.\n\nMeanwhile, Adidas has been able to capitalize on Nike\u2019s downturn by strategically increasing its product offerings. This has led to improved financial metrics for Adidas which has bolstered market sentiment.\n\nOutlook Comparison & EPS Revisions\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Nike\u2019s total sales are expected to decline 10% in fiscal 2025 to $46.34 billion compared to $51.36 billion last year. Fiscal 2026 sales are projected to stabilize and rise 1% to $47.11 billion.\n\nNike\u2019s annual earnings are currently slated to drop 47% this year to $2.10 per share versus EPS of $3.95 in 2024. That said, FY26 EPS is projected to rebound and rise 12% to $2.36. However, it\u2019s noteworthy that FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates have continued to decline over the last quarter and are noticeably lower in the last 30 days.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs for Adidas, its top line is expected to increase 6% as the company rounds out FY24 with total sales projected to expand another 10% in FY25 to $27.3 billion. Even better, annual earnings are now expected to climb to $2.15 per share in FY24 from an adjusted EPS loss of -$0.36 in FY23. More intriguing, FY25 EPS is forecasted to soar another 88% to $4.05.\n\nNotably, over the last 60 days, Adidas FY24 EPS estimates are up 4% although FY25 EPS estimates are slightly down.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Comparison\n\nTrading at $71 a share, NKE is at a 34.3X forward earnings multiple with ADDYY at $125 but at 30.9X. Still, both trade at premiums to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.1X and their Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry average of 14.4X.\n\nIn regards to price to sales, Adidas is more attractive as well with ADDYY under the optimum level of less than 2X while NKE is at 2.3X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDividend Comparison\n\nNike does have a clear edge as it relates to dividends with a 2.22% annual yield that towers over Adidas\u2019s payout of 0.19% and tops their industry average of 1.92%.",

However, a premium composition and .SWOOSH branding gives it a nice twist. The smooth leather upper dons a very dark gray and hosts not only the standard Swooshes, but a mini Swoosh at the midfoot of the lateral too. Plain Swoosh branding adorns the tongue tag while the heel tab sees a special \u201cSWOOSH AIR\u201d callout nod to the program. From there, the .SWOOSH logo hits the sockliner while a toothbrush-shaped accessory with \u201cYou missed a spot\u201d text rounds out the pair.\n\n.SWOOSH has not yet announced the release of its \u201cTriple Black\u201d take on the Air Force 1 Low. Stay tuned for updates as it\u2019s likely to arrive as a .SWOOSH member-exclusive drop later this year via the Nike SNKRS platform at a starting price of $130 USD.",

We\u2019re not saying, \u2018Have a good year.\u2019 We\u2019re challenging athletes to have a tough year, proving to themselves that they can channel Mamba Mentality to unlock their goals.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the collection is the Kobe 5 Protro \u201cYear of Mamba,\u201d which adds a forefoot Zoom Air unit and Protro midfoot foam to an iconic silhouette known for its combination of lightweight performance and standard-setting court feel.\n\nThese Nike Basketball innovations are paired with an iridescent \u201cEggplant\u201d launch colorway that provides a familiar, elevated look, complete with graphic references to Kobe\u2019s career and a nod to the Year of the Snake, inscribed in Mandarin on the tongue. An additional \u201cUniversity Red\u201d colorway will be available exclusively in China.\n\nA premium Kobe jacket leads the apparel collection, incorporating a satin-like material that protects against rain and a quilted interior that delivers comfort and warmth. An embroidered pattern on the back of the jacket pays homage to Kobe\u2019s five championships and the work it took to win them, with a snake entangling five rings and a call to Kobe\u2019s Mamba Mentality. Similar motifs anchor the T-shirt, crew and fleece pant that comprise the rest of the collection.\n\n\u201cWe know athletes are inspired to live and breathe Mamba Mentality, and this collection extends that mindset off the court with Kobe lifestyle apparel rooted in Nike Basketball performance,\u201d says Treniere Moser, Director, Kobe apparel. \u201cMamba Mentality doesn\u2019t stop when you leave the gym, and this collection is designed to reflect that tenacity in sport and life \u2014 helping athletes achieve their dreams during the Year of the Mamba.\u201d\n\nJoining the Year of Mamba apparel later this winter is the Details Collection, which is inspired by Kobe\u2019s ability to fine-tune every aspect of his game and make it better. From transforming the traditional on-court tear-away pant into a modern pleated look, to reimagining the classic shooting shirt as a dress, each piece in the collection takes something familiar and pushes it into the unexpected, reimagining the familiar material of basketball mesh and incorporating insider references to Kobe\u2019s career.\n\nFurther honoring Kobe\u2019s legacy and challenging the next generation to live by Mamba Mentality are the Kobe 9 Elite High Protro \u201cMasterpiece\u201d and Kobe VI Protro \u201cSail\u201d \u2014 beloved silhouettes restyled to meet the moment of today.\n\nTen years after its initial release, the Kobe 9 Elite High Protro has been updated with a contemporary React foam midsole and new traction pattern on the inside of the foot while carrying forward the Flyknit upper athletes know and love. The Kobe VI Protro, meanwhile, advances the silhouette\u2019s legacy with two new colorways: one honoring Kobe and his namesake NBA All-Star Game trophy with a star-studded upper, and another referencing a mamba shedding its skin.\n\n\u201cWhen you put Protros on, you know there are no shortcuts: The steps to success are right there,\u201d says Yim. \u201cYou have to enjoy the journey more than just the end destination. If you study the greats, you know what it takes to be great \u2014 and we\u2019ve channeled inspirations from one of the greatest to ever play into these Protro silhouettes.\u201d\n\nNike is also challenging athletes to embody Mamba Mentality through weekly workouts in the Nike App. Follow the Kobe Interest to see if you have what it takes.\n\nThe Kobe 5 Protro Year of Mamba silhouette and apparel will be available globally at nike.com and select retail locations January 9. The Kobe 9 Elite High Protro \u201cMasterpiece\u201d and Details Collection will be available February 8. The Kobe VI Protro \u201cSail\u201d will be available February 13.\n\n",

This has been the case with various models over the last decade-plus and will ring true once again with the Air Trainer Huarache. Following the recent three-pack of Corteiz colorways, including the Light Bone, Flat Pewter, and Black renditions, 2025 will mark the model's GR return.\n\nOne of the first colorways to hit shelves is the pictured Blue Tint iteration, which opts for a tonal blue finish across most of the silhouette. Suede panels grace the mudguard, perforated toebox, and the overlay that extends from the toe up to the collar and back onto the heel, all coated in a light blue. A secondary shade of blue is present on the neoprene internal bootie, tongue tag, and Nike-branded lockdown strap on the midfoot.\n\nNike Air Trainer Huarache Blue Tint\n\nThe strap is attached to a transparent TPU in a blue tint, outlined with light armory blue hues. To help differentiate the branding details along the tongue tag and heel, we see summit white make up the text at both locations. Below, the silhouette comes with a light army blue and summit white midsole paired with a tonal outsole.\n\nThe Nike Air Trainer Huarache Blue Tint will release in April 2025 through Nike and select retailers online and in-store.

            "content": "\n\n\n\nNike\u2019s recall of a line of shoes Opens a new window slammed by many consumers as racist has sparked major debate across America. \u201cThe controversy,\u201d according to the BBC Opens a new window , \u201chas reignited the anger at the heart of America\u2019s gaping political divide.\u201d\n\nFeaturing our nation\u2019s first flag, created by Betty Ross during the American Revolution, the sneaker was no doubt meant as a patriotic tribute that would be released in time for Independence Day.\n\nMany consumers, however, complained that the flag represents an era of slavery, with many quickly pointing out in the past that particular flag has been adopted by various extremist groups \u2014 including the American Nazi Party.\n\nWhile there has been significant support of the sportswear giant\u2019s withdrawal of the footwear \u2014 Nike said its decision to recall the sneakers was a result of \u201cconcerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation\u2019s patriotic holiday\u201d \u2014 there also has been vehement backlash from conservative-leaning consumers.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has even weighed in, saying he would make the first order if Nike changes its mind and re-releases the shoe.\n\nAs I watch Nike navigate yet another public and heated racism-related debate play out on social media and online (see: Colin Kaepernick-starring campaign that led many angry consumers to burn their Nike apparel), I wonder if such a public response could have been predicted in the first place.\n\nI may be biased with my pro-marketer viewpoint but I believe this whole ordeal illustrates why marketers should be more involved in product development.\n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t know the extent to which Nike\u2019s marketing team was clued in leading up to the release of the sneaker. Marketing may very well have had plenty of input and simply not connected the shoe to racist implications, but clearly nobody else at Nike did either (unless concerns were expressed and discarded).\n\nNevertheless, this controversy offers a textbook example of why in our digital world company leaders should consider incorporating a marketing focus in product development and management.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the data\n\nConsumer data is now at the heart of digital marketing and, as such, the best marketers now must be data-savvy.\n\nCrucially, the data we\u2019re primarily working with is consumer data, which means that beyond data expertise, marketers are also fast becoming customer experts.\n\nIndeed, to market successfully and effectively to consumers online, it\u2019s vital to know everything about them, from personal preferences, habits and behaviors, to their consumer journey and buy cycle.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many product managers who will disagree with my assertion that marketing departments are turning into the company\u2019s foremost authority on what makes their customers tick. After all, product teams are the ones who speak directly with users and elicit feedback.\n\nMarketers, though, are increasingly tracking every element of their operations \u2014 gathering and analyzing key consumer data, such as which specific messages are getting prospects over the line and which campaigns are resonating most, not only with their customer base but also with the wider public.\n\nWhether or not you agree with me, this is important data that can provide high-value insights to the product team on the market, competitors and prospective (and current) customers.\n\nIn Nike\u2019s case, for example, marketers may have been more sensitive to the fact that the company\u2019s customer base will be highly involved when it comes to race-related social causes and discourse.\n\nReducing friction\n\nAs most of us know, all too often marketers must manage friction and sometimes even combative relationships with other company departments. It usually reduces to differing priorities and goals across the various teams that also report to different executives.\n\nOne of the better-documented adversarial, inter-departmental dynamics in many organizations lies between marketing and sales. Slowly and surely, though, this is changing \u2013 finally \u2013 as business leaders realize that unifying the traditionally disparate data silos between these two teams leads to improved demand generation and conversions, faster sales cycles and better customer retention.\n\nThat same improvement in departmental cohesion now needs to make its way to marketing and product.\n\nGenerally, the main causes of discord between these two teams are:\n\nDifferent sets of success metrics;\n\nShort-term goals overshadowing the company\u2019s big-picture, strategic-level objectives;\n\nDynamics and relationship between marketing and product lack definition, which leads to indecision, gaps/overlap in functions, and sometimes even territorial disputes;\n\nLack of adequate communication.\n\nTo combat this friction, company leaders should consider the following improvements to the way their product and marketing teams interact:\n\nGet the two departments working together as early as possible in the product development process;\n\nIdentify and agree on the key roles and responsibilities of each based on specific skillsets and capabilities rather than an organizational chart;\n\nKeep clear lines of communication throughout and ensure transparency from both sides;\n\nDefine early which strategic success metrics are most important for all involved.\n\nUltimately, bringing marketing closer to the product development and management process not only will help businesses design better products and services, but can also help avoid potential Nike-like scandals.\n\nFinally, while loathe to contradict myself I admit that marketers are still liable to make stupid mistakes \u2014 after all, we are human \u2014 and fail to understand current political and social climates, as Alitalia showed us this weekOpens a new window .\n\nThe Italian airline suffered painful backlash for releasing a social media ad that featured a white actor wearing blackface to portray former President Barack Obama.\n\nYou\u2019d think a consumer expert, of all people, would know that blackface will never play well with audiences today. Go figure \u2014 and take it as a warning.",

The French luxury goods brand and the American sportswear giant wage trademark-centric claims against the Shoe Surgeon and its founder Dominic Ciambrone (collectively, the \u201cShoe Surgeon\u201d or \u201cdefendants\u201d) in their respective complaints, alleging that by making authorized use of their well-known marks, the Shoe Surgeon is likely to confuse consumers and damage their brands. While Goyard\u2019s lawsuit appears to be winding down, with a settlement in sight, the case waged by Nike is still underway.\n\nGoyard v. the Shoe Surgeon\n\nGoyard and the Shoe Surgeon appear to have resolved their clash over customized footwear. In the notice of settlement that it filed with a federal court in California on December 20, the French luxury goods brand revealed that it has reached a settlement to the trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition claims it has waged against the sneaker and apparel customizer.\n\nThe Background : Goyard filed suit against the Shoe Surgeon in June, alleging in a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that the Shoe Surgeon is on the hook for an array of trademark causes of action as a result of its sale of footwear, apparel, and accessories that it markets as being made with \u201cauthentic\u201d Goyard canvas. The problem, according to Goyard, is that it has \u201cnot verified [the trademark-bearing canvas at issue] as genuine.\u201d\n\nGiven that the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s sneakers and other offerings contain trademarks that are \u201cidentical, substantially indistinguishable, or confusingly similar to the Goyard marks,\u201d Goyard claimed that consumers are likely to be confused as to the nature/source of the goods \u201cat the time of initial interest, sale, and/or in the post-sale setting.\u201d The likelihood of confusion is compounded, per Goyard, by the defendants\u2019 \u201clegitimate collaborations with other famous brands,\u201d which could \u201csuggest to consumers that the defendants may have a legitimate collaboration with Goyard, when they do not.\u201d\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, Goyard set out claims of trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition, and is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.\n\nThe Shoe Surgeon\u2019s Response : In response to Goyard\u2019s suit, the Shoe Surgeon presented several defenses. It admitted that Goyard did not grant it an express license to use Goyard intellectual property, including its name and trademark-bearing textiles, but argued that no such license or permission is required for it to \u201ctruthfully claim to customize shoes with \u2018authentic\u2019 Goyard canvas material,\u201d particularly as \u201cthe clients for whom [it has] customized shoes with authentic Goyard fabric and others viewing those shoes are not confused about any connection with Goyard.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the sneaker customizer maintained that its bespoke services, aimed at individual clients, are not likely to confuse consumers about whether it has any affiliation with Goyard. Beyond that, the Shoe Surgeon asserted that its use of Goyard\u2019s materials is artistic, as it enhances the aesthetic of client-owned shoes without competing with Goyard\u2019s products, and is not commercial in nature.\n\nStill yet, the defendants argued they they should be shielded from the claims in Goyard\u2019s lawsuit since the \u201caccused customization services [are] performed using authentic Goyard bags purchased directly from Goyard\u201d and thus, \u201camount to a resale and/or use by the first purchaser.\u201d\n\nNike v. the Shoe Surgeon\n\nDespite a pending settlement with Goyard, the lawsuit that Nike waged against the Shoe Surgeon, which centers on the trade dress of its \u201ciconic\u201d Air Jordan 1, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 3, and Air Jordan 4 silhouettes, is still playing out before a federal court in New York.\n\nThe Background : In the case that it lodged, Nike accuses the Shoe Surgeon of constructing \u201ca multifaceted retail empire built around the unauthorized use of [its] trademark rights and the associated goodwill that [it has] spent decades accruing.\u201d Nike asserts in the complaint, which it filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in July, that the defendants have engaged in an \u201cegregious display of widespread infringement that has even crossed into willful counterfeiting of iconic Nike products.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Nike claims that the Shoe Surgeon\u2019s business is built around customized footwear, which the defendants either create \u201cfrom scratch\u201d or by \u201cmodify[ing] and offer[ing] for sale large quantities of [otherwise authentic] Nike-branded products.\u201d Additionally, the defendants enter into \u201cNike-focused collaborations with other rights holders using Nike\u2019s intellectual property, [and] ink digital rights agreements based on Nike trademarks,\u201d Nike maintains.\n\n\u201cTo make matters worse,\u201d Nike argues that the defendants \u201care engaging in all of this behavior while falsely leading consumers to believe that Nike is affiliated with their businesses or has otherwise authorized their conduct.\u201d In reality, Nike states that it \u201chas not authorized any of [the] complained-of conduct, and this conduct \u2013 coupled with the false air of credibility the defendants are intentionally creating \u2013 is likely to cause and is already causing confusion in the marketplace that the parties are associated, when they are not.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Nike sets out claims of direct and contributory trademark infringement, counterfeiting, unfair competition and false designation of origin, and trademark dilution.\n\nThe Shoe Surgeon\u2019s Response : The Shoe Surgeon and Chambrone filed a lengthy answer and counterclaims in November, in which they highlight a history of collaborations with Nike and allege wrongdoing on the part of the Swoosh. The Shoe Surgeon alleges that Nike not only commissioned its services for high-profile projects, but also used their expertise to shape its own customization ventures, including the launch of its \u201cNike By You\u201d service, all while failing to pay for their services.\n\n\u201cIndeed, starting back in 2017, Nike fostered a relationship with the Shoe Surgeon to find out what had made this \u2018humble self-taught cobbler\u2019 into the pioneering shoe-customizer and go-to artist for celebrities,\u201d the Shoe Surgeon asserts in its filing. At the same time, the Shoe Surgeon alleges that that Nike \u201creached out to [it for] over a dozen projects and collaborations over the last seven years,\u201d including with \u201crequests for which Nike indicated it would pay but ultimately failed to pay.\u201d Nike \u201cstrung the Shoe Surgeon along not only as to payments that never came,\u201d the company contends, but also as to \u201ca potential relationship for future projects between Nike and the defendants.\u201d\n\nIn addition to lodging an unjust enrichment cause of action against Nike as a result of such alleged payment failures, the Shoe Surgeon sets out a defamation and/or trade libel cause of action against Nike after the sportswear co. \u201claunched a public smear campaign against it, falsely accusing the company of manufacturing counterfeit products.\u201d Still yet, the Shoe Surgeon is seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity/cancellation for functionality for all thirteen of the trade dress registrations that Nike relies on in its suit.\n\nThe case is Nike, Inc. v. S2, Inc. d/b/a The Shoe Surgeon, et al., 1:24-cv-05307 (SDNY).",

The original design was made popular by French-based running brand SATISFY and has been known to be called MothTech\u2122. Following the reveal of Nike\u2019s new shirt, SATISFY caught wind of the product and has taken to social media to clarify that the shirt is not in fact a collaboration between them and the Swoosh. In a post on LinkedIn, the company responds the Nike lookalike stating, \u201cWe were surprised to see a product from Nike surface that closely mirrors our distinctive design. To clarify, SATISFY has no involvement in this project. The design appears to draw heavily from our signature MothTech\u2122 aesthetic, which is disappointing to see from a major corporation known to defend its own image and intellectual property so fiercely.\u201d\n\nThe company goes on to explain how founder and creative director Brice Partouche came up with MothTech\u2122, \u201cIt represents the genesis of SATISFY\u2019s DNA. It crystallizes the intersection of culture, performance, and functionality, serving as the foundation for our disruptive approach to redefining running culture.\u201d They added, \u201cOur designs resonate with runners seeking gear that meets their performance needs and reflects their identity, challenging the status quo. We\u2019re grateful to our community for their vigilance and unwavering support as we continue to push the boundaries of running culture together.\u201d Nike\u2019s new running shirt has sparked a debate online with some calling for SATISFY to be recognized and other running enthusiasts claiming that holes in shirts for ventilation is not new technology and that Nike has done so in the past.\n\nTake a look at the full statement below.",

            "content": "We came across a long thesis on Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) on ValueInvestorsClub by ThinkAnew. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on NKE. The company\u2019s shares were trading at $83.56 when this thesis was published, vs. closing price of $73.31 on Jan 3rd.\n\n\u00a9 https://sgbonline.com/\n\nNike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world, with the primary activity of designing, developing and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Footwear generates around two-thirds of total revenue, featuring renowned brands like Nike, Jordan and Converse.\n\nDespite recent struggles and a 20-year history of flat operating margins, the author believes that Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) represents an attractive investment opportunity. The bull thesis is primarily centered around the company\u2019s scale, history and wide network of partner athletes \u2013 while it is undeniable that NKE operates in one of the most competitive industries in the world, the author believes that the company\u2019s scale allows it to invest billions of dollars annually to be around the best athletes in the world and appear at the most popular sport events. This allows NKE to remain in the spotlight and create never-ending demand year after year (an amazing stat: three-quarters of NBA players wear either Nike/Jordan brand and half of the 2022 FIFA World Cup players wore Nike uniforms). Consequently, the company should be able to continue to sign up the majority of the best athletes within every generation, as long as management doesn\u2019t mess up the execution.\n\nThe author also believes that NKE has made good progress in addressing past mistakes, such as benevolently giving up space at the largest retailers like Foot Locker to focus on direct-to-consumer distribution. This has led to more consumer attention towards competing brands, but management has already revised this policy, which should positively impact demand for NKE brands. Another potential catalyst for NKE is the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both happening in the US, which could bring unprecedented attention and advertising opportunities for NKE. All in all, the author estimates FY2030 EPS of $6.20-$6.30, which coupled with a target forward P/E of 20.0x, yields a target price of $125.00, or 70% upside to be realized over the next 5 years.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NKE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

It had received critique from some \u2014 including an in-person spat with industry veteran Brandon \u201cBimma\u201d Williams \u2014 for what was perceived to be an uninspired colorway. This new patent leather pair, and the potential release of the aforementioned croc style, should be more than enough to satisfy those looking for a more pronounced design.\n\nAccording to sneakermarket.ro, the new Lil Yachty x Nike Air Force 1 Low \u201cLucky Green\u201d is expected to be released during summer 2025.

The Nike Pegasus Premium sits at the top of Nike\u2019s Pegasus range and is a very different shoe to the Nike Pegasus 41 and Nike Pegasus Plus, mostly thanks to the wild midsole design that contains three different materials.\n\nThe high stack and combination of materials create a bouncy and enjoyable ride and the Pegasus Premium is the springiest Pegasus I\u2019ve ever tested, but this bounce is undermined by the weight of the shoe, and it\u2019s also quite unstable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it\u2019s fun, and a great-looking shoe you can also wear casually, the Nike Pegasus Premium doesn\u2019t match the performance of the best running shoes. In my Nike Pegasus Premium review I\u2019ll explain why and compare it to the best Nike running shoes and alternatives I\u2019ve tested from other brands.\n\nNike Pegasus Premium review: price and availability\n\nNike Pegasus Premium\n\nThe Nike Pegasus Premium is due to go on sale on 30 January 2025 and will cost $210 in the U.S. and \u00a3185 in the U.K., making it considerably more expensive than the other Pegasus shoes in Nike\u2019s range. The price is in line with top max-cushioned shoes like the Asics Superblast 2 and Hoka Skyward X.\n\nNike Pegasus Premium review: design and fit\n\nThe Nike Pegasus Premium will launch in the \u2018Airscape\u2019 color I tested, with other colors sure to follow. The shoe has a very high midsole stack of 45mm at the heel and 35mm at the forefoot, keeping the same 10mm drop that you have on the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus.\n\nI found that the shoe fit me well in my normal running shoe size, which is the same size I use for the other Pegasus shoes and have done with all Nike shoes for years. Given the high stack on the Pegasus Premium it isn\u2019t a surprise that it\u2019s a heavy shoe \u2014 at 11.6oz in a men\u2019s size 10 it\u2019s over an ounce heavier than the Pegasus 41, and 2.5oz heavier than the Pegasus Plus in my size.\n\nUpper\n\nNike Pegasus Premium\n\nThe Pegasus Premium has an engineered mesh upper with plenty of padding around the collar. The tongue is also well padded, which increases the step-in comfort of the shoe but might make it feel a little hot if running in warm conditions. It was breathable enough for my use in the UK winter though, and overall I found the upper comfortable throughout my testing, with no rubbing or hot spots.\n\nMidsole\n\nNike Pegasus Premium\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNike has thrown everything at the midsole of the Pegasus Premium, which contains three different materials. The top layer is ZoomX foam, which is the springy, lightweight material used in the Nike Alphafly 3 and Vaporfly 3 racing shoes.\n\nThen you have a full-length Air Zoom unit, which is the main innovation in the Pegasus Premium. Nike has used Air Zoom pods in other running shoes for years, but this is the first time a full-length unit has been put into a shoe, and it delivers a highly-responsive ride feel with the Pegasus Premium.\n\nUnderneath the Air Zoom unit there is a layer of ReactX foam running from the heel to the midfoot of the Pegasus Premium. This is likely there to protect the softer foams above and add some more stability to the shoe, which is needed because the high stack and narrow midfoot on the Pegasus Premium does compromise its stability.\n\nOutsole\n\nNike Pegasus Premium\n\nThere is a long cutout on the bottom of the Pegasus Premium which shows off the Air Zoom unit, but the key impact zones on the shoe are covered with a layer of rubber. During my runs in wet conditions the shoe has gripped well, and I don\u2019t expect any problems with the outsole\u2019s durability.\n\nNike Pegasus Premium review: running performance\n\nI\u2019ve tested all three Nike Pegasus shoes in the current line-up and the Pegasus Plus is a natural step up on the Pegasus 41, with a similar design but a better foam in the midsole that makes it lighter and more responsive.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nike Pegasus Premium is, however, something very different to the other two shoes in the Pegasus stable. It\u2019s more akin to max-stack cruisers from other brands like the Hoka Skyward X or Brooks Glycerin Max, and offers a fun and bouncy ride that adds enjoyment to easy runs.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly the springiest Nike Pegasus shoe I\u2019ve tried, and it has a lot more foam underfoot than the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus. This is especially noticeable under the forefoot on the run. The Pegasus 41 and Plus sometimes felt a bit flat to me there, and aren\u2019t as comfortable as shoes from other brands with lower drops and higher forefoot stacks, but there\u2019s certainly no lack of comfort with the Pegasus Premium.\n\nNike Pegasus Premium\n\nAll that foam underfoot does come with two considerable drawbacks though. The first is the weight. Even for a high stack shoe, the Pegasus Premium is heavy \u2014 it\u2019s much heavier than the Asics Superblast 2, and also weightier than the Hoka Skyward X and Brooks Glycerin X, and this makes it harder to enjoy faster runs in the Pegasus Premium.\n\nAlso, most high-stack cushioned shoes I\u2019ve tested have a wide base to make them more stable, including the Hoka and Brooks shoes mentioned above, but this isn\u2019t the case with the Pegasus Premium. It has a narrow pinch-point at the midfoot and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stable shoe \u2014 even as a neutral runner I could feel my foot rolling inwards sometimes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Nike had made the shoe wider it would have been even heavier, so the Pegasus Premium might be stuck between a rock and hard place on that front. If you\u2019re a neutral runner and running on flat surfaces then the instability shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but if you need any extra support then I\u2019d probably avoid the Pegasus Premium.\n\nShould you buy the Nike Pegasus Premium?\n\nWhile the Nike Pegasus Premium is a fun shoe and I\u2019m interested to see where Nike takes the Air Zoom tech in its midsole next, it\u2019s not one I recommend to most runners. The combination of the high price, heavy design and instability mean that there are better options available, so unless you really love the look of the shoe and want to use it for general use as well as running, I\u2019d look elsewhere.\n\nThe Asics Superblast 2 is the most versatile max-stack shoe I\u2019ve tried, and brilliant for easy, hard, short and long runs alike, while the Hoka Skyward X offers a bouncy, enjoyable ride for easy runs while being more stable than the Nike Pegasus Premium.\n\nWithin Nike\u2019s own range the Pegasus Plus is a more versatile daily trainer, if less comfortable, while the Nike Zoom Fly 6 is a fantastic plated super-trainer I love doing all types of run in. The standard Pegasus 41 is a better option for new runners thanks to its stable and protective design, and relatively low price.",

            "content": "Complex\u2019s \u201cSneaker of the Year\u201d panel is the biggest conversation on the sneakerhead calendar. Each year, at the ComplexCon convention, Joe LaPuma and a panel of notable guests talk through Complex\u2019s draft \u201cBest Sneakers of the Year\u201d list, invariably arguing about unwarranted inclusions, unfair snubs, and various side issues. It can get surprisingly testy, and this year, that was more true than usual.\n\nThe rapper Lil Yachty arrived late to the stage, having landed late at Vegas, bringing his immense passion for and knowledge of sneakers, but also a chip on his shoulder. In 2024, Yatchy had finally got a Nike deal, and slowly been teasing his collaborative Air Force 1 sneakers, which were released in late 2024. The online response hadn\u2019t been entirely positive.\n\nHe\u2019d been allowed to collaborate on one of the most iconic sneaker silhouettes of all time, and given that free reign, he\u2019d made an almost all-white pair with a deep navy sole and lining. From the photos, at least, this limited, collaborative pair looked a lot like the general release pairs you see sitting on sale on JD Sports shelves, and the sneaker internet mocked him for this \u201clazy collaboration.\u201d One of the people pointing this out had been former sneaker-industry insider Bimma Williams, who was in the ComplexCon audience, and Yatchy lashed out at him on stage, calling him a \u201cdick sucker,\u201d among various other less than eloquent remarks.\n\nThis moment eroded much of my goodwill toward Yatchy \u2014 an otherwise humble, curious, pleasant-seeming person \u2014 but having tried his shoes, I understand why he was so defensive. I had never intended to own a pair, but a sneaker collector friend, Kevin Gerdes \u2014 whose total collection is worth six figures \u2014 had told me they were his favorite pair of the year. And with a recommendation like that, I had to get a pair, and I\u2019m glad I did.\n\nYes, they are a subtle pair of shoes \u2014 white with navy \u2014 but the materials and details make all the difference. Rather than the sheer bleach white of retail Air Forces, this is an ever so creamier, off-white shade; the navy is this deep French navy, and the leather is of a far higher quality than most modern Air Forces, which typically use a heavily lacquered leather, which creases easily. No, it\u2019s not a bold design. Yet it looks exactly like the cool subtle pairs you\u2019d see in early 2000s East Coast hip-hop videos. The details \u2014 like the original Air Force 1 dubree and the leather tongue tag \u2014 make it seem well thought out and authentic, and you can feel the passion in their design.\n\nThey won\u2019t draw attention and get hype, but that\u2019s not their point. They\u2019re a celebration of \u201cif-you-know-you-know\u201d sneaker culture, and wearing cool, well-made, detailed shoes; and it\u2019s one of the rarer Nike releases of last year, with Europe notably only receiving around five thousand pairs through Nike\u2019s SNKRS app. Best of all, because they\u2019re not hyped up, they\u2019re still available on the reseller marketplaces for about $150.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those shoes that don\u2019t work from the photos, yet it\u2019s easily one of my favorite sneakers of 2024. I can\u2019t wait to try his next pair.",

Indeed, the participating athletes, such as Simone Biles and LeBron James, were at the pinnacle of their respective sports. Both the Americans took their team to the top and secured Olympic gold medals. While they were at their peak moments in the coveted event, it was also a proud time for many people associated with them.\n\nAnd guess what? It was also a big moment for their shoe designer, who was behind the shoe that they wore at the coveted event. Indeed, that certain piece has its own story, and thanks to Nike for giving them the opportunity to get their design out there to two of the best athletes in the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSurprised to see Simone Biles and LeBron James wearing his design\n\nBack in 2021, Nike hired Logan Hickox as a design engineer. Eventually, his contributions to the brand led to his promotion to design engineer II. However, there\u2019s a lot more to shoe designing than what an average person thinks. As reported by Face 2 Face Africa, Hickox explained in an interview, stating, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a shoe, there\u2019s a whole world of science that goes behind it. In the Bowerman Footwear Lab at Nike, it\u2019s an innovation space. It\u2019s a thinker space.\u201d\n\nNike gave him the opportunity to bring in the big ideas, and he was never disappointed. Logan also revealed the way he designed different components, as he used a variety of CAD programs. Furthermore, he spilled his beans on the shoe giant, stating, \u201cAt Nike, prototyping is the name of the game, and what people don\u2019t see is that you might have one pair of shoes, but really, what went behind it was hundreds of designs.\u201d\n\nEventually, he was given another opportunity to contribute to the design of the Nike Air Max Dn USA. Yes, this particular shoe was worn by Team USA athletes like Simone Biles and LeBron James at the Paris Olympics, and he was just mesmerized by his accomplishment, revealing his emotions, he stated, \u201cSeeing LeBron James and Simone Biles, the GOATs of their respective sports, wearing some of the shoes that I designed, that was incredible.\u201d With this accolade on his resume, he thanked Nike for the opportunity and described how, with the right motivation, people can achieve many heights in their careers.\n\nvia Imago Simone Biles USA, AUGUST 1, 2024 \u2013 Gymnastics \u2013 Artistic : Women s Individual All-Around Final Balance Beam during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Olympische Spiele, Olympia, OS at Bercy Arena in Paris, France. Noxthirdxpartyxsales PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxJPN 263491864\n\nIndeed, Logan has had his own journey filled with challenges. He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida. However, his interest was much more in sports than in engineering. And eventually, he found himself in Nike with the right amount of hard work. Designing shoes for these big names must be exciting, isn\u2019t it? The market surely revolves around one, and even many athletes chase a dream of having a signature shoe to their name.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nA market that never dies down\n\nIndividuals have a unique passion for shoes. There are many enthusiasts who like their footwear designed by big designers in the world, and they would pay any price for it. And the marketplace for shoes is huge! However, only a handful of brands excel in their respective fields. Similarly, Noah Lyles, who is sponsored by Adidas, demanded his signature sneakers from the shoe giant after winning his career-first Olympic gold medal in the men\u2019s 100m sprint at the Paris Olympics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIndeed, the accolade was significant, marking Team USA\u2019s first men\u2019s 100m Olympic gold 20 years after Justin Gatlin. But did the brand listen to one of its major sponsors? Not really. Adidas wasn\u2019t interested in a custom Noah Lyles shoe, but it could\u2019ve been something to look out for shoe enthusiasts. It\u2019s not uncommon for shoe brands to create custom shoes for track athletes, as evidenced by the popularity of Michael Johnson\u2019s 1998 Nike Air Zoom JST. Indeed, it featured golden stripes over a black shoe, symbolizing the Olympian\u2019s career of winning only gold medals.\n\nWhat do you think about this move from the shoe giant?

This undoubtedly includes a host of best golf shoes in the game and, in our opinion, Nike make some of the best casual golf shoes and best golf sneakers for those who prefer a more street-like style out on course.\n\nIts apparel and footwear is seen on some of the world's best players including Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Tommy Fleetwood. The brand has plenty of styles including many inspired by its legendary street shoes including the Air Max. It has also shown a clear willingness to bring designs and technologies over from other aspects of the business, such as running shoes and basketball shoes. That way Nike continues to remain at the cutting-edge of golf shoe design not just in terms of looks, but in terms of performance. To help you choose which particular models are the right ones for you, here are the best Nike golf shoes on the market, ranging from some of the best spiked shoes, to more traditional and more street-styled silhouettes.\n\nWATCH: Dan Parker tests over 25 pairs of the best golf shoes to crown his 2024 winner!\n\nThe Quick List\n\nBest Nike Golf Shoes\n\nTop pick\n\n(Image credit: Golf Monthly)\n\nReplacing the Victory Tour 2 shoes, the newer 3 model takes total performance even further, getting 5 stars in our review. Why? Well looks wise Nike improved the aesthetics in several subtle ways - the new Full-grain leather upper has a supple feel and sophisticated look. I also absolutely loved the color I got sent and there are also several other colors to choose from, as well as special edition designs too for events like The Masters.\n\nComfort wise these are right up there with the best on the market thanks to the extra padding around the ankle, and the internal strap on the inside of the shoe which actually contours to your feet. Nike also stitched a Zoom Air unit directly to the upper which delivered exceptional feel, and the foam towards the heel felt very cushiony, almost bouncy when walking on the course.\n\nGrip and stability was also good, and the shoes are 100% waterproof as well. In short, I love this shoe and it covers all the bases to a very high standard. It may come with a pretty punchy price tag, but I really do think it is worth it.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Zoom Victory Tour 3 Golf Shoe Review\n\nBest spikeless\n\n(Image credit: Golf Monthly)\n\nWe love this recent trend of popular sneaker designs being made into golf shoes and the Pegasus from Nike is one of our favorites in this category. Our testing showed them to be a worthy addition to this guide because the blend of comfort and retro looks are as close to perfect as you'll find.\n\nThe underfoot cushioning was remarkably soft, while we also enjoyed the hidden Zoom Air unit in the heel which contributes to that springy feeling when walking down the fairway. The heel area does feel slightly higher than other golf shoes so this may take a bit of time to get used to, but this is only a minor point.\n\nThe rubber traction delivers superb multi directional grip on all types of terrain and the outsole will maintain a good grip when the ground underfoot is damp. That being said, we wouldn't want to use these shoes in the rain because of the suede elements on the shoe. The shoes may still be 100% waterproof, but I would recommend getting a spray protector for the suede areas. These are a fantastic summer shoe because in addition to being great for golf, you can wear them off the course too. In fact they are our favorite Nike spikeless golf shoe at the moment.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Pegasus '89 Golf Shoe Review\n\nMost comfortable\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Next% 2 is the next generation of golf shoe in the Infinity Tour line and is Brooks Koepka's shoe of choice at the moment. From our testing, it's no surprise that this shoe has also made it onto our lists for best golf shoes for walking and most comfortable golf shoes respectively.\n\nWhy you may ask? Well these are arguably the most comfortable golf shoe currently on the market. Straight out of the box, we tested the shoes on a 72 hole event, which may seem like we were set up for failure but we had zero issues. The Air Zoom unit really adds that 'cloud-like' feeling under your foot. The cushioned upper feels excellent and importantly these are all-year round shoes thanks to the waterproofing and 2-year guarantee.\n\nThe sporty look of the shoe will definitely divide opinion, it seems to have split the Golf Monthly team! But many will love it, the pops of green as well as the multi-colored sections on the bottom of the shoe really stand out and highlight the impressive technology on the shoe. Not to mention there are more and more colorways coming out of later which offer something slightly different each time.\n\nFinally it has added additional spikes in the forefoot, raising the total of spikes to six, which is two more than the previous Infinity Tour Next%. As a result the traction during testing was outstanding. Oh and these are 100% waterproof as well, making them one of the best waterproof golf shoes anywhere too.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour Next% 2 Golf Shoe Review\n\nBest looking\n\n(Image credit: Golf Monthly)\n\nThe Infinity Tour Next% is the choice of many golfers around the professional tours, it did indeed used to be Koepka's shoe of choice before the 2 above replaced it.\n\nHaving put these to the test on the golf course, we were impressed with how well these shoes fit and how comfortable they were. The design offers a sporty and modern aesthetic that has a profile that is akin to some of the best golf sneakers on the market. The black and white colorway maintains an understated and premium finish that makes it usable on most golf courses, to the point I think these might be some of the best looking golf shoes anywhere. But there are plenty of other options out there including the yellow pair Koepka was wearing at The Masters back in 2023.\n\nTaking them out on the course, the comfort was right up there with some of the most comfortable golf shoes on the market. The soft cushioning around the heel really felt nice and even when taking out of the box for the first time the comfort around the foot was excellent. They are very lightweight but this wasn't at the expense of stability because the two spikes on the forefoot and two on the heel deliver exceptional grip, especially when combined with the traction pattern on the outsole. The shoes are also waterproof and deliver excellent ventilation to your feet making them an excellent option to wear on the course in both summer and winter conditions.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour NEXT% Shoes Review\n\nMost snug fit\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nNext we have the Air Max 1, which has been updated for the world of golf in a number of ways. For example the synthetic upper has been made water-resistant, whilst the sole of the shoe has been given an update, with a new traction pattern providing more grip.\n\nStarting with that, in our testing we felt that there was ample traction in good conditions and the shoe performed well in slightly wetter weather. Obviously, these aren't going to rival the best spiked golf shoes and, given their sneaker-design, it's likely that you won't want to wear them in winter, as the '86 OG G is definitely more tailored to summer months.\n\nWe would definitely put these amongst the best sneaker golf shoes on the market as we love the subtle details, such as the paint splatter around the length of the sole and the iconic swoosh, which give the Air Max 1 '86 OG G a really premium aesthetic. Although the fit is snug, it does have a somewhat locked-in feel, but if it is possible to try the shoes on before buying them we would highly recommend that.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Max 1 '86 OG G Golf Shoe Review\n\nMost versatile\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPerhaps one of the best golf sneakers in the game, the Air Max 270 G shoe is a sporty and stylish option that can be worn both on and off the course. It comes in three different colorways with each delivering a clean and crisp aesthetic, that looks great paired up with some of the best golf pants.\n\nThe shoe certainly appeals to a younger audience, but there is no mistaking that it is great for those looking for more comfort too. it does fit fairly snug so you may want to order a size up if you want a non-restrictive fit. It is extremely breathable and offers up plenty of ventilation thanks to the mesh covering around the upper, which is water-resistant and easy to clean.\n\nAkin to many of the best spikeless golf shoes out there, the Air Max 270 delivers plenty of traction on the turf thanks to the rubber ridges and bumps on the sole of the shoe. We felt pretty stable in damp conditions and that also adds to the versatility of the shoe, which we felt could be worn in almost any situation, from the course to the shops.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Max 270 G Golf Shoes Review\n\nBest casual\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nA high-quality and stylish pair of golf shoes, the Air Jordan Low G Golf Shoes are built from genuine leather to deliver extreme comfort on the course. Their classic look pays tribute to the original Air Jordans, first released in the early 80s. But these have been re-designed for golf and feature encapsulated air in the heel cushions that make every step a joy.\n\nWhile the outsole has been adjusted to suit added grip on the golf course, it's still incredibly low profile. The adjustments on the outsole include a forefoot pivot circle, which offers extra traction on one of the most vital areas of the foot. We found no problems with grip in dry and damp conditions. That being said we certainly wouldn't wear these shoes in properly wet conditions, but the grip in damp morning conditions was impressive.\n\nWhile these shoes are designed for use in warmer conditions, they do also come with a 1 year waterproof warranty, which is a great addition as you can never predict when the heavens will open on the course. Ultimately, these shoes exist to look really good on - and off - the golf course with the comfort we had while walking was an added bonus. With that in mind, these are brilliant casual spikeless golf shoes and the color choice is excellent. The Pine Green finish is one of our absolute favorites.\n\nRead our full Nike Air Jordan Low 1 G Golf Shoe Review\n\nMost lightweight\n\n(Image credit: Nike)\n\nThe Nike Free technology has been used in the Tiger Woods 13 golf shoes and, for 2024, it returns, with the design of the shoe offering complete freedom of movement as well as a natural, flexible feel when wearing and walking.\n\nAesthetically, we think the Free Golf NN are a really good-looking pair of golf shoes, as the low profile and reflective details on the toe of the shoe really stand-out. What's more, it is available in a number of colorways, which means there should be a style or look for everyone.\n\nGrip-wise, they performed well for a spikeless model, but the main standout was the lightweight comfort, as the NN felt and moved like a running shoe, and didn't require any breaking in at all - they were comfortable straight out of the box. In fact these are some of the most breathable golf shoes on the market as well. Along with the comfort, it is very well made and also boasts a one-year waterproof warranty.\n\nRead our full Nike Free Golf NN Shoes Review\n\nHow we test golf shoes\n\nWe test out golf shoes very regularly because each member of the Golf Monthly team plays golf regularly as well. The procedure revolves around using the golf shoes over several rounds and in different conditions to test things like grip, stability, comfort and so on. We always test shoes for waterproofing too which either means playing in the rain, or pouring some water on the shoes if the weather doesn't deliver some dark clouds!\n\nOur ethos is to be as honest and insightful as possible in our reviews and guides so you are more informed. To learn about the products in great detail, we usually attend product launches and meet with the manufacturer\u2019s R&D experts to understand the new technology.\n\nThat isn't to say manufacturers can buy a good review though, because we tell it how it is for all golf product reviews, not just golf shoes.\n\nHow to choose golf shoes\n\nThere are a number of factors to consider when picking out your next pair of golf shoes especially if you have wider feet than others. Let's take a look at them.\n\nMeasurements\n\nObviously, you should start by knowing what size your feet are not just in terms of length but width too. Because shoe sizes often vary from brand to brand, you yourself knowing your feet size is invaluable to knowing which models to go for.\n\nSpiked or spikeless?\n\nNext up is to decide between spiked and spikeless. There is a mix of styles above but you should know that they have pros and cons. Spiked golf shoes offer better grip and stability but don't sit as low to the ground as spikeless models. Spikeless golf shoes offer off-course versatility but might not offer as much traction. Have a think about which factor is most important to you here.\n\nComfort\n\nOnce you know the right size to go for, and the type of shoe, comfort is the next factor to be aware of. If a shoe isn't comfortable, you aren't going to wear it so we recommend trying on different models before you buy.\n\nWhen you are trying shoes on, listen for a 'whoosh' sound which should indicate air leaving the shoe which usually suggests a good fit. Walk around in the shoes too so you can feel any pinching and whether your feet are moving around inside them. A correctly fitted shoe should so neither of these things.\n\nThis is important because if your feet slide around inside, or you get rubbing and blisters, you won't wear them again and they could damage your feet and performance.\n\nWaterproofing\n\nIf you have large, small, narrow or wide feet, waterproofing is always important. Us golfers are outside all day sometimes and that means the occasional bit of rain is inevitable sometimes and your shoes need to be able to deal with this. Therefore always check if a model is waterproof.\n\nStyling\n\nWe are sure you agree the models above show how golf shoe design is so diverse and different at the moment. Brands not only create traditional, classic-looking shoes, but also modern styles that can be used off the golf course too. Therefore it is important to think about what your shoes look like and what style suits you. Whatever you like or dislike, there is something for everyone these days.\n\nBudget\n\nFinally be aware of your budget because you can find a good, comfortable golf shoe for your wide feet at every price point. Speaking of which our guide on the best budget golf shoes houses our top picks in this regard.\n\nAdditionally for more golf shoe buying advice, read our guides on the best golf shoes for plantar fasciitis, best women's golf shoes, or best golf shoes for seniors.\n\nFAQs\n\nDo Nike still make golf shoes? Yes, and very good golf shoes at that. The brand stopped making hardware such as clubs and ball back in 2016, but continues to make market-leading apparel and shoes to this day.",

Earthy accents of brown find a home on the leather near the lateral toe and the eyelets.\n\nNike Air Trainer SC High LA Rams\n\nFurther contrasting shades and furthering ties to the LA Rams are found on the TPU eyelets, the tongue lining, and the nylon straps on the midfoot, all of which come in a Rams-friendly yellow hue. Final details on the upper include the white lace clashing with the navy tongue and the Nike logo outlined in yellow on the heel. Down below, the model comes complete with a white and navy foam midsole containing an Air unit in the heel paired with a navy, white, and yellow outsole.\n\nThe Nike Air Trainer SC High LA Rams will release in Fall 2025 through Nike and select retailers online and in-store.

Given his perennial all-star status, many of KD\u2019s sneakers have undergone All-Star Weekend makeovers. While we know that this year, the iconic Nike KD 4 Scoring Title will return right around the time of the NBA All-Star Game, the pair made in honor of the event will launch much sooner than expected.\n\nRecently debuted by Kevin Durant on the court, the pair comes with a graphic print depicting Kevin Durant on a 35-dollar bill alongside Nike branding and a multi-color gradient. Blue hues begin around the mesh on the toe and transition into an amalgamation of green, orange, and aqua-green/blue colors as you move back toward the heel. Contrasting this multi-color look are solid hits of color on the lace set, coming in pink, and on the branding details along the tongue and collar, both in black.\n\nNike KD 17 All-Star\n\nDurant\u2019s Easy Money Sniper moniker is also referenced on the upper, as his \u201cEEEASY\u201d logo is embedded into the graphic pattern and is found via a button on the lateral heel. Helping to reinforce the upper are TPU cages on the midfoot, which themselves are a call-back to the Nike Air Max Plus. Down below, the model has an orange midsole containing Zoom Air cushioning paired with a green rubber outsole.\n\nThe Nike KD 17 All-Star was released today, January 16, 2025, and is available now through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. In men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $160.

But other than that, there aren't many other details surrounding the Nike Terra Manta.\n\nWhen looking into the shoe, one quickly learns that the Nike Terra Manta brings together design cues from other similarly named, outdoor-ready models like the rare Off-White\u2122 Nike Terra Forma and ACG classic Air Terra Humara. However, this new Nike shoe doesn't really give me outdoorsy vibes.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nThe Nike Terra Manta instead looks a lot like the Nike Gato, a stylish skate-flavored terrace shoe that officially returned earlier this year. Add a hint of Field General vibes, too, for good taste.\n\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post. Enable All Media Manage consent Privacy policy\n\nEarly looks at the shoe also revealed a nice textural contrast on the uppers. The Terra Manta sneaker also flawlessly balances just enough sporty and casual flavors to be the next great flat-soled Nike sneaker.\n\nNike has even prepared the model in two cool colorways: tan and navy blue. Nothing too crazy but beautiful enough for a solid debut.\n\nAgain, there isn't much of information on the Nike Terra Manta. But here's what we do know: the shoes are expected to drop in 2025 and will reportedly retail for just $80, making it a smooth cop that's also easy on your pockets.\n\nWith official Nike pics already out in the world, it's safe to assume that these budget-friendly beauties will be before we know it.",

His interest in the field was sparked when he noticed flyers at his school promoting a meeting for students interested in robotics.\n\n\u201cYou have the notion that engineers might be of the nerdier type, or maybe they\u2019re not athletic, or they\u2019re not into theater, or whatever it might be,\u201d he said to the outlet. \u201cAnd especially as a Black man myself, not having seen that representation before, that was something that I was definitely apprehensive about at first. Being able to really push outside of my comfort zone and being able to see it\u2019s not just one mold that people fit, that was something that was super eye-opening to me.\u201d\n\nHickox attended the University of Florida in 2016 and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering five years later, his LinkedIn notes. In 2020, he further honed his skills through several internships, including a design internship with Nike.\n\nBy August 2021, he had been hired as a design engineer at the company and has since been promoted to design engineer II.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a shoe, there\u2019s a whole world of science that goes behind it,\u201d he explained to Fast Company. \u201cIn the Bowerman Footwear Lab at Nike, it\u2019s an innovation space. It\u2019s a thinker space\u2026 So for me, being able to design these different components, I use a variety of different CAD programs. At Nike, prototyping is the name of the game, and what people don\u2019t see is that you might have one pair of shoes, but really, what went behind it was hundreds of designs.\u201d\n\nHickox\u2019s design contributions include collaborating on the Nike Air Max Dn USA, which was worn by the U.S. team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n\u201cSeeing LeBron James and Simone Biles, the GOATs of their respective sports, wearing some of the shoes that I designed, that was incredible,\u201d he expressed.\n\nReflecting on his journey thus far, Hickox is both humbled and amazed by his accomplishments, yet steadfast in his mission to build a lasting legacy for the next generation.\n\n\u201cNever in my wildest dreams would I have thought I would be working with Nike world headquarters. The biggest thing that I want to leave behind is just the legacy of, \u2018Hey, you belong. Do you have opportunity here? Go chase it,'\u201d he said.",

Spoiler alert: Travis Scott still reigns supreme, dominating the list with four of the top five spots.\n\n2024 proved to be another banner year for SNKRS, with collaborations, reimagined classics, and innovative designs captivating sneakerheads worldwide. Let\u2019s dive into the breakdown of this year\u2019s most sought-after releases and the trends that shaped the sneaker world.\n\nTravis Scott: The Unstoppable Force\n\nTravis Scott\u2019s partnership with Jordan Brand remains the gold standard for hype collaborations.

These entries highlight the enduring popularity of Tinker Hatfield\u2019s iconic design.\n\nNon-Jordan Collaborations Steal the Spotlight\n\nThough Jordan Brand dominated the list, a few notable non-Jordan entries made their mark. The Nike Kobe 6 Protro \u201cItalian Camo\u201d brought a nostalgic yet bold energy, placing seventh. Meanwhile, the Futura x Nike SB Dunk Low claimed the eighth spot, drawing attention from skate culture and art enthusiasts alike.

The S&P 500 is in record territory, but that's not the case for this stock.\n\nShares of the sportswear giant last traded in the three-figure club in March 2024, but they've been in a downward trend since. They currently sell at 58% below their peak from November 2021 (as of Dec. 30, 2024).\n\nCan this consumer discretionary stock reverse course, rise 33% from its current $75 price tag, and get to $100 in 2025?\n\nA winning business\n\nNike controls 16.4% of the global sportswear market, according to data from Euromonitor. Adidas is in second place with a 9% share, showcasing Nike's commanding lead of the industry.\n\nThis kind of positioning doesn't happen overnight. Since its founding in 1964, Nike has risen up the ranks to become a household name with massive name recognition. The company's brand, supported by excellence in marketing and storytelling, has kept Nike relevant for decades.\n\nNike's brand has been a key contributor to its financial success. Revenue in fiscal 2024 (ended May 31) totaled $51.4 billion, 85% higher than in the same period 10 years earlier. Net income during this stretch soared 112%.\n\nThanks to consistent profitability, Nike has been able to return lots of capital to shareholders. The current dividend yield of 2.14% is certainly healthy. But it's worth pointing out that the payout has climbed 186% in the past decade.\n\nShare buybacks are also critical. Nike repurchased $4.3 billion of outstanding stock in fiscal 2024.\n\nOn a losing streak\n\nThings haven't been going smoothly for Nike in recent years. With the benefit of hindsight, I believe there are two blunders that have led to the company's challenges.\n\nThe first was Nike's relentless push to boost its direct-to-consumer and digital sales. Not long after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nike's leadership team set a goal to achieve 50% of its revenue from the online channel. So, it decided to cut ties with key wholesale accounts.\n\nAfter the pandemic's worst days had passed, consumer behavior normalized, and people went back to shopping in person. But Nike had bet that this wouldn't be the case. It gave up valuable shelf space to rivals, especially in the critical running category.\n\nAs a consumer brand, Nike must excel in product innovation, developing the right merchandise to drive interest. The company also has to ensure it doesn't create too much supply, which would undermine its brand image.\n\nHere's the other area where Nike failed, as it relied too heavily on classic footwear lines that lost their cool factor due to excess supply. At the same time, the business hasn't prioritized releasing new styles and designs. \"The result is we've become far too promotional,\" CEO Elliott Hill said on the second-quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nThese negative trends led to 8% and 26% sales and net income drops, respectively, in Q2 2025 compared to the same year-ago period.\n\nExceeding low expectations\n\nNike shares have tanked an alarming 26% in the past five years. The market has completely soured on the company and its prospects. That pessimistic perspective is warranted.\n\nHowever, the current valuation might be too hard to ignore. As of this writing, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.1, representing a 42% discount to its trailing five-year average.\n\nTo turn things around, the business needs to stabilize its revenue and earnings declines, which will be helped by reducing promotional activity and focusing on product innovation. All this must happen while Nike wins back customers around the globe.\n\nEven small progress can boost investor sentiment. If the stock rises 33% in the next 12 months, I would not be surprised. But to be clear, this depends solely on Nike's ability to improve its financial performance and reveal that it's a business heading in the right direction.",

            "content": "This story was originally published on April 25, 2024. We\u2019re republishing it as part of our countdown of top stories of the year.\n\nWhen you think of mainstay American brands, Nike is probably close to the top of the list. Long known as an innovator in the world of sports apparel and equipment, there\u2019s a certain air of gravitas that comes with owning an item branded with the Nike logo. But all might not be well in Nikeland, with recent layoffs, a pushback against leadership, and a rethink on internal culture prompting the iconic brand to make changes.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, after Nike laid off 1,600 employees earlier this year, CEO John Donahoe said in a meeting with over 20,000 employees that he held himself accountable for the company\u2019s recent struggles amid a pivot away from brick-and-mortar sales amid a perceived e-commerce boom that didn\u2019t fully materialize.\n\nSpoiler: It didn\u2019t go over well.\n\n\u201cAccountability: I do not think that word means what you think it means,\u201d an employee wrote. \u201cIf this is cost cutting, how about a CEO salary cut?\u201d another wrote. Soon a cascade of laughing emojis filled the screen. Some colleagues warned others that their posts weren\u2019t anonymous and the chat might be monitored. The attacks went on for several minutes. \u201cI hope Phil is watching and reading this,\u201d an employee wrote, referencing the retired Nike co-founder Phil Knight. The virtual protest illustrated the depths of the dissatisfaction within the sneaker giant and concern for its strategy. \u201cHow did we actually get here?\u201d wrote one product manager.\n\nThis pushback from Nike\u2019s own employees amid the rethink needed to help right the ship exposes a flash point for the organization\u2019s operational strategy. What goes on behind closed doors in a company can greatly affect external perceptions of that same brand. But with a smart and well-executed change strategy, internal shifts can double as cultural cornerstones that drive external successes.\n\nHow internal affairs impact external perception\n\nWhen the seas of change begin to make waves, it\u2019s time for communicators to take notice and determine how to proceed with the company\u2019s mission and values at the top of the list of priorities. At Nike, creativity has long been one of the brand\u2019s biggest identifiers. The WSJ report claims that the company spent far too much in the way of time and resources looking back at the brand\u2019s history of accomplishments rather than focusing on new breakthroughs. It\u2019s no stretch to understand how that loss of creativity may well have impacted Nike\u2019s less-than-stellar business outlook, leading to the layoffs and internal consternation.\n\nAccording to Antonio Stephens, director of DE&I communications and global employer brand at Levi Strauss and Co., emphasized how these internal changes can change perceptions among not just the general marketplace, but also among potential recruits.\n\n\u201cInternal changes within any organization can lead to shifts in external perceptions among key stakeholders and talent prospects.\u201d\n\nCommunicators can help serve as a stabilizing force during these times. But they need to work hand-in-hand with leadership to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n\u201cDuring times of change, communicators play a crucial role in proactively working with leaders to control the narrative,\u201d continued Stephens. \u201cThis involves maintaining visibility among employees through open and transparent communication platforms, ensuring consistent messaging is cascaded effectively by change agents.\u201d\n\nEmployee experience and brand impacts\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider the impact that external pressures can have on employee culture and morale within a company. Looking at the level of dissent apparent in the messages firing back at Nike\u2019s CEO in the town hall meeting, it\u2019s clear that some of Nike\u2019s employees are feeling the heat.\n\nCommunicators aren\u2019t a fix-it method for every problem a company faces, but they serve as critical advisors in avoiding moments like these. For instance, internal communicators should always be in the ear of leaders and provide counsel so they can avoid stepping on verbal landmines in front of employees and stakeholders like Donahoe did. It\u2019s far easier to prevent culture issues internally as opposed to fixing them once the public finds out about them.\n\nMeasurement in times of change\n\nA good communicator knows how to tell the story of the situation around them, often through data. That\u2019s especially critical during times of change. At Ragan\u2019s Employee Communications and Culture Conference last week in Chicago, we learned that you can\u2019t just assume everyone is at the same stage of understanding the story you\u2019re trying to tell. In such moments, measurement can help you define distinct employee personas that segment the delivery channels, cadence and language your change messaging to preserve employee culture during rocky times.\n\nIn addition, if communicators can talk about the stories within their metrics in a transparent way, it can fundamentally change how other stakeholders share information both inside and outside the company. By measuring attrition metrics after a major change announcement and comparing it to qualitative data from a pulse survey, for example, a story emerges about what went wong or right and why.\n\nNike is still one of the most recognizable brands in the world, make no mistake. But this is a case study in the fact that no matter how big or popular your organization is, comms are still important in maintaining a positive culture internally that can then beget a positive external perception.\n\nSean Devlin is an editor at Ragan Communications.

As we approach the \u201cYear Of The Snake\u201d on January 29th, we\u2019ve put together full breakdowns on all the Jordan, adidas, and now Nike shoes on tap.\n\nHere we have two Dunks and two Air Force 1s; one each for men and women. Relying on snakeskin material would have been easy enough, but the collection as a whole keeps the reptilian texture to a minimum. All four pairs come with red and gold snakeskin tongue labels, complemented by Zhongguo Jie knots symbolizing luck, harmony, reunion, and love.\n\nBoth \u201cYear Of The Snake\u201d Dunks feature quilted, snake-inspired satin lining, differing when is comes to their color and other add-ons. The women\u2019s pair features maroon overlays and pops of gold on the tongue and Swoosh, packaged with rope and flat laces as well as a metallic gold snake dubrae. The men\u2019s pair keeps things a touch simpler, taken in white and sage green with just one set of standard white laces.\n\nAs for the Air Force 1, which was the canvas for Nike\u2019s first ever Lunar New Year release back in \u201902, the women\u2019s pair spruces up in white/gold while the men\u2019s strikes a more conservative note in almost all-white. The snake-inspired pattern seen on the Dunks appears on the backtab of the women\u2019s colorway and heel panel of the men\u2019s, with both looks coming with the same aforementioned gold dubraes.\n\nImportantly, this only sums up the totality of Nike\u2019s lifestyle \u201cYear Of The Snake\u201d shoes. The Nike Basketball banner will see the release of \u201cYear Of The Mamba\u201d Kobe 5 Protros in honor of the holiday, not to mention a GT Cut 3 (which is available now).\n\nRelease dates for the four shoes previewed here have yet to be announced, but those eager to cop can expect Nike\u2019s \u201cYear Of The Snake\u201d collection to land before or around January 29th, 2025. See detailed images of all four pairs below and stick with us for further updates.\n\nPhotos via atmos.",

Nike, Kraft Heinz and Autodesk fall into this category, according to an internal memo from the fund seen by Bloomberg News.\n\nCo-founder James Fishback said earlier this month during Azoria\u2019s launch at President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort that he has already spoken with Starbucks Corp. about their DEI targets.\n\nBlack, indigenous, people of color and Hispanic Americans \u201care plenty qualified on their own,\u201d Fishback, 29, said in an interview, adding that his mother is Hispanic. \u201cThey don\u2019t need handouts. They don\u2019t need shortcuts.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure from conservative activists, investors and lawyers, companies have started to roll back their DEI efforts. A federal appeals court struck down a Nasdaq rule last week that compelled companies to include more women, people of color and LGBTQ+ directors on their boards \u2014 or explain why they hadn\u2019t.\n\nRelated: Death of Nasdaq Diversity Rule Signals More Trouble for DEI\n\nRobby Starbuck, the music-video-director-turned-right-wing-provocateur, is among the most vocal opponents of the DEI movement. He has pushed more than a dozen companies, including Walmart Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Harley-Davidson Inc., to change their DEI programs in the past year.\n\nRelated: Walmart\u2019s DEI Compromise Holds Lessons for Corporate America\n\nNow, Fishback is joining the fray. He previously worked at Greenlight Capital Inc., the hedge fund run by David Einhorn. He left the firm last year and he\u2019s now in a legal dispute with Greenlight over various allegations.\n\nFishback\u2019s exchange-traded fund, Azoria 500 Meritocracy, will exclude three dozen companies from the S&P 500 that have gender and racial hiring targets. Fishback said those companies will be made public when the fund launches. He has previously mentioned Best Buy Co. as another company that he\u2019s targeting.\n\nBest Buy declined to comment, while Autodesk, Kraft Heinz and Nike haven\u2019t responded to requests for comment.\n\nStarbucks said in a statement that aspirational goals for gender, racial and ethnic diversity that it set in 2020 expired in October. The company\u2019s current goal is to promote from within for 90% of its retail leadership roles.\n\nFishback said he plans to travel to the UK to meet with members of Parliament and discuss policies related to meritocracy and DEI. At this point, he said his only plans for the ETF are in the US.\n\nFishback\u2019s fund is the latest to be started by right-wing investors that are pushing back on corporate DEI and environmental, social and governance strategies. \u201cAnti-woke\u201d investor Vivek Ramaswamy, who\u2019s now working with Elon Musk on Trump\u2019s \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d initiative, started Strive Asset Management two years ago in a bid to counter ESG strategies.\n\nCathie Wood, who runs Ark Investment Management, attended the launch of Fishback\u2019s firm at Mar-a-Lago. Her firm says on its website that it\u2019s focused on gender equality and supports groups combating social and economic injustices including the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Kevin Roberts, who runs Heritage Foundation \u2014 the conservative group behind Project 2025, which provided policy recommendations for the incoming Trump administration \u2014 also was at the Mar-a-Lago event.\n\nPhoto: Photographer: Natalie Behring/Bloomberg\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.\n\nTopics Talent",

A release is confirmed for 2/1 in EU; a US release date has yet to be established. Check the new shots below and keep an eye on our \u201cWhere To Buy\u201d section for direct purchase links upon release.\n\n1 of 5\n\nOriginal article published December 30th, 2024: Drake and Nike are taking us back to the Certified Lover Boy era by releasing the \u201cLove You Forever\u201d NOCTA x Air Force 1 Low in new colors. Hot on the heels of \u201cCitron\u201d and \u201cCobalt Tint\u201d executions in early December, we\u2019re just now getting a first look at a fresh \u201cPink Foam\u201d pair for Spring 2025.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been keeping up with Drake\u2019s work with the Swoosh thus far, the design should strike a familiar note. Just like the two aforementioned colorways as well as the inaugural Drake Air Force 1 from 2022, the shoe comes as a monotone take on Bruce Kilgore classic. Premium \u201cPink Foam\u201d leather spans the full length of the upper, complemented by a semi-clear midsole featuring script \u201cLove You Forever\u201d text in place of the usual \u201cAIR.\u201d\n\nNo release date has been set at the time of this writing, but Drake\u2019s \u201cPink Foam\u201d Air Force 1 is expected to arrive during the Spring 2025 shopping season for $160. Our Sneaker Release Dates page will display updates as more information comes to light.",

            "content": "As the year comes to a close, Nike has published its list of the most popular SNKRS drops of 2024. The brand previously posted lists for 2022 and 2023, with Travis Scott\u2019s Air Jordan 1 Low OG collaborations claiming the top spot in both years. This time around, Scott has not only taken first place, but claimed four out of the top five positions.\n\nHot off of the release of the Kids of Immigrants x Nike Air Max Sunder \u201cSunrise,\u201d we have a complete rundown of what sneakers drove the most traffic to SNKRS this year. Per usual, Travis Scott\u2019s AJ1 Low OGs drew in the masses, taking first, second and fifth. His Jordan CJ1 T-Rexx \u201cSail\u201d landed in fourth, just behind the Air Jordan 4 \u201cBred Reimagined.\u201d The AJ4 also found itself in sixth with its \u201cIndustrial Blue\u201d colorway. The only two non-Jordan Brand drops in the top 10 came in seventh and eighth place with the Kobe 6 Protro \u201cItalian Camo\u201d and Futura x Nike SB Dunk Low respectively. From there, Trophy Room\u2019s AJ1 Low OG \u201cRookie Card \u2013 Away\u201d and J Balvin\u2019s Air Jordan 3 \u201cRio\u201d rounded out the top release list.\n\nKey takeaways from the data includes both Scott and the AJ1 present across 40% of the entries. The AJ4 was the only non-collab pair from Jordan Brand to make the list, appearing in two colorways. Low-tops performed best with six featured in the lineup and Nike only found itself holding 20% of the spots, down from 50% the past two years. Check out the full list below, including the original articles for each pair.\n\nDid you end up copping any of these 10 pairs from SNKRS this year? Either way, here\u2019s to hoping there\u2019s better luck in store for all of us in 2025.",

            "content": "Nike Field General Snakeskin Pack\n\nNike and much of the sneaker industry delved deep into its archives throughout 2024. Included in this was the reintroduction of the Nike Field General, a sneaker initially built for the gridiron in the \u201880s and worn by iconic NFL quarterbacks like Archie Manning, Dan Marino, and many more. We\u2019ve seen the sneaker come forth in various new renditions, but 2025 will mark its first foray into Lunar New Year celebrations with the upcoming Snakeskin Pack.\n\nAlthough not directly tied to Nike\u2019s overarching Lunar New Year Collection, celebrating the Year of the Snake, the three colorways pictured here are obvious homages to the zodiac. All three pairs come with a tonal color palette across the upper, one in Dark Grey, another in Light British Tan, and finally, a Sail rendition. The three colors also share the same placement of snakeskin details, as the Swoosh comes in different colored faux snakeskin on each pair, and the color of the leather heel tab takes on a sail finish.\n\nNike Field General Snakeskin Pack\n\nAside from the snakeskin Swoosh, everything else remains standard for the model, with a smooth leather finish on the toebox and midfoot panel. At the same time, the suede hits the mudguard, vamp, eyestays, and heel overlay. A canvas material is used for the tongue\u2019s construction, which is done in a tonal look to match most of the sneaker. Underfoot, all three pairs come with a tonal rubber midsole and outsole.\n\nThe Nike Field General Snakeskin Pack will release in Spring 2025 through Nike and select retailers online and in-store. Available in men\u2019s sizing, the retail price is $110.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Sporting Goods Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against the other sporting goods stocks.\n\nThe sports industry typically generates millions of dollars through events, promotions, and endorsements. It is one of the few sectors that continued to prosper, even during the pandemic. The global sporting and athletic goods market is projected to grow significantly, driven by consumer health awareness and rising demand for fitness products. The market value reached $52.02 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2% through 2032, due to innovation in sporting technology and materials. Sports stocks have climbed more than 10% year-to-date, pushing the sports index of the broader market to its highest level since July of last year.\n\nThe market has experienced a sudden increase in demand as it recovers from the pandemic. The pandemic initially disrupted the market with postponed events like the Olympics and supply chain challenges. However, increased consumer awareness around fitness and health post-pandemic has further fueled the global demand for sports and sporting goods.\n\nThis growth in demand has varied across regions. Western Europe and Asia Pacific have been at the forefront of the sales recovery, while Latin America has maintained its impressive growth momentum. North America also achieved steady progress, building on its previous year's performance. Looking ahead, Latin America and Southeast Asia show the greatest potential, with growth rates of 22% and 11%, respectively, in 2023. Meanwhile, although China rebounded after a challenging 2022, analysts remain cautious about future growth due to ongoing economic difficulties.\n\nGlobal economic challenges, such as high inflation and uncertainty, are shaping consumer behavior. Rising prices are a top concern for consumers worldwide, affecting purchasing power and brand loyalty. Despite these challenges, sports participation is increasing in some regions, particularly in activities that are accessible, social, and less time-consuming. For instance, customer preference for pickleball and paddle tennis has increased by 159% since the pandemic. As consumer preferences evolve, companies are adapting their strategies to cater to different demographics, particularly the expanding older population.\n\nRising Demand for Sustainable Sporting Goods\n\nOne of the key trends in this industry is the increasing preference for sustainable sporting goods. Despite economic pressures, many consumers are willing to pay 9.7% more on average for products that have a positive environmental impact. Legislation is also playing a big role in driving sustainability. Laws like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal are pushing investments in green energy and sustainable solutions, including in sporting goods. The EU\u2019s Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and Waste Framework Directive are setting stricter standards for product design, recyclability, and end-of-life management. Moreover, regulations like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive are increasing the pressure on companies to be transparent about their environmental and social impacts.",

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nUpdated February 11th, 2025: An updated look at the upcoming Air Jordan 4 SB \u201cMidnight Navy\u201d has surfaced, showcasing the Nike SB logo on the heel. Earlier in December 2024, images of the upcoming release were revealed, while mock-ups of shoes were fairly accurate with the final product.\n\nThe below article was originally published on December 30th, 2024.\n\n\u201cSneaker of the Year\u201d conversations for 2024 are all but finished, yet one of the most highly-anticipated shoes of the new year reaches back even further. Reviving what was widely recognized as the defining colorway of \u201923, the Nike SB Air Jordan 4 will usher its second edition two years later, spinning off the gum-soled edition of the AJ4 in Navy.\n\nIn these first-look images, we get confirmation of the mock-up shots formulated for this shoe\u2019s initial announcement. The flashes of gum brown on the outsole at the forefoot and heel provide aesthetic confirmation of the skate tooling that defines the shoe compositionally. Ironically, these shots come just hours after news that the Jordan 4 SB \u201cVarsity Red\u201d was removed from the release calendar, leaving this as the sole sequel for the seminal 2023 collab.\n\nWhile we\u2019ll need to wait for in-hand dissections to confirm the hardware, the increased padding, rubber detailing are all expected to accompany the Nike SB branding on the heel. Finally, the biggest divergence on this shoe, the flares of navy where \u201cPine Green\u201d once took hold, allows this edition to carry the OG sensibility of peers like the \u201cMilitary Blue\u201d and \u201cColumbia.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s yet to be seen whether the AJ4 in general will hold onto its top status in the Jumpman catalog for 2025, but there\u2019s a slew of colorways already queued up that make it very likely, including this shoe, the \u201cBlack Cat\u201d 4s and Air Jordan 4 \u201cWhite Cement.\u201d Though we don\u2019t have a concrete release date for this shoe, we expect it to hit shelves in March 2025, retailing at $225.\n\nKeep an eye on our Jordan Release Dates page in the coming weeks for additional info on this shoe and other major releases like the Black Cat 3s.",

However, Nike has provided us with a list that, just like Sole Retriever\u2019s most popular sneakers list from 2024, looks at data to showcase what the sneaker community went after the most.\n\nUnsurprising to many, the list is dominated by hype collaborations, Nike Kobes, OG Jordans, and, of course, Travis Scott releases. Sneaking in the top ten are two Air Jordan collaborations, J. Balvin\u2019s AJ3 Rio and Trophy Room\u2019s Air Jordan 1 Low OG, both of which were some of the most hyped-up drops of the year's first half. Futura\u2019s Nike SB Dunk Low, Kobe Bryant\u2019s Nike Kobe 8 Protro Italian Camo, and the return of the Air Jordan 4 Military Blue follow suit.\n\nNumber ten through six of the Top 10 SNKRS releases in 2024\n\nIn the top five, Travis Scott dominates as the Houston native and global superstar has four entries. Number five is his homage to his high school, Elkins High, which ended up being Sole Retriever\u2019s most popular sneaker based on data we have collected over the last 12 months. Following this is Scott\u2019s debut signature sneaker, the Jordan Jumpman Jack in Sail Dark Mocha, and the Jordan 4 Bred Reimagined, coming in at number three. Finally, the top two releases are Travis AJ1 Lows, number two being the recently-released Velvet Brown colorway, and number one being the Reverse Olive pair.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve highlighted each pair in the order Nike had on its top ten SNKRS releases.\n\nJ.
