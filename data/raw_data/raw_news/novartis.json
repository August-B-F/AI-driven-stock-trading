            "content": "Basel: Novartis has announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved oral Fabhalta (iptacopan) for the treatment of adults with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria.\n\n\u201cC3G is a debilitating disease often affecting young people, impacting many aspects of their physical and emotional health, and our previous treatment options came with significant challenges,\u201d said Carla Nester, M.D., M.S.A., F.A.S.N., Professor of Pediatrics-Nephrology at the University of Iowa and Fabhalta APPEAR-C3G Study Co-Investigator. \u201cThis approval of Fabhalta is historic for the entire C3G community as now, for the first time, we have a therapy that is believed to treat the underlying cause of the disease, providing the potential for a new standard of care for patients.\u201d\n\nFabhalta is an oral inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway to selectively target what is thought to be the underlying cause of the disease. Before the approval of Fabhalta, patients had to rely on supportive care, broad immunosuppression, and symptom management.\n\n\u201cAs someone whose family has suffered from C3G across multiple generations, it is difficult to fully express the physical and emotional challenges of living with this unrelenting disease,\u201d said Lindsey Fuller, C3G patient and Co-Leader of C3G Warriors. \u201cTo finally have an approved treatment \u2013 and one that can be taken orally \u2013 is something people with C3G have been waiting for. Today\u2019s approval brings new hope for me, my family, and so many others.\u201d\n\nC3G is a progressive and ultra-rare kidney disease that, until now, has had no approved treatments. The average age of diagnosis is around 23 years old. Prognosis is poor, with approximately half of people living with C3G progressing to kidney failure within 10 years of diagnosis, requiring lifelong dialysis and/or kidney transplantation. People living with C3G may experience high levels of fatigue, mobility issues affecting everyday life activities, and mental health symptoms, including depression and anxiety.\n\nThe pivotal Phase III APPEAR-C3G study evaluated the efficacy and safety of twice-daily oral Fabhalta in adult patients with C3G. The study was comprised of a 6-month randomized, double-blind treatment period with Fabhalta compared to placebo in addition to supportive care, followed by an additional 6-month open-label treatment period where all participants received Fabhalta.\n\nTreatment with Fabhalta resulted in clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction, which was seen as early as 14 days and sustained at 12 months. Similarly, in the open-label period, proteinuria reduction was seen in participants who switched to Fabhalta.\n\nFabhalta demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no new safety signals. In patients with C3G, the most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) with Fabhalta were nasopharyngitis and viral infections. Fabhalta may cause serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria and is available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that requires specific vaccinations.\n\nLast month, Fabhalta received a positive CHMP Opinion in C3G by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Regulatory reviews for this indication are ongoing in China and Japan.\n\n\u201cWe extend our deepest gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in our clinical trials, without whom this first FDA approval in C3G wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d said Victor Bult\u00f3, President US, Novartis. \u201cWith this additional approval for Fabhalta \u2013 the second in kidney disease \u2013 we will leverage our established capabilities and expertise to bring this innovative treatment to patients in need as we work to help transform care for people living with kidney diseases.\u201d\n\nThis is the third US approval for Fabhalta and its second within the Novartis kidney disease portfolio since August 2024, when Fabhalta was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon confirmatory evidence. Fabhalta received its first FDA approval in December 2023 for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Discovered by Novartis, Fabhalta is also being studied in a broad range of other rare kidney diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and lupus nephritis (LN). Studies are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy profiles in these investigational indications.\n\nIn addition to Fabhalta, Novartis is advancing the late-stage development of two additional IgAN therapies with highly differentiated mechanisms of action: atrasentan, an investigational oral endothelin A receptor antagonist that received FDA filing acceptance in Q2 2024 with a decision anticipated in H1 2025, and zigakibart, an investigational subcutaneously administered anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody that is currently in Phase III development.",

Experts warn abandoning any diversity goals in clinical research could set drug development back decades.\n\n7 minutes\n\nJessica Davis Pl\u00fcss I report on the Swiss pharmaceutical industry and healthcare topics such as access to medicine, biomedical innovation, and the impact of diseases like cancer. I grew up just outside San Francisco and studied international affairs with a focus on development economics and healthcare policy. Prior to joining SWI swissinfo.ch in 2018, I was a freelance journalist and a researcher on business and human rights. Aylin El\u00e7i\n\nFrom innovative treatments to unequal access to medicine, I cover health topics and keep an eye on Switzerland's Health Valley. I'm Swiss-Turkish, and have a background in communications, journalism and photography. Before joining SWI swissinfo.ch, I covered technology and health at Euronews, and my work has been featured in international outlets including Fayn Press, Mediapart, Le Temps and Times of Malta.\n\nGlobal companies with headquarters outside the US are not immune to pressure from US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. Several Swiss companies announced this week that they are adjusting their language and goals on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) not just in the US but also at a global level.\n\nAmong them, pharmaceutical company Roche is changing its ten-year ambition from \u201cachieve an inclusive environment through global leadership that mirrors our workforce\u201d to \u201cfoster an inclusive environment that inspires people to perform at their very best,\u201d a Roche spokesperson told SWI swissinfo.ch in an emailed statement.\n\nThe decision comes in response to Trump\u2019s executive orders, specifically one issued on January 21 on \u201cending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunityExternal link\u201d. This includes a call to encourage the private sector to \u201cend illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\u201d.\n\nDEI programmes and policies seek to create workplaces that are welcoming to all people, and address barriers to the representation of marginalised groups, for example in leadership positions. Big companies in the US, and increasingly globally, have embraced DEI in an effort to attract and retain talent, as well as to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse customer base. President Trump has attacked DEI as \u201cwoke\u201d culture that he claims leads to unfair treatment of non-minorities.\n\nAmid Trump\u2019s dismantling of DEI, Roche wiped diversity targetsExternal link from the website of its US subsidiary, Genentech, in mid-February. Basel-based competitor Novartis also said this week it was getting rid of diverse panelsExternal link in its hiring process in the US.\n\nRoche\u2019s decision to make changes at a global level are \u201cbecause our global programs and goals can have an impact on our US organisations if we are not compliant under the new law,\u201d Roche executives said in an email to employees on Tuesday evening, which SWI was able to see.\n\nBut the fact that global headquarters in Switzerland are bending to Trump\u2019s demands has raised questions about how far his orders could reach, and whether some of companies\u2019 core activities including drug research and development could be affected.\n\nInsights into how diseases and treatments affect people differently based on their sex, gender, and ethnicity has become important to the development of targeted drugs.\n\nIn 2022, Novartis invested $17.7 million (CHF15 million) as part of a 10-year plan to address racial inequalities in clinical trials. A year earlier it set up the Beacon of HopeExternal link initiative to collaborate with 26 historically Black universities in the US.\n\nNovartis told SWI by email that it remains committed to Beacon of Hope, and that it will continue to invest in \u201cdiverse patient representation in clinical trials as it is critical to our R&D efforts\u201d.\n\nRoche echoed these sentiments. In its 2024 annual report, the firm wrote that it is embedding \u201cDEI into every aspect of our pharmaceutical and diagnostic research, development and solution delivery\u201d. It also wrote that it had an entire \u201cteam dedicated to supporting inclusive research\u201d.\n\nIn a response to SWI, a Roche spokesperson said that its US subsidiary\u2019s inclusive research will \u201ccontinue to focus on designing studies that include patients across various races, ethnicities, and ancestries to ensure that clinical trials reflect the broader patient population\u201d.\n\nThere remains a lot of uncertainty though. In the email to employees, Roche executives wrote that \u201cmoving forward, there will be changes to DEI content, activities and programmes\u201d both in the US and globally.\n\nThe long-term harm\n\nExperts who spoke to SWI warned that it will be patients who ultimately suffer from any retreat on diversity in drug development.\n\n\u201cNot considering sex, gender and race in research of new medicine isn\u2019t just bad science; it\u2019s negligence,\u201d said Antonella Santuccione Chadha, a pathologist and neurologist who worked at Roche and Biogen from 2018-2022 and is now the head of the Women\u2019s Brain Foundation based in Zurich.\n\nMore\n\nMore Drugmakers are finally making medicine for women This content was published on Sex and gender are rarely considered in drug development. There\u2019s now a movement, including in Switzerland, to change this. Read more: Drugmakers are finally making medicine for women\n\nIn the past 40 years, medical products have been 3.5 times more likely to be removed from the market because of adverse effects on women than on men, according to a McKinsey Health Institute studyExternal link published last year.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1993 that the US Food and Drug Administration even allowed women of child-bearing years to participate in early trials. Over the past decade, a number of medicines regulators, including in SwitzerlandExternal link, have created guidance, toolkits and standards for more diversity in clinical trials.\n\nThe importance of expanding trials to a more diverse population has also become more pressing in the light of population trends. By 2050, one in four people on the planet will be African, up from 1 in 11 in 1960, according to the United Nations. Currently, despite Africa comprising over 16% of the world\u2019s population and shouldering 25% of the global disease burden, only 2% to 4% of global clinical trials are conducted on the continent.\n\nThe impact and consequences of a retreat on diversity would be \u201ctangible and scary\u201d, said Claudia Vaccarone, a consultant on inclusive strategies. This would impact the \u201cstudy and development of drugs and devices specifically addressing health issues of women and minorities\u201d.\n\nUnder pressure\n\nThere are already signs that diversity and inclusion in medical research will come under pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nIn the first week after the US president was sworn in, several External linkfederal webpages on diversity in research were removed, including draft guidance for drug and device makers on under-represented populations for late-stage clinical trials that was set to be finalised in 2025. The guidance was since restored but it is still unclear what will remain of existing efforts, and what shape they will take.\n\nMore\n\nMore Explainer: Why US health funding cuts are rattling Swiss science This content was published on The Trump administration has upended funding by the National Institutes of Health.

The companies also have lucrative contracts with the US government to conduct research and supply medicine, for example through Medicare, the national health insurance programme for people over 65.\n\n\u201cCompanies need rules, guidance and even incentives to ensure trials reflect the population they are trying to serve,\u201d said Chadha. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time to go backwards.\u201d\n\nEdited by Virginie Mangin/dos",

More than 95% of infants born in the U.S. with a rare neuromuscular disorder called spinal muscular atrophy are now treated with its Zolgensma gene therapy and it is being developed for older children.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX continues to see patients with sickle cell disease start the process to receive its Casgevy therapy, said Chief Operating Officer Stuart Arbuckle.\n\nHe said the treatment, which had 2024 sales of just $10 million, was pursued because the company believed gene editing offered the best solution for people living with the debilitating disease.\n\nGene therapy \u2014 the one-time process of inserting a modified gene to compensate for a faulty gene or change how a patient's cells produce proteins \u2014 is a complex procedure in which patients often have to be hospitalized, with insurance coverage not always clear.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has supported the breakthrough treatments, which have multimillion-dollar prices.\n\nPeter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told Reuters he is confident \"speed bumps\" including scientific challenges, manufacturing difficulties and real-world application of gene therapies will be worked out.\n\n\"We need to have a streamlined regulatory process... Combine that with manufacturing improvements to have a package of things to bring down cost so they are no longer cost prohibitive,\" Marks said earlier this month. \"My hope is that we have a group that is going to be here through the next years working on this.\"\n\nSafety issues are also a concern even after approval. Sarepta Therapeutics SRPT said this week a 16-year-old boy died from acute liver failure months after receiving the company's gene therapy for a rare muscular dystrophy.\n\nWeight-loss drugs, meanwhile, are forecast to see annual sales of $150 billion in coming years as new, highly-effective medicines have sparked outsized demand. Obesity therapeutics attracted $1.75 billion in venture capital last year, nearly triple 2023's total of $630 million.\n\nOverall, global biopharma venture funding rose to $27 billion in 2024 from $23.2 billion in 2023. Cancer remained the top sector at $10.3 billion, according to DealForma.\n\nThomson ReutersGene therapy and gene editing/CRISPR venture activity by year\n\nECONOMICS AND POLICY DIFFICULTIES\n\nUnlike traditional drugs that can be made in large quantities for mass distribution, gene therapies are more individualized, requiring specialized equipment and cell processing materials.\n\n\"People believe in the promise of gene therapy,\" said Priya Chandran, biopharmaceuticals sector leader at Boston Consulting Group. \"Investment is dropping because the overall economics and policy landscape has been problematic.\"\n\nThe Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the industry trade group for the cell and gene therapy sector, said it expects investment to be reinvigorated as new trial data emerges.\n\n\"The biggest biopharma companies continue to invest as the gene therapy pipeline evolves to tackle diseases with larger patient populations,\" said ARM spokesman Stephen Majors.\n\nWhen Pfizer last month stopped selling Beqvez, its gene therapy for hemophilia B, it said demand was weak. The company in 2023 had already backed away from early-stage gene therapy research, and last year abandoned efforts on a gene treatment for muscular dystrophy after disappointing results from a late-stage trial.\n\nBluebird sells three gene therapies in the U.S., including Lyfgenia for sickle cell disease, which competes with Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics' CRSP Casgevy.\n\nPfizer and Bluebird did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEvidence that expensive gene therapies can provide a sustained benefit and will be accepted by patients, doctors and insurers has become more critical as major pharmaceutical companies face the looming loss of market exclusivity for top-selling medicines.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimated that around $175 billion of 2025 U.S. large-cap biopharma revenue \u2013 35% of the total \u2013 will go off patent by the end of the decade.\n\nCompanies \"are trying to invest fast enough so that they can restock their pipelines and hopefully fill the gap,\" said EY's Baral. \"These are capital allocation choices.\"",

Before the approval of Fabhalta, patients had to rely on supportive care, broad immunosuppression, and symptom management5-6.\n\n\"As someone whose family has suffered from C3G across multiple generations, it is difficult to fully express the physical and emotional challenges of living with this unrelenting disease,\" said Lindsey Fuller, C3G patient and Co-Leader of C3G Warriors. \"To finally have an approved treatment \u2013 and one that can be taken orally \u2013 is something people with C3G have been waiting for. Today's approval brings new hope for me, my family, and so many others.\"\n\nC3G is a progressive and ultra-rare kidney disease that, until now, has had no approved treatments2-5. The average age of diagnosis is around 23 years old2. Prognosis is poor, with approximately half of people living with C3G progressing to kidney failure within 10 years of diagnosis, requiring lifelong dialysis and/or kidney transplantation2,7. People living with C3G may experience high levels of fatigue, mobility issues affecting everyday life activities, and mental health symptoms, including depression and anxiety8,9.\n\nData supporting approval\n\nThe pivotal Phase III APPEAR-C3G study evaluated the efficacy and safety of twice-daily oral Fabhalta in adult patients with C3G1,10. The study was comprised of a 6-month randomized, double-blind treatment period with Fabhalta compared to placebo in addition to supportive care, followed by an additional 6-month open-label treatment period where all participants received Fabhalta1,10.\n\nTreatment with Fabhalta resulted in clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction, which was seen as early as 14 days and sustained at 12 months1,10. Similarly, in the open-label period, proteinuria reduction was seen in participants who switched to Fabhalta1,10.\n\nFabhalta demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no new safety signals1. In patients with C3G, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10% ) with Fabhalta were nasopharyngitis and viral infections1. Fabhalta may cause serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria and is available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that requires specific vaccinations1.\n\nLast month, Fabhalta received a positive CHMP Opinion in C3G by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)11. Regulatory reviews for this indication are ongoing in China and Japan.\n\nTransforming care in kidney disease\n\n\"We extend our deepest gratitude to the patients and investigators who participated in our clinical trials, without whom this first FDA approval in C3G wouldn't have been possible,\" said Victor Bult\u00f3, President US, Novartis. \"With this additional approval for Fabhalta \u2013 the second in kidney disease \u2013 we will leverage our established capabilities and expertise to bring this innovative treatment to patients in need as we work to help transform care for people living with kidney diseases.\"\n\nThis is the third US approval for Fabhalta and its second within the Novartis kidney disease portfolio since August 2024, when Fabhalta was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon confirmatory evidence1. Fabhalta received its first FDA approval in December 2023 for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)1. Discovered by Novartis, Fabhalta is also being studied in a broad range of other rare kidney diseases, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and lupus nephritis (LN). Studies are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy profiles in these investigational indications.\n\nIn addition to Fabhalta, Novartis is advancing the late-stage development of two additional IgAN therapies with highly differentiated mechanisms of action: atrasentan, an investigational oral endothelin A receptor antagonist that received FDA filing acceptance in Q2 2024 with a decision anticipated in H1 2025, and zigakibart, an investigational subcutaneously administered anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody that is currently in Phase III development.\n\nAbout APPEAR-C3G\n\nAPPEAR-C3G (NCT04817618) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily oral Fabhalta (200 mg) in patients with native kidney C3G1,12. The study comprises a 6-month double-blind period in which adult patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Fabhalta or placebo on top of supportive care, followed by a 6-month open-label period in which all patients receive Fabhalta (including those who were previously on placebo)1,12. The primary endpoint for the double-blind period was proteinuria reduction from baseline at 6 months for Fabhalta compared to placebo as measured by 24-hour urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR)1,12. In addition to the results from adult patients with C3G, enrollment is ongoing in a separate cohort of adolescent patients with C3G12.\n\nAbout C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)\n\nEach year, approximately 1-2 people per million worldwide are newly diagnosed with C3G, a form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)3.\n\nIn C3G, overactivation of the alternative complement pathway \u2013 part of the immune system \u2013 causes deposits of C3 protein to build up in kidney glomeruli, which are a network of blood vessels that filter waste and remove extra fluids from the blood4,13. This triggers inflammation and glomerular damage that results in proteinuria (protein in urine), hematuria (blood in urine) and reduced kidney function4,14.\n\nIndication\n\nFABHALTA is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a kidney disease called complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce protein in the urine (proteinuria).\n\nIt is not known if FABHALTA is safe and effective in children with C3G.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nFABHALTA is a medicine that affects part of the immune system and may lower one's ability to fight infections. FABHALTA increases the chance of getting serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. These serious infections may quickly become life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Patients must complete or update vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks before the first dose of FABHALTA. If patients have not completed vaccinations and FABHALTA must be started right away, they should receive the required vaccinations as soon as possible. If patients have not been vaccinated and FABHALTA must be started right away, they should also receive antibiotics to take for as long as their health care provider tells them. If patients have been vaccinated against these bacteria in the past, they might need additional vaccinations before starting FABHALTA. Their health care provider will decide if they need additional vaccinations. Vaccines do not prevent all infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Patients should call their health care provider or get emergency medical care right away if they have any of these signs and symptoms of a serious infection: fever with or without shivers or chills; fever with chest pain and cough; fever with high heart rate; headache and fever; confusion; clammy skin; fever and rash; fever with breathlessness or fast breathing; headache with nausea or vomiting; headache with stiff neck or stiff back; body aches with flu-like symptoms; or eyes sensitive to light. Health care providers will give their patients a Patient Safety Card about the risk of serious infections. Patients must carry it with them at all times during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of FABHALTA. The risk of serious infections may continue for a few weeks after their last dose of FABHALTA. It is important for patients to show this card to any health care provider who treats them. This will help health care providers diagnose and treat patients quickly.\n\nFABHALTA is only available through a program called the FABHALTA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Before patients can take FABHALTA, their health care provider must enroll in the FABHALTA REMS program, counsel their patients about the risk of serious infections caused by certain bacteria, give their patients information about the symptoms of serious infections, make sure that their patients are vaccinated against serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria and that they receive antibiotics if they need to start FABHALTA right away and are not up-to-date on vaccinations, as well as give patients a Patient Safety Card about the risk of serious infections.\n\nPatients should not take FABHALTA if they are allergic to FABHALTA or any of the ingredients in FABHALTA. Patients should not take FABHALTA if they have a serious infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, or Haemophilus influenzae type b, when starting FABHALTA.\n\nBefore taking FABHALTA, patients should tell their health care provider about all their medical conditions, including if they have an infection or fever, have liver problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if FABHALTA will harm an unborn baby), or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed as it is not known if FABHALTA passes into breast milk. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for 5 days after the final dose of FABHALTA.\n\nPatients should tell their health care provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Taking FABHALTA with certain other medicines may affect the way FABHALTA works and may cause side effects. Patients should know the medicines they take and the vaccines they receive. Patients should keep a list of them to show their health care provider and pharmacist when they get a new medicine.\n\nFABHALTA may cause serious side effects, including those mentioned above as well as increased cholesterol and triglyceride (lipid) levels in the blood. Health care providers will do blood tests to check patients' cholesterol and triglycerides during treatment with FABHALTA. Health care providers may start patients on medicine to lower cholesterol if needed.\n\nThe most common side effects of FABHALTA in adults include: headache; nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, sneezing, and sore throat (nasopharyngitis); diarrhea; pain in the stomach (abdomen); infections (bacterial and viral); nausea; and rash.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING and Medication Guide.\n\nNovartis in kidney disease\n\nBuilding on a 40-year legacy that began in transplant, Novartis is on a mission to empower breakthroughs and transform care in kidney health, starting with kidney conditions that have significant unmet need. Historically these conditions have had considerably less funding and research, leading to a treatment landscape largely focused on reactive or end-stage disease management, often with significant physical, emotional, and financial burdens. Our pipeline targets the underlying causes of disease, with an aim to protect kidney health and delay or prevent dialysis and/or transplantation. Our goal is to help patients get back to living life on their terms\u2014whether at work, in school, or with loved ones, and by partnering with patients, advocates, clinicians, and policymakers we aim to raise awareness, accelerate diagnosis and get patients the right care, sooner.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

            "content": "On Wednesday, Novartis gave a more detailed look at long-awaited clinical data that the company believes will help secure a broad approval for a successor drug to its blockbuster gene therapy Zolgensma.\n\nThe drug, code-named OAV101, shares the same active ingredient as Zolgensma, which in 2019 gained U.S. approval for the treatment of a rare, muscle-wasting illness known as spinal muscular atrophy. Zolgensma, though, is injected into the veins, and is only cleared for use in patients under two years of age. Novartis has spent years trying to show OAV101, which is shot right into the spine, can be a safe and effective therapy for older kids.\n\nKey to that mission is the \u201cSTEER\u201d study, a late-stage trial of children with moderate SMA who are older than two years and have never before received certain targeted medicines like Zolgensma, Biogen\u2019s Spinraza or Roche\u2019s Evrysdi. The study pitted OAV101 against a sham control over a one-year period. Researchers then gauged the drug\u2019s effects using a 66-point scale that evaluates patients\u2019 motor function to quantify how their disease is progressing.\n\nNovartis had already announced late last year that its drug had succeeded on the study\u2019s main goal by substantially beating the control. Now, the company is disclosing specific data. Participants given OAV101 showed a 2.39-point improvement on that motor function scale, compared to a 0.51-point gain in the sham group. Novartis said all of the trial\u2019s secondary goals \u201cconsistently\u201d favored its drug, too, though they did not achieve statistical significance.\n\nRegarding safety, the company said the overall incidence of adverse events \u2014 including those deemed serious or of \u201cspecial interest\u201d \u2014 was similar between the two arms. The most common were upper respiratory tract infection and fever. Of the serious adverse events, the most frequent were pneumonia and vomiting in the OAV101 group and pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection for the sham group.\n\nMany gene therapies use adeno-associated viruses \u2014 modified pathogens that act like shipping containers \u2014 to deliver their medicinal cargo to the right tissues. But these viruses have a natural attraction to the liver, where they can cause severe health problems. Liver health has therefore become a major concern and focal point for gene therapy developers. Novartis has been among them, as two fatal cases of acute liver failure were reported among patients treated with Zolgensma.\n\nOne sign the organ is under stress is increasing levels of an enzyme called transaminase. According to Novartis, its study found these increases were infrequent. Most were low-grade and transient. The company also noted that there were no cases of \u201cHy\u2019s law,\u201d a guideline drug researchers use to identify when a patient is at risk of severe liver damage.\n\nIn a statement, Novartis said the STEER results add to a \u201cgrowing body of evidence\u201d supporting OAV101. The data \u201creinforce our belief in this therapy, which has the potential to have a meaningful impact on a broad range of people with SMA through its continuous benefit via a one-time dose,\u201d according to Shreeram Aradhye, the company\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nNovartis intends to submit an approval application by the end of June.\n\nIn addition to STEER, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant has data from experiments dubbed \u201cSTRONG\u201d and \u201cSTRENGTH.\u201d The former was an earlier-stage study, while the latter was an open-label trial that enrolled 27 participants who had previously tried and discontinued treatment with Spinraza or Evrysdi.\n\nNovartis said its drug appeared to stabilize motor function in STRENGTH. All patients in the trial experienced at least one adverse event, with the most frequent being common cold, fever and vomiting. Nearly half had an adverse event that researchers determined was related to OAV101.\n\nTaken together, the results from STRENGTH and STEER indicate that Novartis\u2019 drug could be a \u201cmeaningful treatment option,\u201d said Crystal Proud, a pediatric neurologist and principal investigator at Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters in Virginia.\n\nNovartis, too, expects the drug to be meaningful in multiple ways. The company trudged forward with therapy despite development delays in 2019 and 2020. Just a couple months ago, CEO Vas Narasimhan affirmed that the company envisions OAV101 eventually generating $3 billion in annual sales.\n\nNarasimhan told investors that, if approval is granted, the launch should be similar to Zolgensma\u2019s, with a fast initial ramp up that then hits a \u201csteady state.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hope is by going to the physician and patient population, saying, \u2018Look, you have a one-time gene therapy using the gold standard [scoring scale] ... with a very expected safety profile,\u2019 that could be very compelling for a large number of patients,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's the approach we're going to take in rolling the medicine out.\u201d",

            "content": "Six years ago, the FDA approved Novartis\u2019 Zolgensma as the first gene therapy for children under two years of age with spinal muscular atrophy. Wednesday, the company reported late-stage data from an intrathecal form of the gene therapy that appears to be effective in treating the rare, neuromuscular disease in older patients.\n\n\u201cEverything was in a positive direction,\u201d John W. Day, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences and pediatric genetics at Stanford Medicine who was not involved in Novartis\u2019 studies, told BioSpace. \u201cIt looks like [the gene therapy is] safe. It looks like you\u2019re seeing a signal of treatment efficacy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, although the trial missed its secondary endpoints, intrathecal (IT) Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec or OAV101 IT) elicited a 2.39-point improvement on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE)\u2014a gold standard spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) assessment tool\u2014in the Phase III STEER trial. That\u2019s compared to 0.51 points for those who received a sham surgery. In a second Phase IIIb study, dubbed STRENGTH, OAV101 IT led to stabilization of motor function over 52 weeks in patients who have discontinued treatment with Biogen\u2019s antisense oligonucleotide Spinraza or Roche\u2019s SMN2 splicing modifier Evrysdi.\n\nBased on these data, presented Wednesday at the Muscular Dystrophy Association\u2019s Clinical & Scientific Conference in Dallas, Novartis plans to file for approval of the IT formulation with regulatory agencies in the first half of 2025.\n\nBoth formulations of Zolgensma address the genetic root cause of SMA by providing a functional copy of the human SMN1 gene, which is lacking in these patients. If approved, OAV101 IT would be the first gene replacement therapy for patients with SMA over the age of two years.\n\nSpinraza is FDA-approved for patients of all ages with all types of SMA, while Roche\u2019s recently approved Evrysdi tablet is indicated for patients two years or older who weigh more than 20 kgs.\n\nDesigned for Older SMA Patients\n\nNovartis broke through in May 2019 with the FDA approval of Zolgensma, the first gene therapy for SMA. \u201cWhen it comes to the mostly newborn, the young kids, we have seen transformative results there,\u201d Norman Putzki, the company\u2019s global development head of neuroscience and gene therapy, told BioSpace prior to Wednesday\u2019s presentation. However, a more prevalent group of patients were \u201calready too old . . . or too heavy to receive the treatment,\u201d Putzki said.\n\nEnter OAV101 IT, which is delivered intrathecally (IT), making it safe for older, heavier patients, according to Putzki.\n\nWith these patients, \u201cYou have a massively larger exposure, particularly towards the high end of the spectrum . . . that would require very high doses,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we can mitigate everything that is a dose-related toxicity by going IT with a small, flat dose into the [cerebrospinal fluid].\u201d Sure enough, Novartis reported that the rate of adverse events was similar between treatment and placebo groups in both the STEER and STRENGTH studies.\n\nAs for efficacy, Putzki said Novartis has seen motor gains that were \u201cclinically meaningful,\u201d but he emphasized the significance of preserving the function the patients have left. In the STEER and STRENGTH studies, SMA had already taken its toll on this older patient population, who were able to sit but not walk independently. With OAV101 IT, Putzki said, \u201cyou see there\u2019s a prevention of further progression of the disease, further decline, losing these motor abilities that patients need in order to take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nOf the 75 patients treated with Novartis\u2019 gene therapy in the STEER trial, two patients were able to stand independently, while 15 were able to walk with assistance, according to the company\u2019s presentation.\n\nFor Day, however, the results seen with OAV101 IT in STEER and STRENGTH were more \u201cnuanced\u201d than the \u201cdramatic\u201d results seen in infants treated with Zolgensma, as well as Spinraza and Evrysdi. Indeed, the gene therapy did not achieve statistical significance on the trial\u2019s secondary endpoints\u2014an additional scale called the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) or a 3-point response on the HFMSE. Novartis attributed these misses to the prioritization of a subgroup analysis in the preplanned testing procedure.\n\nThis older population is \u201ca hard group to see a very dramatic response in,\u201d Day said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re pretty significantly affected patients.\u201d\n\nBut despite failing to meet these secondary endpoints, Novartis did say they trended in the right direction so as to \u201cconsistently favor OAV101 IT.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how long the treatment effects could be expected to last, Putzki pointed to the aggregate data from STEER, STRENGTH and the Phase I/II STRONG study, in which patients treated with OAV101 IT have been followed for up to six years. So far, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen a loss of treatment effect over time,\u201d he said. And in the long-term, follow-up study of the Phase I START trial of Zolgensma, a single intravenous infusion of the gene therapy continued to demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile and durable efficacy up to 10 years after dosing, according to Novartis.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s biologically plausible to assume that\u2019s also true for [OAV101 IT],\u201d Putzki said.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nFrom the FDA\u2019s 2016 approval of Spinraza\u2014the first treatment for SMA\u2014to the greenlighting of a tablet version of Evrysdi last month, the past decade has seen considerable progress in treating the disease.\n\n\u201cWe have come from no treatment available to multiple treatment options available, and we have seen that the adoption in the community has been really rapid, and the treatment paradigm has evolved really quickly,\u201d Putzki said.\n\nAlso at the MDA conference, Scholar Rock presented new data from a Phase III trial of apitegromab, an antibody that inhibits myostatin activation in the hopes of providing a clinically meaningful improvement in motor function for SMA patients. In the SAPPHIRE trial, apitegromab met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement on the HFMSE. In a prespecified secondary endpoint, 30.4% of patients receiving apitegromab saw at least a 3-point improvement on this scale, versus 12.5% of placebo patients.\n\nOther companies with SMA drugs in development include Biohaven, which is developing a myostatin and activin receptor blocker called taldefgrobep alfa\u2014though the candidate stumbled in Phase III in November 2024\u2014and NMD Pharma, which is testing NMDP-02, a ClC-1 ion channel inhibitor, in Phase II trials.\n\nDespite the progress, however, Putzki and Day agreed that there is still room for improvement.\n\nDay spoke of the need for better biomarkers. Almost all patients who receive a course-modifying treatment for SMA have residual motor deficits, he said. The question, he continued, is whether those residual deficits reflect a persistent deficiency of SMN or whether other factors are at play. If, for example, there is \u201can inadequate [number] of motor neurons . . . all the [SMN restoration] in the world is not [going to] resolve that.\u201d\n\nNeurofilament light (NfL) has recently garnered attention as a possible biomarker to show disease progression and monitor treatment responses in SMA patients. But Day isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cI just find it non-specific and insensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeally, we would have biomarkers that really reflected SMN content in different cell types.\u201d\n\nFor Putzki, the next step in SMA is to cover \u201cthe entire range of patients\u201d\u2014exactly what Novartis aims to do with OAV101 IT. \u201cCurrently, patients in that category, two to 18 years or older, they have to rely on chronic treatments\u201d that \u201ccome with a significant burden on the patients and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cSo having a one-time gene therapy available, I think takes a lot of this burden away.\u201d",

It was found that patients who received the gene therapy (n = 75) achieved a 2.39-point improvement on the HFMSE, whereas those who received the placebo (n = 51) showed only a 0.51 point improvement on the HFMSE (P=0.0074); as such, STEER met its primary end point. Novartis pointed out that results for the secondary end points did not reach statistical significance because of the preplanned multiple testing procedure, but that these findings \u201cconsistently favor\u201d OAV101 IT. Patients in the treatment group were aged 2.1 to 16.6 years (mean, 5.89) and patients in the placebo group were aged 2.4 to 14.2 years (mean, 5.87)\n\nWith regard to safety, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of special interest were reported to have a similar incidence between the treatment group and the placebo group. Upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia constituted the most common AEs in both groups. Pneumonia and vomiting constituted the most common SAEs in patients who received the gene therapy, whereas pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection constituted the most common SAEs in patients who received the placebo. Novartis stated that increased transaminase cases did not occur frequently, and those cases that did occur were for the most part transient and low grade. Hy\u2019s law cases did not occur in any patients.\n\nIn addition to the STEER data, Novartis also presented data from the phase 3b STRENGTH clinical trial (NCT05386680) evaluating OAV101 IT. STRENGTH treated children aged 2 to less than 18 years who had ceased receiving standard of care treatment in the form of nusinersen (Spinraza) or risdiplam. The trial included 27 patients aged 2.4 to 17.7 years of age (mean, 7.4).The patients who had previously been treated with risdiplam had been on that treatment for a mean of 2.98 years and the patients who had previously been treated with nusinersen had been on that treatment for a mean of 4.32 years. At 52 weeks of follow-up, patients showed a 1.05 increase in HFMSE least squares (LS) total score from baseline. Novartis stated that the overall population in the trial showed stabilization of HFMSE over 52 weeks.\n\nWith regard to safety it was noted that 48.1% of patients (n=13) had AEs deemed related to the treatment, but that no AEs in the study were fatal or led to discontinuation of participation.

In the Phase III STEER study, treatment with OAV101 IT led to a statistically significant 2.39-point improvement on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), a gold standard for SMA-specific assessment of motor ability and disease progression, vs. 0.51 points in the sham control arm (P=0.0074).1-5 In the Phase IIIb STRENGTH study, treatment with OAV101 IT in patients who have discontinued treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam demonstrated stabilization of motor function over 52 weeks of follow-up.\n\nThese data will be presented during the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical and Scientific Conference held in Dallas, Texas, from March 16\u201319, 2025. The results add to the growing body of evidence within the OAV101 IT development program, which has evaluated a broad population of over 170 patients with SMA, spanning a total of over 6.4 years across the STEER, STRENGTH and Phase I/II STRONG studies.6\n\n\"In the STEER study evaluating treatment-na\u00efve patients, OAV101 IT demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in motor function across a broad SMA population,\" said Crystal Proud, M.D., Pediatric Neurologist and a Principal Investigator at Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters. \"These results \u2013 paired with those in the STRENGTH study \u2013 support the potential for OAV101 IT to be a meaningful treatment option for people living with SMA with a goal of maintaining or improving motor function through a one-time therapy.\"\n\nOAV101 IT is an investigational gene replacement therapy designed to directly address the genetic root cause of the disease by replacing the nonworking SMN1 gene with a single dose. It is the first investigational gene replacement therapy to provide clinical benefit in both children and young adults with SMA with a favorable safety profile, underscoring the potential of this therapy to provide patients the opportunity to avoid repeated treatment administration.\n\n\"The data presented today from our OAV101 IT program reinforce our belief in this therapy, which has the potential to have a meaningful impact on a broad range of people with SMA through its continuous benefit via a one-time dose,\" said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., President, Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. \"Together with patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals, we are committed to continuing to advance our mission to lead innovation in SMA treatment and broaden therapy options with our gene replacement therapies.\"\n\nSTEER Study\n\nIn the registrational STEER study, efficacy and safety were studied in treatment-na\u00efve patients with SMA Type 2, aged two to less than 18 years who were able to sit, but had never walked independently. Results for OAV101 IT were compared against a sham control, a procedure designed to mimic the administration of an investigational drug, without delivering any active treatment. One hundred twenty-six (126) patients received either OAV101 IT (n=75) or a sham procedure (n=51). Mean (range) age at dosing was 5.89 (2.1\u201316.6) years in the treatment group and 5.87 (2.4\u201314.2) years in the sham arm. At the end of the 52-week period, all eligible patients had received both OAV101 IT and the sham procedure.\n\nKey findings:\n\nThe trial met its primary endpoint of change from baseline to 52 weeks in HFMSE score, with OAV101 IT demonstrating a statistically significant 2.39-point improvement on the HFMSE vs. 0.51 points in the sham group (overall difference, 1.88 points; P=0.0074).\n\nAll secondary endpoints consistently favor OAV101 IT, despite not achieving statistical significance due to the pre-planned multiple testing procedure.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of special interest was similar between both groups.\n\nThe most common AEs for both groups in the STEER study were upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia. The most frequent SAEs were pneumonia and vomiting for the OAV101 IT group and pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection for the sham group. Instances of transaminase increases were infrequent; most were low-grade and transient. There were no cases of Hy's law.\n\nSTRENGTH Study\n\nThe open label Phase IIIb STRENGTH study evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged two to less than 18 years who had discontinued treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam. In the study, 27 patients were enrolled with a mean (range) age of 7.4 years (2.4-17.7). Mean duration of prior risdiplam and nusinersen treatment were 2.98 and 4.32 years, respectively.\n\nKey findings:\n\nOAV101 IT demonstrated a favorable safety profile that was consistent with STEER study.\n\nThe motor endpoint of efficacy, HFMSE, demonstrated stabilization for the overall study population over 52 weeks.\n\nThe increase from baseline to 52 weeks in HFMSE least squares (LS) total score was 1.05.\n\nAll patients in the STRENGTH study experienced at least one AE. The most frequent AEs were common cold, pyrexia and vomiting. A total of 13 patients (48.1%) experienced AEs considered to be related to study treatment. No AEs leading to death or study discontinuation were reported.\n\nAbout OAV101 IT\n\nIntrathecal onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) is an investigational, one-time gene replacement therapy for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nNovartis has an exclusive, worldwide license with Nationwide Children's Hospital to both the intravenous and intrathecal delivery of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) gene replacement therapy for the treatment of all types of SMA; an exclusive, worldwide license from REGENXBIO for any recombinant AAV vector in its intellectual property portfolio for the in vivo gene replacement therapy treatment of SMA in humans; an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with G\u00e9n\u00e9thon for in vivo delivery of AAV9 vector into the central nervous system for the treatment of SMA.\n\nAbout Spinal Muscular Atrophy\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene, resulting in the irreversible loss of motor neurons, affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swallowing and basic movement.11-13 The severity of SMA varies across a spectrum of types that generally correspond to the number of copies the individual has of the SMN2 gene, which produces a small fraction (~10%) of functional SMN protein compared with SMN1.12 Loss of motor neurons cannot be reversed, so patients with SMA with symptoms at the time of treatment will likely require some supportive respiratory, nutritional and/or musculoskeletal care to maximize functional abilities.13\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As a result, the company said it will eliminate approximately 8,000 positions around the world, or about 7% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to Novartis, the changes should save at least $1 billion \u2014 as well as guarantee sales growth of at least 4% until 2025.\n\nThe broader shake-up has already affected nearly 400 employees in East Hanover between 2022 and 2023.\n\nPure focus\n\nUnder the plan, Novartis combined its pharmaceuticals and oncology business units into two separate commercial organizations with a stronger geographic focus:\n\nInnovative Medicines U.S.\n\nInnovative Medicines International\n\nAs a pure-play innovative medicines business, Novartis now has four core therapeutic areas:\n\nCardiovascular-renal-metabolic\n\nImmunology\n\nNeuroscience\n\nOncology\n\nAdditionally, the company completed the spinoff of its generics and biosimilars business Sandoz.\n\nNovartis also says it has \u201cmultiple significant in-market and pipeline assets in each of these areas\u201d that \u201caddress high disease burden and have substantial growth potential.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Novartis\u2019 latest quarterly earnings, CEO Vas Narasimhan said, \u201cIn our first full year as a pure-play innovative medicines company, Novartis delivered one of the strongest financial performances in our history, growing sales 12% cc [constant currency] and core operating income 22% cc [constant currency].\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also achieved important innovation milestones, including new approvals and readouts for many of the assets that will fuel our growth over the mid- to long-term. With the momentum we are seeing in the business, we expect to continue our strong sales growth with margin expansion in 2025 and we remain on track to deliver on our mid-term guidance.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we are focused on executing against our pipeline, including 15 submission-enabling readouts over the coming years and more than 30 assets with the potential to drive differentiated growth over the long term,\u201d he added in the Jan. 31 statement. \u201cWe remain balanced in our capital allocation approach and committed to creating sustainable value for shareholders.\u201d\n\nEvolving business\n\nCommenting on the newly announced job cuts in East Hanover, a company spokesperson told NJBIZ, \u201cNovartis continually assesses opportunities to drive growth and sustainable performance and create the greatest potential impact for patients and customers.\u201d\n\nThe media representative added, \u201cWe are committed to treating our people with fairness and respect and encourage affected employees to apply for open positions in other areas of our business.\u201d\n\nAhead of the upcoming loss of patent protection for its best-selling heart failure drug Entresto as well as continued growth of cholesterol medication Leqvio, the company is focused on evolving its cardiovascular portfolio.\n\nNew product launches are also on the horizon, including for pelacarsen. The therapy aims to reduce elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients with elevated levels and at risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cTo support this future portfolio, we have made changes to our CV commercialization model that optimize our support for patients throughout their treatment journey and simplify and strengthen how we engage with our customers. The new structure will be implemented April 1, 2025,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

The 427 layoffs will go into effect between June 13 and Oct. 24 this year, public filings show.\n\nIn 2022, Novartis said it would cut 8,000 jobs globally, Reuters reported, a move that would save the company $1 billion over the next two years. Additionally, the company spun off its generics and biosimilars unit Sandoz in 2023.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\nThis round of layoffs was triggered by that fact that Novartis\u2019 patent expired on Entresto, its heart condition medication, Meo said. In addition, the pharmaceutical giant has been shifting focus to its cholesterol medication Leqvio, and the launch of Pelacarsen, a cardiovascular medication.\n\nNovartis shrinking its Morris County campus\n\nR&O announced that it had acquired 62 acres of the former Novartis campus in 2021. At the time of the sale, the company planned to demolish 900,000 square feet of empty office space on the campus, including the iconic eight-story tower that sits atop a corner knoll on Route 10.\n\nNovartis still has operations in neighboring buildings to the south. The entire 202-acre Novartis campus before the sale was assessed at $425 million in 2021 and generated $10.2 million in property taxes for the township, tax records show.\n\nIn December 2024, business magazine Real Estate New Jersey reported that Morristown-based New Vernon Equities had acquired the site with plans to develop office space for life science and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nOver 13,000 layoffs across NJ in 2024\n\nNearly 100 New Jersey companies announced more than 13,300 layoffs combined in 2024, public records show, as white-collar sectors such as pharmaceuticals, banking and finance tightened job counts.\n\nNot all 13,332 people were necessarily out of a job. For example, a layoff notice was filed for 157 people from the Metropolitan YMCA in Wayne, but many of those workers were rehired.\n\nBig Lots said late in December that it was handing 385 workers the pink slip, but then announced a last-minute deal to keep 400 of its stores open.\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100 and Facebook",

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic type of arthritis that causes inflammation in the spine and other parts of the body. It can lead to a hunched posture and stiffness. Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is a type of inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and pelvis, characterized by inflammation that doesn't show up on X-rays but may be visible on MRI.\n\nSecukinumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1/\u03ba antibody against interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in various chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as plaque psoriasis. By blocking the actions of IL-17A, secukinumab works to inhibit the pro-inflammatory pathways that drive immune-mediated inflammatory disorders\n\nSecukinumab injection is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients who may benefit from receiving phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) or other treatments. It is also used alone or together with other medicines (e.g., methotrexate) to treat active psoriatic arthritis.\n\nAt the recent SEC meeting for analgesics and rheumatology held on February 25, 2025, the expert panel reviewed the justification for the waiver of the PMS study condition as part of the approval granted for additional indications of psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.\n\nAfter detailed deliberation, the committee reiterated its earlier recommendation for generating the PMS data in the country to assess patient safety for the indications of psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.\n\nAlso Read: Synokem Pharmaceutical Gets CDSCO Panel Nod To Study Anti-rheumatoid drug Iguratimod",

These therapies utilize RNA molecules to regulate gene expression, modify protein production, or replace faulty genetic instructions. The main types of RNA-based therapeutics include messenger RNA (mRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and RNA aptamers.\n\nmRNA therapies, exemplified by COVID-19 vaccines, instruct cells to produce specific proteins that trigger immune responses or treat genetic disorders. siRNA and miRNA therapies silence harmful genes by interfering with messenger RNA, making them promising for neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and rare genetic disorders. ASOs function by binding to target RNA sequences to modulate gene expression, while RNA aptamers act as targeted inhibitors or delivery agents.\n\nAdvancements in delivery technologies, including lipid nanoparticles and conjugation strategies, have improved the stability and effectiveness of RNA-based drugs. Regulatory approvals for RNA therapies, such as those for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, have validated their therapeutic potential.\n\nWith ongoing research into optimizing stability, specificity, and safety, RNA therapies hold promise for revolutionizing personalized medicine, oncology, infectious diseases, and rare genetic disorders, paving the way for the next generation of precision therapeutics.\n\nRNA Therapies Pipeline Analysis: Drug Profile\n\nLEQVIO: Novartis\n\nLEQVIO (inclisiran) is an injectable treatment given every six months to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. It is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy that targets a liver protein called PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9), which normally limits the number of receptors that remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. By blocking the translation of PCSK9 mRNA, LEQVIO decreases PCSK9 production, helping to lower LDL cholesterol levels. It is used alongside diet and statins to manage high LDL cholesterol in adults with elevated cholesterol or atherosclerosis. Novartis holds the global rights to develop, produce, and market LEQVIO through a partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a pioneer in RNA interference (RNAi) therapies.\n\nFind out more about FDA RNA therapies @ RNA Therapies Analysis\n\nRNA Therapies Market Dynamics\n\nThe RNA therapies market has seen rapid growth and significant interest in recent years, driven largely by advances in biotechnology, increasing investments in the development of novel therapies, and the success of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the potential to treat genetic disorders, cancers, infectious diseases, and other conditions that were previously considered untreatable, the RNA therapy market is expected to expand rapidly.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the market is the increasing prevalence of chronic and rare genetic diseases. RNA therapies are particularly effective in treating rare genetic disorders by correcting or modulating the expression of specific genes. For instance, the approval of treatments like SPINRAZA (for spinal muscular atrophy) and ONPATTRO (for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis) has validated the commercial viability and therapeutic impact of RNA-based drugs. Additionally, RNA therapeutics provide a promising approach for precision medicine, where treatments can be tailored to the genetic profile of an individual patient.\n\nOn the competitive front, the RNA therapy market is dominated by both established pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech startups. Major pharmaceutical players such as Moderna, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, and BioNTech have made significant strides in developing RNA therapies and are investing heavily in expanding their pipelines. This competitive landscape is further enriched by partnerships and collaborations between biotech companies and academic institutions, which are accelerating innovation and product development. However, challenges such as delivery mechanisms, safety concerns, and scalability of RNA-based therapies still remain critical hurdles that industry players need to address.\n\nRegulatory advancements and supportive government policies also contribute to the market\u2019s positive outlook. Regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA have shown a willingness to fast-track the approval of RNA-based treatments, particularly for life-threatening or rare diseases with limited treatment options. The success of mRNA vaccines has also built confidence in the safety and efficacy of RNA therapeutics, paving the way for a more streamlined regulatory process for future RNA-based drugs.\n\nTo know more about RNA therapies, visit @ RNA Therapies Market Insights\n\nA snapshot of the pipeline RNA therapies mentioned in the report:\n\nARO-APOC3: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals\n\nCemdisiran: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals\n\nSepofarsen: ProQR Therapeutics\n\nAB-729: Arbutus Biopharm\n\nSolbinsiran: Eli Lilly and Company\n\nHRS 5635: Fujian Shengdi Pharmaceutical\n\nARO-C3: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals\n\nDCR-AUD Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc\n\nJNJ-75220795 Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine\n\nOLX 702A: OliX Pharmaceuticals\n\nSTP 122G: Sirnaomics\n\nSGB-9768: SanegeneBio\n\nDiscover more about RNA therapies in clinical development @ RNA Therapies in Clinical Trials\n\nKey Developments in the RNA Therapies Domain\n\nIn July 2024, Rgenta Therapeutics announced the clearance of its IND by the FDA for RGT-61159, which is being developed for the potential treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors as well as acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nIn June 2024, Ascidian Therapeutics announced a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Roche for the discovery and development of RNA exon editing therapeutics targeting neurological diseases.\n\nIn May 2024, Achilles Therapeutics plc announced a research collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. to evaluate best-in-class, self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) targeting clonal neoantigens.

According to Yen, the findings from the second part of the trial, presented at AAD 2024, are particularly exciting.\n\nIn the trial, a significant proportion of patients maintained their response for 28 weeks. Specifically, 74% of those who continued on amlitelimab retained a Patient-Reported Itch Numerical Rating Scale (PPRNRS) score of \u22654, indicating a meaningful reduction in itch. In total, 63% of patients who were withdrawn from treatment also maintained this score.\n\n\"In those patients continuing on amlitelimab, 74% maintain this PPNRS greater than or equal to 4 score,\" Yen said. \"In the withdrawal arm, even more impressively, 63% of those patients still maintain their PPNRS greater than 4 score, demonstrating that amlitelimbab has the potential to provide durable, sustained efficacy, not just in patients on drug, but potentially off drug, as well.\"\n\nRIVER-AD Study: Promising Results for Patients Who Initially Did Not Respond\n\nThe RIVER-AD study served as an extension to the STREAM-AD trial and included patients who did not meet response criteria in part 1. These patients were given the opportunity to continue treatment in part 2 or, for those who had been on placebo, receive active treatment in the RIVER-AD extension study.\n\n\"What we showed is that with continued treatment, the majority of these patients actually did achieve a clinical response,\" Yen said.\n\nYen also pointed out that these results highlight amlitelimab's ability to provide clinical responses even in patients who had previously not responded to treatment.\n\nAmlitelimab\u2019s Mechanism of Action: Targeting OX40 Ligand\n\nOne of the key factors that sets amlitelimab apart from other treatments for AD is its novel mechanism of action, Yen said. Unlike many current therapies that target cytokines involved in inflammation, amlitelimab targets the OX40 ligand (OX40L), a critical mediator in immune cell signaling.\n\nThis upstream mechanism offers several advantages, including a reduced risk of off-target effects like immunosuppression, a common concern with some biologics. Additionally, targeting OX40L, rather than the OX40 receptor itself, spares regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in immune regulation and long-term disease modification.\n\nAmlitelimab and the Future of AD Treatment\n\n\"Amlitelimab has the opportunity to target a broader population than some of the existing therapies,\" Yen said. \"It also has this unprecedented opportunity to potentially have off-treatment, it can maintain off-treatment response, which is really very, very exciting for patients.\"\n\nSanofi is also exploring amlitelimab in other dermatologic conditions, including alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and systemic sclerosis.\n\nLooking ahead, Sanofi\u2019s ongoing phase 3 clinical program, OCEANA, aims to further investigate the safety and efficacy of amlitelimab in AD, including its long-term benefits and potential for off-drug remission.\n\nReferences",

Novartis will join the league and ACS in their commitment to help more people detect cancer early and address the unequal burden of cancer in under-resourced communities. This is critical as some cancers can be identified early, before they have had a chance to grow and spread. In fact, the 5-year survival rate for many cancers is over 90% when detected early, which means knowing your risk and getting screened are imperative to improving outcomes.1 To learn more about Crucial Catch, visit NFL.com/CrucialCatch.\n\n\"At the NFL, we're always looking for new ways to provide the highest level of care to our players, including through collaboration with experts across the medical field.

This ground-breaking study will leverage Folia\u2019s cutting-edge technology platform, allowing participants to track changes and quality of life impacts based on the symptoms most relevant to them- whether commonly associated with IgAN or not- alongside their individual treatment plan during an initial six-month observational period. By enabling participants to self-select and define what\u2019s most relevant to them, rather than relying solely on pre-specified patient-reported outcomes (PROs), this approach provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the lived experiences of IgAN.\n\nThis study is the first real-world data program designed to capture the at-home experiences of individuals and caregivers managing IgAN. Developed in collaboration with IgAN patients themselves, it directly measures patient-defined burden and evaluates the impact of various treatments on quality of life. As new therapies for IgAN become available, these insights will provide a timely and valuable understanding of real-world day-to-day experiences and treatment outcomes in this population.\n\nThrough the Folia platform, IgAN patients and caregivers can actively engage with their own study observations, gaining deeper insights into their symptom burden, treatment effects, and acute health events. The Folia app can generate tracking summary reports, allowing users to easily visualize their changes over time- such as symptom severity trends, frequency of flare-ups, and treatment responses. Folia can also overlay treatment usage with symptom severity and patients can export visual reports to share with their care teams.\n\nThis study is entirely remote, eliminating the need for clinic visits while still enabling participants to use their tracked data during medical appointments, ensuring that real-world insights can directly inform their care.\n\n\u201cThe point of Folia is to provide a tool to help people with chronic conditions take more control over their care, and understand how their treatment plan is working for them. We're excited to bring these capabilities to kidney disease with this IgAN program, and look forward to the insights on treatment effectiveness and living with IgAN that our participants share with our research teams,\" said Nell Meosky Luo, the CEO & Founder of Folia Health.",

But this year in the US alone, more than 310,000 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and nearly 43,000 will die of the disease. We can do better.\n\nTogether with Susan G. Komen, Novartis is proud to announce the creation and launch of the Alliance for Breast Cancer Policy. The coalition comprises more than 20 partner organizations and is the only group focused on advancing patient-centered policy solutions to help improve outcomes for breast cancer patients. This work will include the federal Access to Breast Cancer Diagnosis Act, which aims to reduce financial barriers to care by requiring private health plans, including high-deductible plans, to fully cover the cost of diagnostic and supplemental breast imaging.\n\nAfter more than 30 years of working to develop transformative treatments for this disease, our understanding of the needs of people touched by breast cancer and those who care for them continues to grow. As the sole industry sponsor and member on the Alliance\u2019s Steering Committee, Novartis is committed to the coalition\u2019s mission to remove barriers to breast cancer care and improve health outcomes for patients to transform breast cancer care through policy innovation.\n\n\"Despite the great strides that have been made in screening and treating breast cancer, several barriers remain that hinder timely access to quality care,\" said Reshema Kemps-Polanco, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Novartis US. \"We have a long history of pioneering breast cancer research and now, through this partnership, we take a significant step forward to address challenges faced by patients and families that go beyond the medicine. Together, we can drive meaningful change for generations to come.\"\n\nThe coalition will also focus on more accurately capturing the experiences of people living with metastatic breast cancer (mBC), ultimately helping equip policymakers with data to improve access to treatment and resourcing to support the health outcomes for those individuals with mBC.\n\nCollaborating with the Broader Breast Cancer Community\n\nAddressing the devastating toll of breast cancer requires a broad, collaborative approach, especially with breast cancer incidence rates remaining on the rise and diagnoses happening in younger women. Novartis has a longstanding collaboration with Susan G. Komen and other members of the coalition, and we are proud founding members of the Alliance for Breast Cancer Policy\u2019s steering committee.\n\nIn addition to our policy work through the coalition, we continue to work alongside our advocacy partners, health care providers, and other members of the community to champion transformative progress for people affected by the disease. This includes our work to:\n\nLeverage cutting-edge technology to enhance clinical trial representation, enrollment efforts, and data collection to gather more accurate and relevant scientific insights across geographies and patient demographics;\n\nImprove access and support across the breast cancer journey for patients from all communities and backgrounds;\n\nBridge care gaps between people in historically underserved groups and providers in order to improve outcomes;\n\nPromote awareness about risk factors and the importance of routine screening among women at risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nLearn more about our ongoing commitment to breast cancer care.",

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\n\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novartis (NVS)\n\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of varied drugs that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. It continues to build depth in core therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, renal and metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology in geographies like the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Novartis\u2019 efforts to strengthen its wide portfolio by developing breakthrough treatments have made it even more formidable in this space. Kesimpta, Pluvicto, Scemblix, Kisqali, Leqvio and Fabhalta should fuel growth.\n\nNVS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 13.15; value investors should take notice.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.04 to $8.47 per share. NVS boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.3%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, NVS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Novartis AG (NVS)?\n\nBefore you invest in Novartis AG (NVS), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

There are more milestones ahead that will potentially make CARVYKTI available to even more patients,\u201d said Ying Huang, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Legend Biotech. \u201cCARVYKTI has already helped thousands of multiple myeloma patients. Even though CARVYKTI is the market leader for CAR-T in multiple myeloma, we are still working relentlessly to elevate our commercial, manufacturing, regulatory and clinical efforts. While we are focused on executing with excellence for CARVYKTI this year, we continue to prioritize the right investments to enhance our opportunities as a stand-alone cell therapy company for the long term.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Business Developments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreated over 5,000 clinical and commercial patients to date.\n\n\n\nTreated over 5,000 clinical and commercial patients to date.\n\n\n\nAnnounced positive three-year follow-up data from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study showing that CARVYKTI\n\n\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\nincreased the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates when compared to the standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

This increase of $18.3 million was primarily driven by the license revenue recognized in 2024 pursuant to Legend Biotech\u2019s license agreement with Novartis for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of LB2102 and other potential CAR-T therapies selectively targeting DLL-3 (the \u201cNovartis License Agreement\u201d), and since the license agreement was effective as of December 28, 2023, no license revenue was recognized in 2023. License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $138.4 million, compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase of $103.2 million was primarily driven by the license revenue recognized in 2024 pursuant to the Novartis License Agreement, as well as the nature and timing of milestones achieved as outlined under the Janssen Agreement for cilta-cel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, was $168.0 million and $482.6 million, respectively, compared to $79.4 million and $249.8 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $88.6 million and $232.8 million for the three months and year ended, respectively, was due to an increase in revenue generated from sales of CARVYKTI\n\n\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\nin connection with the Janssen Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, was $0.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively, compared to $0.0 million and $0.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Other revenue primarily includes payments made in connection with the supply of materials by us to Novartis under the terms of the Novartis License Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Collaboration Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of collaboration revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, was $69.4 million and $216.4 million, respectively, compared to $32.5 million and $144.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $36.9 million and $72.2 million for the three months and year ended, respectively, were due to a combination of Legend Biotech\u2019s share of the cost of sales in connection with CARVYKTI\n\n\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\nsales under the Janssen Agreement and expenditures to support expansion in manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of License and Other Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of license and other revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, was $4.5 million and $18.2 million, respectively, and consisted of costs in connection with the Novartis License Agreement. The Company did not incur any costs of license and other revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, were $104.4 million and $413.5 million, respectively, compared to $105.7 million and $382.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $31.3 million for the year ended was primarily due to research and development activities in cilta-cel, including start-up costs for clinical production in Belgium, as well as continued investment in our solid tumor programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, were $34.2 million and $136.8 million, respectively, compared to $28.7 million and $106.8 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $5.5 million and $30.0 million for the three months and year ended, respectively, was primarily due to the expansion of administrative functions and the additional headcount needed to provide administrative support as a result of the company's expanded infrastructure, driven by increased manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling and Distribution Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling and distribution expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, were $48.9 million and $147.5 million, respectively, compared to $33.7 million and $94.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $15.2 million and $53.3 million for the three months and year ended, respectively was primarily driven by an increase in costs associated with commercial activities for cilta-cel, including the expansion of the sales force and second line indication launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Income and Gains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income and gains for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, were $125.1 million and $173.1 million, respectively, compared to $18.5 million and $58.1 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase of $106.6 million and $115.0 million for the three months and year ended, respectively, were primarily attributable to an increase in unrealized foreign exchange gains related to the changes in the intercompany loan balances and cash balances as a result of exchange rate changes between USD and Euro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, there were no expenses, compared to $38.4 million and $28.5 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $38.4 million and $28.5 million for the three months and year ended, respectively, were primarily due to unrealized foreign currency exchange loss related to the changes in the intercompany loan balances and cash balances as a result of exchange rate changes between USD and Euro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income or loss for the Period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, net income was $26.3 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $144.8 million, or $0.40 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $171.1 million for the three months ended was primarily attributable to unrealized foreign currency exchange gains due to changes in the intercompany loan balances and cash balances as a result of exchange rate changes between USD and Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net loss was $177.0 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to a net loss of $518.3 million, or $1.47 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Net Loss for the Period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $59.1 million, or an adjusted net loss of $0.16 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $88.5 million, or an adjusted net loss of $0.24 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, adjusted net loss was $188.8 million, or an adjusted net loss of $0.52 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss $335.7 million, or an adjusted net loss of $0.95 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebcast/Conference Call Details:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend Biotech will host its quarterlyearnings calland webcast today at 8:00am ET.

OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS MEASURES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share (which we sometimes refer to as \u201cANI per Share\u201d) as performance metrics. Adjusted Net Loss and ANI per Share are not defined under IFRS, are not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS, and are subject to important limitations. Our use of Adjusted Net Loss has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted Net Loss does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) excludes unrealized foreign exchange gain (loss) which was primarily resulted from changes in the intercompany loan balances and cash balances as a result of exchange rate changes between USD and EURO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Net Loss does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Loss excludes such as share based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, our definition of Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we believe that providing information concerning Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share enhances an investor\u2019s understanding of our financial performance. We use Adjusted Net Loss as a performance metric that guides management in its operation of and planning for the future of the business. We believe that Adjusted Net Loss provides a useful measure of our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We define Adjusted Net Loss as net loss adjusted for (1) non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, share based compensation, impairment loss and fair value loss of warrant liability and (2) unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss mainly related to intercompany loan balances and cash deposit balances as a result of exchange rate changes between USD and EUR.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Net Loss per Share is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Loss by the weighted average shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEGEND BIOTECH CORPORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(UNAUDITED)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS$\u2019000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Income (Loss)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26,284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(144,818\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(177,026\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(518,254\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6,796\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,351\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23,359\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20,451\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare based compensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,388\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12,589\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68,941\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47,680\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpairment loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,423\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,423\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain)/loss (included in Other Expenses, other income and gains)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(109,975\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38,332\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(108,509\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28,645\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair value loss of warrant liability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85,750\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(59,084\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(88,546\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(188,812\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(335,728\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANI per share:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANI per share - basic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANI per share - diluted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article was originally published on Quiver News , read the full story\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Some 37 corporate-backed startups were bought in February in sectors ranging from semiconductors and skincare to pharma and robots.\n\nGCV\u2019s data on exits for corporate-backed startups in February shows that the market is in a strong position relative to the last two years, even though exits were lower than the January 2025 and December 2024 figures.\n\nThere were 44 exits in February, compared with 56 in January and 47 in December. A large part of the drop from January is accounted for by a fall in US exits, of which there were 12 fewer in February.\n\nBut although February\u2019s exit tally was lower, it still represents an uptick over the past two years.\n\nThe total capital raised \u2014 where the size of the exits was disclosed \u2014 is not such a clear story of strength, however. While the $2.78bn total is nearly double the February 2024 figure, with a 76% increase in exits, it is still towards the lower end of the monthly totals seen over the last year.\n\nThe exits makeup was skewed towards acquisitions, as is often the case, with 37 in the month. There were four IPOs \u2014 a modest amount, but more than we saw in any of the last three months.\n\nThe top 5 acquisitions\n\nAnthos Therapeutics\n\nAnthos Therapeutics, which makes pharmaceuticals treating cardiovascular disease, was acquired by its former investor Novartis, for $925m in cash upfront, with up to $2.15bn in development and sales milestones agreed.\n\nNovartis, one of the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical companies, made two large acquisitions in 2024 as well. It acquired the German biotech MorphoSys for $2.9bn in February 2024 and Mariana Oncology for $1bn in May.\n\nMorphoSys\u2019s drug pipeline covers a range of diseases, but many of its in-house developments \u2014 like Mariana Oncology \u2014 focus on cancer. Cancer treatment is often at the heart of Novartis\u2019s strategic collaborations, including through CVC investments and joint venture agreements. GCV\u2019s CVC Funding Round Database does not record any recent investments in cardiovascular disease-focused startups.\n\nMantl\n\nMantl, a fintech company which provides a platform for banking customers to open an account on any device, was acquired by Alkami, a digital banking solutions provider, in a $400m deal.\n\nOne of Mantl\u2019s previous investors was Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Alphabet is frequently the most prolific corporate investor in GCV\u2019s monthly data roundups. When investing in fintech, it often targets payment technology companies. For example, last year it took part in the $430m funding round for the UK digital bank Monzo.\n\nMinimalist\n\nUK consumer products giant Unilever acquired the Indian skincare brand Minimalist for $350m, in which it had previously been an investor. Minimalist brands itself as having simple solutions to skincare problems and transparency through highlighting the main active ingredient on the packaging.\n\nUnilever had invested via Unilever Ventures, its CVC arm, which has offices in Mumbai and London. It has made a number of strategic investments into Indian cosmetics startups, including the $5m series A round for RAS, a luxury skincare brand, in January, and the $4m series A raise for the hair care brand Arata in December 2024.\n\nKinara\n\nUS semiconductor startup Kinara, which makes AI processors for machine learning, was acquired by the Dutch multinational chipmaker NXP Semiconductors for $307m. One of Kinara\u2019s earlier investors is the American-Taiwanese semiconductor and solid-state drive maker Silicon Motion.\n\nNXP was also featured in GCV\u2019s January exits roundup, when it acquired TTTech Auto, an Austrian autotech software developer. Kinara serves a broader market, designing chips for edge AI applications, where generative AI can run on devices such as medical equipment, industrial machines or security cameras.\n\nDrata\n\nDrata, a US compliance automation company, acquired SafeBase for $250m. SafeBase makes a cybersecurity assessment tool that helps its customers to perform security reviews.\n\nSafeBase was previously backed by Comcast, the US media company, and Zoom, the video conferencing software developer.\n\nIPOs: Healthcare and robotics\n\nHealthcare startups led the way for corporate-backed startup exits on the IPO market in February, accounting for three of the four recorded for the month.\n\nMaze Therapeutics\n\nMaze Therapeutics raised $140m. It is a US pharmaceutical startup that makes precision medicines, where genetic makeup is considered, for more targeted treatment. One of its most advanced treatment programmes in development aims to treat a form of kidney disease that certain gene variants make more likely; Maze claims the variation could affect 13% of African Americans.\n\nThe startup\u2019s earlier investors include Alphabet, which often invests in healthcare. In 2024 it took part in the funding round for a number of precision medicine biotech startups, including Santa Ana Bio and Accent Therapeutics, which make immunology and cancer therapies, respectively.\n\nAardvark Therapeutics\n\nAnother US healthcare startup, Aardvark Therapeutics went public, raising an undisclosed amount. It also targets metabolic diseases, developing small molecule therapies for obesity and rare genetic disorders.\n\nOne of the drugs Aardvark is developing is a weight-loss pill designed to treat hunger. It will go beyond just activating the GLP-1 hormone, which is how market-leading weight loss drugs currently operate, and will also stimulate CCK, another hormone which is thought could combat some of the GLP-1 drug-induced side effects.\n\nBioVersys\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s BioVersys was the third corporate-backed healthcare startup to IPO, raising $99.1m.\n\nThe company makes antibiotics designed to combat drug-resistant infections. For example, its pipeline includes a drug for treating tuberculosis, an infectious disease that was nearly eradicated by effective antibiotic treatments before multidrug-resistant strains became more common in the 1980s.\n\nRoboSense\n\nRoboSense, a Chinese robotics company that makes components for robotics that are used in the automotive industry, raised $128.6m in its IPO.\n\nOne of the startup\u2019s investors was BAIC Motor, a Chinese carmaker. BAIC has invested in a number of robotics and autotech startups since 2023, including Tongyu Automotive, which makes AI-based driving systems, and GalaxyBot, which makes robots designed to carry out human labour tasks like factory work.",

The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced revenue from Neurocrine and Novartis collaboration agreements.\n\nThe company posted a net loss of $34.5 million for Q4 2024, compared to a net income of $56.4 million in Q4 2023. For the full year, the net loss was $65.0 million, contrasting with a net income of $132.3 million in 2023. The decline in net income was mainly due to the decrease in collaboration revenue.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses increased to $35.6 million in Q4 2024 from $25.8 million in Q4 2023, and to $127.4 million for the full year 2024 from $92.2 million in 2023. The rise in R&D expenses was driven by increased program-related spending and higher facilities costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $9.0 million for Q4 2024, slightly down from $10.2 million in Q4 2023. For the full year, G&A expenses remained stable at $35.9 million compared to $35.8 million in 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Voyager's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $332.4 million.\n\nBusiness and Operational Highlights\n\nVoyager has made notable progress in its tau-targeting programs. The tau silencing gene therapy VY1706 showed promising results in a non-human primate study, reducing tau mRNA levels by 50% to 73% across the cerebral cortex. The company plans to present additional data at the ADPD conference in April 2025.\n\nThe anti-tau antibody VY7523 demonstrated acceptable safety and pharmacokinetics in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Initial tau PET imaging data from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study are expected in the second half of 2026.\n\nVoyager has extended its cash runway into mid-2027 by reassessing its gene therapy program for ALS and no longer advancing VY9323, its previous lead development candidate for the program.\n\nStrategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments\n\nVoyager is focusing on advancing its gene therapy programs in collaboration with partners like Neurocrine and Novartis. The company anticipates IND filings for gene therapies targeting GBA1 Parkinson\u2019s and Friedreich\u2019s ataxia in 2025. Additionally, U.S. IND and Canadian CTA filings for the tau silencing gene therapy VY1706 are expected in 2026.\n\nManagement's Perspective\n\nAlfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Voyager, highlighted the significant advancements in the company's tau-targeting programs and the progress in its partnered gene therapy portfolio. He emphasized the strong cash position, which is expected to support the company through multiple value-creating milestones into mid-2027.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nVoyager expects to present additional data on its tau silencing gene therapy and anti-tau antibody at the ADPD conference in April 2025. The company also anticipates informative data read-outs from third parties on anti-tau antibody and tau silencing antisense oligonucleotide in 2025 and 2026. Initial tau PET imaging data from the MAD clinical trial of VY7523 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease are expected in the second half of 2026.\n\nSEC Filing: Voyager Therapeutics, Inc.

The subject expert committee (SEC) has asked the Swiss drugmaker to \u201csubmit a revised protocol\" as experts believed that the patients are subjected to \u201cmany investigations\" in the clinical trial which are not relevant to the progress of the diseases and the mechanism of effect of the drug.\n\nNovartis has presented a phase 2a clinical study of its drug Iptacopan which is used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a type of anaemia where an excessive breakdown of red blood cells occurs, resulting in insufficient healthy cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body.\n\nrelated stories\n\nThe drug was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as it is a first-in-class complement inhibitor for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin. The drug reduces protein in the urine (proteinuria) in adults with chronic kidney disease.\n\nAccording to the minutes of the meeting, \u201cCommittee opined that justification of exposing the patients to invasive procedure (biopsy) is not clear; moreover, it seems procedure is without any clear therapeutic advantage.\"\n\n\u201cIt is not clear how to define inadequate biopsy and what action to be taken if it is inadequate. Repeat biopsy seems to be difficult in such cases. It has been observed that patients are subjected to many investigations like exploratory transcriptomics, multiparametric renal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), many biomarker, potential predictive markers, biomarkers of tubular injury and genetics studies. etc which are not relevant to the progress of the diseases and the mechanism of action and effect of this drug,\" the panel noted.\n\n\u201cLooking to these investigations it seems the objectives and methodology are not focused\u2026,\" the panel noted while concluding \u201cKeeping in view of the above points committee opined that the firm should submit a revised protocol with detail methodology aligning with the specific objectives for further review by the committee.\"\n\nReviewing SEC Observations: Novartis\n\nOn being asked how the company plans to go ahead post SEC observations, Novartis spokesperson told News18, \u201cAs you will understand, it is quite early to comment on the next steps.\"\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of reviewing the minutes by the SEC and post consultation with our global teams, we will take the necessary next steps,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nIt went ahead adding that the efficacy of the drug is already established in the bigger trials and in India, the company is planning only a small study.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we would like to point out that the said trial for LNP023 (iptacopan) is a small sample size study to investigate into deeper mechanisms that may possibly contribute to the already established efficacy of the medicine amongst patients with IgA nephropathy,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cAs you understand, this molecule has demonstrated positive phase III outcomes for patients with IgA nephropathy for the primary endpoints of the trial post which Novartis has received US FDA accelerated approval for iptacopan, the first and only complement inhibitor, for the reduction of proteinuria in primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN). As we move forward, patient safety and improved outcomes will continue to remain our priority,\" Novartis said.\n\nFirst Published: March 11, 2025, 10:51 IST",

            "content": "Molecular Partners ((CH:MOLN)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nMolecular Partners\u2019 recent earnings call painted a picture of both progress and challenges. The company showcased significant advancements in its pipeline, particularly with its radio DARPin franchise and T cell engager 533, while maintaining a robust financial position. However, the discontinuation of the Novartis collaboration and its impact on revenue were notable setbacks.\n\nSuccessful Execution of 2024 Program Goals\n\nMolecular Partners made significant strides in advancing their radio DARPin franchise. The lead compound, DLL3 targeting 712, successfully passed all IND-enabling studies and is now ready for clinical trials. Additionally, the company selected mesothelin as a new target and expanded its collaboration with Orano Med, securing 10 slots for the Lead-212 isotope.\n\nPositive Financial Health\n\nThe company concluded 2024 with a cash balance of CHF 149 million, which is expected to support operations into 2027. They bolstered their financial position by raising CHF 20 million through financing, maintaining a solid financial base with no debt.\n\nEncouraging Clinical Results and Pipeline Progression\n\nThe T cell engager 533 demonstrated significant improvements in efficacy with new dosing strategies. This resulted in 3 complete responses out of 8 patients treated beyond day 12, highlighting the potential of this program.\n\nNovartis Collaboration Setback\n\nThe collaboration with Novartis was discontinued as the targets did not progress as expected. This decision was mutual and based on strategic interests, marking a notable setback for the company.\n\nRevenue Decline from Novartis Collaboration\n\nThe revenue for 2024 was impacted by the conclusion of the Novartis collaboration, with CHF 5 million recognized as the last part of the upfront payment. No further revenue is expected from this source, highlighting a decline in this area.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Molecular Partners provided guidance on several fronts. They anticipate operating expenses between CHF 55 million and CHF 65 million, excluding potential partnership payments. The company is focused on advancing its radio DARPin programs, particularly MP0712, with clinical trials and initial imaging data expected by year-end. Additionally, they aim to progress with the T cell engager program, MP0533, in AML, with new dosing amendments and outcomes anticipated by year-end.\n\nIn summary, Molecular Partners\u2019 earnings call highlighted a mix of progress and challenges. While the company made significant advancements in its pipeline and maintained a strong financial position, the discontinuation of the Novartis collaboration impacted revenue. Looking forward, the company remains focused on advancing its key programs and maintaining its financial health.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Dublin, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Zollinger Ellison Syndrome Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Zollinger Ellison Syndrome market was valued at USD 1.34 billion in 2024 driven by innovations in treatment options across the 8 major markets. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.40% during the forecast period of 2025-2034 and attain a market value of USD 2.07 billion by 2034.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Zollinger Ellison syndrome market features key players such as Novartis AG, GSK Plc, Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc., and Bristol Myers Squibb Company, which are leading the development of proton pump inhibitors and other therapies that help manage excessive gastric acid production. Companies like Mylan N.V., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc are focused on delivering innovative treatment solutions for rare disorders. Additionally, Lupin Limited, Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited, and Baxter International Inc. are actively involved in expanding treatment options for patients suffering from Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nZollinger Ellison Syndrome Market Trends\n\n\n\nThe industry is evolving rapidly, driven by technological innovations and advancements in various practices. As continuous research uncovers new insights across sectors, several key trends are emerging, shaping the future direction of the market. These trends are expected to significantly influence the landscape, improving outcomes, enhancing precision, and expanding access to advanced solutions across products, therapies, and services.\n\nRising Adoption of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)\n\nThe market is witnessing increased usage of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, for managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome. PPIs are considered the first line of treatment, given their ability to effectively reduce gastric acid production. With ongoing advancements in drug formulations, these inhibitors are becoming more efficient in controlling symptoms, thereby driving demand. The growing prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders is also contributing to the increased use of PPIs worldwide.\n\nIncreasing Focus on Personalised Treatment Approaches\n\nAs medical research progresses, personalised treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome is gaining traction. Healthcare providers are increasingly focusing on tailored therapies, where treatment is designed based on a patient's specific genetic makeup and disease progression. This trend has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly, with therapies being adjusted to maximise effectiveness. As the global healthcare industry shifts towards precision medicine, personalised approaches are becoming a cornerstone in rare disease management.\n\nEmergence of Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures\n\nWith advancements in medical technologies, minimally invasive surgical procedures are emerging as a crucial trend in the treatment of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. These procedures, particularly for removing gastrin-producing tumours, offer benefits such as reduced recovery times, fewer complications, and improved patient comfort. As patient demand for less invasive options grows, healthcare providers are increasingly adopting advanced surgical techniques, contributing to the overall growth of the market.\n\nGrowing Investments in Rare Disease Research\n\nGovernments and pharmaceutical companies are making substantial investments in research related to rare diseases, including Zollinger Ellison syndrome. The rising focus on developing novel therapeutic interventions for rare conditions is accelerating the discovery of new drugs and improving diagnostic methodologies. This increased funding is expected to drive innovations in treatment options, offering more effective solutions for patients and expanding the market over the coming years.\n\nIncreased Use of Combination Therapies\n\nThe use of combination therapies, involving both medication and surgical interventions, is becoming more common in the management of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. By combining different treatment modalities, healthcare providers can achieve better control over the disease's progression, improving patient outcomes. This trend is expected to drive demand for multi-faceted treatment approaches as patients seek comprehensive solutions that offer long-term relief.\n\nExpanding Role of Online Pharmacies\n\nThe growing adoption of e-commerce platforms for pharmaceutical products is transforming the distribution of treatments for Zollinger Ellison syndrome. Online pharmacies are gaining popularity due to the convenience they offer, allowing patients to easily access medications such as PPIs and other therapies. This trend is particularly notable in regions where access to specialised medical treatments may be limited, and it is expected to play a significant role in expanding access to care globally.\n\nMarket Drivers\n\nRising Prevalence of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome: The increasing incidence of Zollinger Ellison syndrome, a rare disorder characterised by excessive gastric acid secretion, is driving demand for effective treatment options. This rise is likely linked to better diagnostic methods and heightened awareness of the condition, encouraging growth in the market as more patients seek specialised care.\n\nAdvancements in Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): Ongoing developments in proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as improved drug formulations that enhance the effectiveness and duration of acid suppression, are boosting market growth. These advancements are making treatments more accessible and effective, leading to higher adoption rates among healthcare providers and patients alike.\n\nImproved Diagnostic Techniques: Technological advancements in diagnostic methods for Zollinger Ellison syndrome, such as endoscopic ultrasound and imaging techniques, are enabling early and accurate detection. This improvement in diagnosis is driving demand for targeted treatments, as early intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes and disease management.\n\nIncreasing Healthcare Expenditure: Rising healthcare spending across developed and developing regions is positively impacting the market for Zollinger Ellison syndrome treatments. Governments and healthcare providers are allocating more resources towards rare diseases, allowing for better access to advanced treatments and medications, which is supporting the growth of the market.\n\nGrowing Focus on Rare Diseases: There is an increasing global emphasis on researching and addressing rare diseases, including Zollinger Ellison syndrome. Government initiatives, combined with support from pharmaceutical companies, are fostering innovation in this sector, with new drugs and treatment approaches being developed to meet the unique needs of patients suffering from this condition.\n\nChallenges\n\nHigh Cost of Treatment: The treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome, particularly when it involves advanced medications and surgeries, can be prohibitively expensive for many patients. This high cost acts as a barrier to accessing care, especially in lower-income regions, which poses a significant challenge to market growth despite the availability of effective therapies.\n\nLimited Awareness in Developing Regions: Awareness of Zollinger Ellison syndrome remains limited in many developing countries, where healthcare systems may not prioritise rare diseases. This lack of awareness among both healthcare providers and patients leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, thereby hindering market growth and preventing patients from receiving timely care.\n\nAdverse Side Effects of Medications: While proton pump inhibitors and other treatments are effective in managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome, they may also cause adverse side effects in some patients, including gastrointestinal disturbances and long-term nutrient deficiencies. These side effects can deter patients from adhering to prescribed treatments, limiting market expansion.\n\nComplexity of Disease Management: Managing Zollinger Ellison syndrome often requires a combination of medications, surgeries, and ongoing monitoring, making treatment complex and time-consuming. This complexity can lead to non-compliance among patients, particularly those with co-morbidities, creating a challenge for healthcare providers in ensuring consistent and effective disease management.\n\nStringent Regulatory Approvals: The development and approval of new therapies for Zollinger Ellison syndrome face stringent regulatory scrutiny to ensure safety and efficacy. This can delay the introduction of innovative treatments into the market, slowing down potential advancements in patient care and limiting the availability of cutting-edge therapies.\n\nFuture Opportunities\n\nDevelopment of Targeted Therapies: There is significant potential for pharmaceutical companies to develop targeted therapies that address the unique needs of Zollinger Ellison syndrome patients, particularly in the areas of gastrin-secreting tumour management.\n\nExpanding Healthcare Infrastructure in Emerging Markets: The growth of healthcare infrastructure in emerging markets, such as Asia Pacific and Latin America, presents opportunities for increased access to diagnostics and treatment for Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nIncreased Research Funding for Rare Diseases: Government and private sector initiatives focused on rare diseases are likely to increase research funding, creating opportunities for the development of innovative treatments for Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\n\nPersonalised Medicine: The rise of personalised medicine, which tailors treatment based on individual patient profiles, offers significant opportunities to improve outcomes for Zollinger Ellison syndrome patients through customised therapeutic approaches.\n\nGrowing Role of Online Pharmacies: With the expansion of digital healthcare services, online pharmacies are expected to play a more prominent role in the distribution of Zollinger Ellison syndrome medications, increasing patient access to treatments in remote regions.\n\nZollinger Ellison Syndrome Market Segmentation\n\nMarket Breakup by Treatment\n\nMedication\n\nEsomeprazole\n\nDexlansoprazole\n\nLansoprazole\n\nOmeprazole\n\nPantoprazole\n\nRabeprazole\n\nSurgery\n\nCancer Therapies\n\nChemotherapy\n\nRadiation Therapy\n\nMarket Breakup by Distribution Channel\n\nHospital Pharmacy\n\nRetail Pharmacy\n\nOnline Pharmacies\n\nOthers\n\nMarket Breakup by Region\n\nUnited States\n\nEU-4 and the United Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nJapan\n\nIndia\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 250 Forecast Period 2024 - 2032 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.4 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2032 $2 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.5% Regions Covered Global\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/7q0o5z\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Feel free to contact Angela Gabriel at angela.gabriel@biospace.com.\n\nGRO Biosciences\n\nMarch 14\n\nGRO Biosciences began exploring strategic alternatives about six months after raising a Series B funding round and recently cut an undisclosed number of employees, including research staff, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based synthetic biology company founded in 2016 also no longer lists two key executives on its leadership page, Fierce noted: Daniel Mandell, the founding CEO, and Christopher Gregg, the chief scientific officer.\n\nBorn out of genetics professor George Church\u2019s lab at Harvard University, GRO Biosciences closed its Series B round in July 2024, raising $60.3 million to help advance its pipeline and further develop its platform. The company planned to use the money mostly to start a Phase I clinical trial for its lead program ProGly-Uricase, an investigational enzyme-based therapy that had been proposed for severe and refractory gout. GRO is now exploring strategic alternatives to advance that program, Fierce reported.\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarch 7\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals let go about 25% of its workforce this quarter, a cost-cutting move that\u2019s expected to save roughly $15 million through 2027, the company announced March 6. The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey.

The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6.

However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

(Novartis) welcomes the Government of Alberta's decision to publicly reimburse Pluvicto\u2122 (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan injection) for eligible patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). With this announcement, Alberta joins Ontario and Nova Scotia in providing public access to this radioligand therapy, expanding treatment options for patients across Canada.\n\nThe addition of Pluvicto\u2122 to Alberta's publicly funded treatments provides access to this radioligand therapy for eligible individuals with PSMA-mCRPC who have previously received androgen receptor pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.\n\n\"Alberta's government is committed to improving access to life-prolonging treatments for all Albertans, especially those battling advanced prostate cancer. By adding Pluvicto\u2122 to Alberta's publicly funded treatments, we are ensuring that patients have expanded access to a novel therapy that can improve clinical outcomes. This decision reinforces our commitment to providing innovative, evidence-based care and supporting the health and well-being of Albertans,\" said Alberta Health Minister, Adriana LaGrange.\n\nThis announcement represents a key advancement for patients with advanced prostate cancer in Alberta, with the public reimbursement of Pluvicto\u2122 recognized by clinicians and patient advocacy groups as a notable milestone in addressing an unmet medical need.\n\n\"This is an important development for Albertans with advanced prostate cancer who have run out of other options,\" said Calgary-based medical oncologist Dr. Steven Yip. \"This decision helps address a significant gap in our treatment landscape, offering a vital option for patients with few alternatives. For my patients who have exhausted other avenues, this brings renewed hope and the opportunity for more time with their loved ones with a meaningful quality of life1.\"\n\n\"This is an important turning point for patients in Alberta who are facing advanced prostate cancer,\" said Abby Collier, Executive Director, Prostate Cancer Foundation Canada. \"Ongoing innovation is essential to improving patient care and reducing the burden of this disease on individuals, families, and communities. Public funding for Pluvicto\u2122 helps ensure that eligible patients can receive treatment closer to home, surrounded by their loved ones and support networks. We are encouraged by Alberta's decision and are hopeful that other provinces will follow, so that all Canadians have equitable access to this important treatment option.\"\n\nWith Alberta's recent decision, Pluvicto\u2122 is now publicly funded in three provinces, marking an important advancement in expanding access to this important treatment for advanced prostate cancer.\n\n\"We are encouraged by Alberta's decision to publicly reimburse Pluvicto\u2122, marking a meaningful step toward ensuring equitable access for patients,\" said Mark Vineis, Country President, Novartis Canada. \"We are fully dedicated to furthering our engagement with the remaining provinces to ensure patients throughout Canada have the opportunity to access this advance in prostate cancer care.\"\n\nPluvicto\u2122 was approved by Health Canada in August 2022 and is the first targeted radioligand therapy for the treatment of PSMA-positive mCRPC in Canada2.\n\nAbout Pluvicto\u2122\n\nPluvicto\u2122 (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan injection) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received at least one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and taxane-based chemotherapy2. It is a type of precision cancer treatment combining a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope (a radioactive particle)1. After administration into the bloodstream, Pluvicto\u2122 binds to target cells, including prostate cancer cells that express PSMA, a transmembrane protein2. Once bound, energy emissions from the radioisotope damage the target cells and nearby cells disrupting their ability to replicate and/or triggering cell death2.\n\nAbout Novartis\n\nNovartis is a focused innovative medicines company.

            "content": "And the Oscar goes to\u2026pharma ads.\n\nYes, Anora took home the most honors at the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday night \u2014 including Best Picture \u2014 but medical marketing made an impact, too.\n\nA number of prominent pharma companies advertised during the nearly four-hour affair, which attracted 19.7 million average viewers throughout the broadcast \u2014 marking the fourth consecutive year of viewership growth.\n\nOf note, this was the first Oscars broadcast via streaming, with Disney airing the ceremony via Hulu in addition to ABC.\n\nThis year\u2019s festivities were particularly promising for advertisers, according to EDO, which found that Oscars ads were 172% more effective than the prime-time average.\n\nThe company stated that advertisers would need to air, on average, about 88 prime-time ads to generate as much impact as one airing during the Oscars.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl may not always be the ideal spot for pharma, major cultural events like the Oscars and other entertainment awards shows can offer a more appropriate opportunity for advertising.\n\nThis year, drugmakers leaning into this space included the likes of Novo Nordisk, Novartis and Eli Lilly \u2014 which debuted its Healthy Skeptic spot days before the broadcast.\n\nPharma shines on screen\n\nAmong the dozens of ads that ran during the ceremony, Big Pharma performed admirably, according to data from EDO.\n\nAn analysis by the TV outcomes company found that pharma ads generated 23% of ad-driven consumer engagement during the Oscars \u2014 excluding movies and entertainment titles.\n\nAdditionally, consumers were 477% more likely to engage with pharma ads during the Oscars than the average prime-time program.\n\nEDO also ranked the top 10 Oscars ads by consumer engagement, with Novo and Lilly making the list.\n\nNovo\u2019s 90-second Discover the Power ad for GLP-1 Wegovy drove 465% as much engagement as the median-performing Oscars ad, according to EDO.\n\nThe ad ranked fourth overall in terms of impact.\n\nAdditionally, Lilly\u2019s 90-second Change ad for Zepbound drove 299% as much engagement as the median ad, while the drugmaker\u2019s Healthy Skeptic spot drove 250% as much engagement.\n\nThe two spots ranked eighth and ninth overall, respectively.\n\nViewers want more\n\nIn contrast to EDO\u2019s analysis, U.K.-based ad agency DAIVID found that a number of the pharma ads didn\u2019t score well with viewers.\n\nThough Lilly had the most dramatic new ads for the Oscars, DAIVID said viewers found them to be \u201ctext heavy\u201d and \u201cpreachy.\u201d\n\nThe layered voices utilized in the narration were considered \u201cextremely off-putting\u201d for the audience, according to the analysis.\n\nAdditionally, it found that viewers were confused by the creative and disengaged when the ad discussed prescription options and government regulators instead of a particular drug or medication.\n\nNovo\u2019s Wegovy ad sparked a strong uptake in interest and overall intense positive emotions with viewers when the narration asked, \u201cHave you always had trouble with your weight?\u201d\n\nHowever, the agency noted that this also generated a peak for intense negative emotions like \u2018awkwardness,\u2019 \u2018contempt\u2019 and \u2018disgust\u2019.\n\nStill, viewers\u2019 intense positive emotions finished at their highest levels at the end of the ad.\n\nThough it ran during Super Bowl LIX, Novartis\u2019 Your Attention, Please spot featuring Hailee Steinfeld scored 8.4% lower than the U.S. average for positive emotions and 30% higher for negative emotions at the Oscars.\n\nDespite having a 17% higher brand recall than the average, the awareness effort didn\u2019t deliver on viewer action, with intentions to share and talk about the ad trailing the average between 8% to 16%.\n\nDAIVID also evaluated an ad for Jardiance, which features an anthropomorphic turtle promoting chronic kidney disease treatment from Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the analysis indicated that the word \u2018Jardiance\u2019 drove the strongest confusion throughout the creative.\n\nTwo thumbs up\n\nMuch like Anora, an indie film that took home the top prize by upsetting box office blockbusters, some pharma ads took a circuitous route to success Sunday night.\n\nOf the several pharma ads that ran, Kantar honed in on two that stood out: Novartis\u2019 Your Attention, Please as well as Lilly\u2019s Healthy Skepticism.\n\nUtilizing ad testing through its LINK database, Kantar found that both ads were unconventional for pharma ads, yet scored \u201cvery high\u201d at contributing to long-term brand equity.\n\n\u201cBoth of these brands break from conventional pharma advertising and dial up the engagement factor by being entertaining, provocative and different from their competitors,\u201d Kantar noted in a statement. \u201cBoth ads succeed in building awareness and long term brand equity.\u201d\n\nBased on its scoring system, which compares an ad to all other ads in the database for the U.S., Lilly\u2019s spot scored better than 78% of ads in terms of brand power, 81% for being different, 84% for enjoyment and 89% for being meaningful.\n\nTo the market research company, Health Skepticism reminded consumers of the value of the nation\u2019s regulatory system as well as the need to trust the pharmaceuticals they take.\n\nKantar said the ad successfully communicated what makes Lilly a meaningful and different brand that consumers can trust.\n\nAs for Novartis, its spot once again contributed to brand equity, scoring better than 82% of ads in terms of brand power.\n\nThe ad also established Novartis as a brand that is meaningful, outpacing 93% of other ads while also notching 92% on the enjoyment percentile.",

Bitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\n\nMr. Reinhardt, are you resigning with a bad feeling? Things are going haywire in the U.S., the largest pharmaceutical market. Now President Donald Trump also wants to introduce tariffs on medicines.\n\nRhetoric is one thing, what actually happens is another. Traditionally, pharmaceutical products have always been exempt from customs duties. So that would be something new. We are not panicking. But of course, we are following what is coming with interest and excitement and are preparing for possible scenarios.\n\nCustoms duties and production postponements cost money. Is Novartis preparing for additional financial burdens in 2025 due to U.S. policy?\n\nWe assume that the financial impact will remain within reasonable limits. However, it is too early to make a final assessment.\n\nWhen you took over as chairman 12 years ago, Novartis was a sort of general store with five or six divisions, depending on how you count them. When did you realize that it would have to become a pure pharmaceutical company?\n\nVery early! My idea from the outset was to focus on the pharmaceutical business. I had already worked for the company for 30 years. During that time, I realized what it means to have to work with many small businesses that only make a small contribution to the bottom line but cost a lot of money, time and management capacity.\n\nCan you give an example?\n\nToday, the management only talks about pharma. There are no more discussions about the taste of cough syrup. I have never been an advocate of diversification. The company should concentrate on what it does best: developing and marketing innovative medicines.\n\nWere you not simply following an industry trend?\n\nIt was more the other way around. When other companies saw that we were moving away from veterinary medicine, they did too. The same was the case for nonprescription medicines.\n\nThis focus was a complete dismantling of the strategy of your predecessor Daniel Vasella, who brought you back to Novartis as chair. Has he ever said anything to you about this?\n\nNo. I have had little contact with Mr. Vasella in the 12 years of my presidency. He has withdrawn completely from the strategic and operational environment of Novartis.\n\nIn any case, the change in strategy has not harmed the value of his shares.\n\nYes, he can be satisfied.\n\nDaniel Vasella shaped Novartis for years and stepped down at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. Georgios Kefalas / Keystone\n\nNovartis was the last company to spin off its generics business. Was it not an advantage for the public image to have Sandoz, a supplier of inexpensive medicines, as part of the company?\n\nThat is one point of view. However, it is difficult to offer original medicines and generics under the same roof because you are constantly distracted. In addition, there are hardly any synergies in sales and production. How well Sandoz is developing on its own two feet is obvious \u2013 as is the spun-off eye care specialist, Alcon.\n\nSandoz veteran and Swiss Re Vice Chairman dba. J\u00f6rg Reinhardt (58) joined Sandoz in 1982 after completing his doctorate in pharmacy. After the merger with Ciba to form Novartis, he became head of the Vaccines and Diagnostics Division and later chief operating officer. In 2010, Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella promoted Joe Jimenez to CEO over him, but he brought Reinhardt back to Basel as Chairman in 2013. In the meantime, the Saarland native had moved to Bayer as head of the health care division. Reinhardt has been a member of Swiss Re's board of directors since 2017 and its Vice Chairman since 2024. Reinhardt will step down as chairman at the Novartis Annual General Meeting on Friday, March 7. His designated successor is the Italian-American dual citizen Giovanni Caforio.\n\nLast week, the Sandoz Foundation, which goes back to the family of the company's founder, sold a large part of its historic stake in Novartis. Was that a vote of no confidence in the current leadership?\n\nI see no other motives other than the foundation's intention to diversify its assets. In addition, the share package was sold at an attractive price. Our exchanges with the foundation in recent years have been very sporadic.\n\nFor its part, Novartis showed good judgment when it sold its Roche shares at the end of 2021, before the setback of the share price. Was the timing pure coincidence?\n\nA bit of luck is always part of it. The board of directors had discussed for years whether this participation still made sense. There were always votes for and against. I never recognized a strategic component in this investment. It was dead capital that could be put to better use. When the share price then rose quite a bit, we approached Roche and said that we wanted to sell. Within a few weeks, the whole deal was finished.\n\nWhen Novartis still held a stake in Roche, there was repeated speculation that the two could merge to form a Swiss super-pharmaceutical company. Has this ever been discussed?\n\nNo. Neither the family that owns Roche nor Novartis had any interest in this.\n\nBoth companies are exposed to powerful competition, particularly from the U.S. Do they still have the critical mass to be successful on their own?\n\nFrom today's perspective, yes. Nobody knows what will happen in 20 years' time. So much is happening right now. Some things look very different than they did just a few years ago.\n\nWhat was the most difficult moment during your time as president?\n\nOne sticking point was certainly when we had to announce the surprisingly poor performance of our eye care subsidiary Alcon at the beginning of 2016 and the share price fell sharply. This caught us completely off guard and made us realize that we were probably not the right owner. It was a wake-up call.\n\nAt the beginning of your presidency in particular, Novartis repeatedly made headlines for bribing doctors. Fines running into millions of dollars were imposed. Can you retire with a clear conscience in this respect?\n\nThese were legacy issues that were then systematically cleaned up. We have invested heavily in risk management and compliance. This has paid off. There have been no more major incidents of this kind in recent years.\n\nFrom a medical point of view, what has been the biggest advance that Novartis has achieved in recent years?\n\nNovartis has always been an early investor in future technologies. For example, in cell, gene and radioligand therapies. Even if not all products immediately become 10 billion euro bestsellers, this has enabled us to gain valuable experience at an early stage. We are now developing the first successor products. Radioligand therapy, for example, allows targeted radiotherapy for prostate cancer, but there are many other applications.\n\nAnother advantage of such cutting-edge technologies is that they are difficult to copy. At the same time, the Novartis gene therapy Zolgensma, for example, costs over $2 million per treatment. Isn't that way too expensive?\n\nYou need to consider what the alternatives cost. If such a patient takes a medicine for life and has to be treated, it is much more expensive. Gene therapies such as Zolgensma only need to be injected once. That's the end of it.\n\nZolgensma from Novartis is considered one of the most expensive drugs in the world. This gene therapy is used for children with spinal muscular atrophy \u2013 for example Marley, the son of Rosie-Mae Walton and Wes Powell. Joe Giddens / PA / Getty\n\nAn important decision in 2018 was the appointment of Vas Narasimhan as CEO. When was the moment when you first thought he had what it takes to be CEO?\n\nI can't say for sure, but it was already clear beforehand that he had potential. He is an outstanding physician and one of the most intelligent people I know. When we were both still working in the vaccine division, for example, there was a contract negotiation that didn't move for months. So I said: \u00abVas, you take a look\u00bb \u2013 and in a week and a half, the matter was settled. That was a key moment.\n\nNevertheless, you would also have had internal alternatives.\n\nWhen it came to the decision, we had a second candidate, Paul Hudson. The board of directors did not take the decision lightly. Paul later became CEO of Sanofi.\n\nApparently there was a phase a few years ago when the CEO's chair was wobbly.\n\nIn every good relationship, you have to get together from time to time. Vas was a young man when he became CEO at the age of 42. He has brought a fresh perspective to the company, which has done us good. He was very active on social media early on and has continued to develop over the years. This is demonstrated by the good results of the last two years.\n\nVas Narasimhan wanted to level out the hierarchies left over from the old Novartis\u2019 culture. The keyword used for this was \u00abunbossed.\u00bb Has Novartis really changed?\n\nCultural change takes a lot of time. But we have evolved and become more open, as you can see from the campus in Basel, which is open to the public. We no longer close ourselves off. But there is still work to be done.\n\nThe remuneration policy feels like a throwback to the old days. You paid your CEO a generous 19 million francs in 2024.\n\nWe have a very strongly performance-oriented salary system. The target salary has been around 12 million francs for years. The actual salary depends on the performance of the company and can also be lower. In 2022, it was around 8 million francs.\n\nHow do you get from there to 16, or now 19 million?\n\nA large part of the remuneration is based on the growth that we expect in the three years to come. Because we had a difficult time during the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, our targets for the following years were relatively moderate. They have now been massively exceeded in 2023 and 2024, which has led to the very high payouts.\n\nSo it was an outlier.\n\nI would like to say that remuneration will not necessarily remain at this level. We strive to be somewhere between the U.S. and Europe in terms of wages. Novartis is in the top third in Europe and at the bottom in the U.S.\n\nMr. Narasimhan has now been in office for seven years. Will there be a change of CEO soon after your resignation?\n\nNo, nothing will change in the foreseeable future. This will probably only become an issue in the medium term.\n\nThe American Vas Narasimhan was appointed CEO by J\u00f6rg Reinhardt in 2018. Sandra Blase / WEF via Imago\n\nWhen you think about the company\u2019s further development, would the more focused Novartis be ready for a major takeover? Your designated successor, Giovanni Caforio, the former CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, would have a lot of experience in this area.\n\nA major acquisition is unlikely. On the other hand, there will always be acquisitions in the single-digit billion range. This strategy was defined by the board for the long term and remains so. That won't change with Giovanni either.\n\nSmaller acquisitions can also be risky. In the case of the German biotech company Morphosys, you had to write off a large part of the purchase price shortly afterward. Did Novartis not take a close enough look due to its long-standing relationship with the company?\n\nNo. It was about a certain drug that unfortunately did not meet expectations. Acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry always involve a high risk because they usually involve products that have not yet proven themselves.\n\nIf it wasn't his expertise in takeovers, what tipped the scales in favor of Mr. Caforio?\n\nWe wanted someone with many years of management experience in the pharmaceutical industry who understood the American market. Today, we are only in ninth or 10th place there. You have to be one of the leading providers if you really want to be in the game. However, it was important to us that the person also has strong European roots and also knows the business in Europe. There are not many managers like that. Giovanni will reside in Basel and Italy in the future.\n\nIs that enough to secure Novartis' strong Swiss roots?\n\nWe still feel a strong connection to Switzerland and invest here. We have just built a new chemistry building on the campus at a cost of around 100 million Swiss francs. A biotechnology development building will soon be added, which will cost another 300 million. Basel is a wonderful hub, there is no reason to change that.\n\nBut the campus is basically finished, isn't it?\n\nIt's true: We don't need as much space as originally expected. When construction of the campus began in the mid-1990s, Novartis assumed that up to 30,000 people would work here. Today there are around 7,000, with 5,000 of them in research. It turns out Novartis has grown, but not just in Basel. Administrative activities and other support functions are now based in Hyderabad, Kuala Lumpur, Prague, Dublin and Mexico. Here on the banks of the Rhine, we have focused on head office functions as well as research and development.\n\nWill you actually become honorary chairman of Novartis after your retirement, or will Mr. Vasella continue to hold this title?\n\nI assume that the name will remain associated with Mr. Vasella. There are no rules for this, but we will no longer award the title. It only exists on paper and does not grant any privileges.",

According to ARS Pharma, the nasal spray is the \u201cfirst significant innovation\u201d in administering epinephrine to children \u201cin more than 35 years.\u201d\n\nNeffy was first approved in August 2024, becoming the industry\u2019s first nasal spray to address severe allergies. ARS CEO CEO Richard Lowenthal at the time called the approval \u201ca watershed moment\u201d for allergy care.\n\nThe company expects neffy to be available in pharmacies by the end of May 2025 and, through a co-pay savings program, will cap out-of-pocket cost at $25 for two single-use application devices for \u201cmost commercially insured patients,\u201d as per the company\u2019s press announcement. Otherwise, the two doses of neffy will cost $199.\n\nLowenthal in a statement called Wednesday\u2019s approval \u201ca major milestone\u201d not just for the company but also for children, their families and their healthcare providers. \u201cMany children and caregivers fear needle-based auto-injectors, which can delay lifesaving treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe neffy 1 mg will improve access to a needle-free option for the treatment of severe allergies and reduce hesitation in treating this vulnerable group,\u201d Lowenthal continued.\n\nThe neffy nasal spray contains ARS Pharma\u2019s formulation of epinephrine, mixed with the proprietary absorption agent dodecyl-maltoside, a well-established anti-allergy medication. The hormone therapeutic works by targeting both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, in turn relaxing the airways and tightening the blood vessels\u2014both of which serve to counter the common symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n\nElsewhere in the allergy space, Roche\u2019s Genentech and development partner Novartis reported on Sunday that their asthma drug Xolair bested oral immunotherapy\u2014in a trial where patients were exposed to increasing amounts of the allergen\u2014at treating food allergies. Following Xolair treatment, 36% of patients were able to tolerate at least 2,000 mg of peanut protein taken together with two other food allergens.\n\nThis latest win for Xolair is good news for Novartis, which in January 2024 was forced to terminate a Phase III trial for ligelizumab, a subcutaneous biologic therapy that the pharma was positioning as a successor to Xolair.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nHow Will Tariffs Affect the Market?\n\nOn March 5th, BBC reported that the US stock market had fallen after the tariffs sparked trade war fear. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has sparked significant concerns about a potential trade war. The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from these countries, with Canadian energy products facing a 10% tariff. On the other hand, tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased from 10% to 20%. As a result, Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of US goods, with plans for additional tariffs on $125 billion in goods over the next three weeks. Moreover, China imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 15% on various US agricultural imports, such as chicken, pork, and soybeans. The tariffs have raised fears of inflation and a broader trade conflict, leading to a decline in US and global stock markets. As a result, the S&P 500 experienced a significant drop, and European markets also closed lower.\n\nToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\n\nWhile talking about how the Fed might react to the tariffs, Fisher mentioned that it is a little too early to guess. The Fed is bringing inflation down and we are getting closer to the 2% target, however, at the same time tariff increases the cost of doing business, which might slow down the economy and tickle up inflation. To conclude Fisher noted that tariffs won\u2019t be digested quickly and will take time.",

The former contained \u201ctext heavy, dense, hard-to-read, hard-to-follow\u201d content. The latter replaced that with better use of color and \u201clight,airy and easy-to-convey data\u2026 clear, concise text and infographics telling the story.\u201d\n\nMarti also presented Summit-goers with five \u201cBest Practices for Content Excellence\u201d:\n\nFirst, she said, \u201cmake sure the content initiatives you\u2019re working on directly support organizational objectives and market demands.\u201d This will help in relations with agencies, peers and other content team members.\n\nSecond, \u201cmake sure you are flexible with that content strategy. I work with my brand partners a ton and things change every day. You have to build a content strategy and system that is nimble to some extent, or it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s going to quickly be outdated, people won\u2019t use it, and they\u2019ll just go outside of it.\"\n\nThird, \u201cuse data and analytics to optimize your content performance and resource allocation. It takes time to gather that data,\u201d Marti noted, but by having \u201cdata to back up what we say, you\u2019re going to have a lot better conversation.\u201d\n\nFourth, \u201ccreate continual learning to enhance team capabilities. I saw this happen very slowly at first with us, but it\u2019s starting to pick up steam.\u201d Novartis brands, Marti said, are now \u201cgetting really excited to compete, be first to accomplish a new feat, and get themselves featured [in content].\u201d\n\nFifth, \u201cuse advanced tools to automate where possible, drive collaboration and make content optimization easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of promise when it comes to AI,\u201d Marti acknowledged, \u201cbut there\u2019s also a lot of promise if you look around at the tools already in your organization. There\u2019s a chance those could help you with your content mapping, strategy and planning process.\u201d",

For the next four years, he held residencies at various hospitals in Bern and Z\u00fcrich before serving (1984\u201388) as the attendant physician at C.L. Lory-Haus at Bern University Hospital. He left medicine in 1988 and joined the marketing department of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. in New Jersey, the U.S.-based division of Sandoz Pharma Ltd. The following year Vasella graduated from Harvard Business School, and he moved up quickly in the marketing and sales department at Sandoz to become department head of special-product marketing. He was appointed assistant vice president in 1992 and became head of the corporate-marketing department the following year. In 1994 Vasella returned to Switzerland and accepted the position of head of the worldwide development office at Sandoz\u2019s headquarters in Basel. He was named CEO of Sandoz the following year.\n\nEarly in 1996 Vasella was named CEO of the newly formed Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, which was established as a result of the largest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry. The combined company united industry giants Sandoz Ltd. and Ciba-Geigy Ltd., two Swiss-based health care groups, in a $29 billion merger that made Novartis second in size and influence only to Britain\u2019s Glaxo Wellcome, the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical concern. As CEO, Vasella was responsible for coordinating the integration of the Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy product lines. He assumed a joint leadership role with Novartis chairman Alex Krauer, who had served as chairman of Ciba-Geigy. The two were responsible for overseeing the company\u2019s overall development and direction, and Vasella also served as head of the company\u2019s executive committee. After Krauer retired in 1999, Vasella was appointed chairman of Novartis. In 2003 he published the book Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill Is Rewriting Medical History (reissued in 2004), written with Robert Slater, in which he discussed Novartis\u2019s breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec, also known as Glivec. In 2010 Vasella stepped down as CEO, and three years later he retired as chairman.\n\nVasella also joined the boards of PepsiCo, Inc. (2002), and XBiotech (2014). The recipient of numerous honours, in 2003 he received Harvard Business School\u2019s Alumni Achievement Award and the CancerCare Human Services Award.",

            "content": "Chinese architect Liu Jiakun has been awarded the 2025 Pritzker Prize \u2013 considered to be the \u2018Nobel of Architecture\u2019. And his work is a far cry from the anonymous skyscrapers and ultra-high-tech gloss that has come to typify many Chinese megacities.\n\nLiu was the first architect to design the inaugural Serpentine Pavilion Beijing in 2018, but he\u2019s not a household name in Europe and North America. The prolific architect has worked chiefly in his native southwest China, where he has spent the last four decades eschewing a distinctive aesthetic style in favour of an \u2018architectural strategy\u2019 grounded in context.\n\nSays the Pritzker committee: \u2018Through an outstanding body of work of deep coherence and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and constructs new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic constraint. Instead of a style, he has developed a strategy that never relies on a recurring method but rather on evaluating the specific characteristics and requirements of each project differently.\u2019\n\nAs such, Liu\u2019s site-specific designs \u2013 among them museums, academic buildings, culture centres and public spaces, mostly in his home city of Chengdu \u2013 do not have a recognisable aesthetic. Instead, each project incorporates traditional and vernacular elements filtered through purpose and context, with Liu relying on \u2018low-tech\u2019 craftsmanship and simplicity to achieve efficiency and elegance. His firm, Jiakun Architects, has completed over 30 projects \u2014 all of them in China.\n\nOne of his most celebrated initiatives is his sustainable \u2018rebirth bricks\u2019 made from debris from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. These repurposed materials were used in several of his projects, including the Novartis Building in Shanghai and the Shuijingfang Museum and West Village in Chengdu.\n\nAdds the committee: \u2018His honest architecture presents the sincerity of textural materials and processes, displaying imperfections that endure, rather than degrade, through time. He disfavors manufactured product, preferring traditional craft and often using raw local materials that sustain the economy and environment, built for and by the community.\u2019\n\nReflecting on his win and the transformative power of architecture, Liu says, \u201cArchitecture should reveal something\u2014it should abstract, distil and make visible the inherent qualities of local people. It has the power to shape human behaviour and create atmospheres, offering a sense of serenity and poetry, evoking compassion and mercy, and cultivating a sense of shared community.\u2019\n\nGet to know Liu Jiakun\u2019s notable projects.",

He strengthened the found material with local wheat fibre and cement to produce fortified bricks \u2018with greater physical and economic efficiency than the original\u2019.\n\nSource:Arch-Exist\n\nThese so-called \u2018rebirth bricks\u2019 can be found extensively throughout the Novartis building in Shanghai (2014), Shuijingfang Museum in Chengdu (2013) and the five-storey West Village also in Chengdu (2015), which is his largest work.\n\nIn 2018, he was commissioned to build the first temporary Serpentine Gallery pavilion outside the UK at the opening of the WF Central development in Beijing\u2019s Dongcheng district.\n\nThe jury described his work as creating \u2018public areas in populated cities where the luxury of space is largely absent, forging a positive relationship between density and open space\u2019.\n\nAravena said: \u2018Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life.\n\n'In a world that tends to create endless dull peripheries, he has found a way to build places that are a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time. His work may offer impactful clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanisation, in an era of rapidly growing cities.\u2019\n\nThis year\u2019s jury also included previous laureates Lacaton & Vassal co-founder Anne Lacaton \u2013 the recent winner of the 2025 Jane Drew Prize for Architecture \u2013 and Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA.\n\nLast year\u2019s Pritzker Prize went to 79-year-old Riken Yamamoto from Yokohama, Japan. He was recognised for his architecture which \u2018considers the user experience first\u2019, spanning a career of five decades with projects ranging from public and private housing to education, civic spaces and city planning.\n\nThe 2023 prize went to David Chipperfield, who became the fifth British winner, more than 15 years after Richard Rogers collected the prize in 2007.\n\nPrevious Pritzker laureates include the late Indian architect Balkrishna Vithaldas (BV) Doshi, Berlin-based Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 (in 2022) and the late Zaha Hadid in 2004.\n\nSource:Qian Shen Photography\n\nPritzker Prize winners\n\n2025 Liu Jiakun (68), China\n\n2024 Riken Yamamoto (78), Japan\n\n2023 David Chipperfield (69), UK\n\n2022 Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 (56), Burkina Faso/Germany\n\n2021 Anne Lacaton (65) and Jean-Philippe Vassal (67), France\n\n2020 Yvonne Farrell (69) and Shelley McNamara (68), Ireland\n\n2019 Arata Isozaki (87), Japan\n\n2018 Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi (90), India\n\n2017 Rafael Aranda (55) Carme Pigem (54) and Ramon Vilalta (56) of RCR Arquitectes, Spain\n\n2016 Alejandro Aravena (48), Chile\n\n2015 Frei Otto (89), Germany\n\n2014 Shigeru Ban (56), Japan\n\n2013 Toyo Ito (71), Japan\n\n2012 Wang Shu (48), China\n\n2011 Eduardo Souto de Moura (58), Portugal\n\n2010 Kazuyo Sejima (54) and Ryue Nishizawa (44), Japan\n\n2009 Peter Zumthor (65), Switzerland\n\n2008 Jean Nouvel (62), France\n\n2007 Richard Rogers (73), UK\n\n2006 Paulo Mendes da Rocha (77), Brazil\n\n2005 Thom Mayne (61), USA\n\n2004 Zaha Hadid (53), UK\n\n2003 Jorn Utzon (84), Denmark\n\n2002 Glenn Murcutt (66), Australia\n\n2001 Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron (51), Switzerland\n\n2000 Rem Koolhaas (56), Netherlands\n\n1999 Norman Foster (63), UK\n\n1998 Renzo Piano (60), Italy\n\n1997 Sverre Fehn (72), Norway\n\n1996 Rafael Moneo (58), Spain\n\n1995 Tadao Ando (53), Japan\n\n1994 Christian de Portzamparc (50), France\n\n1993 Fumihiko Maki (65), Japan\n\n1992 Alvaro Siza (57), Portugal\n\n1991 Robert Venturi (65), USA\n\n1990 Aldo Rossi, (59), Italy\n\n1989 Frank Gehry (60), USA\n\n=1988 Oscar Niemeyer (81), Brazil\n\n=1988 Gordon Bunshaft (79), USA\n\n1987 Kenzo Tange (73), Japan\n\n1986 Gottfried Bohm (66), Germany\n\n1985 Hans Hollein (51), Austria\n\n1984 Richard Meier (49), USA\n\n1983 IM Pei (66), China\n\n1982 Kevin Roche (60), USA\n\n1981 James Stirling (55), UK\n\n1980 Luis Barragan (78), Mexico\n\n1979 Philip Johnson (73), USA",

            "content": "BBJ: 2024 was an eventful year for Novartis Hungary. What were some of the key achievements?\n\nColette Matz: It was an incredible year for Novartis Hungary, and I am proud of the accomplishments of the entire organization. We are particularly proud of maintaining our #1 position in the innovative pharma sector in Hungary. We launched new groundbreaking therapies for Hungarian citizens in oncology, cardiology, and neurology that are already significantly impacting patient outcomes. Our commitment to innovation is also reflected in the 15% increase in our R&D investments locally. Additionally, I\u2019m proud of our partnerships to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment in Hungary. For example, the launch of the Lipid Management Center in collaboration with Semmelweis University is a pioneering initiative aimed at transforming cardiovascular health in Hungary. This center serves as a beacon of hope for countless Hungarians at risk of or suffering from cardiovascular diseases.\n\nBBJ: Can you elaborate on your focus on innovation and digital transformation and how these initiatives have impacted your operations?\n\nCM: Digital health and data have become integral to our daily operations. For example, our multi-stakeholder dialogue with the Hungarian Government, including Deputy Secretary for Health Judit Bidl\u00f3 and Deputy Secretary for Innovation L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f3dis, in Basel last summer, was particularly enriching. We discussed how AI is reshaping patient support and clinical trials. We\u2019re also thrilled about our partnership with the SzEFA Foundation to develop \u201cDr. BetMen,\u201d a digital patient journey management tool to improve care pathways and outcomes, especially concerning women\u2019s health. These efforts highlight our commitment to integrating digital technologies into healthcare, ensuring we stay at the forefront of medical innovation while providing better patient outcomes.\n\nBBJ: Looking ahead to this year, what are your key priorities and goals?\n\nCM: Our priorities for 2025 revolve around several key areas. One significant focus is the implementation of the European cardiovascular legislation. We look forward to its adoption in Hungary, which will significantly enhance cardiovascular health standards nationwide. This legislation will support our mission of improving patient outcomes in cardiovascular health. Moreover, we will continue our disease awareness initiatives, particularly in helping Hungarian citizens know and understand their health numbers by supporting health screening events, which are crucial for the early detection and prevention of diseases. Women\u2019s health remains a big priority area. We\u2019re committed to enhancing the patient journey, creating awareness about the importance of regular screenings, and supporting the prevention of relapse for patients who have battled breast cancer. This is not just a professional mandate for me but a personal one. As a mother, I understand the unique challenges women face in managing their health, and we\u2019re dedicated to making this journey easier and more informed.\n\nBBJ: How do you approach partnerships, especially in critical areas like oncology?\n\nCM: Collaboration is certainly at the heart of our strategy. For example, partnerships with patient organizations and multi-stakeholder collaborations have been pivotal in advancing awareness, treatment, and support structures in oncology. The tireless work of patient organizations, along with the efforts of healthcare providers, researchers, and our team, has been instrumental in making progress against diseases like breast cancer. Through collaboration and partnerships, we have a significantly better opportunity to drive meaningful improvement in outcomes and broaden access to care for people in Hungary. By working together, we can ensure that women receive the support they need throughout their health journey.\n\nBBJ: What role does Novartis see itself playing in preserving the competitiveness of the European life sciences sector?\n\nCM: This is a crucial issue. At Novartis, we believe it hinges on fostering an open dialogue between the industry and the government. Ensuring that the right discussions are taking place and making strategic investments in Europe are key components of our approach. We\u2019re committed to advocating for smart, balanced regulations that support innovation without overburdening the sector. Additionally, we recognize the value of clinical research; it\u2019s essential for advancing medical knowledge and improving patient care. In Hungary, we aim to leverage our excellent pool of Hungarian scientists, top-notch clinical centers, and strong medical training programs to increase our competitiveness. Our collaboration with Semmelweis University and its rector, B\u00e9la Merkely, showcases the strength of our local foundations. Moreover, we understand that investment in the life sciences sector translates to economic growth, as healthcare is a vital competitive industry that contributes to GDP improvement.\n\nBBJ: How important is company culture in driving these initiatives?\n\nCM: Company culture is absolutely one of the most crucial elements required to drive innovation in healthcare. We emphasize fostering a culture of empowerment and accountability, encouraging leadership at all levels. By building strong cross-functional teams, we ensure that innovation is driven collaboratively. Our culture is externally focused, aiming to deeply understand the needs of our stakeholders and the broader healthcare system. This deep comprehension allows us to drive innovation that meets these needs effectively. We focus on maintaining open, transparent dialogues where every team member feels valued and heard. This collective effort ensures that our associates are motivated and passionate about making a meaningful impact in healthcare.\n\nBBJ: Are you concerned about finding suitably qualified staff in Hungary?\n\nCM: The labor market presents challenges, but our strong employer brand helps us navigate these waters effectively. We\u2019ve been recognized as a top employer, receiving awards like the Randstad Award for the most attractive employer in life sciences and being named a top employer for the third consecutive year. These recognitions help us attract top talent, and we also emphasize developing our current employees. We believe in creating an environment where our teams can continuously grow and excel. This is instrumental in fostering a culture of inclusivity, resilience, and social responsibility. This way, our associates are engaged and empowered to contribute meaningfully to the organization and the community.\n\nBBJ: How are you working with external stakeholders to promote healthcare innovation in Hungary?\n\nCM: Collaboration with external stakeholders is key. As a board member of the Swiss-Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, I work closely with other investors and industry leaders to address issues of mutual interest and advance the healthcare ecosystem in Hungary.\n\nBBJ: What are the most significant challenges and opportunities for Hungary\u2019s pharmaceutical industry?\n\nCM: The biggest challenge remains the sustainability of healthcare systems amid increasing costs and demographic changes. We appreciate the government\u2019s decision to reduce the special pharma tax back to 20%, which we hope remains stable as regulatory and taxation predictability are crucial for fostering a conducive environment for innovation and investment. However, the opportunities are immense. Hungary\u2019s centralized health database and readiness for digital health innovation provide a unique platform for us to make significant advancements. The country\u2019s ability to forge robust partnerships between industry and academia is another strength we can leverage to improve patient outcomes and propel the industry forward. We\u2019re optimistic about the potential for meaningful progress and are committed to overcoming challenges through innovation and collaboration.\n\nThis article was first published in the Budapest Business Journal print issue of February 21, 2025.",

            "content": "The FDA has never handed out more priority review vouchers than it did in 2024. Depending on who you ask, that\u2019s a sign that the program is working or that pharma is reaping huge benefits in a quid pro quo situation of the government\u2019s own making. But now rare disease biotechs have been left scrambling, as Congress did not renew the rare pediatric disease portion of the program at its end of year deadline despite bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cThe impact on the rare disease drug developers and the investment community [is] already being felt because of the destabilizing effect of the failure to reauthorize the program prior to its expiration,\u201d Stacey Frisk, executive director of the Rare Disease Company Coalition, told BioSpace in an interview. Her group is lobbying for a renewal to be tacked on to congressional efforts to address a looming March 14 budget deadline. \u201cSo really, the timeline is as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe priority review voucher (PRV) rare disease program, which began in 2012, had unanimous renewal support from the 118th Congress, which ended on Jan. 3, according to Frisk. The program passed the House without issue and was listed among the priorities for the resolution to avoid a government shutdown. But the health programs that included the PRV program\u2014which had already begun to sunset\u2014were stripped from the continuing resolution at the last minute.\n\nDespite the bipartisan support, the PRV program \u201cgot caught\u201d as Congress\u2019 timelines and priorities changed at the last minute, Matthew Winton, chief operating officer of Inozyme Pharma and a rare disease advocate , told BioSpace.\n\nA bill called the Give Kids a Chance Act of 2024 has now been proposed to get the PRV program moving again, as Congress works to avoid the shutdown.\n\n\u201cTime is . . . sort of running out,\u201d Winton said. \u201cWe need action on this immediately to continue the program but also continue investment in these pediatric rare diseases.\u201d\n\nThe FDA notified drugmakers in the fall that, absent the renewal passing, the agency would have to stop handing out the coveted fast-pass vouchers, which expedite the drug review timeline from 12 months to about 6 . The vouchers can be bought and sold, which provides a valuable fundraising boost for tiny rare disease biotechs. The current going rate on the open market is $150 million, the price Zevra Therapeutics earned just last week for its voucher that was granted from the September 2024 approval of Miplyffa. According to Winton, the cost of PRVs has risen to this rate as companies foresee the end of the program.\n\nWithout renewal, the FDA began sunsetting the program as of December 20, 2024. The agency cannot award any new vouchers unless the drug already had the rare pediatric disease designation. If Congress does not act, companies with existing designations will only have until September 30, 2026, to get their drugs approved in order to earn a voucher.\n\nAlready, companies with the rare pediatric disease designation for drugs in development are reeling, with many starting to warn investors in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that they may never get their coveted vouchers despite working for years to position for one. Winton said that companies make decisions to develop a drug years in advance, so having the rug pulled out suddenly due to a policy change can halt external investment.\n\n\u201cWith that uncertainty, you\u2019re going to get a slowdown in decision making. You\u2019re going to get a slowdown in people investing in R&D programs,\u201d Winton said.\n\nSee BioSpace\u2019s full analysis here\n\nQuid Pro Quo\n\nThe industry has spent at least $513 million on buying vouchers that were earned in 2024, although more could have been sold without public disclosures. These non-dilutive proceeds are often used by smaller companies to bolster their overall clinical programs.\n\nIn a recent case that underscores the stakes, bluebird bio fought hard to get one for its sickle cell disease gene therapy Lyfgenia, which was approved in December 2023 . Bluebird had already lined up a buyer before it even received the approval, according to SEC documents dated October 2023. Novartis agreed to pay $103 million for the voucher if it were granted.\n\nWhile bluebird was granted rare pediatric disease designation in May 2020 for the treatment, the FDA did not hand out the coveted voucher. Bluebird appealed and was ultimately rejected three times. The agency did, however, hand one out to Vertex Pharma for rival gene therapy Casgevy, which was developed with CRISPR Therapeutics and approved on the same day as Lyfgenia .\n\nThis unsuccessful effort was cited in bluebird\u2019s recent announcement that it would sell itself to private equity firms in a deal valuing the gene therapy maker at just $30 million. Bluebird did not have enough cash to operate past the first quarter but had spied positive revenue later in the year.\n\nEleven of the valuable trading cards were handed out to biopharma companies over 2024, across the three different programs that offer the vouchers. For the rare disease program specifically, indications that benefitted include sickle cell, Niemann-Pick type C, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and glioma, among others. With the pediatric rare disease program sunset announced, the FDA has handed out two already this year to Novo Nordisk for hemophilia A therapy Alhemo and Neurocrine Biosciences for congenital adrenal hyperplasia drug Crenessity.\n\nThere are two other ways to get one beyond the rare disease program: through the development of drugs for tropical disease or a biological threat, such as COVID-19. Four have been awarded since the pandemic began for COVID-19: to Moderna, BioNTech, Pfizer and Gilead for their vaccines and antivirals. Neither of these programs are impacted by Congress\u2019 recent actions, and so far, the FDA has granted one voucher under the tropical disease program this year: to Bavarian Nordic for its chikungunya virus vaccine Vimkunya. Bavarian Nordic has already indicated plans to sell the voucher \u201cwhen appropriate.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the voucher programs say the fast passes are not doing their job to expedite the approval of drugs to help fill unmet needs in the rare and tropical disease communities. In a December 2024 paper , U.K. researchers Piero Olliaro and Els Torreele called the program \u201ca misconceived quid pro quo, whereby much is given for little public health return, promoting and rewarding monopoly pricing of high-revenue products, with no strings attached\u2014which indeed makes it attractive to pharmaceutical companies and investors.\u201d\n\nBigger companies that earn or buy the vouchers use them to skip the line at the FDA for any drug they want. These vouchers are hard to track, as the companies do not have to report exactly where they got the voucher from when they use them. The FDA in recent years has occasionally posted Federal Register documents noting that a voucher was used for a particular drug, but these documents do not indicate where the voucher came from. From various records, it\u2019s clear that many major blockbuster drugs of recent years have used these hall passes, from Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro, to AbbVie\u2019s Rinvoq to Gilead\u2019s portfolio of HIV meds and many more.\n\nIn mid-February, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals cashed one in for a speedy review of Amvuttra in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, an indication that is one of the hottest market battles at the moment with offerings from Pfizer and BridgeBio now available. Vertex Pharmaceuticals did the same in July 2024 for cystic fibrosis triple med Alyftrek, receiving an FDA nod less than six months later, in December 2024.\n\nNovartis has by far been the most frequent patron of the fast passes, with as many as eight bought or earned over the years. The company has used the passes on Mayzent, Beovu, Kesimpta, Fabhalta and Kisqali, according to records. Gilead has spent as much as $621 million on known purchases of priority review vouchers.\n\nOlliaro and Torreele argue that the program does not actually encourage drug sponsors to ensure the availability of the medicines that get approved under the program, especially for tropical diseases. For instance, the makers of tuberculosis therapies Sirturo and Dovprela, a medicine that was approved under the tropical disease program as pretomanid, have been criticized for keeping the prices for the therapies too high to help in countries with a high tropical disease burden. Sirturo is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson while Dovprela (previously pretomanid) was developed by the TB Alliance .\n\nFrisk and Winton are aware of the criticisms but say that the rare disease program is working. You just have to look at the ramp up of drugs that have received a voucher over the years, with more handed out recently. That means that more companies are making these drugs and more rare diseases are getting new options for patients.\n\nAs for the criticism of a handout for Big Pharma, Winton says this is a tax neutral program. No taxpayer funds are being given to these companies; it\u2019s simply a market-based solution that ultimately helps smaller companies do what they do best: develop rare disease drugs for smaller populations.\n\n\u201cSome of these drugs may not be developed or invented at all\u201d without the voucher program, Winton said. \u201cThese [vouchers] are not necessarily going to the 17th, 18th statin\u2014not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that\u2014but these are also going to feed the cycle of innovation and bringing drugs to patients in the U.S. who have no other options.\u201d\n\nPlanning Funerals\n\nOne pediatric rare disease that has particularly benefitted is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has had seven drugs approved under the PRV program, including four from Sarepta Therapeutics. Each time, Sarepta sold its voucher and used the funds to continue its clinical programs.\n\nAnother rare disease that now has multiple options is spinal muscular atrophy. Winton previously worked at Biogen as head of the SMA franchise, where he oversaw work on Spinraza, which received a PRV in March 2017.\n\n\u201cThat disease state has completely changed. You were used to planning funerals. And now you\u2019re celebrating birthdays and you\u2019re celebrating graduation into high school,\u201d Winton said. \u201cThat\u2019s an amazing success story.\u201d\n\nThese patients now have several different modalities to choose from, including Novartis\u2019 gene therapy Zolgensma and Genentech\u2019s Evrysdi, both of which received priority review and were granted vouchers at approval. These seminal approvals of complex technologies like gene therapy have also helped fuel other innovations in the modality, which is another legacy of the PRV program, Winton noted. Similarly, Biogen advanced its antisense oligonucleotide technology with Spinraza, which earned a voucher in March 2017 and was sold for $103 million last year .\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to patients, when you talk to the rare disease community, the one thing they always say is \u2018move faster.\u2019 The one thing they don\u2019t have is time,\u201d Winton said. \u201cThe message we always take away when we talk to them is try to work hard or hurry up. This program does that. It speeds up our ability to get drugs to market. It speeds up our ability to do more research.\u201d\n\nAbout the data: BioSpace compiled the list of priority review vouchers through dozens of sources, including the FDA, Federal Register, SEC, GAO, company reports, news articles and more. Still, the list may not be comprehensive, as some PRV transactions go unreported.\n\n",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nThroughout its 46-year history, architecture\u2019s most prestigious prize has often been won by icon-builders: the apparent lone geniuses who imprint their visions, signature-like, on the world. It is emblematic of the industry\u2019s shifting priorities that this year\u2019s Pritzker Prize, often dubbed the \u201cNobel of architecture,\u201d has gone to a man who actively avoids having a recognizable style.\n\nLiu Jiakun, unveiled as 2025\u2019s laureate on Tuesday, has spent much of his four-decade career designing understated academic buildings, museums and public spaces in his home city of Chengdu (and nearby Chongqing), in China\u2019s southwest. His hyper-local and self-admittedly \u201clow-tech\u201d techniques have come at the expense of a distinctive aesthetic.\n\nIn China\u2019s era of architectural excess, Liu has instead quietly thrived by letting each site \u2014 and the history, nature and craft traditions surrounding it \u2014 shape his designs, not vice versa. Whether repurposing earthquake debris or creating voids in which native wild flora can flourish, methodology matters more than form. In its citation, the Pritzker Prize jury praised Liu for precisely that: having \u201ca strategy instead of a style.\u201d\n\nNature and architecture coalesce at Chengdu's Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, one of the first projects completed by Liu's firm, Jiakun Architects. Bi Kejian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nExplaining his approach to CNN ahead of the announcement, the 68-year-old architect (who admitted to being \u201ca little surprised\u201d by the accolade) said he tried to act \u201clike water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try my best to penetrate and understand the place \u2026 then, when the time is right, it will solidify, and the idea of \u200b\u200bthe building will appear,\u201d he said on a video call from Chengdu, adding: \u201cA fixed style is a double-edged sword. It can make others remember you quickly, but it also binds you and makes you lose a certain freedom.\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s firm, Jiakun Architects, has completed over 30 projects \u2014 all in China \u2014 in almost as many years. The architect has often turned to his country\u2019s history for inspiration. Traditional pavilions informed the flat rooftop eaves of his Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick in Suzhou; the wraparound balconies of the Shanghai campus he designed for Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis evoke a tiered pagoda. But these nods to the past are never for history\u2019s sake alone, Liu said.\n\n\u201cI focus on the themes that tradition focuses on, rather than the forms that tradition presents,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe eaves and cantilevered verandas of Liu's Novartis Shanghai Campus building put a contemporary spin on traditional Chinese architecture. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nIn other words, elements of traditional architecture must be reinterpreted for functional, modern use, not used as tributes to a bygone time. Indeed, China\u2019s cities are inundated with examples of the opposite, whereby curved roofs are added to otherwise characterless structures in the pursuit of an ill-defined \u201cChinese-ness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional forms \u2026 are the results of the culture, technology and people\u2019s philosophy of survival at that time,\u201d Liu explained. \u201cIf we focus on the superficial results, we will stop at that time. But if we focus on the themes that tradition has always focused on, but use current technology and methods, then there\u2019s a continuation of tradition.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s new dawn\n\nBorn in 1956, three years before China\u2019s (and arguably the world\u2019s) most devastating famine, Liu\u2019s childhood revolved around the Chengdu hospital where his mother worked. He demonstrated an early aptitude for art and literature, though, like many of his generation, his teenage years were interrupted by the Cultural Revolution when he was sent to the countryside as part of Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201ceducated youth\u201d program.\n\nLiu\u2019s career has, however, neatly coincided with the post-Mao period \u2014 one that has seen architecture freed from state control and socialist ideals. He accepted a place at Chongqing\u2019s Institute of Architecture and Engineering in 1978, two years after the former Chinese Communist Party leader\u2019s death, and graduated amid the reform-era policies that opened China\u2019s centrally planned economy to free-market forces.\n\nLiu's museum architecture, including the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick, was praised by the jury for being \"at once a historical record, a piece of infrastructure, a landscape, and a remarkable public space.\" Liu Jian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nThis period heralded huge changes for architecture. Key foreign texts and journals from the field entered the country and became more widely available to students and academics. Government-controlled design institutes, like the one Liu worked at in his early career, were finally permitted to charge fees, having previously only served the state. Yet, in the fast-moving atmosphere of 1980s China, Liu still felt architecture \u201clagged behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I graduated, it seemed that architects had nothing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy had not developed, and ideas had not become active.\u201d\n\nBy the early 1990s, Liu \u2014 who was, at the time, also pursuing writing \u2014 considered quitting the profession altogether. He changed his mind after seeing an exhibition by a former classmate, the architect Tang Hua, that he says inspired him to escape the shadow cast by their sector\u2019s state-controlled past. He established Jiakun Architects, one of the country\u2019s very first private practices, in 1999.\n\nThe firm\u2019s early projects laid a blueprint for understanding Liu\u2019s ethos. His Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, which opened in Chengdu in 2002, sits serenely in a bamboo forest, its rough concrete and gray shale existing in harmony with the stone artifacts housed within. The recesses and overhangs of his rust-colored Department of Sculpture building, completed for the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing two years later, are themselves acts of sculpture. At the Museum of Clocks, also in Chengdu, textural red brickwork alludes more to the area\u2019s humble past than a gleaming future.\n\nThe protruding upper levels of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute's Department of Sculpture allowed Liu to artfully maximize the narrow site's floor space. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAt the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, sunlight passes through a circular ceiling void and slowly travels across the brick-walled courtyard like a sundial. Bi Kejian/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAs architecture in China became increasingly bold and bombastic in the 2010s (a trend that eventually led the country\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, to call for the end of \u201coversized, xenocentric, weird\u201d buildings), Liu\u2019s output remained quiet and unpretentious \u2014 even when the scale of his commissions grew. By Liu\u2019s own admission, his firm was always too small to tackle the skyscrapers or mixed-use mega-projects that redrew China\u2019s skylines. But as his oeuvre came to encompass corporate real estate and urban regeneration, his motivations still lay elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI am not very interested in the tendency of making taller and bigger buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not necessarily consciously resisting it. I am just not very interested.\u201d\n\nEveryday architecture\n\nInstead, Liu seeks to redress some of the ills generated by his country\u2019s rampant urbanization.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s cities are developing very fast, so they face two major challenges,\u201d he explained. \u201cOne is the relationship with public space, and the other is the relationship with nature. I think my works focus on these two aspects.\u201d\n\nPedestrians and cyclists pictured on the sloped pathways of West Village, which transformed an entire Chengdu block and remains Liu's largest work to date. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nSymbiosis between nature and architecture plays out at Liu\u2019s ambitious West Village, an inner-city Chengdu block transformed into a courtyard but at a neighborhood scale. Sloping pathways transport cyclists and pedestrians around a five-story structure that encircles soccer pitches and lush greenery, a park reimagined vertically.\n\nThis huge public gesture is accompanied by many tiny ones. For paving, Liu used bricks perforated with holes and filled with soil, allowing grass to sprout through the middle.\n\nA few miles away, the Shuijingfang Museum has been constructed using similarly thoughtful building blocks: \u201cRebirth Bricks.\u201d Created by Liu\u2019s firm using rubble from the Wenchuan earthquake, which devastated the Sichuan region in 2008, the reconstructed bricks (made by mixing the rubble with wheat stalks and cement) have been employed in several of his projects. It\u2019s an innovation that typifies why Liu is celebrated for practicing a kind of everyday architecture in which local context reigns large.\n\nLiu's \"Rebirth Bricks,\" made using rubble from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, are pictured in use at the Shuijingfang Museum in Chengdu. DAi Chun/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nAt the Shuijingfang Museum, Liu sensitively surrounded the site's prexisting wood-framed buildings with new concrete structures. Arch-Exist/The Pritzker Architecture Prize\n\nBut does this mean the architect\u2019s vision will always be restricted to China, the country he most intimately understands?\n\nDespite designing the first overseas pavilion for London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in Beijing in 2018 and lecturing at institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and London\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts, Liu has never completed a project abroad. Asked whether he would relish the prospect of a prestigious international commission, an opportunity winning the Pritzker Prize will surely present, Liu said his approach could indeed be adapted to foreign contexts with sufficient research and preparation.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of method and methodology, there is actually no problem in doing it abroad,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAs long as I am fully familiar with the place, I think (my) set of methods is completely applicable.\u201d",

In this light, some of Europe\u2019s most rarified shareholders have turned to monetising crown jewel stocks that are trading close to record highs.\n\nLast week, huge trades in Italian luxury automobile giant Ferrari [BIT:RACE, NASDAQ:RACE] and Swiss pharmaceutical conglomerate Novartis [SWX:NOVN] added billions to European YTD block volumes.\n\nThis followed a EUR 1.4bn sell-down in German medical devices company Siemens Healthineers [ETR:SHL] by its parent company earlier in February.\n\nOver the past decade, only 2021 and 2020 have had better starts in terms of European block trades, according to Dealogic data. Deal flow also came from 134 deals in 2021, and 91 in 2020, compared with just 59 European accelerated deals as of March 3 this year. In short, mega deals have dominated this year.\n\nEurope has shown a strong capacity for big block trades in recent years, as exemplified by long sell-down processes in LSEG [LON:LSEG] and Haleon [LON:HLN], but February\u2019s trades are a substantially different beast.\n\nThe Ferrari and Novartis trades were both brought by family shareholders with long historic links to the stocks they were selling \u2013 the Angelli dynasty in Ferrari, through Exor, and the Sandoz family in Novartis, through Emasan AG, an arm linked to the Sandoz Family Foundation.\n\nNeither trade was expected by the market and were of a significant size.\n\nThe Ferrari trade was the first block in the stock and only the second capital markets offering of Ferrari shares since its 2016 IPO. The Sandoz family\u2019s sale in Novartis, meanwhile, was the first accelerated sell-down of its stake in decades.\n\nIn both cases, the underlying stocks were trading close to record highs, a sign of the exuberance being shown towards European equities.\n\nExor CEO John Elkann noted after the deal the huge equity growth had taken Ferrari\u2019s share in Exor\u2019s portfolio to 50% of NAV and that the transaction helped it reduce its concentration and improve diversification. He added that the latter will also be achieved by making a sizeable new acquisition.\n\nTo be able to print such huge deals \u2013 without any real foreshadowing to the market \u2013 shows how much demand there is for European equity.\n\nEnd of US exceptionalism\n\nCapacity for European blocks has come in juxtaposition with a broader thematic of investment flows into Europe and away from the once dominant US market. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 is up 9% YTD, while the S&P 500 is up only 1.46%. The NASDAQ 100 is down 0.43%.\n\n\u201cThere is much more interest in Europe, which is seen as very attractively valued versus the US, but it is broader than that,\u201d said an ECM banker involved in last week\u2019s activity. \u201cThe recent block trades we have seen are really benefitting from the reversal of the US equity exceptionalism, which has dominated over the last few years.\u201d\n\nAs of January 2025, 73.57% of the MSCI World Index was held in US stocks. The two largest European country weights were the UK with 3.49% and France with 2.67%, while the rest of Europe fell into \u201cother\u201d at 12.04%.\n\n\u201cIf US pension funds, for example, just wanted to allocate an extra 1% to Europe, then that\u2019s going to take quite a bit of allocation for them to get there,\u201d noted an ECM investor.\n\nThe investment flows into Europe have not only pushed reference share prices to such attractive points that sellers want to monetise, but they also mean that there is demand for that monetisation in capital markets.\n\nTo speed up this process, several ECM bankers note that these US investors have been taking larger stakes in block trades, which has allowed for a deal rush so far this year.\n\nA second investor noted that he is optimistic about European ECM, but cautious about how long this trend of more flow to Europe might continue.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing consensus that US market dominance has peaked, and investors need to redeploy and grow their investment in Europe,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe always start the year positively on Europe but certainly this year feels different.\u201d\n\nThe investor added that geopolitical noise might be driving some of this shift in allocation, with an unpredictable Trump administration clouding the near-term outlook for many US stocks, and Europe looking increasingly more stable.\n\nA second banker involved in the deals last week agreed that some concern over US political stability might be playing a part in the allocation shift, although he added that structurally, Europe might not be much more stable than the US.\n\n\u201cThere are issues with the UK economy and the picture in Germany is far from certain, even after the elections,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the marketing around Europe is just so much better at the moment.\u201d\n\nAs long as Europe has a good story to sell, there will be hopes that the investment flows, and therefore an opportunity for large sell-downs, will keep coming.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 10 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNovo Nordisk had, for all intents and purposes, a very good year in 2024. So why did CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen see a compensation increase only in line with inflation?\n\nFor Big Pharma CEOs, compensation can swing drastically year to year \u2014 from base salary to bonus incentives to stock options and more, the performance of the company and the overall industry plays a major role. But there are many other factors at play, as well.\n\nFor example, 2023 showcased major fluctuations in pay among U.S. leaders. David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, saw double-digit compensation growth that year, spurred by sales growth of its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs. The company became the biggest pharma by market cap, and Ricks took home 24% more in overall pay in 2023. On the other end of the spectrum, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla took a 35% hit in compensation in 2023 after sales of its COVID-19 vaccine were in free fall.\n\nAmerican pharma companies have yet to reveal final CEO pay for 2024, but several European pharmas have made the information public, revealing just how closely tied pay incentives are to specific targets.\n\nOutside the U.S., CEOs are compensated similarly, but tend to have lower overall takehome pay than their American counterparts. And a number of factors beyond company performance and trigger adjustments in CEO pay \u2014 even causing them to fall when sales up up. Here, we\u2019re looking at those unique factors that impacted compensation for four CEOs last year.\n\nEmma Walmsley, CEO, GSK\n\n2024 compensation: $13.3 million\n\n2023 compensation: $16.2 million\n\nDecrease: 18%\n\nGSK\u2019s top executive saw her total compensation package fall 18% in 2024 from the year prior, according to the company\u2019s annual report. It\u2019s a stark difference from 2023, when Emma Walmsley saw the biggest pay increase from the prior year \u2014 51% \u2014 across the industry.\n\nThe U.K.-based company reported a 33% fall in operating profit for the year, driven by a $2.3 billion settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits regarding its cancer drug Zantac. The drugmaker\u2019s vaccine sales also fell during the year, although total portfolio sales for the year were up 7%, and its stock price rose after the 2024 results were announced last month.\n\nAmid the turbulence, Walmsley didn\u2019t reap big returns in compensation. And GSK appears to be worried about \u201cretention risk\u201d due to her low pay when compared to industry peers. In the annual report, GSK noted that Walmsley\u2019s pay was more in line \u201cwith \u2018[No.] 2\u2019 roles in our peer group,\u201d and the gap between the CEO and CFO compensation was 40% less at GSK than the group average.\n\nTo fix the gap, GSK plans to move toward a higher pay package for its CEO that is more in line with biopharma peers. With a maximum 50% share price increase, Walmsley could earn up to $27.2 million in 2025.\n\nGSK also started off 2025 with a bang by announcing its $1 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker IDRx at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January. It was one of a handful of billion-dollar-plus deals revealed at the industry event, potentially signaling an M&A rebound for the year.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, CEO, Novo Nordisk\n\n2024 compensation: $8 million (57.1 million DKK)\n\n2023 compensation: $9.5 million (68.2 million DKK)\n\nDecrease: 16%\n\nSwiss-based Novo Nordisk announced positive year-end results last month, with operating profit rising 25% and North American sales jumping 30% in 2024. Sales within the obesity and diabetes business, which includes its ultra-popular GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy, also increased 26%.\n\nDespite the successes, Novo\u2019s CEO still saw compensation fall compared to the prior year.The company\u2019s structure ensured that Lars J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s base salary only increased by 3.5% compared to 2023, in line with all employees in the company and considered as a general salary inflation increase.\n\nThe lower overall pay stems from even higher growth in 2023, when global sales and operating profit were up 36% and 44%, respectively. Therefore, J\u00f8rgensen didn\u2019t receive as high a payout for both short- and long-term incentives, Novo said in its report. Novo also took a stock price hit toward the end of 2024 after disappointing clinic results for its R&D hopeful CagriSema, a next-generation obesity med.\n\nPlus, the company failed to deliver on its DEI promises, which may have factored into J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s decline in compensation, according to Fortune. Within its short-term incentive program, Novo didn\u2019t reach its goals for increasing diversity and inclusion. While the company noted progress, it was less than desired, but all 12 other STIP targets were achieved, according to the report.\n\nThe failure comes as the U.S. is embattled in a culture war over DEI in public institutions and companies. The Trump administration\u2019s crusade to end DEI efforts at government agencies has crossed over to some large U.S. companies, although many pharmas, such as Sanofi, are still investing in their diversity goals.\n\nNovo is aiming to achieve gender parity in senior leadership positions, with a minimum of 45% women and 45% men in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025. The share of women in leadership roles reached 42% in 2024, Fortune reported.\n\nVas Narasimhan, CEO, Novartis\n\n2024 compensation: $21.2 million (19.2 million Swiss francs)\n\n2023 compensation: $18 million (16.2 million Swiss francs)\n\nIncrease: 15%\n\nWith net income up 45% in 2024, Novartis achieved strong financial results for its \u201cfirst full year as a pure-play innovative medicines company,\u201d CEO Vas Narasimhan said in the company\u2019s year-end earnings announcement. The Swiss pharma saw better-than-expected sales for several drugs at the end of the year, including the heart failure med Entresto, which will lose exclusivity this year, as well as cancer drugs Kesimpta and Kisqali, according to Reuters.\n\nThe exec\u2019s pay included $8.3 million in long-term incentives, while Narasimham\u2019s base salary rose about 13%. The long-term incentives won\u2019t actually pay out until 2026, however, as Novartis uses a three-year cycle for this variable.\n\n2024 marked a turning point for Novartis as it focused on its four core therapeutic areas \u2014 cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology. The company snagged FDA approvals for a new kidney disease medication, expanded approval for Kisqali and accelerated approval for its leukemia drug Scemblix. Looking ahead, Narasimham anticipates 15 \u201csubmission-enabling readouts\u201d over the next few years and upwards of 30 potential new assets,\u201d he said in the earnings announcement.\n\nThomas Schinecker, CEO, Roche\n\n2024 compensation: $11.1 million (10 million Swiss francs)\n\n2023 compensation: $10.6 million (9.6 million Swiss francs)\n\nIncrease: 4.5%\n\nSwiss pharma Roche announced that pharma sales rose 8% in 2024 excluding COVID-19 products. Among the highlights for the year, Roche earned EU approval for its eye injection therapy Vabysmo, which saw a surge in sales at the start of the year despite market competition. In the U.S., Roche also received FDA nods for new cancer and multiple sclerosis drugs. Plus Roche made or announced a handful of acquisitions during the year, including its takeover of cell and gene therapy company Poseida Therapeutics in a deal worth up to $1.5 billion.\n\nSchinecker\u2019s base salary increased nearly $250,000 from 2023, to just under $3.6 million, while his bonuses increased from roughly $3.6 million in 2023 (in the form of shares) to nearly $3.8 million in 2024. Other stock awards, payments and benefits rounded out his total pay package for the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s pipeline includes several late-stage cancer targets, as well immunology and neurology assets, and Schinecker anticipates the pharma will have new readouts in 2025 with potential drug launches in 2026. Roche expects 12 key readouts throughout the year, he said during the company\u2019s earnings call.",

This 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consists of three parallel cohorts. Participants are assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive either 270 mg or 450 mg of efzofitimod, or a placebo, administered intravenously once a month for a total of six doses. The trial aims to enroll up to 25 SSc-ILD patients and is actively recruiting at multiple sites across the U.S.The market for Systemic Sclerosis-associated Lung Disease is expected to experience significant growth, driven by increased adoption of existing treatments, the anticipated introduction of one-time gene therapies, and heightened awareness.Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a condition marked by fibrosis, vasculopathy, and inflammation, affecting multiple organs and systems with serious prognostic implications. When SSc impacts the lungs, it can lead to pulmonary complications such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Patients with SSc face a high risk of developing ILD as a complication, which can result in lung inflammation and scarring, ultimately leading to respiratory failure.Among global markets, the United States holds the largest share of the Systemic Sclerosis-associated Lung Disease market, surpassing the EU4 nations (Germany, Spain, Italy, France), the United Kingdom, and Japan.The higher prevalence of SSc-ILD in females in the U.S. is attributed to the increased occurrence of systemic sclerosis in women, likely influenced by genetic and hormonal factors.Severity-specific data indicates that moderate cases of SSc-ILD are significantly more common than severe cases.As per DelveInsight analysis, the Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease market is anticipated to witness growth at a considerable CAGRStrategise your business goals by understanding market dynamics @ Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease Market Landscape [Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease OverviewSystemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a condition marked by fibrosis, vasculopathy, and inflammation, affecting multiple organs. When the lungs are involved, it can lead to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Although the exact cause of SSc-ILD remains uncertain, a combination of environmental, immune, and genetic factors is believed to play a role. Patients with SSc are highly susceptible to developing ILD, which may cause lung inflammation and scarring, ultimately leading to respiratory failure.Diagnosing Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD) primarily involves identifying ILD on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest in individuals with known SSc while excluding other potential causes of lung disease. A thorough clinical assessment, including an evaluation of respiratory symptoms, is essential for all newly diagnosed SSc patients to detect lung involvement as early as possible.

As part of the agreement, which is expected to close on June 1st, Syngenta will also lease the Novartis fermentation pilot plant and science laboratories located in Basel, Switzerland. The acquisition builds upon a successful research collaboration between Syngenta and Novartis since 2019.\n\nThis acquisition follows the start-up of Syngenta\u2019s new biologicals production facility in Orangeburg, South Carolina, US. The facility is Syngenta\u2019s first world-scale production facility for agricultural biologicals in the US and will support growing demand for science-based and novel biological solutions in both the North and Latin American markets.\n\nThese developments come as Syngenta forges multiple collaborations to accelerate the pace of biologicals innovation, as well as fortify its position in key growth areas such as nutrient use efficiency. Over the past months Syngenta has announced various collaborations, including with:\n\nProvivi for new pheromone solutions, targeting devastating pests in key crops across Asia\n\nGinkgo Bioworks to accelerate the launch of innovative biologicals\n\nIntrinsyx Bio in the fast growth area of nutrient use efficiency\n\nLavie Bio to discover and develop novel bio-insecticide\n\nLithos Crop Protect for sprayable pheromone targeting the Western Corn Rootworm pest\n\nTraitSeq to leverage AI to accelerate the development of innovative biologicals\n\nCamilla Corsi, Syngenta\u2019s Global Head of Crop Protection Research and Development, said: \u2033We invest significantly to offer the industry\u2019s most advanced pipeline of innovative agricultural solutions. The integration of these world-class assets opens a new chapter on our ability to develop cutting-edge biological solutions for farmers and reflects our commitment to drive solutions that continue to elevate the sustainability of agriculture.\u2033\n\nJonathan Brown, Global Head of Syngenta\u2019s Seedcare and Biologicals business, said: \u2033With the broadest and most comprehensive portfolio across all segments of biological products, we have established ourselves as a leader in the industry. In a constantly growing market, it is important to ensure a pipeline capable of supporting continuous evolutions. I am convinced that this acquisition will allow us to maintain our capacity to innovate.\u2033\n\nBiologicals are agricultural technologies that harness nature to protect and improve the health of crops. Biocontrols, biostimulants and nutrient use efficiency products complement conventional agricultural inputs, offering farmers greater flexibility to manage pests and diseases, address abiotic stress, and enhance nutrient use efficiency and soil health. Biologicals are crucial for supporting regenerative agriculture and helping agriculture shift towards more sustainable farming practices, and contribute toward Syngenta\u2019s fulfilment of commitments outlined in its Sustainability Priorities. Syngenta has been systematically expanding its focus on biologicals since its acquisition of Italy\u2019s Valagro in 2020.\n\nClick here for more Industry News.",

            "content": "Basel: Novartis has announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion and recommended granting a marketing authorization for Fabhalta (iptacopan) \u2013 a first-in-class oral Factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway \u2013 for the treatment of adults with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G).\n\nThere are currently no approved treatments for patients living with C3G, a progressive ultra-rare kidney disease, which often strikes when people are young. The prognosis for people living with C3G is poor, with around half of patients progressing to kidney failure within 10 years of being diagnosed, at which point they require lifelong dialysis and/or kidney transplantation.\n\n\u201cC3G is a debilitating condition, often affecting young people and severely impacting their physical and mental health,\u201d said Marianne Silkj\u00e6r Nielsen, Founder of CompCure, a Danish non-profit association committed to improving outcomes for individuals with C3G and immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN). \u201cScreening to secure timely diagnosis and access to targeted treatments are critical for patients, their families and society. This milestone is highly welcomed by the patient community, marking progress toward better patient care for people living with C3G.\u201d\n\nThe CHMP\u2019s opinion is based on robust data from APPEAR-C3G, the first randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study in C3G. The study showed patients treated with Fabhalta, in addition to supportive care, achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 35.1% (p=0.0014) reduction in proteinuria (as measured by 24-hour urine protein to creatinine ratio [UPCR]) at 6 months when compared to placebo. In many kidney diseases, proteinuria reduction is an increasingly recognized surrogate marker correlating with delaying progression to kidney failure. Additional data on the secondary endpoint of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, showed a numerical improvement of +2.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.3241) over 6 months with Fabhalta compared to placebo. The eGFR remained stable during the 12 months duration of the study in the iptacopan treatment arm (+0.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 from baseline). In a long-term extension study, the initial UPCR reduction was maintained and stabilization of eGFR was observed over more than 3 years after initiation of the treatment with Fabhalta.\n\n\u201cC3G has no approved treatments, and patients face challenges with current options,\u201d said Professor David Kavanagh, Professor of Complement Therapeutics & Honorary Consultant Nephrologist at the National Renal Complement Therapeutics Centre at Newcastle University and APPEAR-C3G Steering Committee Member. \u201cWith its strong body of evidence, oral Fabhalta targets the underlying cause of C3G in both native and recurrent patients and can bring hope to patients who currently have a poor prognosis.\u201d\n\nAcross the Fabhalta C3G program, which includes over 100 C3G patients, Fabhalta was well tolerated. The safety profile in C3G patients was consistent with the one established in the PNH indication, with no new safety signals reported in the C3G population6-8.\n\n\u201cIf approved, Fabhalta will be the first C3G treatment available for patients living with this severe progressive disease.\u201d said David Soergel, M.D., Global Head, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism Development Unit, Novartis. \u201cBuilding on our longstanding expertise in nephrology and recent advancements in kidney diseases, this positive CHMP opinion marks an important step forward for our exciting multi-asset kidney pipeline, underscoring our commitment to making meaningful progress for patients with unmet needs.\u201d\n\nFollowing the CHMP\u2019s recommendation to approve Fabhalta for the treatment of adults with C3G, the European Commission (EC) will make a final decision within two months.",

            "content": "It can be difficult to decide which dividend stocks to buy. After all, more than 5,700 of them trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nHowever, three Motley Fool contributors think they can make the decisions easier. They believe that three dividend stocks are no-brainer buys right now -- and all three are big healthcare stocks. Here's why they picked Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.11%), Novartis (NVS -0.05%), and Pfizer (PFE 0.47%).\n\nLook beyond the legal and regulatory troubles\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Johnson & Johnson): There is no denying that Johnson & Johnson has an incredible dividend record. The company has raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. However, some might argue the stock is no longer a good pick for income investors. Johnson & Johnson has encountered legal troubles in the form of thousands of lawsuits regarding its talc-based products, which, some plaintiffs allege, gave them cancer.\n\nThat's on top of the U.S. government's newly acquired regulatory authority to negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Some of Johnson & Johnson's medicines have already been targeted, and it will result in lower revenue for the company from these products.\n\nHowever, Johnson & Johnson remains a no-brainer dividend stock. Despite its legal issues, it has maintained its AAA rating from Standard & Poor, the highest credit rating available, and a sign of the strength of its balance sheet. Johnson & Johnson can take care of its financial obligations. That's the clear message. Further, the drugmaker has moved closer to solving its legal issues with a proposed solution via a subsidiary that will put more than 99% of these lawsuits to bed.\n\nMost plaintiffs are already on board, so even if it isn't a done deal, it's moving in that direction. Lastly, Johnson & Johnson should succeed in navigating the new regulatory regime in the U.S. For one, the company has a strong medical device unit that grants it some diversification. It isn't solely dependent on its pharmaceutical business. Second, Johnson & Johnson has survived and thrived through many regulatory changes that directly affected its business over 100 years of history.\n\nExpect the company to find ways to get around this issue in the long run. In short, Johnson & Johnson's underlying business remains strong -- and its dividend program about as safe as they come -- despite its recent headwinds. The stock is still an excellent pick for income-oriented investors.\n\nNovartis is a dependable, high-yielding stock to own for years\n\nDavid Jagielski (Novartis): Swiss pharma stock Novartis pays a high yield, offers steady growth, and is priced reasonably, making it a potential ideal option for income-seeking investors. At 3.5%, its dividend yield is more than twice the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. The company has increased its payout for 28 straight years and with a payout ratio of around 64%, there's still room for even more rate hikes in the future, especially as Novartis' growth continues.\n\nWhat's appealing about the business is that it's going after sustainable and modest single-digit growth of around 5% per year, through to 2029 (at constant exchange rates); it isn't taking on big risks and swinging for the fences. The company has a robust pipeline with more than 100 projects ongoing, spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and others. Meanwhile, the business already has many high-growth products in its portfolio, including heart medication Entresto, which generated 31% revenue growth last year.\n\nNovartis may not be the flashiest stock, but that can make it an underrated buy as it trades at just 13 times its projected future earnings (based on analyst forecasts). With a modest valuation, investors are getting a good margin of safety with the stock while locking in a fairly high yield. If you're a dividend investor in search of a high payout that's safe and growing, Novartis looks like a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nAn ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a bargain\n\nKeith Speights (Pfizer): You won't find many dividend stocks in the healthcare sector with a juicier dividend than Pfizer. The big drugmaker's forward dividend yield is an ultra-high 6.5%. Is this dividend in jeopardy of being cut? Nope. Pfizer's management plans to maintain and grow the dividend payout.\n\nI think Pfizer will be able to deliver on this commitment. The company already has a solid track record of dividends -- 345 consecutive quarterly dividend payments and 16 years in a row of increasing the dividend.\n\nMore importantly, Pfizer should have the products needed to generate sufficient free cash flow to keep the dividends flowing and growing. Sure, the company's COVID-19 sales have plunged. And, yes, Pfizer faces a looming patent cliff with several top-selling products losing exclusivity. However, the big drugmaker also has multiple strong growth drivers, notably including cancer drugs Adcetris and Padcev and migraine therapy Nurtec ODT.\n\nThere's another reason to buy Pfizer stock in addition to its fantastic dividend, though: valuation. Pfizer's shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.07. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a super-low 0.18, according to LSEG. If Pfizer can deliver only modest growth (which I think it can), this ultra-high-yield dividend stock is a bona fide bargain.",

            "content": "Gene therapy is a method of modifying a person's genes to treat or cure a disease by inserting a genetic material. Many gene therapies use viral vectors to deliver the genetic material to cells and tissues. The most commonly used viral vector in gene therapy is Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV). The AAV is made of a shell of protein called capsid encompassing a single-stranded DNA.\n\nThe stock we are bringing to your notice today is that of a biotechnology company involved in developing new capsids that will enable safe and effective delivery of the genetic payloads - Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. (VYGR).\n\nThe company's capsid discovery platform known as TRACER AAV has generated novel capsids that may help deliver therapies to parts of the brain that were hard to reach before, potentially overcoming barriers that have hindered development of gene therapies for neurological diseases to date.\n\nVoyager is advancing its three prioritized pipeline programs namely GBA1 gene therapy for Parkinson's disease, SOD1 gene therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and a humanized anti-tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe lead development candidates for all three programs are expected to be identified by the first half of this year, with investigational new drug (IND) filings expected in 2024 and 2025.\n\nRecent collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences\n\nOn Jan.9, 2023, Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBIX) and Voyager formed a new strategic collaboration to advance multiple gene therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases.\n\nAs per the deal terms, Neurocrine will gain worldwide rights to Voyager's GBA1 gene therapy program for Parkinson's disease and other GBA1-mediated diseases and three gene therapy programs directed to rare CNS targets, each enabled by Voyager's next-generation TRACER capsids, as well as additional equity in Voyager.\n\nIn turn, Voyager is said to receive up-front consideration of $175 million including a $39 million equity investment, up to $1.5 billion in potential development milestones, additional potential commercial milestones, tiered royalties on net sales, program funding, and an option to elect 50/50 cost- and profit-sharing in the U.S. for the GBA1 program following Phase 1 readout.\n\nThe first strategic collaboration between the two companies was established in 2019 for the development and commercialization of gene therapy programs, VY-AADC for Parkinson's disease and VY-FXN01 for Friedreich's ataxia, as well as rights to two undisclosed programs. However, the Parkinson's disease portion alone of the collaboration agreement was terminated by Neurocrine effective August 2, 2021.\n\nAlliances with Pfizer, Novartis\n\nVoyager has established alliances with Pfizer Inc. and Novartis, under which they are granted access to its next-generation TRACER capsids, potentially enabling their gene therapy programs to treat a variety of diseases.\n\nStatus of Novartis License Option Agreement\n\nVoyager has an ongoing license option agreement with Novartis AG that was signed last March. Under this agreement, Novartis may exercise options to license novel AAV capsids generated by Voyager's TRACER capsid discovery platform for potential use with up to three undisclosed CNS targets, and Novartis may expand the license options to include TRACER capsids for two additional targets.\n\nThe Novartis license decision and the decision on the expansion of the license option are expected by March 2023.\n\nStatus of Pfizer License Option Agreement\n\nThe license option agreement with Pfizer was originally signed in October 2021. Last October, Pfizer exercised its option to license a novel capsid generated from Voyager's TRACER capsid discovery platform to help enable a potential gene therapy program against an undisclosed rare neurologic disease target. This triggered a $10 million milestone payment for Voyager.\n\nCash position:\n\nVoyager ended September 30, 2022, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $131.6 million.\n\nVoyager shares began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on November 11, 2015, under the ticker symbol \"VYGR\", priced at $14 each.\n\nThe stock has traded in a range of $2.60 to $10.60 in the last 1 year. VYGR closed Tuesday's trading at $7.95, up 13.57%.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com",

The former contained \u201ctext heavy, dense, hard-to-read, hard-to-follow\u201d content. The latter replaced that with better use of color and \u201clight,airy and easy-to-convey data\u2026 clear, concise text and infographics telling the story.\u201d\n\nMarti also presented Summit-goers with five \u201cBest Practices for Content Excellence\u201d:\n\nFirst, she said, \u201cmake sure the content initiatives you\u2019re working on directly support organizational objectives and market demands.\u201d This will help in relations with agencies, peers and other content team members.\n\nSecond, \u201cmake sure you are flexible with that content strategy. I work with my brand partners a ton and things change every day. You have to build a content strategy and system that is nimble to some extent, or it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s going to quickly be outdated, people won\u2019t use it, and they\u2019ll just go outside of it.\"\n\nThird, \u201cuse data and analytics to optimize your content performance and resource allocation. It takes time to gather that data,\u201d Marti noted, but by having \u201cdata to back up what we say, you\u2019re going to have a lot better conversation.\u201d\n\nFourth, \u201ccreate continual learning to enhance team capabilities. I saw this happen very slowly at first with us, but it\u2019s starting to pick up steam.\u201d Novartis brands, Marti said, are now \u201cgetting really excited to compete, be first to accomplish a new feat, and get themselves featured [in content].\u201d\n\nFifth, \u201cuse advanced tools to automate where possible, drive collaboration and make content optimization easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of promise when it comes to AI,\u201d Marti acknowledged, \u201cbut there\u2019s also a lot of promise if you look around at the tools already in your organization. There\u2019s a chance those could help you with your content mapping, strategy and planning process.\u201d",

            "content": "Eli Lilly on Friday put more than $1.2 billion on the line in a licensing deal with Boston biotech Magnet Biomedicine, adding another pharma powerhouse to the already-crowded, already-competitive molecular glue space.\n\nAs per the agreement, Lilly will front $40 million, an amount that includes an equity investment into the biotech and which will account for the deal\u2019s upfront and near-term considerations. Magnet will be entitled to certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with the total potentially exceeding $1.25 billion in value.\n\nIn exchange for its investment, Lilly will gain access to Magnet\u2019s proprietary TrueGlue discovery technology. According to Magnet\u2019s website, its platform makes use of \u201cstate-of-the-art screening technologies,\u201d alongside an extensive exclusive library, to systematically discover potential small-molecule drug candidates that can bridge a disease target and another protein.\n\nIn turn, these small molecules, which the biotech calls \u201cTrueGlues,\u201d can enable precise targeting and open up access to targets that have historically been difficult to reach, using the secondary protein connected by the TrueGlue as a path to targeting the disease-causing protein.\n\nThe partners will target oncology indications, according to Magnet\u2019s press release, \u201cspanning multiple diseases with unmet medical need.\u201d\n\nAlso under Friday\u2019s agreement, Magnet will be eligible for tiered royalties on global net sales of any product that results from the partnership.\n\nLilly is the latest Big Pharma to enter the molecular glue market. Last month, AbbVie bet up to $1.64 billion on the technology in a partnership with Neomorph targeting immunology and oncology indications. The California-based biotech is a popular partner in the space\u2014it also bagged a potential $1.46 billion contract with Novo Nordisk in February 2024, followed by a deal with Biogen for up to $1.45 billion in October 2024.\n\nAlso in October 2024, Novartis joined its fellow industry heavy hitters with a $150 million upfront payment to Monte Rosa Therapeutics, gaining access to the Boston biotech\u2019s molecular glue degraders targeting the VAV1 protein, a key player in T- and B-cell signaling. The partnership, which includes up to $2.1 billion in milestones, will focus on immune indications.\n\nPfizer and Takeda are likewise investing heavily in molecular glues, pumping up to $2.55 billion and $1.2 billion into their respective partnerships with Proxygen and Degron Therapeutics.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 28): This article has been updated from its original version to correct that the licensing deal between Eli Lilly and Magnet Biomedicine is worth $1.2 billion-plus, as opposed to $1.6 billion-plus. Also, the companies have disclosed that they will be targeting oncology. BioSpace regrets the errors.",

            "content": "Healthcare marketing is taking centre stage. The Super Bowl, advertising\u2019s biggest event, saw Pfizer, Novartis, and Hims & Hers push healthcare into the mainstream with bold, creative storytelling.\n\nPfizer\u2019s campaign, set to LL Cool J\u2019s \u2018Mama Said Knock You Out\u2019, brought the fight against cancer to a mass audience with a dream-sequence ad featuring a paediatric cancer patient boxing, reinforcing its mission for eight cancer breakthroughs by 2030. Novartis\u2019 debut Super Bowl spot tackled breast cancer awareness head-on. While Hims & Hers sparked controversy by marketing telehealth weight-loss treatments to millions of viewers. The three spots placed healthcare marketing firmly in the global marketing spotlight.\n\nThis spotlight and the recognition that comes hand in hand with it matters. Yet when it comes to the healthcare marketing industry the truth remains that the growing creative power of the sector is still overlooked. Stereotypes that healthcare is an industry that is too heavily regulated for creativity to really thrive abound.\n\nAccording to our Truth About Talent: Healthcare Marketing report 59% of healthcare leaders feel the advertising industry undervalues creativity in healthcare marketing. The research is based on in-depth interviews with leaders from some of the world\u2019s most innovative healthcare agencies, including VML Health, 21Grams, Publicis Health, Ogilvy Health, and TBWA\\WorldHealth. It revealed that while the healthcare marketing industry is driving forward a new wave of progressive creativity, the broader advertising industry is still playing catch up. Yet as the Super Bowl underlines the creativity of the healthcare marketing industry should already be centre stage.\n\nHealthcare marketing\u2019s creative momentum\n\nOur research revealed significant opportunities for talent in the sector, driven by momentum in creative innovation. Healthcare marketing\u2019s stand out success at the Super Bowl was not a one-off marketing moment, but a reflection of the creative resilience of the sector buoyed by stable budgets.\n\nAccording to Market Data Forecast the global healthcare advertising market was worth $42.28bn in 2024 and is expected to reach $67.87bn by 2033. This increased investment was evident in the growing number of healthcare brands advertising in the Super Bowl.\n\nNovartis' debut Super Bowl spot \u2018Your Attention Please\u2019, a hard-hitting breast cancer awareness advert, was a standout creative moment for the brand. The provocative and punchy spot focused on breast health, how common breast cancer is among American women and how they can get screened to take proactive care of their bodies.\n\nWhile the controversial Hims & Hers \u2018Sick of the System\u2019 spot, which promoted the Telehealth companies GLP-1 products, underlined the new ethical questions which come hand in hand with the continued scientific advances in weight loss drugs. New creative opportunities will come hand in hand with challenging new questions.\n\nYet our research shows the healthcare marketing industry is stepping up to the challenge. Many leaders underlined that the biggest opportunity for talent in the healthcare marketing industry is to be in the driving seat of genuine creative firsts. Underlying those career-defining Super Bowl marketing moments is an ongoing industry-wide movement to bring genuine and sustained creative innovation to the sector.\n\nFrom dogs detecting cancer, to a reality TV show to demystify rare diseases, to social storytelling on platforms from TikTok to Reddit. A new era of creative storytelling is afoot. Brands such as Pfizer and Novartis are taking the lead in a more patient-centric and brand-first approach to communication.\n\nAt the same time mainstream consumer brands are increasingly recognising the truth that increasingly consumers expect every brand to consider health. According to research from VML, 81% of people think brands should be making an effort to improve people\u2019s mental health. A state of play which makes every brand a healthcare brand.\n\nBrands are already stepping up to this challenge. Nurofen is continuing its ground breaking campaign to drive health equity and close the gender pain gap. While Heineken has successfully taken aim at toxic productivity and overwork with its \u2018Work Responsibly\u2019 campaign in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe stereotypes surrounding healthcare marketing are out of date. The creative momentum of healthcare marketing is increasingly impossible to ignore. The ability to make genuine creative firsts and make work that makes a meaningful difference to people\u2019s lives is a magnet for talent. The spotlight of the Super Bowl may be over, but shining a light on the opportunity for talent in the healthcare industry is vital. The opportunity to create genuine firsts, work at the intersection of creativity and purpose, and drive real cultural change has never been greater.",

Over the past 50 years, various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved survival rates.\n\nHowever, approximately half of CML patients fail to achieve the major molecular response (MMR), the primary treatment goal. Also, one in four patients discontinues or switches treatment within the first year, indicating a persistent unmet need for improved efficacy and tolerability in treatment options.\n\nWith this expanded indication, Scemblix now offers superior therapeutic benefits and tolerability as a first-line treatment for CML patients, thanks to its novel mechanism of action.\n\nThe approval was based on the ASC4FIRST clinical study, which involved 405 newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP adult patients.\n\nThe study compared the efficacy and safety of Scemblix against investigator-selected TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) and imatinib alone. The study's two primary objectives were to compare Scemblix's treatment efficacy against both investigator-selected TKIs and imatinib individually.\n\nAt week 48, Scemblix demonstrated a significantly higher MMR achievement rate than the investigator-selected TKI group (67.7 percent vs. 49 percent) and a nearly 30 percent higher rate than the imatinib group (69.3 percent vs. 40.2 percent).\n\nAlso, in terms of deep molecular response (DMR) achievement, an essential indicator of treatment-free remission (TFR), Scemblix nearly doubled the MR rate compared to investigator-selected TKIs (38.8 percent vs. 20.6 percent).\n\nScemblix also exhibited a favorable safety profile and superior tolerability. The incidence of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation was the lowest among all study groups, while the incidence of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was also lowest in the Scemblix group.\n\n\"The introduction of TKIs, including imatinib, has significantly improved survival rates for CML patients,\u201d said Professor Kim Dong-wook of the Hematology Department at Uijeongbu Eulji Medical Center, a co-author of the ASC4FIRST study. \u201cHowever, given the chronic nature of the disease requiring lifelong medication, an optimal treatment should offer both strong efficacy and high tolerability from the outset.\u201d\n\nScemblix has demonstrated superior MMR achievement and tolerability compared to first- and second-generation TKIs as a first-line treatment, he added.\n\nKim emphasized that as it is already widely used in third-line treatment, the expanded indication allows CML patients to benefit from its effectiveness at an earlier stage, increasing the potential for successful early treatment discontinuation and improving their overall quality of life.\n\nScemblix is the first STAMP (Specifically Targeting the ABL Myristoyl Pocket) inhibitor, which uniquely binds to the myristoyl pocket of BCR::ABL1. It was first approved in Korea in June 2022 for treating Ph+ CML-CP patients who had received at least two prior TKI treatments and was included in the national health insurance reimbursement system in July 2023.",

However, the earnings growth has not kept up with the share price momentum, suggesting that some other factors may be driving the price direction. The upcoming AGM on 7th of March may be an opportunity for shareholders to bring up any concerns they may have for the board\u2019s attention. It would also be an opportunity for them to influence management through exercising their voting power on company resolutions, including CEO and executive remuneration, which could impact on firm performance in the future. In our analysis below, we show why shareholders may consider holding off a raise for the CEO's compensation until company performance improves.\n\nHow Does Total Compensation For Vas Narasimhan Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?\n\nAt the time of writing, our data shows that Novartis AG has a market capitalization of CHF193b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$16m for the year to December 2024. That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$2.1m.\n\nIn comparison with other companies in the with market capitalizations over CHF7.2b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$10m. This suggests that Vas Narasimhan is paid more than the median for the industry. Furthermore, Vas Narasimhan directly owns CHF42m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.\n\nComponent 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$2.1m US$2.2m 13% Other US$14m US$14m 87% Total Compensation US$16m US$16m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 59% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 41% is other remuneration. In Novartis' case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.\n\nNovartis AG's Growth\n\nOver the last three years, Novartis AG has shrunk its earnings per share by 16% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 11%.\n\nFew shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. There's no doubt that the silver lining is that revenue is up. But it isn't sufficiently fast growth to overlook the fact that EPS has gone backwards over three years. It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check .\n\nHas Novartis AG Been A Good Investment?\n\nMost shareholders would probably be pleased with Novartis AG for providing a total return of 46% over three years. This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nWhile the return to shareholders does look promising, it's hard to ignore the lack of earnings growth and this makes us question whether these strong returns will continue. In the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any concerns with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future.\n\nWhatever your view on compensation, you might want to\n\nSwitching gears from Novartis, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this free\n\nIf you're looking to trade Novartis , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

The company recently reported that it has 4.08 million shares sold short, which is 0.21% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.82 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nNovartis Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Novartis has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Novartis's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Novartis's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.09%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.",

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded this model by granting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) similar authority to negotiate prices for Medicare-covered drugs that lack generic competition and constitute a significant portion of Medicare spending.\n\nUnder the law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) can negotiate prices for high-expenditure drugs. Manufacturers who disagree with the program\u2019s terms or the proposed pricing are not legally obligated to participate.\n\nNovartis, however, argued that the program imposed unconstitutional burdens, challenging it on three grounds: that it violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on excessive fines, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against takings without just compensation, and the First Amendment\u2019s ban on compelled speech.\n\nThe court dismissed Novartis\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim, citing the Anti-Injunction Act, which prevents lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of a tax before it is enforced.\n\nAdditionally, the court ruled that the program does not amount to a government taking under the Fifth Amendment, as it does not forcibly seize or mandate the sale of the company\u2019s drugs.\n\nInstead, the government offers to purchase medications under specific terms, which Novartis can choose to accept or decline. If a company finds the negotiated price unfavorable but still opts to sell, it does not constitute an unlawful taking.\n\nPrice Action: NVS stock is down 1.64% at $107.83 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Satur via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

A spokesperson for the foundation confirmed corresponding media reports on Tuesday evening.\n\nKeystone-SDA SDA\n\nThe move is part of a diversification strategy, the spokesperson explained at AWP's request, without going into further detail. According to the Novartis annual report, the Sandoz Family Foundation most recently held a 4.1 percent stake in the pharmaceutical company.\n\nAccording to the news agency Reuters, it is now offering to buy a total of 26.5 million Novartis shares in an accelerated bookbuilding transaction via its holding company Emasan AG. This would correspond to around 1.2 percent of all outstanding Novartis shares.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the company is aiming to sell the shares at a price of 98.25 Swiss francs per share. This would correspond to a total value of the shares of more than 2.6 billion Swiss francs. The spokesperson for the family foundation did not wish to comment on this either. On Tuesday evening, Novartis shares closed at 100.72 francs.\n\nThe Sandoz - Fondation de Famille is a Novartis shareholder because it has historical ties with the company. The origins of the foundation go back to the Sandoz family, who founded the Sandoz chemical company in Basel in 1866. Since the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz to form Novartis in 1996, it has been one of the Group's most important shareholders.\n\nThe foundation is active in several areas, particularly in Switzerland. For example, in the areas of education, vocational training, higher education and research. It also supports artists and museums through the Fondation Edouard et Maurice Sandoz (FEMS).",

            "content": "Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) for SMA\n\nWhat is Zolgensma for SMA?\n\nA one-time gene therapy, Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) is widely approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It was the second SMA treatment ever to be approved in the U.S. and the first approved gene therapy for the rare disease.\n\nZolgensma was originally developed by AveXis, now known as Novartis Gene Therapies after being acquired by Novartis, which is further developing and marketing the treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s now available in more than 50 countries worldwide, according to Novartis.\n\nTherapy snapshot\n\nBrand name: Zolgensma Chemical name: Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi Usage: Disease-modifying therapy for SMA; can improve or maintain motor function Administration: Intravenous (into-the-vein) infusion\n\nHow does Zolgensma work?\n\nSMA is mainly caused by mutations in the gene SMN1, which provides instructions for making the SMN protein. This protein is essential for the proper functioning of motor neurons, the specialized nerve cells that control voluntary movement. Mutations in SMN1 lead to little or no SMN production, which results in motor neurons dying and, ultimately, the development of SMA symptoms.\n\nZolgensma uses a genetically engineered and harmless adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver a working copy of SMN1 to the body\u2019s cells. The delivered gene consists of double-stranded DNA, meaning that it takes the same form as natural genes and can be activated quickly once inside the cell. With this working gene, motor neurons and other cells can produce functional SMN protein.\n\nWhile most cellular DNA is stored in a central compartment called the nucleus, the DNA delivered by Zolgensma remains outside the nucleus. Because motor neurons do not divide to make new cells, they are unlikely to lose the delivered gene, so a single dose of Zolgensma is expected to promote sustained increases in SMN levels in these highly susceptible cells.\n\nWho can use Zolgensma?\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zolgensma in May 2019 to treat newborns and toddlers up to age 2 with all types of SMA that are caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. The therapy is considered one of the most expensive in the world, with a U.S. list price of single dose set at $2.1 million in 2019, the year it was approved.\n\nThe European Commission granted conditional approval to the therapy in May 2020 for children with SMA type 1 or those still without symptoms but carrying up to three copies of the SMN2 gene. SMN2 is a so-called backup gene to SMN1, and these patients are expected to develop type 1 or 2 SMA.\n\nThe European approval covers children weighing up to 21 kg (about 46 pounds), which generally includes youngsters through around 5 years of age. The therapy is available to eligible SMA patients in England and Scotland through the countries\u2019 national health services.\n\nHealth Canada approved Zolgensma in December 2020 for a similar indication as in Europe. The therapy was recommended for reimbursement in the country only for eligible children younger than 6 months of age. Those older than that may receive the therapy at low or no cost in Quebec on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAccording to Novartis, the therapy also is available in many other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland.\n\nWho should not use Zolgensma?\n\nZolgensma has no contraindications. However, the medication carries a boxed warning for serious liver injury and liver failure, and the risks and benefits of treatment should be carefully evaluated in patients with preexisting liver impairment.\n\nThe therapy is not recommended for premature babies before reaching their full-term gestational age, due to the potential neurological effects of the corticosteroid regimen that\u2019s used along with Zolgensma to prevent liver damage.\n\nIt also should not be given to anyone with an active infection. If a patient has an infection, administration of the gene therapy should be delayed until after the infection has fully resolved.\n\nHow is Zolgensma administered in SMA?\n\nZolgensma is given via a single infusion into the bloodstream, which takes approximately one hour to complete. The recommended dose is 110 trillion vector genomes \u2014 the number of individual viral vectors containing the SMN1 gene \u2014 per kilogram of body weight.\n\nStarting the day before Zolgensma\u2019s administration, and for at least one month thereafter, patients should be given corticosteroids equivalent to oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg of body weight.\n\nAfter 30 days on corticosteroids, liver function should be checked. If values are normal, the patients can be weaned off corticosteroids; if not, corticosteroids should be continued until values normalize. If liver markers remain very high after 30 days on corticosteroids, a specialist should be consulted.\n\nZolgensma in clinical trials\n\nThe approval of Zolgensma in the U.S. was supported by data from a Phase 1 clinical trial called START (NCT02122952) and a U.S.-based Phase 3 clinical trial called STR1VE (NCT03306277). Both tested the gene therapy in babies up to 6 months of age with type 1 SMA.\n\nPhase 1 START study\n\nThe START study enrolled 15 babies who had already begun to experience disease symptoms. The children received ascending doses of the gene therapy and were monitored for two years, after which they could enter a long-term study called LT-001 (NCT03421977). That ongoing study is following patients for up to 15 years.\n\nTwo years after Zolgensma treatment, all of the babies given the now-approved dose were still alive without a need for permanent ventilation. Two of these children could stand and walk without assistance, and nine could sit unsupported for at least 30 seconds.\n\nAt a mean of 6.9 years after Zolgensma\u2019s use, gains in motor function were maintained in all evaluable patients given the therapeutic dose, and three children reached the milestone of being able to stand with support. Generally, more substantial motor improvements were documented in children who had better motor function when they were treated with Zolgensma.\n\nPhase 3 STR1VE trials\n\nThe STR1VE trial tested the therapy in 22 babies. At age 14 months, all but two (91%) were still alive and did not require permanent ventilation. Of the two outliers, one died of SMA complications early on in the study, and one withdrew from the trial before age 1.\n\nMost of the children in STR1VE (82%) did not require any ventilation support by age 18 months, and more than half (59%) were able to sit unsupported for at least 30 seconds by that age. In standardized measures of motor function, nearly all of the children reached scores that are almost never seen in untreated SMA type 1.\n\nTwo similar Phase 3 clinical trials tested the therapy in other locations: STR1VE-EU (NCT03461289) in Europe and STR1VE-AP (NCT03837184) in the Asia-Pacific region. Collectively, these three trials enrolled a total of 57 babies with type 1 SMA, and results were generally consistent across the studies.\n\nSPR1NT study in presymptomatic babies\n\nThe Phase 3 clinical trial SPR1NT (NCT03505099) enrolled 29 babies genetically diagnosed with SMA but not yet showing symptoms of the disease. Based on genetic tests, these babies would be expected to develop either type 1 or type 2 SMA. All of the infants were treated with Zolgensma before 6 weeks of age.\n\nAfter two years, all of the children were still alive and did not require ventilation or feeding tube support. Among those predicted to develop type 1 SMA, 79% were able to stand and 64% could walk independently; for those predicted to develop type 2 disease, all could stand and all but one could walk independently. Many of these children reached these motor milestones within timeframes that are typical for children who do not have SMA.\n\nSMART trial in heavier children\n\nThe Phase 3b SMART trial (NCT04851873) evaluated Zolgensma\u2019s one-year safety and effectiveness in children with SMA who weigh 8.5 to 21 kgs (about 18 to 46 pounds). The study aimed to recruit about 24 children with SMA, ages 17 or younger, who were never given any disease-modifying treatment.\n\nOne year after treatment, no unexpected safety issues were reported. Most children had stable or improved motor function. Some participants reached new motor milestones after Zolgensma, as three children could now stand with assistance, one was newly able to stand alone, and another was newly able to walk with assistance.\n\nStudies of OAV-101\n\nOAV-101 is a version of Zolgensma that is administered intrathecally, or via injection into the spinal canal, rather than into the bloodstream. Novartis conducted a Phase 1/2 trial called STRONG (NCT03381729) to test OAV-101 in children with SMA types 2 or 3. The participants ranged in age from 6 months to 5 years.\n\nSTRONG was put on a partial clinical hold by the FDA in October 2019 after troubling safety findings were reported in animal studies of OAV-101. Such safety concerns were not detected in children treated in the trial, and comprehensive toxicology studies addressed all issues identified by the agency. That prompted the lifting of the trial\u2019s hold in August 2021.\n\nInterim results showed that treated children continued to show gains in motor function and that no new safety concerns were identified relative to those previously reported with into-the-vein (intravenous) Zolgensma.\n\nNovartis then ran the Phase 3 STEER trial (NCT05089656), which is testing OAV-101 in approximately 127 children and adolescents, ages 2 to 17. The participants had SMA type 2 and were able to sit but not walk; none were given any prior disease-modifying treatment.\n\nIn STEER, patients were given either OAV-101 or a sham procedure and then monitored for about a year. After that period, those given the sham procedure will receive the therapy, and vice versa, and monitored for about three more months. STEER was requested by the FDA to aid in the potential approval of this new administration route for older patients.\n\nTop-line results showed OAV101 IT delivery directly into the spinal canal, at a dose of 120 trillion vector genomes, safely led to motor improvements for these children a year after receiving the gene therapy compared with before treatment.\n\nAn open-label Phase 3b study called STRENGTH (NCT05386680) evaluated OAV-101\u2019s safety and efficacy in 27 children with SMA, ages 2 to 17. These children previously were treated with Spinraza (nusinersen) or Evrysdi (risdiplam), but had stopped taking these two disease-modifying medications. No results have been reported to date.\n\nCommon side effects of Zolgensma\n\nThe most common side effects of Zolgensma reported in clinical trials are:\n\nvomiting\n\nelevated levels of aminotransferases (markers of liver injury).\n\nLiver toxicity\n\nZolgensma\u2019s label contains a boxed warning highlighting the risk of higher than normal levels of liver enzymes, acute liver damage, and acute liver failure. Individuals with pre-existing liver issues may be at increased risk.\n\nLiver function should be checked in all patients before administering Zolgensma, and it should be regularly monitored for at least three months after treatment. Liver injury due to Zolgensma is thought to occur due to an inflammatory immune reaction against the viral vector. Thus, a course of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids is administered starting the day before Zolgensma infusion, with the aim of reducing the risk of liver injury.\n\nBlood clotting conditions\n\nLevels of platelets \u2014 cell fragments involved in blood clotting \u2014 tend to show a transient decline following Zolgensma treatment, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts should be regularly monitored following Zolgensma\u2019s use until they normalize.\n\nPatients treated with Zolgensma who show signs of thrombotic microangiopathy \u2014 a group of conditions characterized by abnormal clotting in the body\u2019s small blood vessels \u2014 should immediately be referred to a specialist in pediatric kidney and/or liver health for evaluation.\n\nIncreases in troponin-I\n\nLevels of cardiac troponin-I protein can sometimes increase after treatment with Zolgensma, indicating potential damage to the heart muscle. Heart health assessment is recommended following Zolgensma infusion.\n\nUse in pregnancy and breastfeeding\n\nNo data are available regarding Zolgensma use in pregnant women or its presence in human milk, the effects on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production.\n\nSMA News Today is strictly a news and information website about the disease.

            "content": "Company: Aily Labs\n\nTitle: Founder & CEO\n\nIndustry: Technology\n\nNotable in 2024: Introduced a new autonomous AI agent designed to provide forward-thinking, personalized recommendations to corporate leaders to aid in decision-making.\n\nYou might have seen a headline or two in recent years about a company hiring an AI to serve as its CEO. It's still more gimmicky than reality, but for how long, who knows. It's already fair to say CEOs who don't in the least have the power of AI at their fingertips risk disrupting themselves and their businesses.\n\nFor Bianca Anghelina, who founded Aily Labs in 2020 to offer an iPhone AI app for executive decision-making, her professional experience led to firsthand knowledge of just how disruptive AI could be in business roles, and how to integrate it instead of be replaced by it.\n\nFrom work on structuring systems and data at BMW, to planning and modeling, pricing, and profit & loss analysis at drug companies Novartis and Sandoz, Anghelina worked on operations across dozens of countries and on business plans that took up to a year to develop \u2013 and which would still be less than perfect after all of that effort. That changed when she found AI could simplify the process and get a better plan in place within weeks.\n\n\"I had this idea to get inspired by how technology companies actually run their business,\" she told Laurel Strategies' CEO Alan Fleischmann on an episode of his podcast, Leadership Matters. \"I started to look into companies like Microsoft, and how they actually apply AI. And I got this 'inside out' perspective on how AI can change the way of working. \u2026 what I experienced with AI is disrupting my own role.\"\n\n\"AI changed my life,\" she told venture capital firm Insight Partners, an Aily investor, in an interview. \"It used to take months to get a budget plan together and suddenly I could do it in weeks, which meant my time could be spent on more valuable activities like business strategy.\"\n\nAt Novartis, she led global digital finance and the company's integration of AI, but Anghelina began developing her business acumen much earlier. Growing up in Romania, in a small Transylvanian town called Sibiu, with a statistician mother and a father who she says had a love for numbers, one of Anghelina's favorite games to play she called \"Doing Business.\" She went on to earn a business degree in Munich, took her first stab at product creation \u2013 an RFID chip-enabled messaging product she pitched to companies like Siemens \u2013 and continued on a path she described as \"train my brain for structured solutions, and find solutions as fast as possible.\"",

            "content": "This transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nHello, everybody. My name is Teresa Amaral, and today I\u2019m here to talk to you about biomarkers. I would like to frame this in relation to the treatment of patients with melanoma, especially early-stage melanoma. Do we have any biomarkers that we could use in the early stage of melanoma?\n\nI would like to use a little bit of the knowledge we have from later stages, such as stage IV. But, before we go into that, let\u2019s consider the importance of having such biomarkers by using a clinical case.\n\nI imagined a clinical case of a patient that is 43 years old, diagnosed with stage IIB melanoma \u2014 a 2.6-mm tumor thickness with no regression but with ulceration, so it would be a pT3b, and with a sentinel lymph node that was negative. This is stage IIB according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification, version 8.\n\nFor this particular patient, we have the potential to offer adjuvant systemic therapy with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. Should we give adjuvant therapy to this patient? Can we use, or do we have, other biomarkers that could help us decide if this patient should receive adjuvant therapy or not?\n\nBefore we go deeper into this discussion, because I think it\u2019s important for us to correlate our discussions with real patients in order to make our decisions in our daily practice, I would like to talk about biomarkers and what kind of biomarkers we have in melanoma.\n\nIdeally, we\u2019d have a biomarker that is clinically valid, meaning it separates two groups of patients both in terms of survival, which is a prognostic biomarker, and in terms of response, which is a predictive biomarker. Ideally, it could help us in terms of defining toxicities.\n\nWe would also have a biomarker that is clinically useful, which means it helps us guide decisions that will have a significant impact on a patient\u2019s outcome. Ideally, the biomarker will also be analytically valid, which means that it is reproducible and reliable.\n\nWhat exists in terms of biomarkers in advanced melanoma? For biomarkers that are clinically valid, we have one potential biomarker, which is circulating tumor DNA. We have a potential biomarker that is clinically and analytically valid, for example, the NRAS mutation. Again, these are biomarkers that separate groups in terms of survival, response, and toxicity, but are also analytically valid.\n\nWe have a biomarker that might be both clinically valid and useful, which is the presence of brain metastases. This is definitely clinically valid because it separates patients in terms of response and in terms of survival into different groups. It\u2019s useful because the presence or the absence of brain metastases can give us insights in terms of the patient\u2019s outcome.\n\nIt is not standardized because we know that different types of brain metastases \u2014 in terms of localization, size, and number \u2014 have different impacts in terms of the patient\u2019s prognosis. We know that even if the number of brain metastases is exactly the same, the way that we analyze it, the way that we see it radiologically, or the way we use radiologic tools, make each patient with brain metastases different from each other.\n\nWe also have biomarkers that might be analytically valid and are not clinically valid, but may be clinically useful. You might consider if this biomarker is an oxymoron, I would say that it might be. An example of this is programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.\n\nWe know that it\u2019s analytically valid because we can reproduce the PD-L1 status. We know that it\u2019s clinically useful because, in some countries, it guides decisions since the presence of PD-L1 is associated with the reimbursement of some therapies for melanoma, and for other tumor types as well. However, it cannot really separate patients in terms of response or survival for the majority of the treatments that we have.\n\nWe would like to have a perfect biomarker, one which is clinically valid, clinically useful, and also analytically valid. I would say that the only biomarker we have so far that actually fulfills all these three characteristics would be the BRAF mutation.\n\nIt is reproducible and reliable, so it\u2019s analytically valid. It separates groups in terms of survival and response. It\u2019s also clinically useful because it guides decisions, and the presence of this biomarker significantly impacts the patient\u2019s outcomes.\n\nWhen we talk about biomarkers, two of the most important concepts that we really need to consider are specificity and sensitivity. These are important because, when looking into the biomarkers, we need to know their specificity and sensitivity to understand what kind of information they can give us when we are testing them in blood or other samples. We also need to know what is important for our patients.\n\nIf we consider that individuals who have the condition are positive and the individuals who do not have this condition are negative, then the sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives, and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives.\n\nThis is important because if we want to have a biomarker that helps us identify patients who do need therapy, then we would like to have a biomarker that has a high positive predictive value and a high sensitivity. If, on the other hand, we want a biomarker that helps us to identify patients who do not need therapy, then we would need a biomarker that has a high negative predictive value and a high specificity.",

The company planned to use the money mostly to start a Phase I clinical trial for its lead program ProGly-Uricase, an investigational enzyme-based therapy that had been proposed for severe and refractory gout. GRO is now exploring strategic alternatives to advance that program, Fierce reported.\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarch 7\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals let go about 25% of its workforce this quarter, a cost-cutting move that\u2019s expected to save roughly $15 million through 2027, the company announced March 6. The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported.

However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024.

About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing.

The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

This bold initiative, with a target fund goal of $20 million, marks the most ambitious project in the history of U.S. prostate cancer patient programs. It aims to save lives by addressing critical disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, especially among Black men, Veterans, and rural underserved communities. Disparities, due to factors like systemic bias, can exist regardless of income.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the U.S., claiming a life every 15 minutes . Black men are 75 percent more likely to develop aggressive, metastatic disease and two times more likely to die from it. Veterans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. ZERO's Blitz the Barriers will combine education, outreach, and technology to break down barriers to equitable care across 12 highest-risk urban and rural communities over the next ten years. Helping to launch this initiative is ZERO's new global ambassador and Music World Entertainment CEO, Mathew Knowles.\n\n\"Access to reliable experts, information, and a strong support network can transform an individual's cancer journey.\" ~ Courtney Bugler, President and CEO of ZERO Prostate Cancer Post this\n\nThe $7.5 million commitment from Lead Founding Partner, Novartis, an innovative medicines company, will launch Blitz the Barriers. ZERO will activate in Atlanta and Baltimore, pilot cities with significant disparities in prostate cancer health outcomes, and plans to expand to other priority areas, including Washington, D.C., New Orleans, Detroit, Houston, and others. With the support of Novartis and other Lead Partners, Blitz the Barriers will expand resources in these pilot communities with a goal of saving 100,000 lives by 2035.\n\n\"The challenges posed by prostate cancer are too significant to ignore, especially in communities where mistrust, stigma, or limited resources have hindered access to life-saving education and care,\" said Courtney Bugler , President and CEO of ZERO Prostate Cancer. \"Access to reliable experts, information, and a strong support network can transform an individual's cancer journey, breaking down barriers to early detection, treatment, and survival. That's what Blitz the Barriers aims to provide. Together with Novartis and other Lead Partners, we're ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background or zip code, receives the care and support they deserve.\"\n\n\"I understand the importance of prioritizing my health as a male breast cancer survivor and BRCA gene carrier,\" said Dr. Mathew Knowles, educator, author, music executive, and global ambassador for ZERO's Blitz the Barriers. \"I lost my grandfather and four of my five uncles to prostate cancer, and a recent health scare of my own reinforced why regular screenings are essential. I'm proud to partner with ZERO Prostate Cancer's Blitz the Barriers initiative to foster conversations, break down barriers, and raise awareness that early detection can save lives.\"\n\n\"Together with ZERO, we aim to transform the prostate cancer landscape where screenings and care are available to all,\" said Rodney Gillespie, Senior Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head, US Oncology, Novartis. \"This partnership is a bold step toward a shared vision, and we look forward to embarking on this journey to drive real, lasting change in prostate cancer outcomes at a national and local level.\"\n\nKey strategies aimed at enhancing access and outcomes are central to this initiative. These include educational and screening-focused collaborations with trusted local organizations such as community centers, faith-based groups, fraternities, and barbershops. There is dedicated support for the often-overlooked needs of caregivers and advocacy to influence legislation, as well as to address systemic barriers that limit participation in life-saving clinical trials.\n\nLearn more about ZERO's Blitz the Barriers and how you can support at zerocancer.org/blitz.\n\nAbout ZERO Prostate Cancer\n\nZERO Prostate Cancer (ZERO) is on a mission to improve and save lives from prostate cancer through advocacy, education, awareness, and support.

            "content": "Novartis AG's (VTX:NOVN) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $3.50 on 13th of March. This takes the dividend yield to 3.6%, which shareholders will be pleased with.\n\nView our latest analysis for Novartis\n\nNovartis' Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Novartis' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 25.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 48% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nSWX:NOVN Historic Dividend February 18th 2025\n\nNovartis Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.41 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.83. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.8% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Novartis has grown earnings per share at 14% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.\n\nNovartis Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

These viruses act as vectors, carrying corrective or therapeutic genetic material to target cells, where they integrate with the host's DNA or provide temporary gene expression. This approach is used to treat genetic disorders, cancers, and certain viral infections by replacing faulty genes, enhancing immune responses, or inhibiting disease-causing mechanisms. Common viral vectors include adenoviruses, lentiviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which are engineered to be safe and effective for gene delivery.

By working together, both organisations will explore opportunities to develop projects that align with their shared vision of advancing medical science and improving patient care.\n\nMatt Zeller, Country President, Novartis Australia and New Zealand believes the partnership is an important step for patients.\n\n\u201cWe are always looking for opportunities to collaborate with research institutions to push the boundaries of medical science. This MoU with HMRI provides an important platform to help identify and advance new research projects that could have a lasting impact on patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cCardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Australia, and we must be willing to work together, across the ecosystem, to try new things and see what can actually reduce the burden on communities, patients, and their families. The collaboration will enable us to develop and test new models of care and new approaches to data and patient management that could then be scaled beyond the Hunter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis integrated approach reflects a commitment to addressing complex health challenges through collaboration and interdisciplinary research,\u201d Zeller said.\n\nHMRI\u2019s Institute Director and CEO, Professor Frances Kay-Lambkin, emphasised the potential impact of the relationship.\n\nChief of Research Partnerships, HMRI, Todd Williams and Country President, Novartis Australia and New Zealand, Matt Zeller\n\n\u201cThis partnership allows our HMRI affiliated researchers, University of Newcastle experts and clinicians to deliver life changing innovations at a speed unmatched in Australia, if not the world. Our deep connection to the community enables us to rapidly translate laboratory breakthroughs into practical healthcare solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditionally, it can take up to 17 years for research discoveries to make it from the lab to the hands of clinicians. Collaborations like this with Novartis provide the additional funding, resources, and linkages needed to significantly shorten that timeline, directly benefiting patients and the broader community.\u201d\n\nBeyond the initial focus on lipid management and cardiovascular health, the MoU is designed to support a long-term research partnership. HMRI\u2019s Chief Research Partnerships Officer, Todd Williams, highlighted the importance of this collaboration in driving medical research forward.\n\n\u201cThis MoU is an exciting step forward for HMRI and Novartis, with our existing strengths in working with the University, as it gives a structured way for us to collaborate on impactful research projects. By bringing together our combined expertise, we have a unique opportunity to develop and implement research that can lead to real improvements in patient outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Novartis investment not only transforms the health and wellbeing of our communities but also provides industry with a meaningful way to invest and see a tangible return while doing good for the one million people across the Hunter New England region,\u201d he added.\n\nSteering committee to drive research focus like no other\n\nA key feature of this agreement is the establishment of a steering committee, tasked with responsibility for identifying and prioritising research initiatives under the partnership. This committee will play a crucial role in deciding which projects should be pursued, how they should be structured, and what steps need to be taken to bring them to fruition.\n\nThe steering committee will consist of experts from Hunter Medical Research Institute and Novartis; ensuring that each project is scientifically rigorous, strategically aligned, and practically achievable. This structure provides a clear framework for decision-making and ensures that all projects undertaken under the MoU are well-positioned to deliver real-world impact.\n\nCardiovascular disease experts, University of Newcastle\u2019s Professor Aaron Sverdlov and Professor Doan Ngo, will lead a project that initially focuses on lipid management and cardiovascular health.\n\nProfessor Aaron Sverdlov, who is the Director of Heart Failure at the University of Newcastle & Hunter New England Local Health District and a member of HMRI\u2019s Heart and Stroke Research Program, believes tackling lipid management is a critical modifiable risk factor.\n\n\u201cLipid disorders are a silent killer. High cholesterol often goes unnoticed until it has already caused significant damage, leading to heart attacks, strokes, and other vascular diseases. Through this initiative, we aim to establish best-practice management for lipid disorders, ensuring patients have access to early intervention, lifestyle support, and medical treatments that can significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. By integrating digital tools, dedicated clinics, and improving patient and provider education, we can take a proactive approach to cardiovascular disease prevention.\u201d\n\nProfessor Doan Ngo, the Co-Director of HMRI\u2019s Heart and Stroke Research Program, says the partnership is uniquely positioned to transform regional healthcare services.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration with Novartis is a model for how industry, health services, research institutions, and universities can come together to address a critical healthcare challenge. In regional and rural areas like the Hunter New England Local Health District, patients often have poorer access to lipid management services, contributing to worse cardiovascular outcomes. By creating an innovative and sustainable healthcare model, we can expand service delivery, build capacity in medical and allied health training, and ultimately improve cardiovascular health outcomes; not just in our region, but as a scalable example for other areas across Australia.\u201d\n\nWhat are lipids?\n\nLipids are fats that are essential to the body\u2019s normal function. They include cholesterol and triglycerides, which play a crucial role in cell function and energy storage. However, excessive levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), commonly known as \u201cbad cholesterol,\u201d can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nSeveral risk factors can increase a person\u2019s chance of developing CVD, including behavioural (smoking, insufficient physical activity and poor diet), biomedical (high blood pressure or abnormal blood lipids) and others that can\u2019t be controlled such as age and sex recorded at birth.\n\nImmediate impact for an urgent health challenge\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in Australia, with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a significant modifiable risk factor. However, many patients do not achieve optimal lipid levels due to gaps in care pathways and adherence to treatment guidelines.\n\nEven small habit and treatment changes can make an enormous difference to communities.\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million Australians aged 18 and over (6.7% of the adult population) were living with one or more conditions related to heart, stroke and vascular disease. (source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2022 National Health Survey (ABS 2023c).\n\nIn 2021\u201322, there were 568,000 hospitalisations where cardiovascular disease (CVD) was recorded as the principal diagnosis.\n\nIn 2020\u201321, an estimated 9.5% of total allocated expenditure in the Australian health system ($14.3 billion) was attributed to CVD.\n\nNearly two-thirds (65%, or $9.2 billion) was spent on hospital services, with another 20% ($2.9 billion) related to non-hospital medical services (largely primary care) and 14% ($2.0 billion) spent on prescription medicines dispensed through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (AIHW 2023b).\n\n(source: https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/heart-stroke-vascular-diseases/hsvd-facts/data)\n\nAbout Novartis\n\nNovartis is improving the lives of more than 2.8 million patients across Australia and New Zealand through our innovative medicines. By partnering with the healthcare system, we are working for patients to address their needs, and we are committed to accelerating patient access to life saving treatments and associated healthcare.\n\nWe are reimagining medicine by using innovative science and technology to address challenging healthcare issues and our rich research pipeline has 200+ projects in development.

Core operating income increased 29% (cc) to $4.86 billion, reflecting a combination of higher revenue, operational efficiency, and strategic cost management. Free cash flow surged 70% YoY to $3.64 billion, underpinned by higher cash flows from operating activities.\n\nKey Financial Metrics (USD Millions, % YoY Change)\n\nMetric Q4 2023 Q4 2024 % Change (USD) % Change (cc) Net Sales 11,423 13,153 +15% +16% Operating Income 2,582 3,530 +37% +39% Net Income 2,638 2,820 +7% +6% EPS (Diluted) 1.29 1.42 +10% +10% Core Operating Income 3,821 4,859 +27% +29% Free Cash Flow 2,141 3,635 +70% N/A\n\nRevenue Growth Drivers\n\nNovartis\u2019 Q4 2024 revenue growth was driven by strong performances from its flagship therapies, which saw increased demand, expanded indications, and broader market penetration.\n\nEntresto, the company\u2019s leading heart failure and hypertension treatment, generated $2.18 billion in revenue, reflecting a 34% YoY increase at constant currency. This surge was primarily due to sustained demand in major markets such as the US, China, and Japan, where cardiovascular disease prevalence remains high.\n\nKesimpta, a multiple sclerosis treatment, saw a 49% YoY growth, reaching $950 million in revenue. The increasing preference for self-administered B-cell therapies contributed to its strong performance, particularly in the US and European markets.\n\nKisqali, a targeted therapy for early and metastatic breast cancer, delivered $902 million in Q4, reflecting a 52% YoY increase. The surge in sales was fueled by positive clinical data and increasing adoption in first-line metastatic treatment regimens, strengthening Novartis\u2019 oncology portfolio.\n\nCosentyx, an autoimmune and inflammatory disease treatment, recorded $1.6 billion in sales, growing 24% YoY. This growth was bolstered by expanded indications, higher physician adoption, and new intravenous formulations, enhancing patient convenience and accessibility.\n\nLeqvio, a breakthrough cholesterol-lowering therapy, achieved $223 million in sales, marking an 83% increase YoY. Its growing adoption in lipid management and emphasis on broadening patient reach contributed to its significant growth trajectory.\n\nPluvicto, a radioligand therapy for prostate cancer, generated $351 million, growing 28% YoY. The increase was driven by unconstrained supply in the US and expanded distribution in European markets, positioning Novartis as a leader in precision oncology treatments.\n\n\n\nR&D and Innovation Milestones\n\nNovartis continued to advance its research and development pipeline, achieving multiple regulatory and clinical milestones in Q4 2024 that reinforce its commitment to innovation and patient care.\n\nOne of the key achievements was the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval for Scemblix, a novel therapy for first-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (1L Ph+ CML). This approval highlights Novartis\u2019 leadership in hematologic oncology and expands the available treatment options for CML patients.\n\nIn oncology, the European Commission (EC) granted approval for Kisqali as a treatment for HR+/HER2- early-stage breast cancer. This regulatory milestone solidifies Kisqali\u2019s role as a first-line therapy for patients with high-risk breast cancer, reinforcing its strong market adoption.\n\nAdditionally, Novartis submitted Fabhalta (iptacopan) for FDA approval in the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). The therapy received priority review, underscoring its potential to address unmet medical needs in rare kidney disorders.\n\nA major development in neurology and rare diseases was the positive Phase III STEER trial results for OAV101 IT in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The successful outcome of this study paves the way for future regulatory filings, positioning Novartis for expansion in the gene therapy market.\n\nStrategic Business Updates\n\nNovartis continued to strengthen its financial position and global presence through strategic initiatives in shareholder returns, capital allocation, and market expansion.\n\nThe company proposed a 6.1% dividend increase to CHF 3.50 per share, reinforcing its commitment to delivering strong shareholder returns. This marks the 27th consecutive year of dividend increases, highlighting Novartis' consistent financial discipline and robust cash flow generation.\n\nIn terms of capital allocation, Novartis repurchased 77.5 million shares for $8.3 billion in 2024. This substantial share buyback program not only strengthens its capital structure but also enhances long-term shareholder value by reducing outstanding shares.\n\nNovartis' net debt increased to $16.1 billion, reflecting its continued investments in R&D, pipeline development, and strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The company remains focused on sustainable long-term growth, allocating capital efficiently to fuel innovation and expand its product portfolio.\n\nGeographically, Novartis saw notable growth in key priority markets, particularly in the United States, China, Germany, and Japan. These markets contributed significantly to revenue expansion, driven by strong product uptake, increased regulatory approvals, and expanded patient access initiatives.\n\n2025 Financial Outlook\n\nNovartis expects continued financial growth in 2025, driven by strong product performance, expanding market presence, and strategic cost management. The company forecasts net sales growth in the mid- to high-single digits at constant currency, supported by flagship therapies, new product launches, and increased penetration in key markets.\n\nCore operating income is projected to grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, reflecting operational efficiencies and disciplined cost management. However, the outlook also factors in anticipated generic competition for Tasigna, Promacta, and Entresto in mid-2025, which could impact revenue growth in certain segments. Despite this, Novartis remains confident in its ability to drive long-term value creation through innovation, commercialization, and geographic expansion.",

There is a rising need for effective treatments for ischemic heart disease due to the increasing incidence of potential danger such as obesity and diabetes. One of the other main reasons propelling the market forward is the increasing popularity of interventional medical treatments and the widespread use of anti-anginal drugs to treat ischemic heart disease (IHD) diseases.In addition, The need for drugs associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) drugs is increasing as a result of dietary changes, elevated stress levels, and sedentary lifestyles. However, the ischemic heart disease drugs market is anticipated to be hindered by the high treatment costs and the frequent policy ambiguity around reimbursement.List of Prominent Players in Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) Drugs Market:\u2022 Bayer AG\u2022 Eli Lilly and Company\u2022 Novartis International AG\u2022 Pfizer, Inc.\u2022 Sanofi S.A.\u2022 Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\u2022 Baxter International Inc.\u2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH\u2022 Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\u2022 Amgen Inc.\u2022 F.

Because cardiovascular problems are increasingly common as people get older, the demand is being driven in part by an aging worldwide population. Additionally, newer medications are more widely used because medical research is always improving treatment alternatives.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Foreign Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) stands against the other foreign dividend stocks.\n\nDividends have historically been a key driver of investor returns, contributing 85% of the broader market's total return since 1960. In Q3 2024, global dividends hit a record $431.1 billion, despite a drop in special one-off dividends. Underlying dividend growth remains strong at 6.4% for 2024.\n\nSome markets saw major milestones. According to a Janus Henderson report, China, India, and Singapore hit record-high dividends, while the US got a boost from Big Tech firms, which started paying dividends for the first time. In fact, 96% of US companies either increased their payouts or kept them steady. Financials and tech were the biggest growth drivers, while mining and transport lagged behind.\n\nIndia stood out in a big way, and its dividends surged 27.4% to a record $16.2 billion in Q3. Nearly every company posted double-digit increases, and a whopping 97% of Indian companies in the Janus Henderson index have raised or maintained dividends over the last two years, well above the global average. Japan and Canada also continued their upward trend in the third quarter, with a 6.1% and 6.5% increase in dividends, respectively. On the other hand, Europe\u2019s dividend growth slowed a bit to 3.9%, and the UK saw a 7% drop in dividends, mainly because a few commodity giants slashed payouts to manage debt and weak profits.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region was a mixed bag. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia saw dividend declines in Q3, while Singapore and South Korea posted steady gains. Meanwhile, Brazil\u2019s dividends plunged 42% in Q3, but since Brazilian companies have irregular payout patterns, the drop is not as dramatic as it seems. Elsewhere in emerging markets, Saudi Arabia and Thailand were among the strongest performers in the third quarter. Despite some regional setbacks, the overall outlook for dividends remains positive, with financials and tech leading the charge globally.\n\nFor years, international stocks have taken a backseat to the dominance of major US tech companies, but that trend could be shifting. A combination of global factors is making foreign equities more attractive to investors, with the main reason being the recent decline of the US dollar against the euro and other major currencies since last October. Given this, we will take at some of the best foreign dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out foreign dividend stocks. Next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 13 stocks with the highest values. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of February 12. We have also mentioned the dividend yields and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.",

The availability of a new treatment was game-changing for me \u2013 my energy came back and I started to live again,\u201d said Barry Katsof, president, Canadian Association of PNH Patients. \u201cHealth Canada\u2019s approval of iptacopan now provides PNH patients options to assure that they get optimal treatment benefit.\u201d\n\nThe Health Canada approval is based on the Phase III APPLY-PNH trial in patients with residual anemia despite prior anti-C5 treatment who switched to Fabhalta\u00ae1,5 and supported by the Phase III APPOINT-PNH study in complement inhibitor-na\u00efve patients.1,6\n\n\u201cA safe and effective oral option5,6,10,11 to treat PNH could be practice-changing and can relieve the treatment burden experienced by people with PNH receiving parenteral therapies,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Patriquin, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Clinician Investigator, University of Toronto. \u201cIn treatment-experienced patients, iptacopan was superior to C5 inhibition with respect to hemoglobin improvements and achievement of transfusion avoidance. It was also shown effective in treatment-naive patients, providing meaningful increases in hemoglobin without the need for transfusions.\u201d5,10\n\n\u201cWe are proud that Fabhalta\u00ae has received approval to bring a new oral medicine to Canadians living with PNH, a chronic and life-altering blood disease,\u201d said Mark Vineis, Country President, Novartis Canada. \u201cThis new treatment option provides renewed hope for patients, their loved ones and the healthcare providers who care for them.\u201d\n\nThe clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of Fabhalta\u00ae is currently under review by Canada\u2019s Drug Agency (CDA) and Institut National d\u2019Excellence en Sant\u00e9 et Services Sociaux (INESSS). We look forward to communicating their recommendations with the PNH community, when available.\n\nAbout paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\n\nPNH is a rare, chronic and potentially life-threatening complement-mediated blood disorder2 (a disease that occurs when the complement system is activated inappropriately or in excess). People with PNH have an acquired mutation in some of their hematopoietic stem cells (which are located in the bone marrow and can grow and develop into RBCs, white blood cells and platelets) that causes them to produce RBCs that are susceptible to premature destruction by the complement system.2,4 This leads to intravascular hemolysis (destruction of RBCs within blood vessels) and extravascular hemolysis (destruction of RBCs mostly in the spleen and liver), which cause anemia (low levels of circulating RBCs), thrombosis (formation of blood clots) and other debilitating symptoms in varying combinations and levels of severity.2-4\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 10-20 people per million worldwide live with PNH.2 Although PNH can develop at any age, it is often diagnosed in people between 30-40 years old.12,13\n\n(iptacopan capsules)\n\nFabhaltais an oral, Factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway.Fabhaltais indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have hemolytic anemia.\n\nFabhalta\u00ae is only available through a controlled distribution program under which prescribers must enroll patients and confirm vaccination against encapsulated bacteria.1\n\nAbout Novartis\n\nNovartis is a focused innovative medicines company. Every day, we work to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people\u2019s lives so that patients, healthcare professionals and societies are empowered in the face of serious disease. Our medicines reach more than 250 million people worldwide.\n\nIn Canada, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. employs approximately 600 people to serve the evolving needs of patients and the healthcare system and invests over $30 million in R&D yearly in the country.

Prescribers must enrol patients and confirm vaccination against encapsulated bacteria.\n\nIn December 2024, the Swiss drugmaker announced positive topline results for Fabhalta from Phase 3B APPULSE-PNH clinical study.\n\nThe drug has also shown sustained, clinically meaningful results in Phase 3 APPEAR-C3G study of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G).

            "content": "At Novartis India, the focus on gender equality and the promotion of women in leadership roles is not just a corporate initiative\u2014it's a commitment ingrained in the organisation's culture. Anjali Rao, Country Head of People & Organisation, and Vaishali Iyer, Country Head of Communications & CSR, are leading the charge to create a diverse and inclusive workforce.Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Rao explained that diversity is a key pillar of the company\u2019s culture, and Novartis takes significant steps to ensure equal pay and growth opportunities for women. \"Ensuring that we have a diverse workforce is a cornerstone of our culture at Novartis,\" she affirmed. Since joining the United Nations Equal Pay Coalition in 2018, the company has been working towards eliminating the gender pay gap, fostering a culture where both men and women are compensated fairly for the same work. The company also emphasises pay transparency, recruitment without bias, and the development of women leaders through targeted programs.Iyer echoed Rao\u2019s sentiment, stating that empowering women and enhancing their leadership capabilities is a priority at Novartis. \"At Novartis, we have many programs for accelerated women's leadership, where we get people from middle management to understand what it really takes to reach the leadership level,\" she shared. Iyer and her team work closely with associates to identify individual development needs, offering customised programs that go beyond just performance to encompass overall growth.One of the standout achievements in this effort is Novartis India\u2019s leadership team, where 60% of the members are women. Iyer noted, \"We started this around 2018, and it's been a constant effort to ensure that women's representation increases.\" The goal is to achieve a 50-50 gender split in the leadership team, which highlights the company's commitment to gender parity at the highest levels.When asked about facing challenges or biases due to gender, both Rao and Iyer shared personal anecdotes that reflect their resilience and determination.Iyer recalled a time early in her career when she found herself in a predominantly male-dominated environment. \"Whenever we had these events or meetings, typically the menu card would come to me just because I was a woman,\" she shared. Rather than conforming to the stereotype, Iyer made a firm decision: \"I just don't do that.\" She emphasised that women must assert their boundaries and take a stand against gender biases, no matter how subtle they may seem.Rao, too faced biases in her career, particularly as a new mother. She recounts a pivotal moment when, after returning from maternity leave, she was offered the opportunity to manage a large acquisition. Despite the self-doubt that crept in, she chose to take on the challenging role. \"I want to do it, not because I have to prove a point, but because it\u2019s important for my career,\" she stated. This decision marked a turning point, as Rao not only broke the stereotype in her own mind but also demonstrated that a woman can excel in demanding roles, even while balancing family responsibilities.Iyer: I work towards people, patients, and communities to drive impact from Novartis.Rao: I ensure that people within Novartis are well taken care of, their needs are met, they're productive, and they're happy so that they can do all that we want them to do outside of Novartis.Rao: Ensuring that we have a diverse workforce is a cornerstone of our culture at Novartis. And that basically means we make sure that culturally, everybody is welcome, and we take many initiatives within Novartis, starting from how we pay to how we hire, to how we ensure that their performance is well managed, to ensuring that we provide all the right benefits and all of that. But one thing I do want to mention, in this regard, is that Novartis has signed up to be part of the United Nations Equal Pay Coalition back in 2018. And we are on a journey here. And on this journey, one of the most important things we're trying to do, from a pay standpoint, is ensure that there is pay equity through and through, which simply means that we want to ensure that men and women are paid equitably for equal kinds of work that they do. And in that regard, there are a few things we've done, starting with ensuring pay transparency. We ensure that when we are recruiting, we do it with very little to absolutely no bias, ensuring that we are taking care of women's development and progressing them to higher levels of management, and also within Novartis, ensuring that we are providing equal opportunities for women to grow.Iyer: At Novartis, we have many programs for accelerated women's leadership, where we get people from middle management to understand what it really takes to reach the leadership level. And there is constant intervention around different facets of development. So, it's not necessarily just performance; it could be overall development. And we identify and have conversations with our associates to really understand their development needs and then have customised programs around it.One of the things, as we talk about a diverse workforce and gender equality is we have 60% women leaders in our country leadership team. And yesterday, we had our meeting, and we were discussing how to make it 50-50. We started this around 2018, and it's been a constant effort to ensure that women's representation increases.Iyer: Honestly, no. I have been treated very fairly, whether at Novartis or earlier organisations I have worked for. But one anecdote I would like to share here: very early in my career, it was quite male-dominated; the whole environment was very male-centric. So, whenever we had these events or meetings, typically the menu card would come to me just because I was a woman. And then I just made a choice. I said that is something I will not do. And that's a call I've taken. I've stuck to it for the last 30 years, and I just don't do that. And now people around me know that I don't do that. So that's how in leadership, and when it particularly comes to gender biases, women have to stand up and say this is not acceptable. It's about where you draw the line and say stop. So, I think that's something we need to do ourselves.Rao: It's not so much a red line as it's about breaking the stereotype in your head. Sometimes, of course, we are surrounded by stereotypes, but sometimes we are so surrounded by stereotypes that you start narrating that same stereotype story to yourself. And then that becomes a bit of a boundary condition in which you operate. And I think the first step, at least for me, when I've been growing up, and there are those biases, is that every time I encountered a bias, I chose to challenge it. So, for example, when you have a development conversation about your career with anyone, the normal question comes, especially when you are younger and ready to have a child, or you are expecting, you're pregnant, the question comes: \"Do you want to take more time? Do you want to take up this other opportunity because you now have a child?\" And in my head, of course, it was tough, but on several occasions, I said to myself, \"Yes, I do want to sign up for that opportunity even though I just had my son because I want to do it,\" not because I'm forced to do it or have to prove a point, but that was important for my career at that time. And just a small story on that: several years back, I had my son, I'd finished my maternity break, I went back into the workforce, and I was put on handling a pretty big acquisition at the time. It was massive, and there were many long hours involved, not to mention travel. And, actually, to everyone's credit around me, nobody even thought twice to ask me, \"Do you want to take it up?\" But there was that self-doubt: \"Should I take it up? Is this the right time?\" And at that time, I did take it up, and I'm so thankful that I did because it broke the stereotype in my head that just because I'd had a child and was coming back from maternity, this is not something I'm ready to take up.So, I took it up, I did the travel, it was tough, but it made me stronger and confident about being sure that even after having a child, I have a support system that can take care of my child and I can come back into the workplace and do challenging work that I enjoy.",

While he declined to name potential partners or disclose the status of discussions, he said Yuhan is seeking a deal that \u201cnot only generates revenue but also ensures the drug reaches patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe company's 2024 revenue surpassed 2 trillion won ($1.4 billion), propelled by the success of its lung cancer drug Leclaza (lazertinib). The company is now positioning YH35324 as its next major asset.\n\nYH35324, based on IgE Trap-Fc fusion protein technology, was originally developed by GI Innovation under the code name GI-301. Yuhan acquired its rights in 2020 through a 1.4 trillion won licensing deal, securing exclusive global rights except in Japan.\n\nUnlike Xolair, which is approved for allergic asthma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and nasal polyps but not moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, YH35324\u2019s mechanism suggests a broader treatment potential while minimizing the risk of anaphylaxis.\n\nThe phase 1b study focused on patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who had not responded to H1 antihistamines. It directly compared YH35324 to Xolair, the only approved IgE-targeting therapy for CSU. Results showed that patients receiving YH35324 at 6 mg/kg achieved the strongest IgE suppression and the longest duration of effect.\n\nHalf of the patients in the 6 mg/kg YH35324 group reached complete symptom control (UAS7 = 0), compared to 16.7 percent in both the 3 mg/kg YH35324 group and the Xolair group.

But on Tuesday, it bought Blackstone-backed Anthos Therapeutics in a deal worth up to $3.1 billion. Oddly enough, the Swiss firm is re-acquiring control of a blood clot treatment that it had previously owned. The reason comes down to a mismatch between the pharmaceutical business model and investors\u2019 expectations for centenarian giants.\n\nDrug companies must constantly add new therapies as old ones age out of patent protection, subjecting them to cut-price competition. There are three main ways to do so: develop compounds in the lab, license them, or acquire them.\n\nDeveloping a drug is incredibly costly. Big pharma companies spent about $2.3 billion on average per therapy in 2023, according to Deloitte. To shareholders expecting a mature firm to prioritize returning cashflow to them, this research expense is anathema. Nearly two years ago, Sanofi SAN vaporized about $20 billion of its market value simply by promising to ramp up clinical spending.\n\nEnter Blackstone BX and its Life Sciences unit. It offers a way to share the risk of busted research and turn regular spending into periodic acquisition expenses. Novartis licensed the rights to an antibody for treating stroke to a company controlled by the buyout shop in 2019. The Swiss received a minority stake. Blackstone initially injected $250 million and guided development. After trials showed the drug was effective and appeared safer than traditional anticoagulants, Novartis agreed to pay up to take everything back.\n\nIt's not just big pharma that can use the assist. Investors in the independent biotechnology firms developing novel treatments are more tolerant of risk, but the growing cost of trials can require extremely dilutive equity raises. In 2020 Blackstone invested $2 billion into Alnylam Pharmaceuticals ALNY, valued at $13 billion at the time, to help it fund trials without issuing too many new shares. More recently, it injected cash into Moderna MRNA to fund flu vaccines.\n\nThomson ReutersInvestors are skeptical of big pharma R&D for a reason\n\nThis service comes with a hefty price tag. Blackstone\u2019s internal rate of return in its Life Sciences business is 19%, according to filings, far higher than the 4% return Deloitte estimates Big Pharma notches from research and development.\n\nThere are limits. Blackstone\u2019s unit has only $12 billion of assets under management. Significant expansion, or competition from rivals, would probably lower returns. And drug development is inherently uncertain and subject to political risk. But helping big pharma give its investors their cash fix is a nice sideline.\n\nFollow @rob_cyran on X\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nNovartis said on February 11 it had agreed to buy Anthos Therapeutics for up to $3.1 billion. Blackstone Life Sciences owns a majority of Anthos.\n\nBlackstone and Novartis co-founded Anthos in 2019.

Priced Out: The drug\u2019s cost adds to the nation\u2019s ballooning bill for prescription drugs and puts Zolgensma out of reach for kids in many low- and middle-income countries. These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nVincent Gaynor remembers, almost to the minute, when he realized his part in birthing the breakthrough gene therapy Zolgensma had ended and the forces that turned it into the world\u2019s most expensive drug had taken over.\n\nIt was May 2014. He and his wife were sitting in the cafeteria at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, an infant \u2014 patient No. 1 in a landmark clinical trial \u2014 was receiving an IV infusion that, if it worked, would fix the genetic mutation that caused spinal muscular atrophy, a rare, incurable disease. At the time, children born with the most severe form of SMA swiftly lost their ability to move, to swallow, to breathe. Depending on the disease\u2019s progression, most didn\u2019t live to their second birthdays.\n\nThe Gaynors\u2019 daughter Sophia had been diagnosed with SMA five years earlier. Since then, they\u2019d raced to fund research to save her. Their charity, Sophia\u2019s Cure, was covering a substantial portion of the costs of the trial.\n\nThey\u2019d helped raise about $2 million for a program at Nationwide run by Brian Kaspar, a leading researcher. Gaynor, a New York City construction worker, had forged a tight bond with Kaspar, speaking frequently with him by phone, sometimes deep into the night.\n\nBut their relationship had started to fray when \u2014 with success in sight \u2014 Kaspar became part owner of AveXis, a biotech startup that had snapped up the rights to his SMA drug. Billions of dollars were at stake.\n\nWhen Kaspar walked into the cafeteria that day, Gaynor said, the scientist didn\u2019t acknowledge him or his wife before sitting down a short distance away. Neither did the man with him, the startup\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cIt was like they didn\u2019t know us,\u201d Gaynor recalled.\n\nWhen Zolgensma hit the market five years later, it was hailed as a miracle drug. Some babies treated with it grew up able to run and play. It helped reduce U.S. death rates from SMA, long the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, by two-thirds.\n\nThat leap forward came at a sky-high price: more than $2 million per dose, making Zolgensma then the costliest one-time treatment ever.\n\nHow did a drug rooted, like many, in seed money from the U.S. government \u2014 that is, American taxpayers \u2014 and spurred by the grassroots fundraising of desperate parents, end up with such a price tag?\n\nThe story of Zolgensma lays bare a confounding reality about modern drug development, in which revolutionary new treatments are becoming available only to be priced out of reach for many. It\u2019s a story that upends commonly held conceptions that high drug prices reflect huge industry investments in innovation. Most of all, it\u2019s a story that prompts, again and again, an increasingly urgent question: Do medical advances really have to be this expensive?\n\nProPublica traced Zolgensma\u2019s journey from lab to market, from the supporters there at the beginning to the hired guns brought in at the end to construct a rationale for its unprecedented price.\n\nWe found that taxpayers and private charities like Sophia\u2019s Cure subsidized much of the science that yielded Zolgensma, providing research grants and opening the door to federal tax credits and other benefits that sped its path to approval.\n\nYet that support came with no conditions \u2014 financial or otherwise \u2014 for the for-profit companies that brought the drug over the finish line, particularly when it came to pricing.\n\nVincent Gaynor with his daughter Sophia Credit: Photo courtesy of Vincent Gaynor\n\nOnce Zolgensma\u2019s potential was clear, early champions like the Gaynors were left behind as the private sector rushed in. AveXis\u2019 top executives and venture-capital backers made tens or hundreds of millions of dollars apiece when the startup was swallowed by the pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG in 2018.\n\nWall Street analysts predicted Novartis\u2019 new prize drug would be the first therapy to smash the million-dollar-a-dose mark. The Swiss colossus crafted a sophisticated campaign to justify more than double that amount, enlisting a team of respected academics, data-modelers and pricing strategists to help make its case.\n\n\u201cThis was a case where the charities and the government did everything to get this thing commercialized, and then it just became an opportunity for a bunch of people to make transformative, generational wealth,\u201d said James Love, director of the public advocacy group Knowledge Ecology International.\n\nIn a statement to ProPublica, Novartis said Zolgensma\u2019s price reflects its benefits to children with SMA and to society more broadly.\n\n\u201cZolgensma is consistently priced based on the value it provides to patients, caregivers and health systems,\u201d the company said, adding that the drug may reduce the burden of SMA by replacing \u201crepeat, lifelong therapies with a single treatment.\u201d\n\nZolgensma\u2019s price quickly became the standard for gene therapies. Nine of them cost more than $2 million. A tenth, approved in November, is predicted to run about $3.8 million, just shy of the most expensive, also approved last year, which costs $4.25 million a dose.\n\n\u201cDrug companies charge whatever they think they can get away with,\u201d said David Mitchell, the founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs. \u201cAnd every time the benchmark moves up, they think, \u2018Well, we can get away with more.\u2019\u201d\n\nParents of children with SMA say their concerns about costs pale in comparison to the hope offered by such cutting-edge therapies. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a child\u2019s life,\u201d said Hailey Weihs, who battled her health plan to get Zolgensma for her daughter. \u201cAnybody would want that for their own child.\u201d\n\nThe seven-figure costs of Zolgensma and other gene therapies add to the nation\u2019s ballooning bill for prescription drugs, absorbed by all Americans in the form of rising insurance premiums and taxes for public programs like Medicaid.\n\nBreakthroughs like Zolgensma are often framed as wins for all: Patients get life-saving new therapies. Drug companies and biotech investors make enough money to incentivize even more breakthroughs.\n\nBut not everyone\u2019s a winner, Gaynor noted.\n\nNo one wanted Zolgensma to succeed more than he did, or understands better what it has meant for families like his. Yet his years behind the scenes of the drug\u2019s development left him and his family disillusioned.\n\n\u201cI learned it\u2019s all about money,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about saving people.\u201d\n\nWhen Vincent and Catherine Gaynor started their married life in 2006, they knew one thing for certain: They wanted children.\n\nThey learned well into Catherine\u2019s 2008 pregnancy that they were both carriers for SMA, meaning there was a 25% chance their child would be born with the muscle-wasting disorder.\n\nThey were concerned but clung to the larger chance the baby would be born healthy.\n\nWhen Sophia was born in late February 2009, at first they just marveled at her sweet disposition and bright, expressive eyes. How she loved being snuggled. How she sighed after she burped.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take long for Vincent, who\u2019d grown up with younger siblings, to sense something was off. Sophia didn\u2019t lift her legs. They flopped outward like a frog\u2019s when he changed her diaper.\n\nTheir pediatrician assured them Sophia was fine. Then a different doctor suggested testing her for SMA. While they waited for the results, the family went to a nearby park, and Catherine pushed Sophia\u2019s stroller around a pond. \u201cI remember walking behind her with the video camera and knowing in my heart this was the last day we were all going to be happy,\u201d Vincent recalled.\n\nAfter Sophia\u2019s diagnosis, Catherine quit her office job to care for the baby full time. Vincent started gulping down studies and going to conferences, desperate to find a way to save his daughter.\n\nAt the time, there were no treatments to slow or stop SMA. By the time Sophia was 4 months old, she needed a machine to help her breathe overnight. At 6 months, she could no longer take a bottle and needed a feeding tube. Each time she lost ground, their urgency to find a treatment grew.\n\nThe Gaynors didn\u2019t have deep pockets or wealthy friends. He was a steamfitter with Local 638, from a family of steamfitters. They began raising small amounts of money by hosting golf tournaments and throwing Zumba parties. As the volume of donations grew, they founded Sophia\u2019s Cure, emerging as serious players in the small world of SMA charities.\n\nI learned it\u2019s all about money. It\u2019s not about saving people. \u2014Vincent Gaynor, who raised funds for medical research to help his daughter with spinal muscular atrophy\n\nVincent met Brian Kaspar at a cocktail hour for high-yield fundraisers. Kaspar was among the small group of top researchers working to find treatments for SMA, competing fiercely for recognition and funds. (Kaspar declined an interview request from ProPublica and didn\u2019t respond to written questions.)\n\nBecause his drug was a gene therapy, public grant money and private philanthropy played an especially central role, with the National Institutes of Health alone putting over $450 million into science related to SMA. Drug companies at the time approached these treatments with more skepticism, waiting longer to invest and letting universities and academic hospitals do the heavy lifting, said Ameet Sarpatwari, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who studies the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDrug companies sponsored only 40% of the U.S. gene therapy trials active in January 2019, according to a study Sarpatwari co-authored.\n\n\u201cThe narrative of industry is, \u2018We\u2019re doing the hard, expensive part of drug development,\u2019 and, at least for cell and gene therapies, the most risky part is actually being done by public or federally supported labs,\u201d Sarpatwari said, calling Zolgensma a \u201cposter child\u201d for the study\u2019s findings.\n\nBy the time of the cocktail party, Kaspar had turned early research into a promising drug therapy that he was beginning to test on animals \u2014 the precursor to a human trial. Gaynor remembered him as humble and almost classically nerdy, happy to spend hours on the phone explaining how motor neurons work.\n\nMore established SMA charities tended to hedge their bets, spreading money around to multiple programs. But Sophia was already around 18 months old, and Gaynor had no time for that. In September 2010, when Sophia\u2019s Cure won a $250,000 grant from the Pepsi Refresh Project by amassing votes online, he steered the money to Kaspar\u2019s program. The following June, the charity signed an agreement promising Kaspar up to $1 million more, for which it had launched a drive to recruit 200 people to raise $5,000 apiece.\n\nAs the money flowed in, Gaynor and Kaspar became close friends. The Gaynors stayed overnight at Kaspar\u2019s house on their drive to an annual charity event. Kaspar did a Q&A for the Sophia\u2019s Cure YouTube channel from the Gaynors\u2019 dining room and proofread posts Vincent wrote for the charity\u2019s website.\n\nGaynor said they often talked about how getting the drug through the development process would require way more money and muscle than the various SMA charities could muster. Kaspar shared his conversations with venture capital firms and even asked Gaynor to talk to a potential investor.\n\nYet Gaynor said he was blindsided when Kaspar told him he\u2019d formed a relationship with a Dallas startup called BioLife Cell Bank that had been focused on stem cell research.\n\nThe CEO, John Carbona, then 54, had run medical device and equipment companies, but he had no background in drug development. In an interview, Carbona told ProPublica that he took the reins at BioLife in the aftermath of his mother\u2019s death, determined to do something \u201csignificant\u201d to fulfill her hopes for him. After an associate\u2019s twins were born with SMA, he said he became convinced that Kaspar\u2019s gene therapy was the answer.\n\nCarbona remade BioLife into AveXis: Av for adeno-associated virus serotype 9, the engine of Kaspar\u2019s drug; ve for vector; X for the DNA helix; and Is for Isis, the goddess of children, nature and magic.\n\nStill, for much of the next year and a half, money from charities and more than $2.5 million from the National Institutes of Health remained Kaspar\u2019s bread and butter. In late 2012, Sophia\u2019s Cure agreed to provide another $550,000 for a Phase 1 clinical trial. The Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Foundation, an affiliate of the hospital, agreed to match it.\n\nKaspar singled out Sophia\u2019s Cure for the extent of its support in a Nationwide press release.\n\n\u201cSophia\u2019s Cure Foundation has been the lead funder of this program and their incredible investment in this lab has accelerated our program by many years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trial protocol called for Kaspar\u2019s therapy to be tested on infants up to 9 months old. It was a pragmatic decision: The company had limited funds and capacity to produce the test doses, which would be smaller for children who weighed less. Plus, the youngest children were likely to show the most dramatic results since they\u2019d be treated before SMA inflicted its worst damage.\n\nThat left out Sophia, as well as most of the kids whose parents made up Gaynor\u2019s fundraising network.\n\nGaynor\u2019s dream of saving his daughter had tapered into determination to stop the disease\u2019s progression and preserve the strength she had left. Sophia could no longer move her whole hand, but she could still tap with her right pointer finger. She could use an eye-gaze computer to click open screens and attend school remotely. She could communicate a bit, blinking once for yes and twice for no.\n\nEarly on, Gaynor said, Kaspar had promised a trial for older kids. But Gaynor felt Kaspar\u2019s commitment wavered as his ties to AveXis grew and his reliance on funding from Sophia\u2019s Cure diminished.\n\nCarbona struck a deal with Nationwide Children\u2019s in late 2013, getting AveXis the exclusive right to develop an SMA treatment using the hospital\u2019s inventions, including Kaspar\u2019s, in exchange for stock. A few months later, Kaspar signed a contract that granted him an even larger stake in the company. The company also landed its first major investor, Paul Manning of PBM Capital.\n\nOver this period, Gaynor said, the phone calls and updates from Kaspar slowed. The Gaynors were invited to Nationwide Children\u2019s for the start of the clinical trial by the family of the child receiving the first dose.\n\nAfter the initial awkwardness in the cafeteria, the Gaynors said, Kaspar and Carbona eventually came over and sat with them. Carbona remembers it differently, saying that he recalled seeing the Gaynors that day and the mood was friendly, even celebratory.\n\nTension surfaced two months later when they all converged in Lancaster, Wisconsin, for Avery\u2019s Race, an annual SMA fundraiser benefiting Sophia\u2019s Cure.\n\nThe event brought together dozens of families from across the country for an awareness walk, an auction and a rubber ducky race in a nearby creek. In the finale, parents posed questions to Kaspar, Gaynor and Carbona, almost all of them about the clinical trial.\n\nIn video footage captured by a documentary filmmaker, Catherine Gaynor asked bluntly whether testing the drug only on infants meant the FDA would approve the treatment only for the youngest patients while \u201ceveryone else is left hanging out to dry.\u201d\n\nKaspar acknowledged this was possible. He described expanding the treatment to older children as \u201cstep two\u201d but made clear that funds for testing would have to come from Sophia\u2019s Cure.\n\nThat\u2019s what the money raised at Avery\u2019s Race would support, Vincent Gaynor said, adding pointedly that his nonprofit would focus on the work others would avoid \u201cbecause it\u2019s not going to push stock prices up.\u201d\n\nNeither Kaspar nor Carbona responded directly to the dig. Carbona, noting the company had other funding needs, said they would expand testing when they had proof the drug worked.\n\nI mean, they all have their hearts in the right place, but they\u2019re being run by people who are looking for a return on investment. \u2014John Carbona, former CEO of AveXis\n\nBy early 2015, AveXis had raised millions from deep-pocketed biotech investors, adding members of several venture-capital funds to its board. Their participation would be critical in bringing the drug to market, paying for licenses to patented technology needed to make and administer it, for example. It also meant that Zolgensma had to do more than save lives \u2014 its promise had to make AveXis\u2019 investors a profit.\n\nAlmost immediately, Carbona said, the board pushed to take the company public.\n\n\u201cI mean, they all have their hearts in the right place, but they\u2019re being run by people who are looking for a return on investment,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AveXis moved toward an initial public offering, some on the board questioned whether Carbona should continue running it, he said. He\u2019d been accused years earlier of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty by a former employer, who won a $2.2 million court judgment against him. Carbona had denied any wrongdoing and the judgment was reversed in part and reduced on appeal, but the case left lasting damage. \u201cIt hurt me immensely,\u201d he said.\n\nLater that year, the board replaced Carbona with a new chief executive, Sean P. Nolan, who had a decadeslong record at pharmaceutical and biotech companies.\n\nIn September, a company representative offered the Gaynors a meeting with Nolan, saying Kaspar had stressed how instrumental Sophia\u2019s Cure had been to the work on the drug. The Gaynors traveled into Manhattan for the meeting at a hotel bar. They told Nolan about their concerns, including that older kids wouldn\u2019t have access to Kaspar\u2019s drug since it hadn\u2019t been tested on them. They said Nolan was cordial but never followed up. (Nolan didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions from ProPublica.)\n\nNasdaq posted a video to Facebook with the caption, \u201cGetting ready to ring the #Nasdaq opening bell with AveXis, Inc!\u201d Credit: Excerpt from archived live video clip obtained from Nasdaq/Facebook\n\nEarly the following year, AveXis went public. Nolan celebrated by ringing the NASDAQ opening bell as Kaspar, other company executives and members of the board whooped and clapped.\n\nThe IPO and subsequent stock sales raised hundreds of millions of dollars, but little of the money went toward additional trials on Zolgensma, an analysis by KEI, the public advocacy group, concluded.\n\nThe drug\u2019s trials were small, often involving two dozen patients or fewer. AveXis, and later Novartis, spent less than $12 million up to the point of the drug\u2019s approval \u2014 surprisingly little \u2014 to prove the therapy was safe and effective, the group estimated, based on information obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, from studies and in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. (Novartis did not respond to questions from ProPublica about trial costs.)\n\nThe companies spent more than 10 times that amount to license intellectual property from others, KEI found. It\u2019s not the clinical trials, Love, the director, said, that \u201cmakes developing gene therapies more expensive than it has to be.\u201d\n\nBy the time of AveXis\u2019 IPO, the Gaynors had decided to wind down Sophia\u2019s Cure and step back from the SMA community. In 2015, Sophia began having seizures that became more frequent over time. She was 6 years old and growing weaker. Her SMA had progressed too far for Kaspar\u2019s drug to help her.\n\nVincent\u2019s sense of failure was crushing. In September 2016, after years of pent-up anger, he took a last stab at getting Kaspar and AveXis to acknowledge that the charity and its donors had essentially been a partner in developing Zolgensma.\n\nSophia\u2019s Cure sued Kaspar, Carbona, Nolan, AveXis, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital and its affiliated research institute and foundation for breach of contract. They\u2019d relied on the charity\u2019s money to advance the treatment, the lawsuit alleged, then violated the terms of donation agreements by cutting it out of credit and ownership rights once the drug was headed for success. The suit sought damages of $500 million.\n\nMany larger disease foundations have launched venture philanthropy programs that invest in biotech companies and projects, getting royalties and other financial considerations if their gifts help fund new treatments. In court filings, Nationwide Children\u2019s called the notion that the tiny Sophia\u2019s Cure had any right to the drug \u201csimply not true, or even plausible,\u201d and AveXis called it \u201cwholly unsupported.\u201d\n\nCarbona said he was \u201cdisappointed and surprised\u201d by the lawsuit. Nationwide didn\u2019t respond to questions about the matter.\n\nIn November 2017, as the litigation went on, the results of the clinical trial that the charity helped fund were published.\n\nThey were remarkable. At 20 months, all 15 children who\u2019d been treated remained alive, and none relied on a ventilator to breathe. Eleven of 12 infants who received a higher dose of the therapy were able to sit unassisted, speak and be fed orally. Two could walk on their own.\n\nBased on preliminary trial data, the FDA had designated Zolgensma a breakthrough therapy, one of three special designations that helped it race from human trials to regulatory approval in five years. Once the full trial results came out, AveXis became a red-hot acquisition target.\n\nIn April 2018, Novartis beat out another bidder, agreeing to buy the company for $8.7 billion.\n\nThe sale delivered massive windfalls to those with the biggest stakes in AveXis.\n\nKaspar alone took in more than $400 million. He swapped his longtime family home in New Albany, Ohio, for a 9-acre estate in San Diego County, California, that had been listed for just over $8 million. It featured a dine-in stone wine cellar, a horse ring and stables.\n\nNolan, who\u2019d led AveXis for less than three years, walked away with over $190 million; according to a financial filing, his payout included a golden parachute worth almost $65 million. Manning, the startup\u2019s first big investor, made more than $315 million, multiplying his original investment by about 60. (Manning didn\u2019t respond to calls or emailed questions from ProPublica.)\n\nCarbona, too, made a bundle \u2014 he declined to say how much. Since he\u2019d already left the company, his payout wasn\u2019t disclosed in SEC filings. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said of the money. The 20-hour days he\u2019d put into AveXis had helped advance a lifesaving drug. \u201cThis was a significant impact on humanity.\u201d\n\nAfter watching AveXis\u2019 executives and investors cash in, the Gaynors were dealt another painful setback. In early 2019, a U.S. district court judge in Ohio dismissed Sophia\u2019s Cure\u2019s lawsuit against all parties, concluding there had been no breach of contract.\n\nTheir last hope for recognition of the charity\u2019s role in bringing Zolgensma to the world was extinguished.\n\nOnce Novartis acquired AveXis, it turned to setting a price for its much-anticipated gene therapy.\n\nUnlike other nations, the United States allows companies to charge whatever they want for new drugs. This often means Americans pay the world\u2019s highest prices, particularly during the period when only the original manufacturer can market a drug. Research by PhRMA, the trade group for drug companies, suggests unfettered pricing buys Americans faster access, as long as insurers will pay: New medicines most often launch first in the U.S.\n\nNovartis\u2019 deliberations took place at the end of a decade in which launch prices of new drugs had risen exponentially, drawing ire from patient advocacy groups and Congress. The median annual launch price for a new drug jumped from about $2,000 in 2008 to about $180,000 in 2021, one study found.\n\nIn part, the increase reflected that a growing proportion of new drugs treated rare diseases. Drug companies have argued these therapies should cost more because their markets are smaller, making it harder to recoup expenses.\n\nCell and gene therapies also drove prices higher. The first three such treatments were approved in 2017, launching at prices of $370,000 or more. Luxturna, a gene therapy for a rare disorder that causes vision loss, costs $425,000 per eye.\n\nIndustry insiders assumed Zolgensma would cost more than Luxturna. But how much?\n\nThere was what I would call pressure from Wall Street. This was going to set a precedent. Investors wanted to see a high price here. \u2014Dr. Steven D. Pearson, founder of a nonprofit that assesses drug prices\n\nHow drug companies pick prices for their products is among their most closely held secrets.\n\nBeyond its statement, Novartis didn\u2019t respond to questions from ProPublica about how it set or justified Zolgensma\u2019s price. We reached out to more than three dozen people who were at the company or consulted for it at the time; most didn\u2019t respond or declined to comment. A couple said they were bound by nondisclosure agreements.\n\nThe most visible portion of Novartis\u2019 work was an effort to put a dollar value on how much Zolgensma would extend and improve SMA patients\u2019 lives and offset the costs of caring for them.\n\nThis approach, known as value-based pricing, was originally championed by insurers and consumer watchdogs hoping to rein in drug prices. Other nations use economic assessments to decide whether to cover drugs and at what price, often paying far less than the U.S. for the same treatments.\n\nBut pharmaceutical companies have learned to use these techniques to their advantage.\n\nNovartis brought together experts from academia and top consulting firms to work with its internal health economics team to publish research framing Zolgensma as a good value even at a high price.\n\nOne of the academics was Daniel Malone, then a professor at the University of Arizona\u2019s College of Pharmacy. The target audience was mainly insurers, he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to influence the thousands of pharmacy and therapeutics committees around the country that are going to be looking at this therapy and whether they are going to provide it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the company\u2019s direction, Malone said, their model mainly compared Zolgensma to the only other SMA treatment then on the market, a chronic treatment called Spinraza. It, too, was pricey, costing $750,000 in the first year and $375,000 every year after; over a decade, the tally would come to more than $4 million. (This was hypothetical; the FDA had approved Spinraza in December 2016, so no one had ever taken it for that long.)\n\nA paper Malone co-authored concluded that Zolgensma, at prices up to $5 million, was a better buy than its rival, delivering more therapeutic benefit at a similar cost.\n\nCompany executives publicly floated multimillion-dollar prices for Zolgensma using data points from Malone and others.\n\n\u201cFour million dollars is a significant amount of money,\u201d Dave Lennon, then president of Novartis\u2019 AveXis unit, told Wall Street analysts on a call in November 2018. But \u201cwe\u2019ve shown through other studies that we are cost-effective in the range of $4 million to $5 million.\u201d\n\nSuch talk normalized \u201cprices that would\u2019ve been inconceivable a generation ago,\u201d said Peter Maybarduk, director of access to medicines at the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \u201cIt has a desensitizing effect.\u201d\n\nNovartis\u2019 team of experts also helped the company prepare for Zolgensma\u2019s evaluation by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that assesses whether drugs are priced fairly.\n\nUnlike agencies in Europe that do similar evaluations to set drug prices for national health systems, ICER\u2019s recommendations aren\u2019t binding, but they\u2019ve become increasingly influential among public and private payers when it comes to coverage decisions.\n\nDr. Steven D. Pearson, the nonprofit\u2019s founder, said that as ICER began its review, he was aware that investors were pushing for a big number.\n\n\u201cThere was what I would call pressure from Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was going to set a precedent. Investors wanted to see a high price here.\u201d\n\nAt first, it looked like ICER would resist. Its December 2018 draft report said Zolgensma would be overpriced at $2 million.\n\nNovartis pushed back. Another consultant, University of Washington professor emeritus Louis Garrison, submitted public comments echoing a forthcoming AveXis-sponsored journal article he\u2019d co-authored. It argued that drugs like Zolgensma, which treat rare, catastrophic conditions, deserved higher prices, in part to \u201cincentivize appropriate risk taking and investments\u201d by their developers.\n\nGarrison said AveXis reviewed the article prior to publication, but he had the final say on its content. \u201cI thought I could make a value-based argument that they would welcome and that I believe in,\u201d he said. He said he was not directly involved in the company\u2019s pricing decision.\n\nNonetheless, ICER\u2019s final report in April 2019 concluded Zolgensma would need to be priced under $900,000 to be cost-effective, though it acknowledged the drug was still being tested on infants who hadn\u2019t yet shown symptoms of SMA. If they also benefited, the report suggested the drug\u2019s value might increase.\n\nOn May 24, the FDA approved Zolgensma to treat children under 2 with all forms of SMA.\n\nNovartis finally revealed the treatment\u2019s U.S. launch price, $2.125 million, framing this as a 50% discount on Spinraza and what the company\u2019s research showed the gene therapy was worth.\n\nIt also pocketed yet another taxpayer-funded benefit: a voucher from the Food and Drug Administration redeemable for accelerated review of another drug. Such vouchers \u2014 designed to encourage companies to invest in pediatric rare-disease treatments \u2014 can be sold, typically bringing prices of around $100 million apiece.\n\nThat same day, ICER released an update. New data showing Zolgensma\u2019s substantial benefits for presymptomatic children made the drug cost-effective at prices up to $1.9 million by one benchmark and up to $2.1 million by another, it said.\n\nPearson acknowledged the scale and timing of the switch were unusual, but said it was driven by the data, not outside pressure. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to fit into somebody\u2019s preexpectation of where the number would be, believe me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe immediately caught flak from insurers.\n\n\u201cI got a lot of phone calls saying, \u2018Why on earth did you say $2.1 million was a fair price? How could that possibly be the case? We\u2019re going to get swamped with this,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\nThe Gaynors, linking to news coverage on Zolgensma\u2019s launch, wrote on the Sophia\u2019s Cure Facebook page that they were \u201cecstatic\u201d for children newly born with SMA, but that helping create the world\u2019s most expensive drug \u201cis certainly not what we had in mind.\u201d\n\nMalone said he thought it was mostly the potential for blowback that had prevented Novartis from demanding even more for Zolgensma. He\u2019d recommended charging the full $5 million.\n\n\u201cObviously it didn\u2019t stick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey decided not to price the product there, I think, because of the political backlash they would\u2019ve gotten being the first out of the gate at that price point.\u201d\n\nIn the months after Zolgensma hit the market in the U.S., parents of children with SMA frequently ran into resistance from health insurers that refused to pay for it.\n\nBetween late 2019 and mid-2022, Chicago attorney Eamon Kelly represented at least seven parents battling health plans across the country, helping them appeal denied claims or representing them at state Medicaid hearings.\n\nHailey Weihs came to Kelly when her insurer, a Medicaid-managed care plan in Texas, wouldn\u2019t pay for Zolgensma for her infant daughter Aniya. As the coverage dispute dragged on, Aniya developed tongue tremors and lost the ability to bear weight on her legs.\n\nKelly won the case, as he had all the others, but Aniya\u2019s five-month wait to get the drug was terrifying. \u201cEvery day kids with this disease lose motor neurons,\u201d Weihs said. \u201cWhen you lose them, you cannot get them back.\u201d\n\nNow state Medicaid programs and most employer health plans cover Zolgensma, but they often limit which patients get access. Some require doctors to get approval in advance before providing the treatment or impose restrictions on who\u2019s eligible that go beyond what\u2019s on the drug\u2019s label, such as requiring an SMA specialist to prescribe it.\n\nThough fewer than 300 American children are born each year with SMA, treatments for the disease annually rank among the top 20 drug classes for Medicaid spending. From 2019 through 2022, Medicaid spent $309 million on 208 Zolgensma claims, an average of almost $1.5 million per claim. (Under federal law, Medicaid doesn\u2019t pay list price for drugs, getting substantial rebates; other payers also negotiate discounts.)\n\nGlobally, more than 4,000 children have been treated with Zolgensma, Novartis said. The drug topped $1 billion in annual sales in its second full year on the market. Through 2024, the company had reported over $6.4 billion in revenue from Zolgensma sales.\n\nNovartis is working to expand use of the drug in older children, in part by seeking approval for a second version of the drug, administered by spinal injection, for children with less severe SMA.\n\n\u201cWe are unwavering in our commitment to the SMA community and will continue to advance efforts to ensure access to Zolgensma for SMA patients who may benefit from this transformative, one-time gene therapy,\u201d the company said in its statement.\n\nStill, more than five years after Zolgensma\u2019s approval in the U.S., the drug remains out of reach for children in many low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLove, KEI\u2019s director, said he\u2019s heard from families in countries like India and South Africa, where it\u2019s a struggle to obtain not only Zolgensma, but also other SMA treatments available in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maddening to me,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter setting aside their charity work, the Gaynors refocused their energy on Sophia and her two younger siblings, who don\u2019t have SMA.\n\nThe Gaynor family Credit: Photo courtesy Vincent Gaynor\n\nThey\u2019ve taken the clan to Disney World and to the Bahamas to swim with dolphins. Their youngest, who\u2019s 8, lies beside Sophia on her bed and watches movies with her.\n\nNow 15, Sophia had her longest-ever hospitalization in early 2024 when a virus caused her blood sugar to plummet and triggered frequent seizures. She didn\u2019t wake up for two weeks. Since then, she\u2019s been weaker, her affect flatter.\n\nHer parents say they don\u2019t think about the future. \u201cOur focus is that she\u2019s happy, that there\u2019s love all around her,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just day to day.\u201d\n\nThe Gaynors have taken solace in the idea that, through Sophia\u2019s Cure, their daughter has made a difference for all the children with SMA who came after her. \u201cThat was kind of our consolation prize,\u201d Catherine said.\n\nOne of those kids turned out to be her cousin, Vincent\u2019s sister\u2019s son, who was diagnosed with SMA in 2023 and then treated with Zolgensma. He walked at 10 months and now races around. \u201cThat helped me, in part, feel better about what we did,\u201d Vincent said.\n\nHe still bristles at the drug\u2019s price, which he blames on the payouts hauled in by those at AveXis and now Novartis.\n\n\u201cAll those people, they all came in at the 12th hour once the trial was funded and you had the breakthrough,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce it was taken from us, it was all about greed.\u201d\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

And the overall clinical benefit of abelacimab prompted the Independent Data Monitoring Committee to discontinue the study early. Results from AZALEA-TIMI 71 were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 23, 2025.\n\nAnthos is currently conducting a phase 3 clinical study in patients with atrial fibrillation with high risk for stroke or systemic embolism (LILAC-TIMI 76) as well as two phase 3 studies in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis (ASTER and MAGNOLIA). The data from these trials are expected in the second half of 2026.\n\nBlackstone Life Sciences\u2019 investment in and commitment to Anthos shows the power of combining its scale and deep operating expertise to build businesses that can help bring innovative products to market and substantially improve patient outcomes.\n\nAnthos shareholders will be receiving an upfront payment of $925 million upon closing of the transaction. And Anthos shareholders are entitled to receive payments in the event certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved.

In February 2019, Novartis joined hands with the investment firm Blackstone Life Sciences to launch Anthos. At the time, the pharma offloaded abelacimab to the start-up which, along with $250 million in starting capital from Blackstone, was supposed to take the antibody through clinical studies.\n\nNow, Novartis is paying $925 million upfront for Anthos and abelacimab, which chief medical officer Shreeram Aradhye on Tuesday called a \u201cpotential first-in-class treatment.\u201d Abelacimab, according to Aradhye, could be a \u201csafer approach for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation as well as cancer-associated thrombosis.\u201d\n\nNovartis is also pledging up to $2.15 billion in certain regulatory and sales milestones. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending antitrust and regulatory clearance, as well as other customary conditions.\n\nLast month, Anthos published data from the landmark Phase IIb AZALEA-TIMI 71 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrating that 150-mg abelacimab given monthly achieved a 99% median inhibition of Factor XI, an effect it was able to sustain for more than two years.\n\nPatients on abelacimab saw a 62% drop in major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, as compared with patients on Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Xarelto. The treatment difference was statistically significant, with a p-value less than 0.001. In September 2023, Anthos stopped AZALEA-TIMI 71 ahead of schedule due to the \u201coverwhelming\u201d efficacy of abelacimab.\n\nAccording to Novartis\u2019 news release on Tuesday, abelacimab is currently being studied in three Phase III studies, one in atrial fibrillation and two in cancer-associated thrombosis.\n\nWith the Anthos acquisition, Novartis seeks to succeed where fellow Big Pharma Bayer failed. In November 2023, the company terminated the Phase III OCEANIC-AF study of its Factor XIa blocker asundexian after an independent data monitoring board found that the candidate had \u201cinferior efficacy\u201d to Pfizer\u2019s Eliquis. J&J and BMS also suffered a Factor XIa setback in August 2022 when their candidate milvexian failed to demonstrate a dose response in patients with acute ischemic strokes or transient ischemic attacks.\n\nTuesday\u2019s buyout also continues biopharma\u2019s big-ticket dealmaking streak. Last week, for instance, venture capital firm Bain Capital announced the $3.3 billion acquisition of Japan\u2019s Mistubishi Tanabe. Last month, GSK snapped up IDRx for at least $1 billion and J&J bought Intra-Cellular for $14.6 billion. Another possible acquisition on the horizon is Merck KGaA\u2019s potential deal with SpringWorks, though the companies are still currently in \u201cadvanced discussions,\u201d with no certainty that they will reach an agreement.",

            "content": "Novartis is wagering more than $3 billion that a startup it helped launch six years ago has developed a better blood thinner than what\u2019s now available.\n\nThe Swiss drugmaker on Tuesday announced a deal to acquire Anthos Therapeutics, a Boston-based startup it formed with Blackstone Life Sciences in 2019. Novartis will pay $925 million upfront, and could pay up to $2.15 billion more should the drug at the center of the deal hit certain regulatory and sales milestones. The deal should close in the first half of 2025.\n\nThrough the acquisition, Novartis will regain a blood-thinning drug, called abelacimab, that\u2019s currently in late-stage testing. Novartis originally discovered the compound, but in 2019 licensed it to Anthos, a startup Blackstone Life Sciences launched with $250 million. That deal gave Novartis a minority stake in Anthos, which went on to advance the drug into Phase 3 testing.\n\nAbelacimab is a new type of anticoagulant called a Factor XI inhibitor. It\u2019s designed to be safer than existing blood thinners like Xarelto and Eliquis, which earn their makers billions of dollars in sales each year. But they also carry bleeding risks that can make treatment challenging. Abelacimab, as well as other Factor XI blockers in development by Bristol Myers Squibb and Regeneron, are thought to stop clotting while sidestepping some of those issues.\n\nTesting has yielded inconsistent results, though. Bayer dialed back development of a Factor XI drug after it failed a Phase 3 trial in 2023. Bristol Myers\u2019 candidate was moved into late-stage trials despite mixed findings in earlier testing. Factor XI blockers \u201chave not shown a meaningfully better clinical profile to date\u201d than Eliquis or Xarelto in head-to-head Phase 3 trials, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in December.\n\nGeneric versions of Eliquis could arrive in 2026, too, raising the commercial bar for alternative therapies to succeed.\n\nStill, Anthos\u2019 acquisition \u201coffers another validation for the Factor XI mechanism and its large market potential in the anticoagulant space,\u201d Abrahams wrote after the deal\u2019s announcement Tuesday.\n\nAnthos showed a glimpse of that potential in November 2023, when it presented results showing abelacimab was safer than Xarelto in a large, mid-stage trial. Three late-stage studies are ongoing in people at risk of serious clots who have either atrial fibrillation or cancer-associated blood clotting. Anthos has said study results could come next year.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that this medicine originated at Novartis and have been impressed with the Anthos Therapeutics team\u2019s expertise and dedication and with the great progress they have made on the program,\u201d said David Soergel, head of Novartis\u2019 cardiovascular, renal and metabolism development unit, in a statement. \u201cNow is the right time to bring abelacimab back into the Novartis CRM pipeline.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition is Novartis\u2019 first of 2025. It adds to a series of startup buyouts inked by Novartis in recent years, including of DTx Pharma, Mariana Oncology, Calypso Biotech and IFM Due. Beyond Novartis, industry dealmaking of late has focused more heavily on privately held companies.",

Achieving milestones could bring the payout to as much as $3.1 billion. The deal, which still needs regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first half of this year.\n\nThe acquisition represents a homecoming for Anthos\u2019s main asset, abelacimab, a drug that originated in Novartis\u2019s labs. Anthos launched in 2019 with $250 million from Blackstone Life Sciences and a license for global rights to the Novartis drug, known then as MAA868. At the time of the deal, this drug was in mid-stage clinical development. Novartis retained a minority stake in Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Anthos.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nAbelacimab is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind to a clotting protein called Factor XI. Doing so is intended to block activation of this protein that plays a key role in blood coagulation. Drugs are already available to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots. Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, and Eliquis, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, are blockbuster sellers. But both blood-thinning medicines also come with bleeding risks.\n\nAnthos already has clinical trial results topping Xarelto. A Phase 2 test of abelacimab was stopped early in 2023 due to \u201coverwhelming reduction in bleeding.\u201d Detailed trial results published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine show a 62% reduction in major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding and a 67% reduction in major bleeding compared to treatment with Xarelto. Anthos also reported its drug achieved an 89% reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nAbelacimab, which is administered intravenously at first and then by monthly subcutaneous injection thereafter, is currently in Phase 3 testing in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a high risk for stroke or systemic embolism. Two additional Phase 3 studies are underway testing the drug as a way to prevent the recurrence of blood clots in patients with cancer. Anthos expects these studies will post data in the second half of 2026.\n\n\u201cAbelacimab has the potential to be an important treatment option for the millions of patients globally with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke, and we could not have more conviction in the potential of this asset,\u201d Anthos CEO Bill Meury said in a prepared statement. \u201cWith its deep roots in the cardiovascular space, Novartis is especially well positioned to advance abelacimab\u2019s clinical development and bring this innovative product to healthcare providers and patients.\u201d\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nCardiometabolic disease is one of four therapeutic areas that Novartis has identified as core to its strategy. The others are immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. The Anthos acquisition is timely for Novartis. The Swiss pharma giant\u2019s cardiometabolic product lineup is currently anchored by Entresto, a heart failure drug that accounted for $7.8 billion in worldwide sales in 2024, a 30% increase compared to the prior year. But Entresto faces pricing challenges. Patents protecting the product expire in 2025 and 2026. Entresto was also selected as one of the first 10 drugs subject to price negotiation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The negotiated price will take effect in 2026.\n\nThere have been other efforts to beat Xarelto and Eliquis. In 2023, Bayer stopped a Phase 3 test of asundexian in atrial fibrillation after the study\u2019s data monitoring committee concluded the Factor XIa-blocking oral small molecule was unlikely to be more effective than Eliquis. Meanwhile, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s oral Factor XIa inhibitor milvexian is currently in Phase 3 testing in acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and secondary stroke prevention.\n\nImage: Magicmine, Getty Images",

I am deeply grateful to the Anthos and Blackstone Life Sciences teams, the clinical investigators, the patients in our studies, the advocacy community, and many others who have played a role in Anthos\u2019 success over the past six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud to have launched and helped grow Anthos by acquiring the rights to abelacimab, assembling a world class team, designing the clinical plan and financing its development,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Galakatos, Chairman of Anthos\u2019 Board of Directors and Global Head of Blackstone Life Sciences. \u201cWe believe abelacimab has the potential to be a leader in the new class of Factor XI anticoagulants and are pleased to have Novartis as a committed partner to advance the development and commercialization of abelacimab as a potential treatment option for the millions of patients at risk of strokes. This transaction is an affirmation of Blackstone Life Sciences\u2019 ownership investment strategy, where we seek to find innovative products and build companies around them to meet unmet patient needs.\u201d\n\nIn AZALEA-TIMI 71, abelacimab compared with rivaroxaban (Xarelto) demonstrated a 62% reduction in major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, a 67% reduction in major bleeding, and an 89% reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding. The overall clinical benefit of abelacimab prompted the Independent Data Monitoring Committee to discontinue the study early. Results from AZALEA-TIMI 71 were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 23, 2025.\n\nAnthos is currently conducting a phase 3 clinical study in patients with atrial fibrillation with high risk for stroke or systemic embolism (LILAC-TIMI 76) as well as two phase 3 studies in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis (ASTER and MAGNOLIA). Data from these trials are expected in the second half of 2026.\n\nBlackstone Life Sciences\u2019 investment in and commitment to Anthos demonstrate the power of combining its scale and deep operating expertise to build businesses that can help bring innovative products to market and substantially improve patient outcomes.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nAnthos shareholders will receive an upfront payment of $925 million upon closing of the transaction. In addition, Anthos shareholders are entitled to receive payments in the event certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Completion of the transaction is expected in the first half of 2025, pending the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\n\nAdvisors\n\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as the lead financial advisor to Anthos. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is also serving as a financial advisor, and Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal advisor to Anthos.\n\nAbout Anthos Therapeutics\n\nFounded by Blackstone Life Sciences (BXLS) in 2019, Anthos Therapeutics is a transformative, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with the exclusive global rights from Novartis Pharma AG to develop, manufacture and commercialize abelacimab. BXLS is the majority investor in the company and is joined by other partners including Novo Holdings.

By combining scale investments and hands-on operational leadership, Blackstone Life Sciences helps bring to market promising new medicines and medical technologies that improve patients\u2019 lives and currently has $12 billion in assets under management.\n\nAbout Abelacimab\n\nAbelacimab is a novel, investigational, highly selective, fully human monoclonal antibody that binds tightly to Factor XI to block its activation and prevent the generation of the activated form (Factor XIa). This mimics natural Factor XI deficiency, which is associated with protection from thromboembolic disease.\n\nAbelacimab received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA in July 2022 for the treatment of thrombosis associated with cancer. In September 2022, abelacimab was also granted a Fast Track Designation for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding the proposed acquisition of Anthos by Novartis, the expected timetable for completing the transaction, future opportunities for the combined businesses, the expected benefits of Novartis\u2019 acquisition of Anthos, the development and commercialization of Anthos Therapeutics\u2019 product candidates and the potential benefits of abelacimab.

And the ADWEEK stories about the Novartis ad have been some of our most popular since the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually not trying to be provocative as much as just remind people that everybody spends a lot of time thinking about breasts, but maybe we should pay attention when it matters most, in terms of risk assessment, screening, knowing your numbers,\u201d Horwood said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is use this platform to enable an action to be taken.\u201d\n\nHorwood noted that the ad\u2019s goal was to direct viewers to YouAttentionPlease.com for information on screenings, facts on risk, and quizzes to help get people started.\n\nThe Novartis CMO said that the company had been experimenting with its media mix in live sports over the last year, noticing that the events had a significant impact on viewers visiting websites and seeking information. So, with more women watching sports than ever, the Super Bowl made sense to reach a massive audience and spark conversation.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s attention on the Super Bowl these days, and in football specifically, is a real opportunity to [put out] this larger message,\u201d Horwood said. \u201cIt really is about reframing the narrative.\u201d\n\nThat includes taking the message beyond only women and sparking conversations among loved ones and family members.\n\n\u201cIf only people talked about breast health or reminded their friend, their loved one, their daughter, their mother, to pay attention to this, it truly will result in early diagnosis, early treatment, and that leads to better outcomes,\u201d Horwood said.\n\nMoving forward, viewers can expect more from the campaign. Horwood noted that Novartis is partnering with advocacy groups, including the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, and will continue its awareness marketing in the year ahead.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be something that people think about, remember, and then take an action,\u201d Horwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a single execution.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) stands against other best annual dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nIn 2025, dividends in MSCI Europe are expected to reach a record high. According to Allianz Global Investors, these firms are likely to increase dividend payouts by 4% year-over-year to \u20ac459 billion, up from \u20ac440 billion in 2024. In 2026, MSCI Europe dividends could catapult even higher to \u20ac496 billion. In Germany alone, payouts are projected to rise from \u20ac57 billion in 2024 to \u20ac63 billion in 2025, and possibly hit \u20ac70 billion in 2026. Allianz Global expects the Tech and Healthcare sectors to offer the highest dividend increases in 2025, while the Energy sector could likely create some weakness. The Financials sector will remain the biggest dividend contributor in Europe. Dividend yields are staying ahead of long-term German government bond yields as well, with the MSCI Europe dividend yield expected to be 3.5% this year.\n\nOver the last 40 years, about 39% of MSCI Europe\u2019s total annualized return resulted from dividends. Comparatively, dividend payouts made up 22% of total returns in MSCI North America and just over 41% in MSCI Pacific.\n\nJenny Harrington, CNBC Halftime Report\u2019s go-to expert on dividends, observed that the broader market\u2019s dividends have grown about 5.7% in the last 50-60 years, which means that dividend income is outpacing inflation. She also noted that dividends are a tax-advantaged income stream, which is a huge plus. Harrington also commented that dividend investors are more likely to hold their portfolios rather than selling in a panic when markets go down. They are reluctant to give up their income streams and risk wasting years of effort, which helps keep dividend portfolios steady and resilient, even during market selloffs.\n\nHarrington also told investors that some companies may not have strong growth potential but generate high free cash flow, allowing them to pay dividends. However, those seeking high-growth stocks should carefully balance their portfolios. Harrington advised investors to explore opportunities beyond the broader market, as the index is heavily dominated by its top 10 stocks. She suggested that looking at other companies, including dividend stocks, could offer better value and growth potential. Given this, we will now take a look at some of the best annual dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we manually researched annual reports and company websites to see which stocks pay dividends annually. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of February 6.",

Delaney helped the vision come to life.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our message to be conveyed by authentic storytellers \u2014 people who had a stake in ensuring that screening or knowing your risk was important,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one-off effort\n\nHorwood said the company is taking a strategic and holistic approach to its Super Bowl ad and considers it part of the broader, social-focused Your Attention, Please campaign. This larger initiative kicked off the same day the ad was announced and builds on the mission of reaching at-risk women and encouraging breast cancer screenings.\n\nHorwood noted that while the commercial will get the eyeballs, Novartis has built an ecosystem around the ad to give it a longer tail.\n\nThis includes a concerted push on social media platforms, a campaign website with educational resources around breast cancer and partnerships with patient advocacy groups like the Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, TOUCH (The Black Breast Cancer Alliance) and Breastcancer.org.\n\nThough the Super Bowl is routinely the most-watched live event of the year, it hasn\u2019t been the favored spot for pharma advertising, a point that Horwood is all too familiar with.\n\nFrom her perspective, the business case for Novartis running an ad during the Super Bowl is based on the ability to reach a large, engaged audience of women in order to drive action on an important health issue that affects millions nationwide.\n\nWhile some brands may feel that advertising at the game isn\u2019t the most prudent way to educate consumers on a particular medical condition or promote a medication, Novartis has a different view of the situation.\n\nAwareness vs. advertising a drug\n\nBreast cancer isn\u2019t a rare disease, it\u2019s the second-most common form of cancer in the U.S. and the second-leading cause of cancer death among American women.\n\nNovartis is using this ad as a way to raise awareness of the disease and proactive care measures rather than promote a product like its breast cancer drug Kisqali.\n\nHorwood said prioritizing early detection of the disease and clinical intervention is just as critical as having medicines like Kisqali available to patients later on in the process.\n\nShe added that Novartis\u2019 leadership has sought to emphasize the importance of early detection and knowledge in breast health management.\n\nBy highlighting this issue in front of a record number of women viewers, she said Novartis hopes to improve breast health outcomes and maximize its impact.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just show up at the game, we\u2019d love to say we showed up at the game, people received the message and they took action,\u201d she said.\n\nGoing forward, Novartis has plans to explore more advertising opportunities in live sports. Horwood said live sports are among the only growing areas in entertainment and provide an accessible on-ramp for engaging with consumers about health problems and critical disease states.\n\nThis story first appeared on Campaign's sister title MM+M.",

Alongside fellow actress Hailee Steinfeld, Sykes wants viewers to change the message surrounding breast health.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start paying attention to breasts when it matters the most,\u201d the comedian said in the commercial. \u201cEarly detection for breast cancer is a game-changer. And why I\u2019m able to be here today. So let\u2019s get more women screened than ever before.\u201d\n\nSykes then told viewers to go to Yourattentionplease.com to receive mammogram reminders and prevent breast cancer. The site also includes a link to the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator, which helps women determine their personal risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe 60-year-old is a survivor of breast cancer herself. However, she noted that early screening helped her combat the disease before it spread. Given her history, Sykes detailed why she participated in this \u201cgame-changing\u201d advertisement.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 47, I went in for a breast reduction expecting a straightforward surgery,\u201d said Sykes in the press release with Novartis. \u201cI never imagined breast cancer would be lurking. It caught me off guard, and I\u2019m sure early detection saved my life. As an avid football fan, I know the big game is the perfect time to remind women to know their risks, get checked regularly, and encourage others to do the same.\u201d\n\nAccording to the initiative, patients who catch the disease early have an over 98% survival rate. Novartis aims to prioritize early screening to help shape better outcomes for women of all ages.\n\nBlack women also have disproportionately higher mortality rates, at nearly 40%, from breast cancer compared to their white counterparts, as confirmed by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. With this in mind, Novartis\u2019 advocacy during the Super Bowl, amplified by Sykes, remains critical to change these statistics and potentially save lives.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: NAACP Calls For Cancer To Be Declared A Public Health Crisis In The Black Community",

The deal includes an initial payment of $925 million, with the potential for an additional $2.15 billion in future payments based on specific conditions. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2025.\n\nNovartis Expands Cardiovascular Lineup with Anthos\n\nWith Anthos\u2019 acquisition, Novartis aims to expand its late-stage cardiovascular pipeline. Notably, Anthos was founded in 2019 by Blackstone Life Sciences (BX) and Novartis. It holds exclusive global rights from Novartis to develop, produce, and sell abelacimab, a new drug designed to prevent stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation and cancer.\n\nIn the AZALEA-TIMI 71 trial, abelacimab demonstrated significant benefits over its rival rivaroxaban, including a 62% reduction in major bleeding events. Xarelto (rivaroxaban), developed by German pharmaceutical company Bayer (BAYRY), is marketed in the U.S. by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).\n\nThis highlights the potential of abelacimab as a crucial treatment for the millions of people globally with atrial fibrillation at high stroke risk. Meanwhile, Novartis is well-positioned to lead abelacimab\u2019s clinical development with its strong expertise in cardiovascular care.\n\nFor Blackstone investors, this exit underscores the firm\u2019s ability to identify, develop, and capitalize on high-potential healthcare assets. The rapid progression from its 2019 founding to a $3.1 billion exit in 2025 demonstrates an impressive ROI (return on investment).\n\nIs Novartis a Good Share to Buy?\n\nAccording to TipRanks consensus, NVS stock has a Moderate Buy rating, based on one Buy and two Holds assigned in the last three months. The Novartis share price target of $140.50 suggests a 31.5% upside from current levels.\n\nSee more NVS analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books, the Philadelphia Eagles are champions and medical marketers want to know how the pharma and health ads performed on the biggest stage.\n\nThere were a number of health brands that advertised during the big game, namely Pfizer, Novartis and Hims & Hers \u2014 in addition to Bayer, Cetaphil, Power to the Patients, WeightWatchers and UK Healthcare.\n\nThe former trio of brands all advertised nationally during the Super Bowl, taking different approaches to their creative and generating different reactions from viewers.\n\nIf there was any throughline between the three commercials, it was marketing designed to engage with patients, make them more proactive with their health and meet them on a personal level.\n\nIn a note released Monday morning, EDO said health-curious ads that ran during the big game drove \u201cmassive engagement\u201d among consumers.\n\nLaura Grover, SVP and head of client solutions at EDO, said consumer priorities may be evolving, but audiences continue to gravitate toward practicality and real-world utility over novelty.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Super Bowl made that clear \u2014 practical tech outperformed generative AI, health-conscious messaging resonated more than ever,\u201d she said. \u201cThese trends reinforce that brands can win in the Big Game when they align with real consumer value while taking bold, strategic positions. The Super Bowl isn\u2019t just a branding exercise \u2014 it\u2019s one of the most powerful advertising moments of the year to move the needle on business performance.\u201d\n\nPfizer led the way\n\nMost considered Pfizer\u2019s 60-second ad \u201cKnock Out\u201d \u2014 which featured a dream sequence of a pediatric cancer patient shadowboxing set to LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cMama Said Knock You Out\u201d \u2014 to be the winner of the night.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked the Pfizer ad 10th overall, with an ad meter rating of 3.336.\n\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s Super Bowl spot brought the fight against cancer to the national stage, with Michael Buffer lending his signature catchphrase while LL Cool J\u2019s \u2018Mama Said Knock You Out\u2019 set the tone,\u201d according to the Ad Meter description. \u201cIn the end, the 60-second commercial struck a chord with fans and highlighted a storytelling trend for many of the night\u2019s top ads.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, iSpot.tv named Pfizer\u2019s ad as the top spot by likeability, scoring 19% above the norm.\n\nThe company noted that the drugmaker\u2019s commercial led the way among all Super Bowl ads, not just pharma. According to iSpot, this is particularly notable since pharma TV ads generally don\u2019t score very well with audiences as viewers tend to dislike them.\n\nAdditionally, iSpot\u2019s analysis found that viewers considered the message of triumphing over cancer to be the single best thing about Pfizer\u2019s ad \u2014 cited by 41% of surveyed viewers. The top viewer emotion/reaction was corporate responsibility.\n\nU.K.-based ad agency DAIVID said Pfizer had a strong, positive message with its ad and scored high with intense positive emotions. The commercial was also a top performer with spikes in positive emotions of \u201chope,\u201d \u201cadmiration,\u201d \u201cwarmth,\u201d \u201cgratitude\u201d and \u201cinspiration.\u201d\n\nDAIVID\u2019s survey respondents ranked Pfizer\u2019s ad in the top five in terms of being emotionally engaging.\n\nMeanwhile, EDO ranked Pfizer\u2019s ad 58th and said it had 0.55x as much engagement as the median Super Bowl ad.\n\nKantar noted that Pfizer\u2019s ad ranked in the 66th percentile for impact, the 79th percent for power and the 81st percentile for enjoyment.\n\nHims & Hers\u2019 polarizing response\n\nPerhaps the most controversial ad to run during the Super Bowl was Hims & Hers\u2019 \u201cSick of the System\u201d \u2014 which promoted the telehealth company\u2019s compounded GLP-1 offerings.\n\nThe 60-second spot debuted a week prior to running during the Big Game and received a polarized response from medical marketers, viewers and even lawmakers.\n\nDays before kickoff, two senators asked the Food and Drug Administration to review the ad, saying it ran the risk of \u201cmisleading patients by omitting safety or side effect information.\u201d\n\nThough EDO said Hims & Hers\u2019 spot was the fifth highest-performing ad overall, delivering 7.7x as much engagement as the median ad, the broader response was mixed.\n\nDAIVID said the commercial, which features Childish Gambino\u2019s \u201cThis is America\u201d and a voiceover bluntly critiquing the pharma industry and societal views on obesity, as \u201cthe most pushy\u201d ad.\n\nThe agency said the commercial overindexed on intense negative emotions of \u201cshame,\u201d \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cguilt\u201d as viewers had a lukewarm reaction to the ad.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked \u201cSick of the System\u201d 49th overall, with an ad meter rating of 2.51.\n\nOn the other hand, Kantar said Hims & Hers ranked in the 77th percentile for impact, the 88th percent for power and the 86th percentile for enjoyment.\n\nMeanwhile, iSpot.tv said the message of the ad was the single best thing about it, with 31% of viewers citing it as a top performer for Hims & Hers.\n\nNovartis finishes in the middle\n\nNovartis took perhaps the biggest swing of the night with its breast cancer awareness ad.\n\nUnlike Pfizer and Hims & Hers, Novartis debuted \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d at the Super Bowl after releasing two 15-second teasers featuring Wanda Sykes and Hailee Steinfeld in the week leading up to the game.\n\nThat was probably for good reason given that the commercial starts with numerous shots of women\u2019s breasts in all manner of clothing.\n\nThe provocative beginning then transitions into a focus on breast health, how common breast cancer is among American women and how they can get screened to take proactive care of their bodies.\n\nUltimately, the unorthodox pharma ad paid off \u2014 depending on who you ask.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d #16 overall, with an ad meter rating of 3.22 out of 5.\n\nMore than 40% of viewers surveyed by iSpot said the message of Novartis\u2019 ad was the single best thing about it.\n\nMeanwhile, EDO placed it 31st overall with 1.2x as much engagement as the median Super Bowl ad.\n\nKantar said Novartis ranked in the 62nd percentile for impact, the 80th percent for power and the 88th percentile for enjoyment.",

According to the ad, more than 6 million women watching the Super Bowl may be diagnosed with breast cancer, but websites like YourAttentionPlease.com are there to help with screenings and potentially life-saving information.\n\nHere\u2019s what creatives thought of the ad:\n\nThese reactions have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nElaine Cox, ECD, Saatchi & Saatchi\n\nIn a completely unexpected yet completely logical twist, considering half the people viewing the Super Bowl are female, Novartis used a barrage of boobs to reach women rather than men. In other news, tomorrow I\u2019m calling to schedule a mammogram.\n\nDoug Kamp, CCO, Mower\n\nThe \u201cgirls\u201d stole the spotlight from the boys while commanding attention for breast cancer awareness. Novartis\u2019 savvy commercial took full advantage of all demographics, connecting to celebrity and fashion culture while expanding its outreach. By featuring Wanda Sykes, a breast cancer survivor, Novartis humanizes its movement while focusing our attention on breast health. Hailee Steinfeld and her association with Josh Allen make the football connection. We just wish her beau was in the Big Game.\n\nLee Maicon, CSO, The Community\n\nWhat a great line at the heart of it. It\u2019s true that something so focused on gets so ignored. For all the breast cancer communication through the years, I found this to be so much more effective and breakthrough than anything else I\u2019ve seen for a long time. No pinkwashing. Just real women.\n\nRick Morrison, associate creative director, SS+K\n\nThe insight behind the Novartis ad is so ironic and obvious, it makes you want to slap your own forehead: \u201cSo much attention, yet so ignored.\u201d How can both things be true? And yet, they are. The ad forces you to realize, and then question, a human truth. And if a Super Bowl ad is considered a success when it\u2019s merely memorable, then making you question how we perceive our bodies, is what, a double win?\n\nWatch the Novartis Super Bowl 59 Ad, \u201cYour Attention, Please,\u201d below.",

As Steinfeld says in the ad\u2019s teaser, the commercial looks to \u201cgive breasts the attention they deserve most.\u201d\n\nMY HOT TAKE: There are several images that come to mind when thinking about a pharma ad. And those images usually consist of smiling families, dogs running in the yard, and a proud\u2014bordering on braggadocious\u2014person announcing they have herpes. The rest of the ad consists of more smiling people as a voiceover rattles off a list of side effects almost scarier than the original disease.\n\nNovartis is going for something different in its Super Bowl ad.\n\nThe ad seems to start somewhat lasciviously, putting a large focus on women\u2019s breasts like the old beer ads of yesteryear. (More taste! Less filling! Also, less of these ads, please!) However, the narrative shifts from showing closeups of cheerleaders to focusing on women simply going about their days and shining the light on breast health. The goal is simple: Grab attention and get people to a website. To us, it seems it will definitely keep viewers abreast of valuable information.\n\nWatch the Super Bowl 59 ad, \u201cYour Attention, Please,\u201d below:",

Four old ladies went on a joy ride in a commercial for WeatherTech, while sloths had a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. And British singer Seal became an actual seal, sad that he couldn\u2019t hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.\n\nActor Glenn Powell did a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze cloned himself and hired an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey took a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise took a slow cruise in a convertible so they could enjoy H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream bars.\n\nTim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.\n\nMost ads were in development during last fall\u2019s U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSafe advertising isn\u2019t the advertising you notice or remember.\u201d\n\nAnd advertisers can\u2019t afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.\n\nHere are some of the themes of this year\u2019s Super Bowl ads:\n\nHeartwarming nostalgia\n\nBudweiser brought back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenacted their famous deli scene from 1989\u2019s \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d except this time Sally was expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise.\n\nHarrison Ford was reflective in an ad for Jeep, talking about freedom and personal choices. \u201cThis Jeep makes me happy, even though my last name is Ford,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Muppets searched for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad featured a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asked what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.\n\nAdvertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.\n\nCelebrity mash-ups\n\nPutting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson teamed up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning had a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appeared in an ad for Uber Eats.\n\nLinli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there\u2019s a risk of diminishing returns.\n\nCelebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don\u2019t remember which brand they\u2019re advertising, Xu said.\n\n\u201cThere is a balancing act in terms of having celebrities in the ads,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen in focus\n\nMultiple ads put a spotlight on women and girls. Pharmaceutical company Novartis promoted early detection for breast cancer, while Lay\u2019s had a heart-warming spot featuring a little girl who grows her own potato.\n\nWomen\u2019s sports were also a big focus. Nike featured Caitlin Clark, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Sabrina Ionescu, Jordan Chiles, A\u2019ja Wilson and Sophia Wilson in a commercial talking about how often female athletes face the word, \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201d The ad\u2019s conclusion: \u201cYou can\u2019t win. So win.\u201d\n\nThe NFL ran a commercial calling for girls\u2019 flag football to become a varsity sport in all 50 states. But Dove also offered a sobering statistic: half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type.\n\n\u201cClearly the advertisers are trying to target the female audience, given the rising number of female viewers for the big game and the NFL in general in recent years,\u201d Xu said.\n\nGross-out humor\n\nCharles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University\u2019s School of Business, noticed more gross-out humor than usual.\n\nIn a commercial for Dunkin\u2019, actor Jeremy Strong emerged from a can of coffee covered in grounds and brown liquid. A man\u2019s tongue started dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestl\u00e9 Coffee Mate. And in a star-studded ad for Pringles, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, L.A. Clippers\u2019 James Harden and actor Nick Offerman all watch their iconic mustaches jump off their faces and soar through the sky to help deliver cans of the chips.\n\nTaylor said the ads do get attention, but the yuck-factor could backfire.\n\nSerious moments\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Pfizer promoted its efforts to cure cancer. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talked about America\u2019s obesity epidemic. The Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, ran an ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is.\n\nAn ad from Rocket showed people dreaming of home and aimed to get the Super Bowl crowd to sing along to \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message, but thought most advertisers went with humor instead.\n\n\u201cWe just had an election year and there\u2019s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.\u201d\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the religious-themed He Gets Us commercial returned to the Super Bowl. This year\u2019s ad featured Johnny Cash\u2019s cover of \u201cPersonal Jesus\u201d and showed everyday people being helpful and heroic. Come Near, a nonprofit that says it aims to share \u201cthe love and message of Jesus in disruptive and personally engaging ways,\u201d funded the ad this year and last year after taking over the effort from a previous group.\n\nArtificial intelligence arrives\n\nSeveral Super Bowl ads made the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner teamed up for an ad wearing Meta \u2018s smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitched GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google\u2019s \u201c50 States, 50 Stories\u201d campaign is showing viewers a small business from their state that\u2019s using Google\u2019s Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, poked fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that previous Super Bowl ads in the \u201cHe Gets Us\u201d campaign were run by a different group.",

            "content": "A barrage of new, glitzy, celebrity-filled ads debuted during Super Bowl 59 on Sunday.\n\nFox, which aired the game, said in November that it had sold out of ad spots \u2014 with more than 10 of those commercials costing advertisers $8 million apiece, according to CNBC.\n\nThis year\u2019s lineup of commercials touched on everything from smart glasses to pizza rolls. There were also a handful of artificial intelligence-related spots.\n\n\u201cAI is coming. If it\u2019s not already here in almost every business, it will be coming like a freight train,\u201d Mark Evans, executive vice president of sales for Fox Sports, told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cSo you will see some more AI focused creative, which I think intuitively would be expected.\u201d\n\nAs is typical these days, many advertisers began posting Super Bowl teasers and sometimes premiered their full new ads before game day. Two released ads \u2014 one from Hims & Hers and one from Google \u2014 faced some scrutiny before they even aired.\n\nHere is a look at some of the buzziest ads that ran.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle\u2019s original Gemini ad about cheese was no Gouda.\n\nThe ad, which touted the AI model\u2019s utility for small businesses like the Wisconsin Cheese Mart, showed Gemini wrongly generating a description for Gouda cheese that claimed it accounts for \u201c50 to 60 percent of the world\u2019s cheese consumption.\u201d\n\nThe video was re-edited to remove the inaccurate stat, a Google spokesperson confirmed.\n\n\u201cAfter the question came up about the Gouda stat, we spoke with the owner of the Wisconsin Cheese Mart to ask him how he would handle it,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in an email. \u201cFollowing his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the UI to reflect what the business would do.\u201d\n\nSalesforce\n\nIn an ad for Salesforce\u2019s AI-driven customer relationship management platform, called Agentforce, actor Matthew McConaughey is depicted dining outdoors while getting drenched by rain.\n\nHis booking app \u201cdidn\u2019t have Agentforce, so an AI agent didn\u2019t know to move my reservations inside,\u201d the Oscar winner says in the spot.\n\nRay-Ban Meta\n\nChris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner starred in this commercial for Meta\u2019s AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses, which featured a nod to the banana duct-taped to a wall that famously sold for $6 million at an art auction last year.\n\nBooking.com\n\nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and their fellow Muppets search for their ideal vacation stay in the ad for Booking.com, which also recently introduced several AI-powered features for users.\n\nFoundation to Combat Antisemitism\n\nSnoop Dogg and Tom Brady faced off in an ad from the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism. The nonprofit organization\u2019s ad against hate featured the two trading barbs about why they hate each other \u2014 citing reasons such as \u201cyou look different\u201d or \u201ctalk different\u201d or \u201c\u2019cause I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\n\nMichelob Ultra\n\nWillem Dafoe and Catherine O\u2019Hara crush everybody at pickleball in this ad, which also featured basketball player Sabrina Ionescu, former NFL player Randy Moss and track-and-field athlete Ryan Crouser.\n\nBudweiser\n\nAnheuser-Busch\u2019s ads are considered a Super Bowl staple. This year\u2019s Budweiser spot showed a Clydesdale foal who is told it\u2019s \u201cstill too little\u201d to join the company\u2019s beer run. But the foal embarks on its own impromptu journey and ultimately is seen helping the keg make it to its destination.\n\nBud Light\n\nShane Gillis and Post Malone launch Bud Light cans out of a leaf blower in this ad featuring Peyton Manning, inviting the whole neighborhood to a cul-de-sac party.\n\nCoors Light\n\nLethargic sloths face a series of mishaps, struggling to make it through a \u201ccase of the Mondays\u201d until they get a case of Coors Light beers.\n\nStella Artois\n\nDavid Beckham learns he has a twin by the same name, dubbed \u201cOther David\u201d by his parents. He pays his brother (played by Matt Damon) a visit across the pond, where the two awkwardly bond over a bottle of Stella Artois.\n\nLittle Caesars\n\nIn this ad for Little Caesars\u2019 Crazy Puffs, actor Eugene Levy is seemingly so astonished after taking a bite that his eyebrows fly off his face and flutter away, terrorizing everyone in their path.\n\nTotino\u2019s Pizza Rolls\n\nActors Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson star in this ad alongside a Totino\u2019s-loving alien named Chazmo, who dies in an unfortunate accident just before returning to his home planet with a bag of pizza rolls.\n\nHellmann\u2019s\n\n\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d co-stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal return to Katz\u2019s Delicatessen to enjoy a sandwich \u2014 with a cameo from Sydney Sweeney.\n\nDoritos\n\nMembers of the Kansas City Chiefs help the Doritos team mull over potential ideas for a Super Bowl commercial.\n\nPringles\n\nActor Nick Offerman, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and the L.A. Clippers\u2019 James Harden all see their mustaches escape their faces, fluttering away to join \u201cThe Call for More Pringles.\u201d\n\nH\u00e4agen-Dazs\n\nEven \u201cFast & Furious\u201d stars Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel \u201ccan\u2019t help but slow down and savor the moment\u201d with a bar of H\u00e4agen-Dazs, while Ludacris speeds on by.\n\nCoffee mate\n\nIn this ad for Coffee mate\u2019s cold-foam creamer, Shania Twain\u2019s off-screen voice sings an original tune for a dancing tongue.\n\nUber Eats\n\nHolding a buffalo wing from his Uber Eats delivery, Matthew McConaughey argues that football has always been \u201ca conspiracy to make us hungry.\u201d\n\nInstacart\n\nThis Instacart commercial features a roundup of brand mascots, including Kellogg\u2019s Tony the Tiger, the Pillsbury Doughboy, the Kool-Aid Man and even Mr. Clean.\n\nHexClad Cookware\n\nGordon Ramsay is enlisted to cook for an alien visiting the Area 51 test kitchen for a taste of Earth\u2019s offerings. The alien is Pete Davidson, who quips, \u201cAll famous people are aliens.\u201d\n\nHims & Hers\n\nWith a commercial title highlighting the American obesity epidemic, telehealth company Hims & Hers criticizes a health care system \u201cbuilt to keep us sick and stuck\u201d before going on to tout its own weight-loss offerings.\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl, Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., addressed a letter to the Food and Drug Administration expressing concerns over an \u201cupcoming advertisement.\u201d They wrote that they believed the ad \u201crisks misleading patients by omitting any safety or side effect information when promoting a specific type of weight loss medication.\u201d\n\nA Hims & Hers spokesperson told CNBC that the company is \u201ccomplying with existing law\u201d and is \u201chappy to continue working with Congress and the new Administration to fix the broken health system and ensure that patients have choices for quality, safe, and affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\nDove\n\nHighlighting the hashtag #KeepHerConfident, Dove centered its commercial on the prevalence of body image issues among young girls, stating, \u201cLet\u2019s change the way we talk to our girls.\u201d\n\nNovartis\n\nSwiss pharmaceutical company Novartis teased a 60-second ad scheduled to air Sunday with the aim of bringing awareness to breast cancer. The spot stars actors Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes, who herself is a breast cancer survivor.\n\nFanduel\n\nFormer NFL quarterbacks Eli and Peyton Manning faced off Sunday in a field goal showdown organized by Fanduel, and the sports betting company urged fans to place their pick in this Super Bowl ad featuring the brothers.\n\nDunkin'\n\nThe \"Dunkings\" have a new star-studded Super Bowl spot, starring Ben Affleck, his brother Casey, actor Jeremy Strong and Bill Belichick.\n\nLots of movie trailer spots\n\nThese films all aired teaser spots during the Super Bowl: \u201cJurassic World: Rebirth,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible: The Final Reckoning\u201d (star Tom Cruise also appeared in a Super Bowl intro ahead of the game start time), \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d live-action film (which featured Stitch running on the field), \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d live-action remake and \"Thunderbolts.\"\n\nNike\n\nWomen\u2019s sports has been having a moment, and one Super Bowl ad aimed to highlight that.\n\nA new ad from Nike featured some of the biggest female athletes, including Caitlin Clark, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Jordan Chiles, all looking bored as choruses of \u201cyou can\u2019t win\u201d were heard behind clips of them showing off their skills.\n\nThe ad closed with a message in classic Nike font: \u201cYou can\u2019t win. So win.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\n\nOpenAI joined the roster of Super Bowl advertisers in the last commercial break, the technology\u2019s first ad during the game.\n\nAccording to The Verge, the company spent $14 million on the 60-second spot about ChatGPT, which showed the product alongside some of the world\u2019s best inventions.\n\n\u201cWe want the message to feel relevant to the audience that is watching the Super Bowl, which includes tens of millions of people who have no familiarity with AI,\u201d Open AI Chief Marketing Officer Kate Rouch told the outlet.",

Bae Byung-min, MBN reporter.\n\n\"Our industry has a success rate of around 10%. Many clinical processes fail, but we learn from them.\"Patrick Hover, president of Novartis International, a global pharmaceutical company, told the Maeil Business Newspaper at the 55th World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, \"If you're afraid of failure, no one can develop a new drug. It's fate as a pharmaceutical company.\" \"Our goal is to pursue innovation and develop new materials as soon as possible,\" he said. \"We are investing 20% of our sales and about $9 billion in R&D and plan to continue.\" Novartis has the world's No. 1 clinical candidate (200+ pipelines, as of 2022) and carries out more than 100 projects annually.He also revealed the secret to the growth of the Swiss bio industry. He said, \"There is no secret,\" but explained that corporate investment and cooperation, government support, and intellectual property protection are the most important foundations. \"Global pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis actively seek partners to discover new drugs, even though 9 out of 10 will fail,\" Hover said. \"Just as Novartis cooperated with Chong Kun Dang in Korea, Korean biotech companies will be able to grow through cooperation and investment with large pharmaceutical companies that can withstand failure as well as private equity funds.\"The government called for a system that respects innovative new drugs. \"Today, only about 13% of the drugs offered to patients are innovative drugs, and the remaining 87% are generic or biosimilar,\" Hover said. \"In order for Korea to pursue innovation, the government should invest more and encourage it to use innovative drugs to treat patients,\" he argued. It is explained that the virtuous cycle of the innovation pharmaceutical industry occurs by acknowledging the price of successful innovative products and by companies raising sales and reinvesting.It has been emphasized several times that the most important thing is intellectual property rights. \"Switzerland has secured an innovative new drug because it has very strong intellectual property protection,\" he said, adding, \"A great academic and bio-cluster is also the foundation of the country, but the foundation for all innovation is intellectual property.\"The potential of the Korean bio industry was also highly evaluated. \"Korea has a foundation for skilled medical experts, scientists, and researchers to develop innovative materials,\" he said. \"It is important for companies such as Novartis to develop materials in cooperation with biotech companies such as Chong Kun Dang in Korea, and I believe Korea will become a more innovative bio-industry country in the next 5 to 10 years.\"Novartis is also strengthening cooperation with South Korea. In addition to the manufacturing contract with Samsung Biologics, it signed a technology transfer contract worth $1.35 billion for cardiovascular treatment candidates developed by Chong Kun Dang, more than 1 trillion won. Recently, Seoul and Gyeongsangbuk-do are also discussing cooperation for the prevention and management of dyslipidemia.\"We don't only look for cooperation in Switzerland, the United States, and Europe, and we see tremendous growth opportunities in Korea, China, and Japan in Asia,\" Hover said. \"If there is an opportunity like Chong Kun Dang, we will definitely form a partnership.\"In an interview with Maeil Business, Novartis also hinted at the possibility of a new obesity treatment. \"The problem with obesity treatments at present is that they can reduce muscle mass, which is an unwanted result,\" Hover said. \"We are looking for a new mechanism of action.\" This means that it challenges the way you can lose weight healthily while preserving muscle mass. \"Making Me Too products is not what Novartis wants,\" he said. \"It's a job that doesn't add value.\"Novartis' new blockbuster is a radioactive ligand (target binding site) treatment that only hits cancer cells precisely. \"What we're really excited about is tumor removal and radiation that can treat cancer,\" he said. \"We're not limited to treating prostate cancer, but we're studying colon cancer, lung cancer, and the brain.\" Novartis' prostate cancer target therapy, which only removes cancer cells, is in the spotlight as a 'radiation missile treatment'.President Hover predicted that the application of artificial intelligence (AI) will grow the pharmaceutical bio industry faster. \"In collaboration with Microsoft (MS), we are introducing AI not only for research and development but also for general tasks,\" he said. \"In particular, I believe AI will create opportunities to increase the speed and success rate of product development through the use of databases.\" Novartis has partnered with MS since 2019 to develop drug candidates using AI, including treatment design.Novartis is a global pharmaceutical company that has entered more than 130 countries around the world, with annual sales of more than 60 trillion won. There are five key treatment areas: \u25b3 cardiovascular system, kidney and metabolism \u25b3 solid cancer \u25b3 immune disease \u25b3 neuroscience \u25b3 blood cancer, etc., focusing on R&D in this field. According to Novartis, 41 out of more than 100 clinical projects are in phase 3 clinical trials, raising expectations for the development of new innovative treatments.Approximately 284 million patients receive Novartis's medication annually, with 33.2 million receiving Novartis' patient support program benefits.[JINYOUNG TAE is the Davos reporter]",

            "content": "Wanda Sykes has long been beloved for her sharp humor and spot-on delivery, and from her scene-stealing roles in shows like The New Adventures of Old Christine, Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Upshaws to her many stand-up comedy specials over the years, she\u2019s always made us laugh out loud.\n\nSykes\u2019 latest project, a Super Bowl commercial with Novartis promoting their \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d campaign to raise awareness of breast cancer and encourage early detection, tackles a serious subject that impacts far too many women. The cause is a deeply personal one for the comedian, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 47 in 2011 and chose to undergo a double mastectomy.\n\nAhead of the commercial\u2019s debut, Sykes spoke to First for Women about the significance of her campaign, her self-care strategies and the healing power of humor.\n\nEntertainment Danielle Fishel Talks Cancer, Family and Life Behind the Camera (EXCLUSIVE) Danielle Fishel became one of the most popular teen stars of the \u201990s thanks to her role as Topanga Lawrence on the long-running sitcom Boy Meets World. Now 43, the actress, who began acting on the show when she was just 12 and later reprised her role on the spinoff series Girl Meets World, has [\u2026]\n\nWanda Sykes\u2019 breast cancer journey\n\n\u201cWhen I was approached with this opportunity, it fit into my wheelhouse and what\u2019s important to me as far as messaging about breast health and saving lives,\u201d Wanda Sykes says of her partnership. \u201cI know how important early detection is.\u201d\n\nWhile going through her diagnosis and treatments, Sykes found that maintaining her comic touch and her friendships, rather than despairing and retreating, helped her immeasurably. \u201cI used humor to help get through it,\u201d she shares. \u201cI had several friends at the time who were also going through it, so we would exchange stories and lighten it up. It\u2019s scary, and it helps to have that support system and have people around you who can take away some of the seriousness, even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to know you\u2019re not alone,\u201d she adds. \u201cOne out of eight women will experience breast cancer, and that\u2019s why early detection and getting the message out to get screened is so important.\u201d\n\nAdvocating for her community\n\nSykes also wants to bring awareness to the troubling racial disparities when it comes to breast cancer. \u201cUnfortunately with women of color, we\u2019re usually diagnosed at a later stage, so that decreases your chances of success and survival,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn my family, I\u2019ve lost many aunts and cousins because of that late detection, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to me to get the message out, especially to my community,\u201d she continues. \u201cOften you don\u2019t really think about it until you go, \u2018Ooh, that didn\u2019t feel right\u2019\u201d\u2014at which point it might be too late.\n\nWanda Sykes during the filming of her Super Bowl commercial Novartis\n\nWanda Sykes\u2019 self-care strategies\n\nSykes may have endless energy onstage, but she also knows how important it is to slow down. \u201cI have to get my rest. It\u2019s incredibly important. I love a good nap, and if I get a nap I\u2019m a happy girl,\u201d she says, and she found this especially true while going through her health struggles.\n\nNowadays, Sykes jokes, \u201cI\u2019ll go to a movie just so I can get a nap sometimes,\u201d and she\u2019s committed to \u201cbeing aware of what I eat and exercising and listening to my body.\u201d All of these things, combined with getting laughs every day, have helped to keep the star feeling good at 60.\n\nWanda Sykes in 2024 Dan Doperalski/Golden Globes 2024/Golden Globes 2024 via Getty\n\nA comedic evolution\n\nSykes has been keeping busy as a comedian, as she released her latest stand-up special in 2023 and currently stars in the Netflix sitcom The Upshaws, which will air its seventh and final season later this year.\n\nDuring her long comedy career, Sykes has seen a lot of change. \u201cThe landscape has gotten bigger with streaming and social media, and there are more avenues out there to get directly to the audience,\u201d she reflects. \u201cThere was a time where reality shows just took over everything, and we still have some of that, but I think comedy has had this reemergence because people really want to laugh.\u201d\n\nWanda Sykes onstage in 2014 Jamie McCarthy/Getty for The Trevor Project\n\nAsked what advice she wishes she could\u2019ve given herself at the beginning of her career, Sykes answers, \u201cI would say to trust your gut more,\u201d explaining, \u201cI think when most comics first start out, they\u2019re kind of impersonating a comic and not really putting their own persona out there, so it\u2019s not as authentic. They\u2019re trying to imitate someone. I could have maybe saved myself a couple of years if I had trusted my own point of view.\u201d Clearly, staying true to herself has served the comedian well, whether she\u2019s taking the stage or opening up about overcoming life\u2019s challenges.",

            "content": "In 2011, while undergoing breast reduction surgery, actress and comedian Wanda Sykes received some unsettling news: She had breast cancer. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s scary, you know, any type of diagnosis of cancer. It\u2019s scary and it\u2019s daunting,\u201d she recounted to Know Your Value.\n\nThankfully, doctors detected the disease early. The then-47-year-old was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer, otherwise known as Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). But the fear the disease could eventually advance, coupled with a family history of breast cancer, led Sykes to choose to undergo a double mastectomy.\n\n\u201cThere were days when, you know, I\u2019d look at myself in the mirror,\u201d said Sykes. \u201cAnd when you see the scars, it\u2019s like, \u2018My god, What\u2019s going on? What have I gone through?\u2019\u201d She said it was the women in her life, who had also been diagnosed with breast cancer, who helped her through her own diagnosis and recovery.\n\nSykes noted that some of those women were in the later stages of cancer, and that she even lost friends to the disease. \u201cIt was heartbreaking, and it\u2019s scary that my community and group was that big,\u201d she said.\n\nThe chances of knowing someone who has battled breast cancer is high. One in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and it\u2019s now the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. And women of color are disproportionately affected. According to data by the American Cancer Society, Black women have a 40 percent higher mortality rate, and Black women under 50 years old have double the mortality rate of white women of the same age.\n\n\u201cI was just very grateful that I was able to catch it so early \u2026Now my chances are, you know, incredibly positive as far as survival,\u201d said Sykes.\n\nThis weekend, Sykes will share her story on one of television\u2019s biggest stages to help raise awareness about breast cancer health.\n\nOn Sunday, she\u2019ll be part of a Super Bowl ad encouraging early breast cancer screening to an expected audience of over 47 million women. It\u2019s part of a collaboration with pharmaceutical company, Novartis. The ad will also feature singer and actress Hailee Steinfeld. The two urge viewers for \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d \u2014 a campaign by the same name intended to highlight breast cancer risk and how to take action.\n\nThe Emmy award-winning comedian, who\u2019s now 60, said she doesn\u2019t take her health for granted and approaches it differently after the diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI do reflect back and say, you know you went through that. And now (being) 60, it\u2019s different now. Little more mileage, you know, on the tires here,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m doing better as far as what I eat and exercise and so, that does stay in the back of your mind. And you do think about your health and better ways to take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Sykes credited prioritizing her own breast health for saving her life and hopes that message lands with women of all ages, especially now that around 10 percent of new cases include women under 45 years old. \u201cIf I can get the message out that, hey, early detection is important, and to get screened, I\u2019m happy to do that. Because you know, we will save lives.\u201d",

In a letter sent Friday morning to FDA acting Commissioner Sara Brenner, Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wrote that they worry that the Hims ad, which will be seen by millions of people during the big game on Sunday, \u201crisks misleading patients by omitting any safety or side effect information\u201d about the compounded weight loss drugs that it promotes. And they argued that the \u201cFDA may already have the authority to take enforcement action against marketing that may mislead patients about this company\u2019s products.\u201d Enforcement actions could include warning letters or civil penalties.\n\nadvertisement\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes sued GlaxoSmithKline over claims the company engaged in \u201cdeceptive and unfair\u201d practices that endangered consumer lives and enabled the company\u2019s attempts to game the medical system, The Tucson Sentinel writes. The lawsuit accuses the company of discontinuing its widely used asthma medication Flovent and replacing it with an identical product in a scheme to avoid paying rebates to Medicaid tied to the drug\u2019s high price, which is required under federal law. The lawsuit is seeking a declaration that the company violated the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act, an injunction preventing it from selling the new drug at artificially inflated prices, and maximum statutory penalties of up to $10,000 per violation. The attorney general says that over time, the company aggressively hiked the price of Flovent far beyond inflation, making billions of dollars from Medicaid and private consumers.

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPfizer on Wednesday named a longtime Novartis executive the leader of an oncology division it is leaning on to win back the support of investors in the years ahead.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant said Jeffrey Legos, who has been leading Novartis\u2019 hematology and oncology drug development since 2015, will become its new chief oncology officer. In that role, Legos will report to Chris Boshoff, who was formerly Pfizer\u2019s cancer drug chief but stepped in as head of R&D last year when Mikael Dolston retired.\n\nLegos will replace interim chief oncology officer and one-time Seagen R&D leader Roger Dansey, who joined Pfizer after it acquired Seagen in 2023 and will retire after Legos takes over.\n\nLegos has more than two decades of experience developing cancer drugs in various roles at GSK and, since 2015, Novartis. Through those positions, he\u2019s played a part in over 40 regulatory approvals of drugs and companion diagnostics, Pfizer said. At Novartis, those approvals included the radiopharmaceutical Pluvicto and the breast cancer drug Kisqali, both of which are among the company\u2019s fastest-growing medicines.\n\nAt Pfizer, Legos looks to ignite investor interest in a cancer drug portfolio the company is counting on to boost sales in the coming years. Fast-fading sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and treatment Paxlovid, as well as missteps in some recent acquisitions, have led to cost cuts, a flagging stock price and a challenge from an activist investor. Multiple top-selling drugs, including Xtandi and Eliquis, will lose patent protection this decade, too. While investors have focused their attention on Pfizer\u2019s obesity drug research, the company has insisted that its cancer drugs \u2014 many of which were acquired in a $43 billion buyout of Seagen in 2023 \u2014 can help pick up the slack.\n\nThat portfolio accounted for about a quarter of Pfizer\u2019s roughly $64 billion in revenue last year and had four medicines \u2014 led by the breast cancer drug Ibrance \u2014 that eclipsed $1 billion in sales. Pfizer has claimed its pipeline could produce eight more so-called blockbusters by 2030, both by growing sales of marketed medicines and succeeding with others in testing.\n\nOn a quarterly earnings call earlier this week, CEO Albert Bourla pointed to a pair of breast cancer drugs in late-stage testing, among them a type of protein-degrading therapy it\u2019s co-developing with biotechnology company Arvinas. One antibody-drug conjugate it inherited from Seagen is in a Phase 3 trial in lung cancer, while a second ADC aimed at a popular immunotherapy target, PD-L1, will join it this year, he said.\n\nBourla also claimed Pfizer\u2019s multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio is poised to become a \u201cmega blockbuster.\u201d The drug generated more than $130 million in sales in its first year despite only being available for a \u201cvery niche indication,\u201d Bourla said. The company has four ongoing Phase 3 studies that could help broaden use. But it\u2019s already battling for market share with a similar therapy from Johnson & Johnson, and could potentially face additional competition from Regeneron.\n\n\u201cThis product will become a very big oncology product for Pfizer,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nSales growth of Padcev, another Seagen drug, is also a key part of Pfizer\u2019s plan. Study results expected this year in a type of bladder cancer could \u201cnearly triple\u201d the number of patients eligible for treatment, he added.\n\nPadcev earned about $1.6 billion in sales for Pfizer last year.\n\nPfizer shares have lost about half their value since peaking near $60 apiece in 2021.",

            "content": "The Super Bowl is three days away and Novartis is gearing up for its advertising debut at the big game.\n\nThe Swiss drugmaker announced last week that it will air a 60-second ad during Super Bowl LIX to raise breast cancer awareness and encourage more screenings, specifically targeting women aged 40 and younger.\n\nThe spot features actress Wanda Sykes, who is a breast cancer survivor, as well as actress and musician Hailee Steinfeld, who is a breast cancer awareness advocate.\n\nThe ad was created by Omnicom subsidiary Merkley and Partners, while Publicis\u2019 N2 serves as the pharma giant\u2019s media agency of record.\n\nUnlike other brands that release their ads days or weeks ahead of the big game, Novartis is waiting to unveil its commercial during the contest, according to Gail Horwood, the company\u2019s chief marketing and customer experience officer.\n\nIn the meantime, the drugmaker released two 15-second teasers featuring Sykes and Steinfeld to drum up interest.\n\nThough the ad isn\u2019t out in the world just yet, Horwood said there will be a surprise guest appearance in addition to Sykes and Steinfeld: Kristin Juszczyk.\n\nShe is the wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk and a fashion designer who made headlines after designing a jacket Taylor Swift wore during the 2023 season.\n\nLike Steinfeld, who is engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Juszczyk has a connection to the NFL that makes her familiar to fans.\n\nHowever, Horwood said the brand included her in the ad since one of her close family members passed away from breast cancer.\n\nShe stressed that Novartis wanted the ad to feature ambassadors impacted by breast cancer and noted that Emmy Award-winning director M.J. Delaney helped the vision come to life.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our message to be conveyed by authentic storytellers \u2014 people who had a stake in ensuring that screening or knowing your risk was important,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one-off effort\n\nHorwood said the company is taking a strategic and holistic approach to its Super Bowl ad and considers it part of the broader, social-focused Your Attention, Please campaign. This larger initiative kicked off the same day the ad was announced and builds on the mission of reaching at-risk women and encouraging breast cancer screenings.\n\nHorwood noted that while the commercial will get the eyeballs, Novartis has built an ecosystem around the ad to give it a longer tail.\n\nThis includes a concerted push on social media platforms, a campaign website with educational resources around breast cancer and partnerships with patient advocacy groups like the Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, TOUCH (The Black Breast Cancer Alliance) and Breastcancer.org.\n\nThough the Super Bowl is routinely the most-watched live event of the year, it hasn\u2019t been the favored spot for pharma advertising, a point that Horwood is all too familiar with.\n\nFrom her perspective, the business case for Novartis running an ad during the Super Bowl is based on the ability to reach a large, engaged audience of women in order to drive action on an important health issue that affects millions nationwide.\n\nWhile some brands may feel that advertising at the game isn\u2019t the most prudent way to educate consumers on a particular medical condition or promote a medication, Novartis has a different view of the situation.\n\nAwareness vs. advertising a drug\n\nBreast cancer isn\u2019t a rare disease, it\u2019s the second-most common form of cancer in the U.S. and the second-leading cause of cancer death among American women.\n\nNovartis is using this ad as a way to raise awareness of the disease and proactive care measures rather than promote a product like its breast cancer drug Kisqali.\n\nHorwood said prioritizing early detection of the disease and clinical intervention is just as critical as having medicines like Kisqali available to patients later on in the process.\n\nShe added that Novartis\u2019 leadership has sought to emphasize the importance of early detection and knowledge in breast health management.\n\nBy highlighting this issue in front of a record number of women viewers, she said Novartis hopes to improve breast health outcomes and maximize its impact.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just show up at the game, we\u2019d love to say we showed up at the game, people received the message and they took action,\u201d she said.\n\nGoing forward, Novartis has plans to explore more advertising opportunities in live sports. Horwood said live sports are among the only growing areas in entertainment and provide an accessible on-ramp for engaging with consumers about health problems and critical disease states.",

On a constant currency basis, sales increased 16%, driven by the momentum in its key drugs like Entresto, Kesimpta, Kisqali, Cosentyx and Leqvio.\n\nInvestors were impressed by the company\u2019s strong quarterly performance and impressive outlook for 2025.\n\nNet sales are expected to grow in mid to high single digits in 2025. Core operating income is expected to grow in high single to low double digits.\n\nShares of the company have gained 5% since the earnings release. Novartis has performed well in the previous few months.\n\nFor a company like NVS, the results of a single quarter are not that paramount, and the focus is mostly on its fundamentals.\n\nNovartis Key Drugs Propel Growth\n\nWith the successful spin-off of the Sandoz business, Novartis operates as a single global operating segment. It now concentrates on four core therapeutic areas \u2014 cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nTop drugs like Entresto (cardiovascular) and Cosentyx (psoriasis, spondylitis and arthritis) performed well in 2024. Cosentyx sales are being boosted by recent launches, including the hidradenitis suppurativa indication (HS) and the intravenous formulation (IV) in the United States, and volume growth in core indications.\n\nKey drugs like Kisqali (breast cancer), Kesimpta (multiple sclerosis), Scemblix (chronic myeloid leukemia or CML), Pluvicto (prostate cancer), Leqvio (cholesterol) and Fabhalta (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) are likely to drive Novartis\u2019 growth in the coming years.\n\nKisqali put up a stellar performance in 2024 as sales grew across all regions, driven by growth in the United States. Strong momentum from the recently launched early breast cancer (eBC) indication also fueled sales.\n\nOn its fourth-quarter conference call, Novartis announced that it has settled the compound patent litigation with a generic manufacturer for Kisqali. This supports patent protection for Kisqali in the United States is until at least the first quarter of 2031.\n\nStrong growth in Pluvicto (post-taxane setting) is also propelling sales. An anticipated launched in the first half of 2025 in the pre-taxane setting should further fuel sales.",

            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novartis (NVS)\n\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of varied drugs that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. It continues to build depth in core therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, renal and metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology in geographies like the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Novartis\u2019 efforts to strengthen its wide portfolio by developing breakthrough treatments have made it even more formidable in this space. Kesimpta, Pluvicto, Scemblix, Kisqali, Leqvio and Fabhalta should fuel growth through 2030 and beyond.\n\nNVS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nMomentum investors should take note of this Medical stock. NVS has a Momentum Style Score of B, and shares are up 9.6% over the past four weeks.\n\nTwo analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $8.42 per share. NVS boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.3%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, NVS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Novartis AG (NVS)?\n\nBefore you invest in Novartis AG (NVS), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "The Super Bowl is three days away and Novartis is gearing up for its advertising debut at the big game.\n\nThe Swiss drugmaker announced last week that it will air a 60-second ad during Super Bowl LIX to raise breast cancer awareness and encourage more screenings, specifically targeting women aged 40 and younger.\n\nThe spot features actress Wanda Sykes, who is a breast cancer survivor, as well as actress and musician Hailee Steinfeld, who is a breast cancer awareness advocate.\n\nThe ad was created by Omnicom subsidiary Merkley and Partners, while Publicis\u2019 N2 serves as the pharma giant\u2019s media agency of record.\n\nUnlike other brands that release their ads days or weeks ahead of the big game, Novartis is waiting to unveil its commercial during the contest, according to Gail Horwood, the company\u2019s chief marketing and customer experience officer.\n\nIn the meantime, the drugmaker released two 15-second teasers featuring Sykes and Steinfeld to drum up interest.\n\nThough the ad isn\u2019t out in the world just yet, Horwood said there will be a surprise guest appearance in addition to Sykes and Steinfeld: Kristin Juszczyk.\n\nShe is the wife of San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk and a fashion designer who made headlines after designing a jacket Taylor Swift wore during the 2023 season.\n\nLike Steinfeld, who is engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Juszczyk has a connection to the NFL that makes her familiar to fans.\n\nHowever, Horwood said the brand included her in the ad since one of her close family members passed away from breast cancer.\n\nShe stressed that Novartis wanted the ad to feature ambassadors impacted by breast cancer and noted that Emmy Award-winning director M.J. Delaney helped the vision come to life.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our message to be conveyed by authentic storytellers \u2014 people who had a stake in ensuring that screening or knowing your risk was important,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one-off effort\n\nHorwood said the company is taking a strategic and holistic approach to its Super Bowl ad and considers it part of the broader, social-focused Your Attention, Please campaign. This larger initiative kicked off the same day the ad was announced and builds on the mission of reaching at-risk women and encouraging breast cancer screenings.\n\nHorwood noted that while the commercial will get the eyeballs, Novartis has built an ecosystem around the ad to give it a longer tail.\n\nThis includes a concerted push on social media platforms, a campaign website with educational resources around breast cancer and partnerships with patient advocacy groups like the Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, TOUCH (The Black Breast Cancer Alliance) and Breastcancer.org.\n\nThough the Super Bowl is routinely the most-watched live event of the year, it hasn\u2019t been the favored spot for pharma advertising, a point that Horwood is all too familiar with.\n\nFrom her perspective, the business case for Novartis running an ad during the Super Bowl is based on the ability to reach a large, engaged audience of women in order to drive action on an important health issue that affects millions nationwide.\n\nWhile some brands may feel that advertising at the game isn\u2019t the most prudent way to educate consumers on a particular medical condition or promote a medication, Novartis has a different view of the situation.\n\nAwareness vs. advertising a drug\n\nBreast cancer isn\u2019t a rare disease, it\u2019s the second-most common form of cancer in the U.S. and the second-leading cause of cancer death among American women.\n\nNovartis is using this ad as a way to raise awareness of the disease and proactive care measures rather than promote a product like its breast cancer drug Kisqali.\n\nHorwood said prioritizing early detection of the disease and clinical intervention is just as critical as having medicines like Kisqali available to patients later on in the process.\n\nShe added that Novartis\u2019 leadership has sought to emphasize the importance of early detection and knowledge in breast health management.\n\nBy highlighting this issue in front of a record number of women viewers, she said Novartis hopes to improve breast health outcomes and maximize its impact.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just show up at the game, we\u2019d love to say we showed up at the game, people received the message and they took action,\u201d she said.\n\nGoing forward, Novartis has plans to explore more advertising opportunities in live sports. Horwood said live sports are among the only growing areas in entertainment and provide an accessible on-ramp for engaging with consumers about health problems and critical disease states.\n\nThis story first appeared on MM+M.",

            "content": "The British part of EP 3 805 248 is valid. The UK High Court handed down the ruling last week (case ID: HP-2023-000024). As part of a stratgey to clear the way for a biosimilar product of the asthma drug omalizumab, Celltrion had filed a revocation action against the patent with the UK court.\n\nEP 248 belongs to Novartis and Genentech and covers a specific formulation of the active ingredient omalizumab. It allows the stable storage of the monoclonal antibody in liquid form for administration in pre-filled syringes, for example. Previously, omalizumab was only marketed in solid form as a powder that had to be dissolved in liquid before each application. The active ingredient forms the basis for Novartis\u2019 biologic Xolair, which is used to treat allergic asthma and chronic hives.\n\nThe two patent holders had responded with a counterclaim for infringement. UK High Court judge Richard Hacon has now ruled that the patent is valid and infringed.\n\nVery close case\n\nJudge Hacon is convinced that the breadth of the patent claim is very narrow. But in his opinion, the patent is based on an invention. Essentially, the parties had argued over the formulation of the preparation and whether the composition protected by the patent constituted an invention.\n\nThe judgment barely addresses whether Celltrion infringes EP 248 with its biosimilar product. Celltrion had admitted infringement if the patent is valid. There will be no seperate trial on infringement.\n\nCelltrion can now seek permission to appeal from Richard Hacon.\n\nCelltrion seeks revocation\n\nThe EPO granted EP 248 in 2023 but Celltrion believes it is invalid. The company filed an opposition at the EPO and revocation actions not only at the UK High Court but also at the District Court The Hague.\n\nAt the EPO, Celltrion has opposed the grant of EP 248 with the support of Hoffmann Eitle, as has the London patent attorney firm Kilburn & Strode as a straw man.\n\nMeanwhile, the EPO Opposition Division stated in its preliminary opinion that the granted claims of EP 248 comply with the EPC and that the oppositions should be rejected. The EPO has scheduled an oral hearing for early April.\n\nNo imminent infringement\n\nCelltrion was more successful at the UPC, where the dispute came to a head last summer. At the D\u00fcsseldorf local divison the two patent holders accused Celltrion of wanting to bring a biosimilar of Novartis\u2019 Xolair onto the market despite the fact that patent protection still exists.\n\nNovartis and Genentech presented evidence which they believe pointed towards imminent infringement by Celltrion. Among other things, Celltrion had applied for market authorisation for the EU for a biosimilar containing the patented formulation, marketed under the brand name Omlyclo. Celltrion received authorisation for its Hungarian subsidiary in May 2024.\n\nThe patent holders applied to the UPC for an injunction to prevent an actual infringement. However, Celltrion rejected the accusation. The company argued it was merely preparing for a timely market entry for its biosimilar once EP 248 expires.\n\nUPC case over\n\nIn September, the local division dismissed Novartis\u2019 application for provisional measures. The judges ruled that \u201cat the time of the Court\u2019s order, there is not yet sufficient evidence that the infringement is imminent\u201d.\n\nBut they also pointed out that Celltrion\u2019s formulation makes use of the technical teaching of EP 248 and that eight Celltrion subsidaries are cumulatively liable for their actions. Therefore, in the opinion of the court, Celltrion is currently protected by the fact that it has not yet marketed its own product. Furthermore, Celltrion had also questioned the validity of EP 248 but the UPC judges did not comment on this.\n\nBecause Novartis and Genentech did not appeal the decision, the UPC case is closed for the time being. Now Celltrion must hope for a favourable outcome at the District Court The Hague. Here Celltrion has not only initiated a revocation action against the Dutch part of EP 248, but also applied for a declaration of non-infringement (case ID: C/09/660292/24/082). The court heard the case last Friday. A judgment is expected in late March at the earliest.\n\nBristows and Three New Square for Novartis\n\nCelltrion relied on teams from Bird & Bird in the Netherlands, in the UPC proceedings and in the UK trial. Lead partners in the UK proceedings are Patrick Kelleher and Chris De Mauny. Legal director Henry Elliott and associate Phillipus Putter provided support. In the UPC proceedings, D\u00fcsseldorf-based partner Oliver J\u00fcngst took the lead while Marc van Wijngaarden leads the Dutch case.\n\nIain Purvis and Adam Gamsa were Celltrion\u2019s barristers in the UK revocation trial. Both work at IP barristers\u2019 set 11 South Square.\n\nNovartis\u2019 go-to IP litigation firm in the UK is Bristows. Partner Rachel Mumby took the lead alongside of counsel Adrian Chew and associates Olivia Henry and Ben Reeves. Barrister Thomas Mitcheson and Stuart Baran from Three New Square represented Novartis and Genentech in the courtroom.\n\nIn the UPC proceedings against Celltrion, however, Bristows played more of a supporting role and advised in the background. The lead here was Frank-Erich Hufnagel, a partner of Freshfields in D\u00fcsseldorf. Amsterdam based partner Rutger Kleemans and patent attorneys from Carpmaels & Ransford were also involved. A Carpmaels team around Cameron Marshall leads the EPO opposition proceedings on behalf of the patent owners.",

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novartis (NVS)\n\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of varied drugs that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. It continues to build depth in core therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, renal and metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology in geographies like the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Novartis\u2019 efforts to strengthen its wide portfolio by developing breakthrough treatments have made it even more formidable in this space. Kesimpta, Pluvicto, Scemblix, Kisqali, Leqvio and Fabhalta should fuel growth through 2030 and beyond.\n\nNVS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 12.52; value investors should take notice.\n\nTwo analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $8.42 per share. NVS also boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.3%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, NVS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Novartis AG (NVS)?\n\nBefore you invest in Novartis AG (NVS), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "Big Pharmas have a looming gap to fill in their pipelines as several of the industry\u2019s most lucrative assets are expected to come off patent. To patch the holes, these companies are turning to biotechs for licensing deals with massive potential earnings.\n\nMerck\u2019s blockbuster cancer therapy Keytruda, for instance, will lose key protections by 2028, while Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb are expecting generic erosion for their anticoagulant Eliquis by mid-2028.\n\nAverage upfront payments for Phase II lead drugs jumped more than 460% from 2022 to 2024, Alison Labya, a business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData, told BioSpace in an email. Compared with last year\u2019s figures, upfront payments spiked around 30%. Upfront payments, according to Labya, are a \u201cstronger indicator of biopharmaceutical industry activity when evaluating licensing agreements.\u201d\n\nThis growth in licensing investments \u201csuggests that biopharmaceutical companies continue to commit large sums of capital to refuel their pipelines for drugs with clinical efficacy and safety data,\u201d Labya added.\n\nThe number of licensing deals last year likewise saw a marginal 3.5% increase from 2023, which according to Labya, \u201csignals some revitalization\u201d but remains lower than its recent peak in 2022. This pattern \u201csuggests that the biopharmaceutical industry is still in a recovery phase.\u201d\n\nBig Pharma dominated the top licensing agreements of 2024, the largest of which is a pair of cardiovascular pacts between Novartis and Chinese biotech Shanghai Argo. But smaller biotechs aren\u2019t afraid to make big investments, too, with Sarepta Therapeutics committing nearly $1.1 billion in an RNA interference pact with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn this article, BioSpace looks at seven of the most notable licensing deals inked in 2024.\n\nNovartis \u2013 Shanghai Argo\n\nDate: January 7, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $4.165 billion\n\nNovartis opened 2024 with the top deal on this list\u2014a pair of cardiovascular contracts with Chinese biotech Shanghai Argo Biopharmaceutical.\n\nNovartis made an upfront payment of $185 million and Argo is entitled to certain option and milestone payments. Together, the deals could rack up $4.165 billion for Argo, plus tiered royalties. Under the first partnership, Novartis will gain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize an early-stage program for an undisclosed cardiovascular target, as well as the ability to select up to two additional targets for drug discovery. The pharma will then have the option to obtain a worldwide exclusive license for the resulting drug candidates.\n\nSimilarly, the second agreement will allow Novartis to exclusively develop a Phase I/IIa cardiovascular program outside the Greater China region.\n\nThe Argo deals could help Novartis shore up its cardiovascular franchise amid the encroaching generic threat to its heart failure drug Entresto. Last month, an appeals court ruled against Novartis in its attempt to prevent the entry of a generic version into the U.S. market. Entresto is Novartis\u2019 top asset, bringing in more than $6 billion in net global sales in 2023.\n\nNovartis \u2013 PeptiDream\n\nDate: April 30, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $2.89 billion\n\nJust a few months after putting more than $4 billion on the line for Argo, Novartis again made a major investment, pledging up to $2.89 billion to expand an existing collaboration with Japan-based PeptiDream.\n\nFor $180 million upfront and up to $2.71 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones, Novartis will gain access to PeptiDream\u2019s Peptide Discovery Platform System (PDPS) to identify and develop novel macrocyclic peptides. The pharma will be able to select several indications to target, though it has yet to reveal what these are.\n\nNovartis can also conjugate PeptiDream\u2019s peptides with radioligands for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. The pharma\u2019s Lutathera, a radioligand therapy for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and Pluvicto, indicated for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, utilize similar technology. Under the expanded agreement, PeptiDream will be eligible for tiered royalties on net sales of any products that reach the market.\n\nNovartis and PeptiDream are longtime collaborators, with their first drug discovery partnership dating back to 2010, according to the April 2024 press release. Novartis licensed the biotech\u2019s PDPS in 2015, followed by a new collaboration in 2019 for the discovery and development of novel macrocyclic peptides against various targets.\n\nSanofi \u2013 Novavax\n\nDate: May 10, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $1.2 billion\n\nDespite a stale endemic market, COVID-19 was at the center of one of 2024\u2019s largest licensing deals: a potential $1.2 billion agreement between Sanofi and struggling vaccine developer Novavax.\n\nNovavax provided Sanofi with the sole license to its adjuvanted COVID-19 shot, which the pharma can use alongside its flu vaccines. Sanofi will be solely responsible for developing and marketing combination COVID-19 and flu immunization regimens. Additionally, Sanofi will have a co-exclusive license to co-commercialize Novavax\u2019s adjuvanted COVID-19 shot worldwide, for which the pharma will start booking sales this year.\n\nIn return, Sanofi paid Novavax $500 million upfront and promised up to $700 million in development, regulatory and launch milestones. The pharma also took a minority stake in Novavax amounting to less than 5%.\n\nSanofi\u2019s backing\u2014and money\u2014could prove to be a critical lifeline for Novavax, which for the past few years has struggled to stay afloat. In March 2023, for instance, the company warned investors that it might not have enough funds to continue past February 2024. While Novavax managed to keep itself operational beyond that date, the biotech continues to struggle, with its Q2 2024 earnings falling far short of analyst expectations.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb \u2013 Prime Medicine\n\nDate: September 30, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $3.61 billion\n\nIn September 2024, Bristol Myers Squibb leaned into one of the hottest areas in biopharma with a potential $3.61 billion gene editing cell therapy partnership with Massachusetts-based Prime Medicine.\n\nBMS made a $55 million upfront payment coupled with a $55 million equity investment to kick off the collaboration. Prime Medicine will be eligible for more than $3.5 billion in milestones\u2014a sum that includes up to $1.4 billion in development milestones and over $2.1 billion in commercialization milestones. BMS has also pledged royalties on net sales of products that arise from the partnership.\n\nPrime Medicine will provide BMS with optimized Prime Editor reagents, which the pharma will use to develop next-generation ex vivo cell therapies for immunology and oncology targets. Prime Medicine will also provide support for gene editing strategy and reagent development.\n\nThe Prime partnership could help BMS deepen its pipeline in cell therapy, anchored by its CAR T therapies Breyanzi, indicated for several lymphomas and leukemia, and Abecma, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics \u2013 Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals\n\nDate: November 26, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $1.075 billion\n\nLarge licensing deals aren\u2019t exclusively the territory of Big Pharma. That\u2019s something that Sarepta proved in November 2024, when it put more than $1 billion on the line for an RNA interference pact with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAt the heart of this partnership are four clinical candidates from Arrowhead: ARO-DUX4 for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, ARO-DM1 for myotonic dystrophy type 1, ARO-MMP7 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and ARO-ATXN2 for spinocerebellar ataxia 2. All four are in Phase I/II development and leverage Arrowhead\u2019s proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule platform, which allows them to precisely and durably knock down their target genes.\n\nThe deal also gives Sarepta access to three preclinical programs, as well as the option to add up to six more muscle, cardiac and/or central nervous system targets for development using Arrowhead\u2019s RNAi technology.\n\nIn exchange for these assets, Sarepta made a $550 million upfront payment, alongside a $325 million equity investment in Arrowhead\u2019s common stock. Sarepta also promised to fork over $250 million more, to be paid in $50-million annual installments over five years. Arrowhead is eligible for future milestones and royalties.\n\nNovartis \u2013 PTC Therapeutics\n\nDate: December 2, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $2.9 billion\n\nNovartis\u2019 third showing on this list is with PTC Therapeutics, a New Jersey biotech focused on rare diseases. The pharma paid $1 billion upfront alongside the promise of up to $1.9 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones to advance PTC518 for Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\nDesigned to be taken orally, PTC518 is a small molecule that can cross the blood-brain barrier to reduce the production of the mutant huntingtin protein. In turn, PTC518 is believed to prevent the widespread brain injury and neuronal destruction associated with Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\nPTC518 is currently in the Phase II PIVOT-HD trial, which is expected to wrap up in the first half of this year. Thereafter, Novartis will assume responsibility for the asset through further development and manufacturing.\n\nEarlier in the year, Novartis inked another large neuro deal with Voyager Therapeutics, paying $100 million upfront, including a $20 million equity investment, for access to the biotech\u2019s gene therapies for Huntington\u2019s disease and spinal muscular atrophy. The Voyager agreement involves up to $1.2 billion in milestones.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb \u2013 BioArctic\n\nDate: December 19, 2024\n\nTotal disclosed value: $1.35 billion\n\nLike fellow Big Pharma Novartis, BMS leaned into big licensing deals in 2024, with its second entry on this list being a neuro collaboration with BioArctic for $100 million upfront.\n\nThe agreement will focus on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with the partners working on two novel antibodies, BAN1503 and BAN2803, that seek out the more toxic pyroglutamate-modified form of amyloid-beta. The latter asset was designed using BioArctic\u2019s BrainTransporter platform, which makes use of the transferrin receptor to enable penetration of the blood-brain barrier.\n\nBMS will be in charge of the development and commercialization of BAN1503 and BAN2803. Aside from the upfront consideration, BioArctic will also be entitled to up to $1.25 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalties on global sales of products that make it to the market.\n\nThe BioArctic partnership comes after BMS\u2019s $14 billion play to buy Karuna Therapeutics in December 2023 paid off in a major way with the FDA\u2019s approval of Cobenfy in September 2024, marking the first new schizophrenia therapy in more than three decades.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) stands against the other foreign stocks.\n\nIn August, S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that US dividends are set to grow around 5.1% by the close of 2024. In the United States, the energy sector dominated dividend contributions, with pharmaceuticals, financial services, and banks trailing behind. Looking beyond the US, we see similar growth trends in international markets. For example, S&P expects a 3.9% year-over-year recovery in dividends in Canada, resulting in $74.4 billion in dividend payouts for 2024. Interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada will aid this rebound in dividends. Two-thirds of the overall Canadian dividend distributions are attributed to the financial and energy sectors.\n\nBy year-end 2024, European dividends are projected to grow 4.2% year-over-year to $531.5 billion, with the banking and insurance sectors leading the charge and counteracting the weakness in the European transportation, materials, and energy industries. In the Asia-Pacific region, dividend growth is also projected to be strong. Developed markets in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 Australia, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, South Korea, and Singapore \u2013 are expected to grow their dividends to $370.5 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting a 5.8% year-over-year increase. According to S&P Global, 2024 is the year that Japan will overtake Hong Kong SAR in terms of the highest dividend contributions in the developed Asia-Pacific market, with an expected growth rate of over 10% for the year.\n\nTurning back to Canada, Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management, joined BNN Bloomberg on February 4 and discussed the Canadian stock market outlook. He commented that the current hostility from the US should be a wake-up call for Canadian policymakers, noting that it is impractical to isolate the US but Canada should have alternative trading partners in case political tensions influence economic decisions. Bushell mentioned that having export options other than oil is crucial and that Canada should look into exporting natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases as well. In terms of investment strategies, the portfolio manager emphasized that sustainable and stable companies make for excellent long-term investments, regardless of who occupies the White House. This includes critical infrastructure companies, which cater to people\u2019s needs rather than wants. He went on to recommend his top stock picks, which were companies with steady dividend policies, high yields, and 40-60% of their revenues coming from the US, to navigate the messy tariffs. Bushnell prefers Canadian energy stocks since these companies are seeking to export to more countries, which will result in higher gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nNovartis AG (NYSE:NVS)\n\nDividend Yield as of February 3: 3.57%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nNovartis AG (NYSE:NVS) ranks 8th on our list of the best foreign stocks for passive income. It is a Swiss global healthcare company that develops, manufactures, and sells prescription medicines. The company\u2019s therapeutic areas include heart, kidney, and metabolic health, immunology, neuroscience, cancer, eye care, and blood disorders.\n\nNovartis announced positive results of its Phase III STEER study on December 30, 2024, which refers to the clinical efficiency and safety of OAV101 IT. OAV101 IT is a gene therapy meant for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2, in patients aged two to under eighteen. The results showed significant improvement in motor function compared to a sham control. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) plans to forward these results to the FDA in 2025 for approval.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, the Swiss healthcare giant reported its Q4 2024 earnings. After adjustments for special items, the net income climbed 26% to $3.93 billion, which beat Wall Street expectations of $3.64 billion. According to the Q4 earnings call, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)\u2019s sales grew 16% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Excluding the heart failure drug Entresto, which will lose its patent in mid-2025, the Novartis brand portfolio grew about 38%. This led the company to offer a 5% plus sales guidance until 2029, as well as a long-term growth forecast in the mid-single digits.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Novartis also experienced a record-high free cash flow, which soared 24% to $16.3 billion. NVS attributes its stellar cash flow to its transformation into a pure pharmaceutical play. The company is set on sharing its success with shareholders and is on track to execute share buybacks of $5.4 billion in 2025. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) also declared an increase of 6% in its per-share dividend, which now stands at CHF 3.50. This marks the 28th consecutive yearly dividend hike by Novartis.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, 24 Wall Street funds held shares of Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), with the largest stakeholder being Jim Simons\u2019 Renaissance Technologies, owning 2.3 million shares valued at $264.6 million.\n\nOverall NVS ranks 8th on our list of the best foreign stocks with dividends for passive income. While we acknowledge the potential of NVS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

During his visit to the plant, which specialises in the production of radiopharmaceuticals used in the fight against cancer, S\u00e1nchez stressed that combatting this disease is \"a collective task\" and that Spain is a leader in Europe in clinical trials for cancer treatments and advanced therapies.\n\nThe President of the Government also welcomed the employment figures, which show that we have the lowest unemployment rate in the last 17 years, with the forecast of creating more than 400,000 jobs per year in 2025 and 2026, and that Spain will continue to be one of the main economies generating employment and economic growth in Europe and in the world.\n\nIn a context as difficult as the one Europe is going through, \"and with the rumblings of trade wars\", he highlighted Spain's leading position in the EU, among other factors, \"thanks to the commitment of such cutting-edge industries so necessary for the welfare and prosperity of our country as the pharmaceutical sector\".\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez during his visit to the Novartis production plant | Pool Moncloa/Borja Puig de la Bellacasa\n\nThe chief executive highlighted the Government's commitment to scholarships and vocational training, and the resources to improve our public health system. In this regard, the chief executive stressed that support for the pharmaceutical sector accounts for 1.5% of our GDP and creates more than 36,000 direct jobs and 150,000 indirect jobs. It has an investment in R&D&I of \u20ac22 billion, 50% more than six years ago, to promote, retain and attract research talent; and the sector has a strategic project, the PERTE for cutting-edge health, earmarked with \u20ac2 billion.\n\nThe president stressed the importance of companies such as Novartis in the Executive's commitment to territorial cohesion to revitalise \"a Spain full of opportunities far beyond the big cities\", and the generation of quality, qualified and young employment. The La Almunia de Do\u00f1a Godina plant is one of Novartis's four pioneering and innovative radiopharmaceutical facilities worldwide - one of the two in Europe with worldwide production - and in 2025 it will complete an investment of \u20ac53 million for its modernisation and expansion.\n\nNon official translation",

Despite current treatment options, people with HR+/HER2- eBC remain at risk of experiencing a return of their cancer in the long term, often as incurable advanced disease.\n\n\"The possibility of breast cancer returning can be a continuous concern for people who have been diagnosed with the disease. Therefore, providing an additional layer of protection to a broad population of patients at high risk of recurrence is always reassuring.\" said Stephen Johnston, Professor of Breast Cancer Medicine, Consultant Medical Oncologist, and Head of the Breast Unit at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. \"The introduction of ribociclib as a treatment option for early-stage breast cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence is a promising development for both clinicians and patients, including those with node-negative disease and additional risk factors.\"\n\nThe approval is based on results from the Phase III NATALEE trial, which included pre-/postmenopausal women and men with HR+/HER2- with any lymph node involvement (excluding microscopic nodal involvement), or if no nodal involvement either tumour size >5 cm, or tumour size 2-5 cm with either grade 2 (and high genomic risk or Ki67 \u226520%) or grade 3. The trial showed a significant and clinically meaningful 25.1% (HR 0.749, 95% CI 0.628-0.892; p = 0.0012) reduction in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) events versus using aromatase inhibitor alone. iDFS at 3 years was 90.7% (95% CI 89.3%-91.8%) versus 87.6% (95% CI 86.1%-88.9%) respectively (absolute reduction: 3.1%).\n\nThere were no new safety signals reported in the final analysis of the NATALEE trial. The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (reported at a frequency \u226520%) in the dataset for which the frequency for ribociclib plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) exceeds the frequency for AI alone were neutropenia, infections, nausea, headache, fatigue, leukopenia and abnormal liver function tests. The most common grade 3/4 ADRs (reported at a frequency of \u22652%) in the dataset for which the frequency for ribociclib plus AI exceeds the frequency for AI alone were neutropenia, abnormal liver function tests and leukopenia.\n\nWith the most recent analysis of the NATALEE trial data announced at ESMO, Novartis continues to evaluate NATALEE patients for longer-term outcomes, including overall survival.\n\n\u201cThe announcement reinforces Novartis' 30-year legacy in driving scientific advancements for people affected by breast cancer. With consistent results across patient subgroups, ribociclib is now licensed for a broad population of patients diagnosed with HR+/HER2- eBC at high risk of recurrence,\u201d said Gerrit Zijlstra, chief medical officer for the UK & Ireland at Novartis. \u201cThe MHRA decision builds on the confidence established by the NATALEE trial and highlights the potential of ribociclib to reduce the risk of recurrence in eBC, addressing a significant unmet need for patients in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe MHRA licence in the UK comes shortly after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval for ribociclib across Europe. Following MHRA authorisation, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) submissions are under review to secure reimbursement of ribociclib to increase patient access via the National Health Service (NHS).",

            "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Novartis' (VTX:NOVN) stock increased significantly by 7.9% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study Novartis' ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Novartis\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Novartis is:\n\n27% = US$12b \u00f7 US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every CHF1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CHF0.27 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Novartis' Earnings Growth And 27% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Novartis has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. Despite this, Novartis' five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.2%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Novartis' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.\n\nSWX:NOVN Past Earnings Growth February 4th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Novartis fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.",

            "content": "Novartis AG's (VTX:NOVN) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $3.50 on 13th of March. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.6%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Novartis\n\nNovartis' Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Novartis was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 30.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 46% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nSWX:NOVN Historic Dividend February 4th 2025\n\nNovartis Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $2.41, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.83. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.8% a year over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Novartis has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.\n\nWe Really Like Novartis' Dividend\n\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Novartis is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The focus is on maintaining sales growth and managing the impact of generics in the second half of the year.\n\nQ: How resilient is Novartis' gross margin in light of Entresto's potential loss of exclusivity? A: Harry Kirsch noted that while there might be some pressure on gross margins due to increased royalties from new products, this will be offset by SG&A efficiencies. The company expects to maintain strong productivity programs in manufacturing and supply chain to manage costs effectively.\n\nQ: What makes Novartis confident in its Huntington's disease program given past failures in the area? A: CEO Vasant Narasimhan highlighted that the goal is to reduce mutant Huntington protein by 30-50% without adverse effects. The interim results from PTC's Phase 2 study showed relevant mHTT lowering and clinical efficacy signals with a good safety profile. The focus is on achieving a clinical benefit that could lead to regulatory approval.\n\nQ: Can you confirm the contribution of favorable gross-to-net adjustments to sales in Q4 2024? A: Harry Kirsch confirmed that about 3 percentage points of the 16% sales growth in Q4 were due to gross-to-net true-ups from prior quarters. The underlying growth was 13%, and the full-year sales for 2024 are considered undistorted.\n\nQ: How does Novartis view the impact of Medicare Part D reform on its growth outlook? A: Vasant Narasimhan stated that the company expects a modest headwind from Part D reforms, which has been factored into the guidance. The reforms primarily impact Cosentyx and Kisqali, but Novartis anticipates managing these effects within its growth projections.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Novartis Surges Past Earnings Expectations With Strong Q4 Results CEO Vas Narasimhan projects continued growth amid upcoming challenges and strategic acquisitions.\n\nSwiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) has reported impressive fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, driving its shares upward as the company surpassed analyst expectations on multiple fronts. The report indicated adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, well above the anticipated $1.81, reflecting Novartis' ability to navigate competitive market conditions.\n\nQuarterly sales reached $13.153 billion, marking a 16% increase from the previous year, and surpassing the consensus estimate of $12.811 billion. This surge was predominantly fueled by the heart failure drug Entresto, alongside strong performances from multiple sclerosis treatment Kesimpta and arthritis medication Cosentyx. According to Novartis, heart failure medication Entresto's sales grew by 34% at constant currency, driven by heightened demand and expanded market share within the U.S. and Europe.\n\nCEO Vas Narasimhan remarked on the company\u2019s resilience, addressing concerns about Entresto's impending patent expiration. \"We have strong replacement power,\u201d he stated, projecting confidence around continued growth and margin expansion going forward. His comments during the earnings call were aimed at reassuring investors amid threats from rival generic medications.\n\nKesimpta, which targets multiple sclerosis, saw its sales soar 49%, totaling approximately $950 million, reflecting increased patient uptake across all regions. Cosentyx also made headlines with its 24% growth, bolstered by recent strategic product launches, including variations for different indications.\n\nThroughout 2024, Novartis executed 30 deals, establishing itself as one of the top dealmakers within the pharmaceutical sector. Revealing potential for future acquisitions, Narasimhan emphasized, \"We will continue our strategy to look for primarily bolt-on acquisitions to bolster our growth for the future.\u201d These proactive measures signal Novartis' commitment to sustainable long-term performance.\n\nNotably, Novartis announced plans for dividends, with CHF3.50 proposed per share, offering investors reassurance of financial stability amid ambitious expansion plans. Further strengthening its forecast, the company anticipates net sales growth for fiscal year 2025, projecting mid-to-high single digits and core operating income increases between high single to low double digits.\n\nDespite the rise of generics poised to challenge blockbuster sales, particularly for Entresto, Novartis is well-prepared to safeguard its market position. The heart failure drug anticipates heightened competition when its patent expires mid-2025, yet Novartis plans to vigorously defend its exclusivity rights, especially against newly approved generics.\n\nMeanwhile, Novartis has seen significant increases in net cash flows from operating activities, totaling $4.2 billion for the quarter, with free cash flow reported at $3.6 billion. This fiscal health points toward the potential for continued investment and growth.\n\nCFO Harry Kirsch acknowledged the company's recent successes, noting the milestones achieved with innovative treatments. He stated, \"Seeing the newer drugs beat expectations really lifts these brands to a new level,\u201d highlighting the strategic focus on advancing the pipeline for future success.\n\nThe sales forecast paints an optimistic picture for investors and analysts alike, especially as Novartis continues to work on enhancing its portfolio, with over 30 assets showing potential for differentiated growth. Solid clinical trial results are anticipated this year, including promising treatments projected to impact the prostate cancer market significantly.\n\nShares of Novartis saw positive movement, jumping nearly 3% following the earnings report. Investors seem optimistic about the company's prospects as it transitions through pivotal market moments, asserting its competitive edge even as it grapples with the challenges posed by competitor generics.\n\nWith expectations set high for the upcoming year, Novartis remains committed to evaluating its strategies and maintaining momentum, aiming to uphold its reputation as one of the industry leaders. The pharmaceutical giant not only thrives on innovation but also on strategic foresight, ensuring its place at the forefront of global healthcare.\n\nAnalysts continue to monitor Novartis closely as it endeavors to strike the right balance between managing its existing blockbuster drugs and advancing next-generation therapies to secure its long-term market position. Investors eager to see how the market responds will be watching closely for Novartis' performance as it enters the next quarter with ambitious plans.",

Reported EPS is $1.98, expectations were $1.8.\n\nOperator: Good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to the Novartis Q4 2024 Results Release Conference Call and Live Webcast. [Operator Instructions] A recording of the conference call, including the Q&A session, will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. With that, I would like to hand over to Ms. Sloan Simpson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nSloan Simpson: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our Q4 and full year 2024 earnings call. The information presented today contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. These may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. For a description of some of these factors, please refer to the company\u2019s Form 20-F and its most recent quarterly results on Form 6-K that respectively were filed with and furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before we get started, I just want to echo Sharon\u2019s comment for all of our analysts, please limit yourselves to one question at a time, and we\u2019ll cycle through the queue as many times as we can. And with that, I will hand across to Vas.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Terrific. Thanks Sloan and thanks everybody for joining today\u2019s call to review our quarter four 2024 and full year results. So, moving to Slide 4. As you saw this morning, Novartis delivered one of the strongest performances that we\u2019ve had in our history in 2024. When you look at quarter four, our sales grew 16% and core operating income grew 29% in constant currency and on the full year, we had 12% sales growth and 22% core operating income growth with our margin reaching 38.7%, well on our way to our goal of 40% plus margin. We also had important pipeline highlights in the quarter, including for Scemblix and Kisqali, which we\u2019ll go through in in more detail later on the call. Overall, we met and exceeded our full year guidance in 2024, and we\u2019re confident in continued growth in sales and core operating income in 2025, as Harry will outline later in the call.\n\nSo, moving to Slide 5. Our priority brands continued to drive robust growth in the quarter. And I think importantly, that demonstrates we have the replacement power to consistently grow through the end of the decade. Overall, this portfolio of brands grew 38% in constant currencies and excluding Entresto, grew 41%. So, we feel very good about the momentum we have and this is what gives us confidence in the 5% plus sales guidance out to 2029 and the mid-single-digit growth we believe we can deliver in the long-term. Now, moving to Slide 6. Entresto achieved sales of $7.8 billion on the full year, that\u2019s up 31%. And when you look at the left side, you can see we had very good growth, both in the United States and in our international markets.\n\nThe total prescriptions for Entresto in the weekly TRx in the U.S. continued to climb. We had plus 41% growth in the United States with 9,000 NBRxs per week, ex-U.S. continued to perform well. And I think importantly, we see very good performance in heart failure as well as hypertension in China and Japan. Now, when we look at the outlook for Entresto, we\u2019ve updated the market that for forecasting purposes, we assume Entresto LOE in mid-2025. As you likely have seen, our combination pattern is upheld and we currently believe we will be able to secure pediatric exclusivity, though we\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation closely, and that enables us to guide to a mid-2025 LOE. Outside of the U.S., our RDP protection last call November 2026 with a protection in Japan until 2030, and we continue to pursue additional options for further protection in these markets.\n\nI think when you think about forecasting Entresto for the rest of decade, it\u2019s important to note that the U.S. sales are about 50% of the global sales. But importantly, Europe contributes 20% and China and Japan in total of 15% of this brand. So moving to Slide 7. Cosentyx topped $6 billion of sales in the full year, growing 25%. This was fueled by our new launches in HS as well as the IV launch. When you look at the fourth quarter, we had U.S. sales up 36%, as mentioned by the key launches. Outside of the United States, we had 7% constant currency growth driven mainly by volume in our core indications. Now, when you look at how things are unfolding for the brand, we remain number one \u2014 the one number IL-17 in the U.S. dynamic market, and we remain the leading originator biologic in both the EU and China.\n\nNow, looking ahead, we plan to accelerate growth through the HS launch with the NBRx leadership we\u2019ve already established with 60% NBRx share and continuing to secure reimbursement in our key markets. Now IV has started to see accelerated adoption in the U.S. We have about 1,625 accounts ordering. We saw 22% quarter-on-quarter growth, but it\u2019s still early days, and we\u2019re working through now really accelerating the IV adoption. And over the course of year, we expect two Phase 3 readouts in giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica which, if positive, would provide further engines for growth for Cosentyx through the remainder of the decade. Now, moving to Slide 8. Kesimpta grew 49%, reaching $3.2 billion on the full year. It was outpacing both the B cell and the MS market.\n\nWe\u2019re really pleased by the performance in the U.S. and also very solid performance outside of the United States, growing 42% in U.S. with TRx growth at 29%. We\u2019re outpacing the B-cell segment. We see our NBRx share in the high 20s in the B-cell segment. Outside of the United States, we had 67% constant currency growth, which we\u2019re really pleased with. Overall, 70% of the new patients in the United States are first line or first switch. 80% of the U.S. commercial lives have been \u2014 now first-line coverage. So we\u2019re in a very good position from that standpoint. And we are right now the number one NBRx naive medicine and seven out of the 10 ex-U.S. market. So I think the setup overall for Kesimpta looks really good, very strong performance. U.S. and ex-U.S., and that gives us confidence in reaching the peak sales guidance that we\u2019ve set out for this brand.\n\nNow, moving to Slide 9. Kisqali grew 49% in the full year, reaching $3 billion in sales, and this is a reflection of both of the strong performance we\u2019re seeing in the metastatic setting and in the early breast cancer setting. So as you can see in the middle panel here, we\u2019ve outlined the total brand NBRx across the market, and you can see the significant increase we\u2019ve seen in total brand NBRx post the approval in early breast cancer and the positive NCCN guidelines. The brand grew 65% in the U.S. in quarter four. We have metastatic share at 50% now and TRx share at 33% and climbing. In the eBC setting, the early breast cancer setting, we\u2019ve already reached 52% in NBRx share within three months of launch. And so we\u2019re getting very positive feedback from physicians and seeing solid uptake both in node-negative and node 1 patients without risk factors as well as the overlapping node 1 and node 2+ patient population.\n\nI mentioned the Category 1 NCCN guidelines, which is really positive for the brand. And importantly, as well, we announced this morning that we\u2019ve settled the compound patent litigation with a generic manufacturer and that supports Kisqali U.S. patent protection until at least Q1 2031. Outside of the United States, we grew 34% in constant currency with a leading share. NBRx share at 42%. And the early breast cancer launch is ongoing now in Europe and other geographies, and that should provide a further driver of growth for Kisqali over the course of this year. So we guided to $8 billion plus, and I think the early signals are clearly indicating that we\u2019re going to be able to get there and hopefully do better. Now moving to Slide 10. Pluvicto delivered full year sales of $1.4 billion, 42% in constant currencies in the post-taxane setting.\n\nAnd most importantly, we spent a lot of our energy in quarter four, laying the foundation for the pre taxane PSMAfore launch, which we expect in the first half. Now when you look at the quarter, we grew, you can see 28%. Overall, our performance was absolutely in line with what we guided to in our quarter three conference call. U.S. was up 12%. We achieved 40% NBRx share within the VISION population. Pluvicto is now available in over 20 countries outside of the United States. And we\u2019re confident that we can now accelerate growth with the PSMAfore launch in 2025. The final OS was readout over the course of January with HR \u2014 unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.91. And you can see the confidence intervals here. The file has been submitted to the FDA last year, and the review is ongoing.\n\nAnd as we \u2014 so far, there\u2019s no AdCom plan for this brand. So I think that\u2019s really a positive signal, and we\u2019ll see now how quickly we can get to launch. We have over 590 sites open for the brand, 350 sites are actively ordering. And every month, every week, we\u2019re adding more sites. We\u2019re getting more sites actively order. We\u2019re getting further into community oncology, which will set us up not only for Pluvicto, but our broader RLT pipeline over time. And we expect the initial uptake for PSMAfore to come primarily from the depth we\u2019ll get in these existing sites and then grow over time, certainly as we try to reach deeper into the oncology community practices. We\u2019re also progressing on our efforts to expand Pluvicto further and as well as our broader RLT expansion.\n\nThe PSMAddition readout is on track for the second half of this year. We have Pluvicto filings ongoing in China and Japan, and in both of those geographies as well. We\u2019ve announced manufacturing facilities to support the launch of Pluvicto and of course Lutathera and we\u2019ve also now initiated planning for our actinium PSMA-617 Phase 3 study, the first of two actinium studies, we\u2019re now planning to move into Phase 3 on to have continued life cycle management in prostate cancer with radioligand therapies. Now moving to Slide 11. Leqvio showed a steady trajectory, delivered 114% constant currency full year growth in the quarter, 83% growth versus prior year. We\u2019re really pleased that now in the U.S. our growth is outpacing the overall advanced lipid lowering market.\n\nWe have over 3,000 health systems ordering now Leqvio that represents 68% of the overall market volume. We have depth that\u2019s increasing, and I think we\u2019re getting better and better traction with the overall buy-and-bill comfort levels within cardiology practices. We see demand growth in all relevant channels. Outside of the United States, we\u2019ve seen robust growth as well. Leqvio is now registered in over 100 countries. We see solid uptake in markets such as Germany. And in China, our out-of-pocket growth really makes it one of the top ranked markets we have outside of the United States. We have an ongoing launch as well now in Japan. So looking ahead, we have a number of clinical stage readouts coming over the course of 2025, which will help, I think, round out the profile of Leqvio as we await the outcomes trials, readouts in secondary prevention in 2026 and 2027.\n\nNow moving to Slide 12. Scemblix grew 68% for the full year with continued momentum in the third line setting and early progress that we\u2019re already seeing in the frontline setting. We\u2019re a market leader now in the third-line CML setting with NBRx share of 49%. We\u2019re three times higher than the nearest competitor, which I think shows how well established now Scemblix is amongst hematologists. Outside of the United States, our leadership is at 66% for NBRx and total patient share in our key markets. And when you look at the earlier line launch, what was critical is that we have already received NCCN Category 1 preferred recommendation in November. And then we also already see now Scemblix is the fastest-growing TKI by NBRx share across all lines of therapy and we\u2019re the market leader now in second-line NBRx with a share already at 29%.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just in the first few months of launch. So assuming we can really drive that continued trajectory, we should see a very strong uptake overall for Scemblix in the coming quarters. So, we\u2019re confident in the global first-line opportunity. We readout the 96-week data recently as well, which reinforces superior efficacy, and I\u2019ll say more about that in a moment. And then we also showed some very good data that showed treatment discontinuation as well that Scemblix provides a clear profile win over nilotinib. Now going to Slide 13That ASC4FIRST 96-week data reinforce superior efficacy and safety. When you look at the data set here at 96 weeks on the left-hand side of the chart, you can see against all TKIs, we continued to show a significant improvement, a statistically significant improvement in major molecular response similarly versus imatinib a significant improvement in major molecular response.\n\nAnd while we weren\u2019t powered our point estimate difference against second gen TKIs continues to improve as well over time. Now when you look at the safety profile, we maintained a very excellent safety profile that we had at the earlier time point, whether it was grade 3 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation or AEs leading to dose interruption, an excellent profile for the brand. So overall, we offer here a medicine that has high efficacy, compelling safety. And we believe over time, as there\u2019s more and more experience, we\u2019ll become the preferred agent in first, second and third line for CML patients. Now moving to Slide 14. Now turning to Fabhalta. As you\u2019re well, Fabhalta has now launched in two indications in PNH and IgAN. And while it\u2019s early days, I think we see really solid, steady performance for this brand, a 23% volume growth in PNH.\n\nMost of the source of business at the moment is switch patients from the established therapies. We see over 90% of patients staying on therapy after the \u2014 continuing after their first refill, very good commercial coverage levels. We\u2019re approved now in 40 countries. And so step by step as well, we\u2019re progressing the launch in other geographies. The early signs for the IgAN launch as well are very encouraging. We\u2019ve seen strong access with 67% commercial coverage already to label. We\u2019re seeing a number of nephrologists, a staggering number of nephrologists, completing REMS certification. And we also see a high interest in our conversations with opinion leaders on the Fabhalta MOA. One other update we have as well for Fabhalta is that the C3G filing was completed in quarter 4.\n\nWe received priority review. The FDA has confirmed no AdCom for C3G. So we\u2019re now preparing for a launch in the first half of 2025. So moving to Slide 15. So when you look across the full year, I think we delivered very good innovation momentum across regulatory decisions, submissions, readouts and Phase 3 starts. Obviously, the critical approvals were delivered upon, particularly the Kisqali, early breast cancer, Fabhalta approvals, the filings of Pluvicto and the approval for Scemblix. So I think we really are looking forward to maintaining and continuing that momentum in the year to come. One important readout that we did have in quarter four, turning to Slide 16, was for the STEER study for OAV101 IT. This is the intrathecal version of Zolgensma that is administered intrathecally at roughly one tenth the dose of what we see in the IV administration.\n\nThis was tested in children and young adults over two years of age. We\u2019re really pleased to see that we\u2019ve met the primary endpoint for an increase versus baseline for the Hammersmith score, HFMSE which is the gold standard. Not all of the therapies in the space have been tested against the Hammersmith score. So we chose the gold standard and we demonstrated that we met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement versus a sham or placebo as requested by FDA. A very favorable safety profile consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in other settings. We\u2019re looking forward to present the data at an upcoming Medical Congress. You can see the study design over on the right. And our goal here will be to try to secure a broad indication across the various age levels and looking forward then to advance this global regulatory submissions across the various geographies.\n\nA sizable number of patients have not had the opportunity to benefit from Zolgensma in the first six months of life. And now we\u2019re really excited now to give those patients a very compelling one-time treatment option that can hopefully stabilize and potentially improve their disease. Now moving to Slide 17. We also completed an exciting deal in our neuroscience pipeline. This is for votoplam, PTC518. It\u2019s a potential first-in-class oral disease-modifying therapy for Huntington\u2019s disease. We have a lot of expertise in oral splicing agents. We had a molecule called LMI070, which ultimately did not progress because of peripheral neuropathy signals that we had during the development program. So this is a space we know well, and we really believe PTC518 has a very strong profile as evidenced in the interim readout of their Phase 2 study.\n\nAs you know, in Huntington\u2019s disease, a very fatal neurodegenerative disease with really no disease-modifying therapies at the moment, prevalence is 37,000 in the U.S. and 28,000 in EU. So we have an opportunity, hopefully, to make a big difference. We would expect the Phase 2 readout for the study in the first half of 2025 and then moving to pivotal Phase 3 studies thereafter. Then moving to Slide 18. So our goal will be to continue our innovation momentum in 2025. We outlined to meet the management. We have a deep and broad pipeline across our four therapeutic areas across our key platforms and our goal now is to advance the next wave of therapies, both in terms of approvals and submissions. You can see the list here, but also readout some study initiations, which will really fill up that mid-stage pipeline and then allow us to maintain our growth momentum well into the 2030s and beyond.\n\nSo moving to Slide 19 and to close, I just wanted to remind you of our confidence in our mid-term guidance of 5% plus sales growth out to 2029 and a 40% core margin by 2027. We\u2019re very comfortable that we can \u2014 with our replacement power outpaced the GX impacts that we have to 2029. We have an exciting set of in-market growth drivers, many of which have protection well into the 2030s. We have the pipeline probabilized and are hopefully with positive clinical data and approval, that pipeline will become further unprobablized in medicines like remibrutinib, OAV, ianalumab, pelacarsen and atrasentan can further drive the growth profile of the company. So an exciting year. We\u2019re really excited about our performance in 2024 and excited about continuing delivering the strong results and strong innovation delivery into 2025.\n\nSo with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Harry.\n\nHarry Kirsch: Yes. Thank you, Vas. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll now talk you through our financials for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, which as Vas mentioned, has shown some of the strongest performance in our history. As always, my comments refer to continuing operations and growth rates in constant currencies, unless otherwise noted. So starting on Slide 21, giving a bit of context. Our results in 2024, which is here on the far right of each of the three charts was really our first full year as a pure-play Innovative Medicines Company and we continue to show a strong track record of sales growth with margin expansion. If you look back over the last five years, we have grown sales at a 7% CAGR and core operating income at a 15% CAGR through consistent, strong commercial execution and overall significant progress on operational productivity.\n\nThis has resulted in core margin expansion of 1,100 basis points in constant currencies, putting us on a clear path to achieve our midterm margin guidance of 40% plus by 2027. I think when you look at this track record, it becomes very clear that we have lifted the company to a whole new level of sales, margin and as we will discuss later, free cash flow. Moving to Slide 22. We guided to a low double-digit sales growth for full year 2024, and we achieved 12%. So meeting our guidance. And for core operating income, we delivered 22% growth exceeding by one notch our guidance, reflecting the strong momentum we have seen in our priority brands, good also and launches as well as cost discipline throughout the end of the year including some productivity gains.\n\nOn Slide 23, you see a summary of our financial performance. In the quarter, sales were up 16%, and core operating income increased 29%. Core EPS was $1.98, up 33%. To note, in quarter four, we benefited from some growth to net favorability, mainly in the U.S. This added about 3% points of growth in quarter four from gross to net true-ups based on invoices for prior quarters in 2024. So the underlying growth in quarter four has been a very strong 13%, slightly better than the 12% sales growth for the full year in 2024. For the full year, core margin expanded 330 basis points versus prior year in constant currencies to reach 38.7%. Core EPS was $7.81, up 24%. And free cash flow grew 24% to $16.3 billion, a record high for Novartis. Now speaking of free cash flow, let\u2019s turn to the next slide.\n\nYou can see free cash flow generation has really accelerated since we completed our transformation into a pure-play pharma company end of 2023 and also finalized our transformation program, Transformation for Growth program, which we announced April 22. This has been a focus for us to, of course, ensure that not only core operating income increases, but appropriately also free cash flow, so high quality of core earnings and strong free cash flow generation. And in fact, we have generated more cash than we did as combined businesses, be it with Sandoz or a few years back, even with Alcon. This gives us also ample capacity, of course, to reinvest in the business pursue bolt-on deals and return attractive \u2014 attractively to our shareholders while growing dividends and buybacks.\n\nThis brings me to my next slide. So we continue to execute in line with our shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy, which balances the priorities I mentioned. We invest over $9 billion in R&D in 2024 and completed more than 30 bolt-on deals over the last two years to strengthen our pipeline, particularly in the area of neuroscience RLT and renal. With respect to returning capital to shareholders, we remain committed consistently growing our dividend in Swiss francs per share and completing our ongoing share buyback, which has about $5.4 billion still to be executed in 2025. Now on to the next slide, please, to the dividend. So we are really pleased to propose the 28th consecutive dividend increase to CHF 3.50 per share. an increase of 6% in Swiss francs and 20 after the prior few years of 10 per year.\n\nAs you know, we did not rebase our dividend for the spin-off of Sandoz, no Alcon. So this represents really an attractive, consistent growth over time, in line with our commitment to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 27. For full year 2025, we expect continued strong sales growth with margin expansion, with sales growing mid to high single digit and core operating income growing high single to low double digits. Embedded in our guidance with the financial planning assumption that Tasigna, Promacta and Entresto USgenerics entry occurs in the middle of and I\u2019ll give some more detail on expected half 1 versus half 2 dynamics on the next slide. To complete our full year guidance, please note that we expect core net financial expenses to be around $1 billion, and our core tax rate to be around 16% to 16.5%.\n\nOn Slide 28, we have shown illustratively how we expect half 1 and half 2 dynamics should generics for Entresto, Tasigna and Promacta enter in U.S. in mid of 2025 as per our financial planning assumption. Overall, we expect continued strong volume growth from priority brands in 2025. In half one, we expect sales to grow low double digit, while we expect, of course, a softer half due to the impact of the three potential generic entries, with low to mid-single-digit sales growth. Likewise, we expect half 1 Corp Inc. to grow the high teens versus low to mid-single-digit growth in half 2. And finally, let\u2019s have a quick look at the currencies as they always move around. And if late January rates were to prevail for the remainder of 2025, we would expect the full year currency impact to be a negative 2% on sales and a negative three percentage points on core operating income.\n\nAs a reminder, we always provide an estimated impact of exchange rates on our results on a monthly basis on our website. And with that, I hand back to Vas.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Terrific. Thank you, Harry. So coming the final slide, and really, just in summary, continued strong business momentum in quarter four, one of the best financial performances in the company\u2019s history met and exceeded our full year guidance. We\u2019re advancing our pipeline, including new approvals, but importantly, readouts for assets that will fuel our mid to long-term growth and really ensuring we advance the mid-stage pipeline and expect to continue strong sales growth with margin expansion in 2025, as Harry outlined. And we remain on track to deliver our mid-term guidance of 5% plus sales growth through 2029. So with that, Sharon, we can open the line for questions.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Novartis A G (NYSE:NVS) Follow Novartis A G (NYSE:NVS) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question. And your first question comes from the line of Florent Cespedes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nFlorent Cespedes: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. A quick one on the on the guidance, as the guidance is a little bit better than expected top line, but also on the margin. And as Entresto is a very profitable product and that you will lose percent in Europe generics from the mid of this year, I was just wondering if you could elaborate, i.e., what are the \u2013 where we should see some pressure? And where you will have some growth that will offset the generic impact on the P&L and on the top line? Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thanks, Florent. Harry?\n\nHarry Kirsch: Yes. Thank you, Florent. I mean, in the end, it all starts with the top line, as we know, in the pharma businesses. So having our mid to high single-digit sales growth, given the strength of our growth brands and launches, that\u2019s a good starting base. And also our other products are quite profitable. Now, of course, profitability does vary by the different brands. But overall, with the mid to high single-digit sales growth and our ongoing resource allocation and productivity programs, we are very confident that with that, we will have also some moderate margin increase, right? So from that standpoint, and I laid out half one, we will be more, obviously. And if these generics would enter half two would be basically pretty much low to mid-single digits, both on top and bottom line.\n\nThat\u2019s fine. But, overall, very confident in that sales growth with these assumptions as well as this \u2014 the underlying volume growth when you look at it, 14%, 15% volume, and then it depends a bit pricing was quite neutral last year, and then it depends simply on generic assumptions there. But also with a 5%, very confident the 5% CAGR on the five years, and then, of course, from 38.7% to 40% plus, it\u2019s not that far in 2027. But we have good ongoing productivity and therefore, especially on SG&A with good resource allocation and the launches are mostly in areas where we have already strong presence, we would expect SG&A to grow below sales growth as you have also seen in the prior two years.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thank you, Florent. Next question.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Simon Baker from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Baker: Thank you for taking my question. And it\u2019s, kind, of a continuation from Florent\u2019s question. Just mindful of the lots of exclusivity potentially for Entresto later in the year. Historically, you have been very, very good at managing gross margin through patent expires. I just wonder, Harry, I know you don\u2019t guide on gross margin, if you could just give us any commentary around the resilience of the gross margin in 2025 in light of that event? Thanks so much.\n\nHarry Kirsch: Thanks, Simon. So, as I mentioned on prior calls and IR road shows, the further margin improvement, I expect to basically fully come from SG&A as we \u2014 with good resource allocation, basically slightly grow at G&A, but significantly below sales growth, right? The gross margin comes a little bit under pressure as we lose small molecules where we don\u2019t pay royalties with either small molecules where we pay some royalties or larger molecules. But \u2014 all of that will be more than offset by the SG&A efficiencies. And then, of course, also our colleagues in manufacturing and supply chain continue to work on very good productivity programs and have cost reduction programs on each of our products in a very impressive way. of course, never compromising quality of supply, very high 99.5% plus supply customer service levels. And with that, a little bit pressure on the gross margin because of increasing royalties but by far, compensated from SG&A efficiencies.\n\nSimon Baker: Thanks so much.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thanks Simon. Next question?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Weston from UBS. Please go ahead. Hello Matthew, are you on mute? Due to no response, I\u2019ll move to the next question. One moment please. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Parkes from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Parkes: Thanks for taking my question. I think I\u2019ll take one on the Huntington\u2019s program. Obviously, a huge unmet medical need, terrible disease, but there have been some of the failures in in that area the past. So, I\u2019m just wondering what makes you more confident in the approach what you\u2019ve learned from those past experiences? And to what degree do you think the PIVOT HD trial will derisk the probability of success given it\u2019s a slowly progressive disease in the studies relatively short? Or will we still be seeing it as a high-risk program? That would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks, Richard. And I think as you\u2019re aware, the goal here is to take down mutant Huntington, but at a level where you\u2019re not taking it so low that you have some \u2014 you have adverse consequences from reducing Huntington\u2019s too much. I mean, generally speaking, the feeling in the field if you want to reduce mutant huntingtin protein by 30% to 50%. And then alongside that biomarker, you want to see clinical signs of improvement. So, I think that their interim results, PTC has shown the relevant mHTT lowering. They\u2019ve seen some signals of clinical efficacy and a very good safety profile without some of the peripheral neuropathies that we saw in our own programs. So, I think all of that taken together makes the program looks like it\u2019s headed in the right direction.\n\nI think the big question, of course, is thus reducing a mutant Huntington at that level lead to a large enough or important enough clinical benefit that would lead to most importantly helping patients, but also regulatory approval. I think we\u2019ll see how the Phase 2b study reads out. Obviously, if it\u2019s a very compelling result it might enable us to take it forward for a filing. And if not, we would then need to go to a full pivotal study and then really answer the question does reducing mutant Huntington at that level lead to the clinical benefits that one would hope. So, it\u2019s been \u2014 I think PTC has developed a product in all the right ways. It\u2019s got good dialogue with the regulators. So, we\u2019re hopeful that we see a good result on the Phase 2b study, and then we\u2019ll take over and run those Phase 3 studies.\n\nAnd hopefully, we can bring an important first disease-modifying therapy to these patients who badly need it.\n\nRichard Parkes: Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thanks, Richard. Next question, operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Emily Field from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nEmily Field: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one was just a clarification question from the first question that was asked by Florent. If you could just confirm the contribution of favorable gross to net adjustments to sales in Q4 2024? And then I just wanted to ask a question about Pluvicto. I mean, I know the guidance has been not to expect significant sales growth until the additional indication of PSMAfore was added. But was there any particular driver between the sequential decline in the U.S. quarter-over-quarter. And would you expect any of the DTC and promotional efforts that you\u2019ve been putting in place to have an impact on sales ahead of the PSMAfore approval? Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks, Emily. So back on the guidance, Harry?\n\nHarry Kirsch: Yes. So I think your question was about the gross to net and quarter four impacting the guidance. So let me try and then you can tell me if it was sufficient. So we had a growth of 16% in quarter four, as you have seen in constant currency. About three points of that was due to true-ups of gross to net for prior quarters of 2024, so underlying 13%. The full year sales by brand in 2024 is basically undistorted. The underlying growth for 2024 is 12% as you see in the report. So if you want to have a basis, it\u2019s best take the full year 2024 sales, and these are undistorted overall. Now, of course, that has lifted the overall 2024 sales and we have, of course, computed that, if you will, into our 2025 gross to net calculation.\n\nAnd a key element of this as really Medicaid utilization is continuously reducing to pre-pandemic levels. Now, we do not assume that it gets lower and lower, we basically assume that in 2025, we see what we have seen at the latest for 2024, which is a reasonable assumption. So we never take risky assumptions on gross to net. It\u2019s obviously a big part of money, like $16 million to $20 billion of sales is we have like 50% of our U.S. list prices be gross to net. But from that standpoint, it has lifted this more favorable gross to net situation for 2024, our sales level. And from that, we expect to grow mid to high single digit. I hope that clarifies your question.\n\nVas Narasimhan: And then Emily, thank you. On Pluvicto, when you look at it in Q4, it was really in line with what we had expected. In Q3, we had the benefit of some onetime adjustments in France and Germany. But then when you overall look at where we had guided for Q4, it\u2019s roughly \u2013 exactly with where we had expected. Now I think looking ahead, we are hopeful to see further progress in the VISION population, but I think that will be not a rapid increase. I think we\u2019ve already gotten to 40% NBRx share and that we\u2019ll need to get to steady gains by expanding further and further the number of treating sites for VISION population. But it is possible certainly that the DTC will start to have an impact that we kicked off in quarter three of last year.\n\nUsually, it takes six months for DTC to have an impact, so it would be around February, March of this year, we might see some impact on the VISION population. But really, our organizational focus is PSMAfore launch. I think now that we have a really compelling rPFS data. We have very compelling data on distant mets. We have now the OS unadjusted for crossover at 0.91, I think everything now is a good setup to go into a population that\u2019s three times larger, really ensure the sites that are already using Pluvicto now fully maximize their capacity to get as many patients to benefit from the therapy as possible and also accelerate our efforts to get even more sites ready in the community. We\u2019ve launched a number of initiatives. We\u2019re launching a few more over the course of the quarter to really simplify and hopefully get clinicians very comfortable even in the community oncology setting, providing radiopharmaceuticals or radioligand therapy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where I think we\u2019re going to see the next uplift for the brand. Next question, operator?\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Weston, UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Weston: Thank you. I don\u2019t know what happened earlier. It\u2019s a question for Harry. And it\u2019s again about guidance, Harry, but particularly about the impact of Medicare Part D reform on what you\u2019ve assumed within your growth. So, one of the questions we\u2019ve had a lot this morning from investors is how can you be so confident given that you have a very large oral oncology portfolio, which is assumed to be used largely in the Medicare Part D population. So what have you assumed in your outlook are the puts and takes around that portfolio from that new reform?\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks Matthew. I\u2019ll actually take that one. Overall, we expect a modest headwind from the Part D reforms, and we fully factored that into our guidance. The two brands where we see the biggest impact of the reforms, primarily paying into the \u2014 to cover in the catastrophic phase or for Cosentyx and Kisqali. But overall, when we look at it, we\u2019ve factored in the expected modeled headwinds from that. We look at the potential volume uplift, which we don\u2019t really put a lot of stake in yet because we\u2019d really like to see how that ultimately unfolds over the course of this year. And we see a modest headwind, which we think we can manage fully, and that\u2019s incorporated into our guidance. I think we\u2019ll see. I mean I think in the midterm, the policy should lead to volume uplifts, more patients staying on therapy, which is why the industry wanted a 2,000 out-of-pocket cap and that would ultimately, of course, improve patient compliance, staying on their medicines and ultimately impact \u2014 positively impact their sales in the coming years.\n\nIn this first year, I think it\u2019s hard to put much credence on that. But beyond that, we feel very comfortable with the modeling that we did. We think we\u2019ve taken appropriately conservative assumptions.\n\nMatthew Weston: Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Next question operator. Thanks Matthew.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Vosser: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Question on Kisqali. Looking at the NBRx share in metastatic, it stayed at sort of 50% for a number of quarters and maybe a couple of years now. So, I\u2019m just wondering what it takes to change that. You have a superior product. Does the sort of halo effect from the adjuvant allow you to get more accounts on board? Just can we see that displacement of Ibrance, just your thoughts? Thanks very much.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks, Richard. I think the Kisqali shares really started to gain in the first part of last year. After we had the early breast cancer readout and led to a lot more confidence overall in the brand as well as the NCCN guidelines further supporting the use of Kisqali. I think now we are hopeful that with the early breast cancer readout and the opportunity to have a single medicine for all patients within a clinic that we can drive the overall share \u2014 NBRx share higher than 52%. We do have a cap probably somewhere around 75% to 80% just because of some of the payer dynamics and some of the contraindications for Kisqali. But, of course, our goal is to get from that 52% as high as we can to that 75% over the coming years.\n\nOf course, we have plenty of time now to do that. And I think we should see steady gains over time on that one. But the biggest focus for us right now is maximizing the opportunity in the node-zero and node-one patients without risk factors where Kisqali is uniquely labeled and our competitors are not. And our ability to get those patients diagnosed and then ultimately on therapy, it\u2019s such a sizable population and the size of \u2014 obviously, the public health benefit we can deliver, that\u2019s core focus for us overall. And then with that, of course, we should see metastatic gains as well.\n\nRichard Vosser: Okay. Thanks.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Next question, operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Graham Parry, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nGraham Parry: Great. Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s just on Entresto, just wanting to get perhaps a little bit more detail on the dynamics that are factored into the guidance for 2025. So what sales progression are you looking at worldwide and in the U.S.? And in the U.S., do you see a benefit in the first half of the year from don\u2019t hold discount removal? And to what extent does that offset some of the generic decline you should get in the second half of the year? And on generics, how confident you can hold off Entresto generics until 16th of July, and the court filings seems to suggest that MSN is trying every, which way to launch at the moment and there\u2019s only one appeal court stay in place, blocking them from doing that? And are you confident they haven\u2019t shipped any product at all in that narrow window there wasn\u2019t actually stay in place a couple of weeks ago. Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks, Graham. On the overall dynamics, Harry.\n\nHarry Kirsch: Yes, overall, we would expect continued good growth of Entresto until from a forecast assumption standpoint, middle of the year. Of course, our colleagues in the legal and IP department will do everything to appropriately defend further patents, but that\u2019s for now the financial forecast assumption. And so we would see growth on that. And yes, you are right, there is some favorability from the Medicare Part D design on Entresto as it is not a very high-priced specialty product, so very positive dynamics expected until LOE would happen in the U.S. And then, of course, what \u2014 actually, when we look at the multiyear outlook and forecast, Entresto is one of the products that\u2019s really under-forecasted versus our model from the consensus due to the fact that Europe, at least end of 2026, Japan 2030.\n\nAnd then we have a large tail end product of large \u2014 even small molecules in emerging markets. So also there quite a lot of, let\u2019s say, remainder of sales because of Japan should be a blockbuster and then emerging markets once even end of 2026 Europe would see generic entries.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thanks, Harry. And of course, we\u2019re pursuing all options in Europe and Japan to ensure we maximize the exclusivity for Entresto in those geographies, and there are certainly options that might materialize. Now I think on the U.S. dynamic to our knowledge and our best understanding, there were no products shipped into the channel in those few hours. The stay is in place. MSN has requested a reconsideration of the Circuit Court\u2019s stay. And, of course, we\u2019ll monitor that situation, but we believe it\u2019s very clear that the spirit of the law very much is that we did our pediatric exclusivity studies and those pediatric \u2014 that pediatric six-month extension on the combination pattern, which has been upheld should be respected.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s our very clear position. We, of course, continue to litigate out the amorphous complex patents as well as the lawsuit that we have that the FDA should not have approved products with a carve-out on the dosing regimen on the label. So, those court cases also continue to go on over the course of these months and we\u2019ll see how it unfolds. Our best estimate at the moment is to give you that forecasting guidance of middle of the year. And if anything changes, either we or I think IPD will let you know probably IPD sooner than us, but we do the best we can. So, thank you very much Graham. Next question.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Etzer Darout from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEtzer Darout: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of inbound this morning. Just wondering if you had any maybe additional commentary you could provide on the push out of the Horizon Phase 3 and maybe what could be driving that the event sort of rate dynamic relative to your initial event rate assumption? Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes, thanks Etzer. So, this an event-driven study. We\u2019ve been modeling the event rates. I think I\u2019ve also heard a few questions. There\u2019s been no interim analysis of \u2014 no interim analysis drove this. This is just event rate modeling on the blinded event rates that we saw and we expect now to reach the final number of events, which is, I think, always preferable for a cardiovascular study that we need to ensure is adequately powered in the first part of next year. We don\u2019t have a good unnecessarily guess. I mean, in general, I would say cardiovascular outcome studies have been trending to lower event rates under time. Over time, it\u2019s important to note that in these studies, we very rigorously ensure that all patients are at their appropriate treatment levels for LDL lowering to ensure that we can isolate the impact as FDA assets of the Lp(a) lowering therapy.\n\nSo, quite \u2014 it could be the background rate. It could be \u2014 the drug is working. That\u2019s always our hope, but we can\u2019t be sure of that as well. So, we\u2019ll see over the course of \u2014 we\u2019ll see next year at the end, how the study reads out. But we remain very confident that the drug is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do. Mechanism of action is clear. When we look at the profile of the patients that we enrolled, this is the high-risk patient population we wanted to enroll high levels of Lp(a), but then with the lowering that we are seeing \u2014 that we expect to see that, that should lead to the cardiovascular risk reduction that we hoped for. So, that\u2019s the best guidance I can give you at this point in time.\n\nEtzer Darout: Great. Thank you. appreciate the color.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Next question operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of James Quigley from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Quigley: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Going on the guidance, unfortunately. Harry, would you be able to sort of split the guidance out between volumes, generic impact and pricing, presumably, pricing is close to zero or slightly negative. But super helpful if you could give us an idea of how that breaks down? And then secondly, on the slide, where you break out the half one versus half two, obviously, the second half takes a hit because of generics. Where would that land if you didn\u2019t have the generic impact and is low to mid-single-digits, say, a sort of sensible exit rate for the second half of your guidance out to the end of 2029? I appreciate that you don\u2019t guide on the individual years, but just some color would be useful.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks James. Harry?\n\nHarry Kirsch: Yes. Okay. So, let\u2019s give a try. So, overall, we expect continued, if not slightly increased volume growth due to our launches and continued very good execution from a volume standpoint, Pricing probably will be a little bit more pressure. Usually, we have on a year like 1% to 2% points negative. Last year, in 2024, we had flat, but there\u2019s a little bit of growth to net pressure was due to Medicare point redesign, but nothing dramatic there. And the key impact will be an increased generic according to these forecast assumptions. Now for the U.S., we have taken simply analogs for small molecules in the different categories, cardiovascular as well onco. And that\u2019s what you can model yourself. Now if these three would not happen, I would expect the first half to look like the second half. Unfortunately, there is not an unreasonable assumption, that will happen. So that\u2019s why we carefully have modeled this.\n\nJames Quigley: Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Thanks, James. Next question, operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks for the question. So my question is on ianalumab. You guys have Sjogren\u2019s data coming this year in my understanding as well as some additional Phase 2 and 3 data sets. Where are you most excited about the opportunity for ianalumab, which strike me that Sjogren\u2019s is the highest unmet medical need where even just a positive study would gain substantial utilization. Just trying to get better understanding of how you\u2019re thinking about the market opportunity in Sjogren\u2019s and then more broadly for ianalumab? Thanks so much.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Thanks, Seamus. We are very excited about ianalumab\u2019s potential, both in hematology and in immunology. So in immunology, clearly, the Sjogren\u2019s will be the first key foundational readout. We\u2019re studying it in the roughly 40% of patients who have systemic manifestations of Sjogren\u2019s disease. In the Phase 2b study, we demonstrated, for the first time, significant improvements in the SDI, which is focused on the systemic manifestations, including improvements in areas such as fatigue and other physician assessed parameters. And so if we can get a positive read, we\u2019ll try to get as broad a label as we can. And we\u2019re also assessing should we also study the medicine over time in those patients, the remaining 60% of patients, a subset of them who primarily have symptom manifestations without the systemic manifestations.\n\nSo I think there\u2019s significant opportunity in HS. Then, of course, following up on that, we have the systemic lupus and lupus nephritis studies as well running and as well you note, the Phase 2b in hydrodenitis. Alongside that, I think while there is a reasonable standards of care in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, ITP, this medicine also has the potential with its mechanism to be an improvement in second line and first line ITP and that we also have a readout in 2025 as well. And so that would, obviously, enable us to start the process in hematology. We have worked through ensuring we have a different dose levels as well so we can manage the different indications in immunology and hematology from a price standpoint. So taken together, I mean, you have six Phase 3 studies across the board already running by ianalumab, multiple Phase 2s.\n\nSo assuming they go our way, this could be a very significant medicine, probably underappreciated overall. Next question, operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Naresh Chouhan from Intrinsic Health. Please go ahead.\n\nNaresh Chouhan: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on OAV please. So, Cosentyx is currently modeling very little, if anything at all for OAV101. Can you help us think through the bolus opportunity and the speed of ramp up? We think it could be a blockbuster by 2027. Is that unreasonable? And how do you think about the speed of ramp-up? Thanks.\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. I think \u2014 so Naresh, it\u2019s obviously early days from our standpoint. But certainly, with \u2014 I can use the analog of what we saw with Zolgensma. And certainly, in that case, we did see a very fast ramp. And then to the steady state and then we stayed at that steady state. I think it was two, three years until we got to the steady state. And that\u2019s generally what we would expect, I think, in the case of gene therapies. And so I think we\u2019ll see with OAV, the dynamic is obviously a little bit different because many of these patients will need to be switched patients. But I think when you look at the competitive set that we\u2019re going up against. You have a competitor that requires quarterly intrathecal administrations into the spinal cord, which is quite challenging for patients over time.\n\nAnd also, patients often have malformations and the deformities that happened in the spine as a result of the repeated injections. And then the other competitor of medicine was not tested with the standard-of-care Hammersmith score, which is the gold standard, which is what we used. And I think our hope is by going to the physician and patient population saying, look, you have a one-time gene therapy using the gold standard Hammersmith score demonstrating statistical significant improvement using that score with a very expected safety profile that could be very compelling for a large number of patients. That\u2019s the approach we\u2019re going to take in rolling the medicine out and I\u2019m hopeful that it will surprise people as well because I think there is the opportunity as we guided, this could be overall a $3 billion-plus medicine over time.\n\nAnd that\u2019s very much the goal. And I think also, of course, with gene therapies, we have the opportunity to have medicines that are \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 at least our current understanding, be difficult to face real generic erosion. So these become medicines that kind of stay in the long run in our portfolio. So, thanks Naresh. Next question operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Le Berrigaud from Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Le Berrigaud: Yes, hello. Do you hear me?\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes. Go ahead Eric.\n\nEric Le Berrigaud: Yes. Hi. Again, on guidance, but this time on the midterm guidance and trying to put the 2025 guidance in the context of midterm guidance. Since you implemented this midterm guidance, you systematically beat and raise. 2023 was much higher, 2024 was much higher. And then we thought that maybe the transition with the significant LOEs in 2025, 2026 would be the reason for the midterm guidance to be lower than what you achieved. But now in 2025, you\u2019re guiding for mid to high single-digit, which is again higher than the midterm guidance. And so if we think that 2026 will very much look like 2025 because it\u2019s a 50/50, mid mid-2025, mid-2026 impact and then 2027, 2028 should see some rebound with no significant LOE.\n\nIt becomes hard to understand why the midterm guidance is not more, let\u2019s say, higher or \u2014 let\u2019s say, to articulate things. So, maybe something is missing, but could you put that in some context or just the global policy of under-promise and overdeliver? Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: No, certainly not a global policy. We do our best to give you the midpoint estimate of where we think things will go. And then, of course, if we do better, and over the last two years, I think our performance, operating performance has been outstanding. I see two-plus years now. And I think that\u2019s part of the reason you\u2019ve seen the consistent beats and raises. I think certainly, over the coming years, we\u2019ll see. I mean, we, of course, will update over time. I mean the 2026, we have the full year impact, of course, of these generic entries. And then we\u2019ll clear them and then accelerate growth from there. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position at this moment to change our mid-term guidance. But obviously, if we consistently perform at a higher level than the 5% mid-term guidance, we\u2019d have to reconsider it.\n\nBut I think right now, our focus is delivering 2025 per plan, getting these launches up on the trajectory, closing the current gap that consensus has to our view, which I think is roughly two points 2024 to 2029. So I think, Eric, you\u2019re there, but some of your colleagues are not. And so I think that getting that gap closed by showing confidence in Kisqali, in Leqvio, in Pluvicto, in Scemblix, in Fabhalta with the remibrutinib launch with some of the pipeline delivery, continuing delivering on Cosentyx, and then, of course, we\u2019ll reconsider the mid-term outlook as appropriate. Next question, operator.\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Richard Parkes from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\nRichard Parkes: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. It\u2019s just on Cosentyx, the competitive environment. We\u2019ve now had Benzalex on the market for a year or so. I believe that has some recent formulary wins and obviously launching in the HS indication. So just wondering how that competitive environment is playing out and what you anticipate in your guidance? And maybe if you could quantify the opportunity for Cosentyx and new indications that you outlined, GCA and PMR? And then finally, I\u2019d like to thank you for the Lp(a) test at your management day because given it was minus borderline, I\u2019ve now started on a statin. So I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: That\u2019s great to hear, Richard. I\u2019m glad we could help. On Cosentyx, we had 25% growth this year. So I think that shows the robust growth profile of the brand. In terms of the competitor entries, when you look at our formulary position, it\u2019s as we expect, we\u2019ve had to give the appropriate level of adjustments on our rebates, but we\u2019ve maintained very good formulary position. We see very good performance in Asian markets such as China as well as continued good performance in Europe. In Asia specifically, we think our profile of having very good flare resolution where we showed very compelling data on flare, on pain, I think on itch on some of these, I think this really gives us a very compelling data set. And given the long history of safety with Cosentyx, we a very competitive profile to hopefully maintain that 60% plus NBRx share that we have.\n\nWe believe in HS, Cosentyx to be over $1 billion medicine globally. Now for GCA and PMR, our current estimates are $500 million plus for each one of these. I think the question, of course, we\u2019ll have to see. I think originally for HS, we thought this would be $500 million to $750 million, and we delivered that almost in the first year. So I think we\u2019re learning as we go, as we get into these new indications. And as we have a better sense from launching of, of course, positive data and then launching, we can, of course, update over time.\n\nEric Le Berrigaud: Thank you.\n\nVas Narasimhan: And then, I think are there more questions operator?\n\nOperator: We have one more sir. And your next question comes from Florent Cespedes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nFlorent Cespedes: Good afternoon again. Thank you for taking my follow-up question. This time, not on guidance, but on the pipeline. For you Vas, as is now expected in 2026, and it was supposed to be the big Phase 3 readout. Now, on the list of the products that will readout this year that will be the Phase 3, please, could you share with us which is or which are the most meaningful one, please?\n\nVas Narasimhan: Yes, absolutely, Florent. So, I think there\u2019s a couple of things I\u2019d say. First, ianalumab is a key readout. And I think we\u2019ve already highlighted that both Sjogren\u2019s and second line ITP, both of these will be, I think, really important for the profile and opportunity in ianalumab and also hopefully give a read-through of what we might be able to do in lupus, in lupus nephritis in a frontline ITP amongst others. In addition, we\u2019re going to have the readout of Pluvicto in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, which will further create a patient population that\u2019s as large as the VISION \u2014 sorry, the PSMAfore population. And I think that would be another leg to build Pluvicto out to that guidance that we\u2019ve given of $6 billion plus over time.\n\nIn addition, you\u2019re going to have, I think, importantly, the remibrutinib food allergy Phase 2b readout, which will then enable us to move rapidly for the next third indication. We hope remibrutinib on top of CSU and CINDU. I would say for remibrutinib, we expect to file soon and then we do currently intend to use a priority review voucher. And we do believe that remibrutinib in CSU is going to be bigger than the markets expect. And I think the opportunity here in the U.S. and around the world have an oral medicine that can address such a symptomatic disease within two weeks of therapy is something we\u2019re quite excited about. So, we\u2019re very much focused on that launch as well. And then, of course, on Slide 33, you see a long list of other things.\n\nBut I think those would be the big ones that I would highlight that would really move the needle for this year.\n\nFlorent Cespedes: Thank you very much.\n\nVas Narasimhan: I think that\u2019s it. So, thank you all very much for joining. We look forward to seeing you in various settings over the course of the coming quarter and then again at the Q1 earnings call. Have a great day.\n\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Novartis AG ( ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 20% over three years, well in excess of the market decline (1.5%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 10% in the last year, including dividends.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nNovartis was able to grow its EPS at 10% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nWe know that Novartis has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Novartis, it has a TSR of 42% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nNovartis shareholders gained a total return of 10% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 5% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Swiss exchanges.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

            "content": "After signing 30 deals in 2024, Novartis is not done, CEO Vas Narasimhan said on a Friday morning media call. The Swiss pharma will continue to be on the lookout for bolt-on acquisitions as it sets the stage for long-term growth.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our strategy to look for primarily bolt-on acquisitions that we think will bolster our growth in the 2030 and beyond period,\u201d Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said during a Friday morning media call to discuss the pharma\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report. \u201cLast year we signed 30 deals\u2014we believe the most in the industry\u2014mostly early-stage deals.\u201d That volume, according to Narasimhan, demonstrates the company\u2019s philosophy when it comes to M&A.\n\nNovartis\u2019 net sales surged 16% year-over-year at constant currencies to bring in $13.1 billion in the most recent quarter. This figure comfortably tops the $12.82 billion consensus estimate, as per SeekingAlpha. For the full year 2024, Novartis saw a 12% bump in net sales to $50.32 billion.\n\nKey drivers in the quarter included Novartis\u2019 heart failure drug Entresto, which saw sales spike 34% from the same period in 2023 to bring in nearly $2.2 billion. The anti-IgG1 antibody Cosentyx was also a top-performing asset for the pharma, hitting almost $1.6 billion in sales. Multiple sclerosis therapy Kesimpta and breast cancer treatment Kisqalimade made $950 million and $902 million in the quarter, respectively.\n\nIn an investor note on Friday, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said that Novartis\u2019 Q4 beat came \u201cdespite softness in some key products,\u201d including prostate cancer radiotherapy Pluvicto, which earned $351 million in the quarter.\n\nEntresto is facing a strong generic threat, with at least four copycats approved by the FDA. Of these, the one developed by MSN Pharmaceuticals has been at the center of a fierce legal fight, with Novartis seeking to block its entry into the U.S. market. Most recently, the pharma secured a last-minute win when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit earlier this month temporary blocked MSN Pharma from commercializing its generic while the case remains open.\n\nOn the media call, CFO Harry Kirsch said that the company will \u201ccontinue to defend\u201d Entresto\u2019s exclusivity in the coming year.\n\nNovartis emerged as one of pharma\u2019s most prolific dealmakers in 2024. Last month, the pharma put forth $1 billion in upfront payments and up to $1.9 billion in milestone commitments to license PTC Therapeutics\u2019 Huntington\u2019s disease drug. Just weeks earlier, Novartis bought California-based biotech Kate Therapeutics in an acquisition that could reach $1.1 billion in value.\n\nOther standout Novartis deals in 2024 include the $2.2 billion molecular glue partnership with Monte Rosa in October, the nearly $2.9 billion expansion of its existing PeptiDream pact in April, the potential $1 billion agreement with Flagship\u2019s Generate:Biomedicines in September and the more than $4 billion contract with Shanghai Argo in January.\n\nShares of Novartis climbed over 2% in pre-market trading Friday morning, reaching $106.98 compared to $104.75 at close the previous day.",

Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSwiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis on Friday reported better-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter and met its own guidance over the full-year stretch. Fourth-quarter net sales rose 16% on a constant currency basis to $13.2 billion, compared to the $12.795 billion estimated by analysts in an LSEG poll. Quarterly adjusted core operating income came in at $4.86 billion versus the $4.23 billion expected. Shares pared back some of their earlier gains to end the trading session 1.9% higher. For 2024, net sales rose 12% on a constant currency basis to $50.32 billion, versus $50.47 billion forecasted. Full-year core operating income increased 22% to $19.5 billion versus the $17.02 billion forecasted. The company said the sales growth was driven primarily by its blockbuster heart-failure drug Entresto and its arthritis medication Cosentyx.\n\nwatch now\n\nNovartis had raised its 2024 earnings guidance for the third consecutive quarter in October, saying it expected full-year net sales to grow in the \"low double-digit\" percentages and core operating income to grow in the 'high teens\" percentages. CEO Vas Narasimhan said the results marked a positive early signal since implementing a strategic overhaul in 2023 to position Novartis as a \"pure-play innovative medicines company.\" \"When you look at the momentum we've got in the business we really feel like we've got the growth drivers to take care of us through 2025,\" Narasimhan told CNBC's Carolin Roth.\n\n2025 outlook",

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Novartis and AbbVie, as well as updates from Biogen, Merck & Co. and Sanofi that you may have missed.\n\nNovartis on Friday reported fourth quarter and full year results that beat analyst forecasts, driven by sales growth for a range of products including the heart drug Entresto, cholesterol-lowering medicine Leqvio and breast cancer therapy Kisqali. Net sales rose from about $45.4 billion to $50.3 billion between 2023 and 2024, with net income also climbing from $8.6 billion to just over $11.9 billion. Novartis said net sales should grow by mid- to high-single digits in 2025, an \u201cambitious\u201d projection given the coming patent expiration for Entresto this year, wrote Stifel analyst Eric Le Berrigaud. The numbers are \u201cthe result of a wise strategy of focus on key brands and key markets\u201d that \u201cis paying off,\u201d he wrote. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nSales of AbbVie\u2019s autoimmune drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq are making up for the declines in Humira revenue due to biosimilar competition. Alongside fourth quarter earnings Friday, AbbVie said it now expects annual Skyrizi and Rinvoq sales to reach $31 billion by 2027, $4 billion more than it forecast a year ago. By that time, Skyrizi will account for $20 billion annually \u2014 roughly what Humira earned at its peak \u2014 and Rinvoq $11 billion, AbbVie said. Those estimates surpassed consensus estimates of $29 billion in combined sales by 2027, William Blair analyst Matt Phipps wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie\u2019s revenue in 2024 climbed to $56 billion, a 4% increase over 2023 and ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Shares rose about 7% in Friday morning trading. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nDaiichi Sankyo CEO Sunao Manabe will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Hiroyuki Okuzawa as head of the Japanese drugmaker on April 1, the company said Friday. Manabe has steered Daiichi since 2019, overseeing its rise as a leader in the development of antibody-drug conjugates. The company has struck a series of lucrative ADC-focused alliances with AstraZeneca and Merck & Co. under his watch, and seen the cancer drug Enhertu become a blockbuster medicine. Manabe will transition to executive chair once Okuzawa, who has been with the company since 1986, takes over. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nThe European Commission won\u2019t yet approve Eisai and Biogen\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s drug Leqembi, instead asking its drugs regulator to first review new safety information that became available after the committee endorsed the drug in November, Biogen said Friday. That regulator, the European Medicines Agency, had previously found Leqembi\u2019s risks outweighed its benefits before changing course after the companies appealed. The EMA will now seek, at a February meeting, an updated opinion on potential safety considerations and monitoring measures. \u201cThough not ideal,\u201d the request \u201cshould not necessarily lead to an opinion reversal\u201d given the strict risk management protocols currently in place, wrote RBC Capital Markets Brian Abrahams. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nMerck stopped early another trial of its new lung-disease drug Winrevair because of evidence suggesting its clear benefits for people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The trial, called Hyperion, tested Winrevair and background therapy against placebo and additional treatment in people with what\u2019s known as functional Class 2 or 3 PAH, when the disease limits activity because of shortness of breath. As Winrevair already proved it worked in a study of more severely ill people with PAH, trial monitors decided it would be unethical for the placebo group in the Hyperion study not to receive treatment. Trial data will be released later this year and discussed at a future medical meeting. Launched last March, Winrevair recorded sales of $219 million through Sept. 30. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nSanofi on Thursday said its antibody shot for respiratory syncytial virus, Beyfortus, became a blockbuster medicine in its first full year on the market. Sanofi\u2019s 2024 earnings report showed the drug generated sales of 1.7 billion euros, or about $1.8 billion, and 841 million euros in the fourth quarter alone. Sanofi attributed the recent uptick mostly to sales in Europe. More broadly, though, Beyfortus\u2019 launch accelerated once the company ramped up manufacturing to address supply constraints. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado",

However, longer-term trends tell a different story \u2014 AbbVie stock is aligned closely against its 50-day ($175.33) SMA and below its 200-day ($178.77) SMA, suggesting lingering downside pressure. The MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) indicator at a negative 0.89 reinforces this bearish bias, while the RSI (relative strength index) at 50.39 indicates neutral momentum.\n\nOverall, AbbVie is struggling for direction, with slight selling pressure keeping a lid on any breakout potential. A strong earnings beat could push the stock past key resistance levels, but the current setup suggests AbbVie is vulnerable to further consolidation.\n\nNovartis: Riding A Bullish Wave\n\nNovartis, on the other hand, is trending decisively higher.\n\nNovartis is trading above its short-term and mid-range moving averages, with the eight-day ($101.27), 20-day ($99.57), and 50-day ($100.44) SMAs all acting as support. The MACD at 0.68 points to bullish momentum, while the RSI at 63.61 shows strength without being overbought.\n\nHowever, the stock remains below its 200-day SMA ($106.77), leaving some room for caution.\n\nInvestor Implications\n\nHeading into earnings, Novartis holds the technical advantage, displaying a stronger bullish structure and upward momentum. AbbVie, meanwhile, remains stuck in a range, needing a catalyst to break higher.\n\nInvestors should watch key resistance levels \u2014 AbbVie above $177 and Novartis above $106 \u2014 for signs of further movement post-earnings.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Romix Image via Shutterstock",

We also achieved important innovation milestones, including new approvals and readouts for many of the assets that will fuel our growth over the mid- to long-term. With the momentum we are seeing in the business, we expect to continue our strong sales growth with margin expansion in 2025 and we remain on track to deliver on our mid-term guidance. Looking ahead, we are focused on executing against our pipeline, including 15 submission-enabling readouts over the coming years and more than 30 assets with the potential to drive differentiated growth over the long term. We remain balanced in our capital allocation approach and committed to creating sustainable value for shareholders.\u201d\n\nKey figures Continuing operations3 Q4 2024 Q4 2023 % change FY 2024 FY 2023 % change USD m USD m USD cc USD m USD m USD cc Net sales 13 153 11 423 15 16 50 317 45 440 11 12 Operating income 3 530 2 582 37 39 14 544 9 769 49 55 Net income 2 820 2 638 7 6 11 939 8 572 39 45 EPS (USD) 1.42 1.29 10 10 5.92 4.13 43 49 Free cash flow 3 635 2 141 70 16 253 13 160 24 Core operating income 4 859 3 821 27 29 19 494 16 372 19 22 Core net income 3 933 3 126 26 29 15 755 13 446 17 21 Core EPS (USD) 1.98 1.53 29 33 7.81 6.47 21 24\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

As defined on page 35 of the Condensed Financial Report, Continuing operations include the retained business activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines business and the continuing corporate activities, and Discontinued operations include operational results from the Sandoz business.\n\nStrategy\n\nOur focus\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2023, Novartis completed its transformation into a \"pure-play\u201d innovative medicines business. We have a clear focus on four core therapeutic areas (cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology), with multiple significant in-market and pipeline assets in each of these areas, that address high disease burden and have substantial growth potential. In addition to two established technology platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics), three emerging platforms (gene & cell therapy, radioligand therapy and xRNA) are being prioritized for continued investment into new R&D capabilities and manufacturing scale. Geographically, we are focused on growing in our priority geographies - the US, China, Germany and Japan.\n\nOur priorities\n\nAccelerate growth: Renewed attention to deliver high-value medicines (NMEs) and focus on launch excellence, with a rich pipeline across our core therapeutic areas. Deliver returns: Continuing to embed operational excellence and deliver improved financials. Novartis remains disciplined and shareholder-focused in our approach to capital allocation, with substantial cash generation and a strong capital structure supporting continued flexibility. Strengthening foundations: Unleashing the power of our people, scaling data science and technology and continuing to build trust with society.\n\nFollowing the September 15, 2023, shareholder approval of the spin-off of Sandoz, Novartis reported its consolidated financial statements as \"continuing operations\u201d and \"discontinued operations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing operations include the retained business activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines business and the continuing corporate activities. Discontinued operations include the Sandoz Division and selected portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz's business, as well as certain expenses related to the spin-off.\n\nWhile the commentary below focuses on continuing operations, we also provide information on discontinued operations.\n\nContinuing operations\n\nFourth quarter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNet sales were USD 13.2 billion (+15%, +16% cc), with volume contributing 15 percentage points to growth. Generic competition had a negative impact of 1 percentage point and pricing had a positive impact of 2 percentage points, benefiting from revenue deduction adjustments mainly in the US.\n\nOperating income was USD 3.5 billion (+37%, +39% cc), mainly driven by higher net sales, partly offset by higher R&D investments.\n\nNet income was USD 2.8 billion (+7%, +6% cc), mainly driven by higher operating income, partly offset by higher income taxes, mainly resulting from higher income before taxes in the current year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year. EPS was USD 1.42 (+10%, +10% cc), benefiting from the lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nCore operating income was USD 4.9 billion (+27%, +29% cc), mainly driven by higher net sales, partly offset by higher R&D investments. Core operating income margin was 36.9% of net sales, increasing 3.4 percentage points (+3.7 percentage points cc).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCore net income was USD 3.9 billion (+26%, +29% cc), mainly due to higher core operating income.

Net cash flows from operating activities for total Company amounted to USD 17.6 billion and free cash flow amounted to USD 16.3 billion.\n\nQ4 key growth drivers\n\nUnderpinning our financial results in the quarter is a continued focus on key growth drivers (ranked in order of contribution to Q4 growth) including:\n\nEntresto (USD 2 180 million, +34% cc) sustained robust, demand-led growth, with increased penetration in the US and Europe following guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure, and in China and Japan with increased penetration in hypertension Kesimpta (USD 950 million, +49% cc) sales grew across all regions reflecting increased demand for a high efficacy product with convenient self-administered dosing Kisqali (USD 902 million, +52% cc) sales grew strongly across all regions, including +66% (cc) growth in the US with strong momentum from the recently launched early breast cancer (eBC) indication. Kisqali growth is underpinned by increasing recognition of its overall survival benefit in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC) as well as Category 1 NCCN Guidelines recommendation in both mBC and eBC Cosentyx (USD 1 596 million, +24% cc) sales grew mainly in the US, Europe and emerging growth markets driven by recent launches (including the HS indication and the IV formulation in the US) and volume growth in core indications Leqvio (USD 223 million, +83% cc) continued to show steady growth, with a focus on increasing account and patient adoption, and continuing medical education Scemblix (USD 207 million, +66% cc) sales grew across all regions demonstrating the continued high unmet need in CML Pluvicto (USD 351 million, +28% cc) sales grew in Europe and in the US. With supply now unconstrained, the focus is on increasing share in established RLT sites while opening new sites and referral pathways and initiating new patients Fabhalta (USD 57 million) launch continues with a modest ramp in PNH globally and in IgA nephropathy in the US Jakavi (USD 487 million, +13% cc) sales grew across all regions driven by strong demand across indications Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 527 million, +10% cc) sales grew mainly in the US, Japan and emerging growth markets driven by increased demand Lutathera (USD 190 million, +30% cc) sales grew across all regions due to increased demand and earlier line adoption (within indication) in the US and Japan Ilaris (USD 413 million, +11% cc) sales grew across all regions, led by the US Xolair (USD 399 million, +9% cc) grew mainly in emerging growth markets Emerging growth markets* Grew +9% (cc) overall. China grew +7% (cc) to USD 0.8 billion, mainly driven by Entresto, Xolair and Kisqali\n\n*All markets except the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand\n\nNet sales of the top 20 brands in the fourth quarter and full year\n\nQ4 2024 % change FY 2024 % change USD m USD cc USD m USD cc Entresto 2 180 33 34 7 822 30 31 Cosentyx 1 596 22 24 6 141 23 25 Kesimpta 950 48 49 3 224 49 49 Kisqali 902 48 52 3 033 46 49 Promacta/Revolade 583 4 5 2 216 -2 -1 Tafinlar + Mekinist 527 8 10 2 058 7 9 Jakavi 487 10 13 1 936 13 15 Tasigna 411 -8 -6 1 671 -10 -8 Xolair 399 6 9 1 643 12 15 Ilaris 413 10 11 1 509 11 14 Pluvicto 351 29 28 1 392 42 42 Sandostatin Group 306 -3 -1 1 279 -3 -1 Zolgensma 262 -8 -6 1 214 0 2 Lucentis 210 -30 -29 1 044 -29 -28 Leqvio 223 81 83 754 112 114 Lutathera 190 29 30 724 20 20 Exforge Group 159 2 8 703 -1 2 Scemblix 207 66 66 689 67 68 Galvus Group 144 -6 2 602 -13 -6 Diovan Group 140 -5 -2 590 -4 0 Top 20 brands total 10 640 19 21 40 244 18 19\n\nNew approvals\n\nScemblix (asciminib) FDA granted accelerated approval to Scemblix for adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP). The FDA also broadened the indication for Scemblix to include adult patients with previously treated Ph+ CML-CP. Kisqali (ribociclib) EC approved Kisqali as an adjuvant treatment in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer (eBC) at high risk of recurrence regardless of nodal status, nearly doubling the eligible population.\n\nFabhalta (iptacopan) Submission for the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) was completed in the US, and the FDA granted Priority Review status to Fabhalta in this indication. The FDA also confirmed no need for an Advisory Committee meeting.\n\nOAV101 IT (onasemnogene abeparvovec) Novartis announced positive topline results from the Phase III STEER study. This pivotal trial assessed the efficacy and safety of investigational intrathecal OAV101 in treatment-na\u00efve patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 2, aged two to less than 18 years who are able to sit but have never walked independently. The study met its primary endpoint showing an increase from baseline across the study population in total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) scores. HFMSE is a gold standard for SMA-specific assessment of motor ability and disease progression. Pluvicto (lutetium Lu177 vipivotide tetraxetan) Final overall survival (OS) analysis in the Phase III PSMAfore study in pre-taxane mCRPC demonstrated an OS hazard ratio less than 1.0 (HR<1.0) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population unadjusted for cross-over. These results have been shared with the FDA as part of their ongoing review of Pluvicto in this indication. Kisqali (ribociclib) Results from an updated analysis of the pivotal Phase III NATALEE trial of Kisqali plus endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with HR+/HER2- stage II and III eBC showed a sustained reduction in distant recurrence of 28.5% compared to ET alone, underscoring Kisqali's extended efficacy beyond its 3-year treatment duration. No new safety signals were identified. Data presented at SABCS. In addition, Kisqali was recognized by NCCN Guidelines\u00ae as a Category 1 preferred therapy in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for patients with HR+/HER2- eBC. Kisqali is the only Category 1 preferred CDK4/6 inhibitor recommended for both all node-positive disease as well as node-negative disease with high-risk disease characteristics. Kisqali also achieved the highest score (A) on the European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) for eBC, while maintaining a rating of 5 and 4 in the mBC setting. In January 2025, Novartis settled compound patent litigation with a generic manufacturer, supporting Kisqali US patent protection until at least Q1 2031. Scemblix (asciminib) 96-week results from the Phase III ASC4FIRST trial with Scemblix showed sustained superior major molecular response vs. all investigator-selected standard-of-care TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and bosutinib) and vs. imatinib alone in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. Fewer treatment-related grade \u22653 AEs and half the rate of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for Scemblix vs. both imatinib and second-generation TKIs. Data presented at ASH. Fabhalta (iptacopan) In the Phase III APPEAR-C3G study, patients with C3G treated with oral Fabhalta in addition to supportive care experienced clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction sustained at 12 months. In addition, in the open-label period of the study, proteinuria reduction was seen in participants switched to Fabhalta, and improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope was observed upon Fabhalta initiation compared to patients' historic rapid decline. Fabhalta continued to show a favorable safety profile. Data presented at ASN. Selected transactions Novartis entered into a global license and collaboration agreement with PTC Therapeutics for PTC518, a HTT mRNA splice modulator with the potential to become the first oral disease-modifying therapy for Huntington's disease. Under the agreement, Novartis will assume responsibility for PTC518's development, manufacturing and commercialization following the completion of the placebo-controlled portion of the ongoing Phase II PIVOT-HD study, expected in H1 2025. Novartis acquired Kate Therapeutics, a preclinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies to treat genetically defined neuromuscular diseases. The acquisition will strengthen Novartis' efforts to advance gene therapies and neuroscience innovation and includes enabling technology platforms and several preclinical therapeutic candidates. Novartis entered into a worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with Ratio Therapeutics for a next-generation SSTR2-targeting radiotherapeutic candidate. The collaboration focuses on preclinical research and selection of an SSTR2-targeting development candidate, after which Novartis will lead development, manufacturing and commercialization.\n\nRetaining a good balance between investment in the business, a strong capital structure, and attractive shareholder returns remains a priority.\n\nIn 2024, Novartis repurchased a total of 77.5 million shares for USD 8.3 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line. These purchases included 68.8 million shares (USD 7.3 billion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in July 2023 (with up to USD 5.4 billion still to be executed). In addition, 8.7 million shares (USD 1.0 billion) were repurchased to mitigate the impact of share deliveries under the equity-based compensation plans for employees. Furthermore, 1.2 million shares (equity value of USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from employees. In the same period, 9.8 million shares (equity value of USD 1.1 billion) were delivered to employees related to equity-based compensation plans. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 68.9 million versus December 31, 2023. These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity decrease of USD 7.4 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 8.3 billion.\n\nNet debt increased to USD 16.1 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to USD 10.2 billion net debt at December 31, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the free cash flow of USD 16.3 billion being more than offset by the cash outflows for treasury share transactions of USD 8.3 billion, the annual dividend payment of USD 7.6 billion, and net cash outflow for M&A / intangible assets transactions of USD 6.3 billion.\n\nAs of Q4 2024, the long-term credit rating for the company is Aa3 with Moody's Ratings and AA- with S&P Global Ratings.\n\n2025 outlook",

With support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership (GLLEP), the land was transformed into a wildlife haven.\n\nFour years later, the region\u2019s second mitigation site opened. Novartis Ings was completed in October 2022 to the west of the Novartis Factory site on Moody Lane, Pyewipe. A further two field areas are earmarked for mitigation sites for the future.\n\nNovartis Ings was developed thanks to funding from ERDF and the Greater Lincolnshire LEP, and the transfer of land, free of charge, from the pharmaceutical company, Novartis Grimsby. This generous gesture was the company\u2019s lasting legacy to the local community after manufacturing at the site next door for more than 70 years. Land formerly owned by Solenis completed the 20-hectare site.\n\nNovartis Ings created a temporary stopping off point for wildlife on their vast migration journeys along the East Atlantic Flyway, providing waders, in particular, with a rich invertebrate food source on the mudflats. The East Atlantic Flyway is a super-highway that follows the coastlines from the Arctic, through Europe and into Africa. An estimated 175,000 migrating birds on this flyway stop off on the Humber Estuary every winter.\n\nThe rich feeding grounds found along the Humber Estuary act like a service station on this route by providing a rest stop for these migrating birds. Some simply pass through on their way to other places, but large numbers of golden plover, lapwing, black tailed godwit, curlew and others also stay all winter to benefit from the relatively mild climate combined with a reliable food source revealed twice a day by the tide. Eventually most migrate back to their Northern breeding grounds in the spring.\n\nThere is a hide for local birdwatchers to observe the comings and goings of birds and wildlife at Novartis Ings, but the primary aim is to offer specially protected areas for wading birds to rest and recuperate in safety, and with little disturbance.\n\nAt Novartis Ings, the birds can often be seen feeding on the mud flats over the opposite side of the nearby North Wall and when the tide comes in, they cluster and fly over the wall to feed and roost.\n\nBy September, with the changing of the seasons, comes the beginning of the winter migration. Over the next three months, thousands of birds will stop off on the sites, sometimes for a few weeks, to break their 5,000 mile journey from the Arctic to Africa.\n\nIt is difficult to accurately log the number of birds using these sites. Data comes from the Wetland Bird Survey data (WeBS), and via Roger Wardle, a local wetland consultant, who was responsible for creating Cress Marsh and Novartis Ings alongside NELC. But the council also relies heavily upon local wildlife volunteers, whose invaluable contribution helps to maintain an overview of the comings and goings of the different species, as well as carrying out cattle welfare checks.\n\nA core team of volunteers, who are avid bird watchers and nature enthusiasts, with permission from the council, regularly visit Cress Marsh. They can record what they see during the time they are there on a Google data sheet, which asks for the species, how many, what time they were seen. Another volunteer visits Novartis Ings daily and records the bird activity during his visits, as he has done since before the site was prepared as a wetland.\n\nAlthough the sites need to remain predominantly undisturbed, they do require some management.\n\nSian Niblo, Ecology Officer at NELC, said: \u201cCattle are the main management tool on both sites. This year we have had 40 cows on site at Cress Marsh and 15 at Novartis Ings. The cattle are especially suited to wetlands and they graze here from April to November to naturally mow the grass, creating microhabitats suitable for the invertebrates that the waders feed on.\n\n\u201cWe also maintain the water levels on the lagoons on the sites. We try not to have any major variations in water. Although we may want them higher and lower at certain times, we do that incrementally so that we don\u2019t disturb the invertebrate communities that the birds are coming to feed on.\n\n\u201cDifferent birds feed in different ways so we also make sure that we retain wet edges for the birds that probe into the mud to feed, such as oystercatchers.\u201d\n\nThe sites are proving attractive, with more birds appearing each year.\n\n\u201cThe avocet breeding season was phenomenal this year,\u201d said Sian. \u201cWe class the season as March to September and we have resident breeding and migrant breeding. Our avocet numbers have really increased. At one point there were no avocets breeding in Lincolnshire. Avocets normally just pop in to breed and disappear again, but we have been having good numbers. They are also site faithful so, if they have bred here and fledged here, they will return here to breed and fledge again.\n\n\u201cWe have seen breeding activity with avocets, little ringed plover, mallard, lapwing, and shelduck on both sites.\u201d\n\nWorld Wetlands Day is celebrated each year on 2 February to raise awareness about wetlands. This day also marks the anniversary of the Convention on Wetlands, which was adopted as an international treaty in 1971 in Ramsar. The Humber Estuary is designated a Ramsar wetland site.\n\nNearly 90% of the world\u2019s wetlands have been degraded since the 1700s, and we are losing wetlands three times faster than forests. Yet, wetlands are critically important ecosystems that contribute to biodiversity, climate mitigation and adaptation, freshwater availability, world economies and more.\n\nIt is urgent that we raise national and global awareness about wetlands in order to reverse their rapid loss and encourage actions to conserve and restore them.\n\nWorld Wetlands Day is the ideal time to increase people\u2019s understanding of these critically important ecosystems.\n\nIn years to come, much of the hinterland of the Humber estuary will attract economic, industrial and other developments, but these mitigation sites should continue to offer protection to birds and wildlife far into the future.",

Cir. 2025) \u2014 On January 10, 2025, the Federal Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s opinion that claims of a Novartis patent are invalid for lack of adequate written description, but affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the claims were not proven invalid for lacking enablement or being obvious over the asserted prior art. The Federal Circuit emphasized that the proper analysis for enablement and written description challenges is focused on the claims and after-arising technology need not be enabled or described in the specification\u2014even when the after-arising technology is found to infringe the claims because the issues of patentability and infringement are distinct. \u201cIt is only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\u201cNovartis\u201d) sued multiple defendants accusing them of infringing all claims (1-4) of U.S. Patent No. 8,101,659 (\u201cthe \u2019659 patent\u201d) titled \u201cMethods of treatment and pharmaceutical composition.\u201d The \u2019659 patent relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of valsartan and sacubitril, which Novartis markets and sells as a treatment for heart failure under the brand name Entresto\u00ae.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware found that although the claims of the \u2019659 patent were not shown to be invalid as being obvious, indefinite, nor lacking enablement, the claims were shown to be invalid for lacking a written description. The district court \u201cconstrued the asserted claims [of the \u2019659 patent] to cover valsartan and sacubitril as a physical combination and as a complex.\u201d After claim construction, defendants MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MSN Laboratories Private Ltd., and MSN Life Sciences Private Ltd. stipulated to infringement of the as-construed claims. However, the district court found that since complexes of valsartan and sacubitril (which included the accused product) were unknown to a person of ordinary skill in the art as of the priority date of the \u2019659 patent (i.e., the accused product was an after-arising technology), \u201cNovartis scientists, by definition, could not have possession of, and disclose, the subject matter of such complexes . . . and therefore, axiomatically Novartis cannot satisfy the written description requirement for such complexes.\u201d\n\nNovartis appealed the district court\u2019s determination of invalidity.\n\nIssues\n\nThe primary issues on appeal were:\n\nWhether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of written description? Whether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of enablement? Whether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid as being obvious?\n\nHoldings and Reasoning\n\n1. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of written description.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found that the district court clearly erred in finding that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of a written description. Specifically, the Federal Circuit found the district court erred when it \u201cconstrued [the claims] to cover complexes of valsartan and sacubitril.\u201d And the district court\u2019s written description analysis under this construction to be incorrect with respect to complexes of valsartan and sacubitril.\n\nThe Federal Circuit noted that the issue is whether the \u2019659 patent describes what is claimed (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition comprising valsartan and sacubitril administered in combination). And that the issue is not whether the \u2019659 patent describes complexes of valsartan and sacubitril\u2014because the \u2019659 patent does not claim complexes of valsartan and sacubitril. The Federal Circuit found that by stating the claims of the \u2019659 patent were \u201cconstrued to cover complexes of valsartan and sacubitril,\u201d the district court \u201cerroneously conflated the distinct issues of patentability and infringement.\u201d The Federal Circuit explained that \u201cclaims are not construed \u2018to cover\u2019 or \u2018not to cover\u2019 the accused product. . . . It is only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement.\u201d The Federal Circuit found that \u201cthe \u2019659 patent could not have been construed as claiming [] complexes [of valsartan and sacubitril] as a matter of law\u201d because it was undisputed that the accused product was unknown at the time of the invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found that since the district court gave the disputed claim term its plain and ordinary meaning during claim construction (i.e., \u201cwherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination\u201d), the \u2019659 patent need only to adequately describe combinations of valsartan and sacubitril to satisfy the written description requirement.\n\nThe Federal Circuit further found that the \u2019659 patent \u201cplainly described [combinations of valsartan and sacubitril] throughout the specification\u201d and that accordingly, the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as lacking a written description.\n\n2. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement.\n\nThe Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement \u201cfor reasons similar to those that led us to reverse its written description determination: a specification must only enable the claimed invention.\u201d The Federal Circuit found that \u201cbecause the \u2019659 patent does not expressly claim complexes, and because the parties do not otherwise dispute that the \u2019659 patent enables that which it does claim . . . [the defendants] failed to show that the claims are invalid for lack of enablement.\u201d\n\nIn affirming the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement, the Federal Circuit agreed with the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cvalsartan sacubitril complexes . . . are part of a \u2018later-existing state of the art\u2019 that \u2018may not be properly considered in the enablement analysis.\u2019\u201d\n\n3. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as being obvious.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found \u201cno clear error warranting reversal of the district court\u2019s obviousness analysis\u201d and thus affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as being obvious. The Federal Circuit agreed that the district court\u2019s rejection of the defendants\u2019 two theories of obviousness: (1) that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to modify a prior art therapy with valsartan and sacubitril to arrive at the claimed invention; and (2) that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to individually select and combine sacubitril and valsartan from two different prior-art references to arrive at the claimed invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit distinguished the cases defendants relied upon: Nalproprion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., 934 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2019) and BTG International Ltd. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, 923 F.3d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Federal Circuit reasoned that in Nalproprion and Actavis, the prior art showed that the claimed drugs \u201cwere both together and individually considered promising . . . treatments at the time of the invention.\u201d In contrast, the district court found that \u201cthere was no motivation in the relied-upon prior art to combine valsartan and sacubitril, let alone with any reasonable expectation of success.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit agreed \u201cwith the district court that [the defendants\u2019] obviousness theories impermissibly use valsartan and sacubitril as a starting point and \u2018retrace[] the path of the inventor with hindsight.\u2019\u201d",

Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes star in this 15-second promo for the commercial, which urges everyone to pay attention to the \"important stuff\" in front of them-because nobody ever seems to have a spare minute.The multi-channel campaign will help increase awareness of breast cancer, which is the second most common type of cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death among American women. It will also raise annual screening rates.Novartis is promoting the importance of regular breast cancer screenings on one of television's biggest stages. The drugmaker is to air its first Super Bowl ad during the repeat matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on February 9, marking the first time the ad has aired in history.Novartis, a breast cancer drug company, launched a \"Your Attention, Please\" campaign on its massive platform to encourage viewers to prioritize their breast health. \u201cWe continue to be very active in the therapeutics space, but we also asked ourselves, as a leader in this space, what else can we do?\u201d Victor Bulto, president of Novartis US, said in an interview with Fierce Pharma Marketing.The answer was \u201cpretty clear,\u201d he said: Address the breast cancer diagnosis gap. \"Right now, we know that 1 in 2 women, unfortunately, don\u2019t get their regular mammograms,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we also know that the best chance that they have at surviving is early diagnosis.

            "content": "\u201cThe Novartis case should have been treated in the same way as other cases where a patentee secured a broad claim construction to prove infringement, only to have the patent invalidated because the claims as construed were not enabled as to their full scope.\u201d\n\nIn Novartis Pharms. Corp. v. Torrent Pharma Inc., ___F. 4th ___, 2025 U. S. App. LEXIS 486 (Fed. Cir., Jan. 10, 2025), the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shut down efforts to market a generic version of the heart disease drug ENTRESTO which is sold under a patent which claims a \u201ccombination\u201d of two drugs, valsartan and sacubitril. Because the proposed generic drug accused of infringement was a \u201ccomplex\u201d of bonded valsartan and sacubitril, the patentee Novartis needed to urge and had successfully urged that \u201ccombination\u201d be construed to include both bonded complexes and non-bonded (i.e. separate) components. Absent such construction, the accused product would not have infringed.\n\nBut in addressing an enablement defense, in which the subject patent had to be enabled as to the full scope of the patent claims as construed, the Federal Circuit effectively held that the patent did not claim bonded valsartan-sacubitril complexes, such that enablement as to the bonded combination\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014was a moot point.\n\nThis was problematic at best. It contravened Supreme Court precedent by allowing the patentee to extend its monopoly to drug products for which the patentee did not provide the required quid pro quo of an enabling disclosure. And the decision seems to have been driven by a factual distraction and case law which, in all likelihood, is no longer viable.\n\nThe District Court Rejects the Lack of Enablement Defense\n\nThe patent asserted by Novartis in the case was U.S. Patent No. 8,101,659. For present purposes, the claims of the \u2018659 Patent called for a pharmaceutical combination comprising valsartan and sacubitril \u201cadministered in combination\u201d in about a 1:1 ratio. The accused generic product, like Novartis\u2019s ENTRESTO, comprised a complex of non-covalently bonded valsartan and sacubitril.\n\nDuring claim construction, the defendant MSN urged that the claims be limited to the two active agents as two separate components. Inasmuch as such a limiting construction would have led to a finding of non-infringement, Novartis argued that \u201ccombination\u201d be given its plain and ordinary meaning, i.e. including bonded complexes. The District Court agreed and thereafter conducted a bench trial\n\nIn addressing enablement after the bench trial, the district correctly recognized that enablement is judged as of the patent\u2019s priority date (here, 2002), such that a later-existing state of the art may not properly be considered in an enablement analysis. The Federal Circuit\u2019s summary of the District Court\u2019s ruling on enablement was\u2014in its entirety\u2014as follows (with citations omitted):\n\n\u201c[B]ecause complexes of valsartan and sacubitril were unknown in the art in 20022, the [district] court determined that they need not have been enabled in the \u2018659 patent\u2026.The [district] court further found that MSN had failed to establish that pharmaceutical complexes, more generally, were known or were nascent as of the 2002 priority date.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit Affirms on Enablement\n\nIn a unanimous precedential opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision rejecting the defense of lack of enablement. The case also involved defenses of lack of written description and obviousness, which are beyond the scope of this article.\n\nThe Court of Appeals began its analysis by stating that a specification must \u201conly\u201d enable the claimed invention. It then noted that the claimed invention \u201cas construed by the district court\u201d is a composition in which valsartan and sacubitril are administered \u201cin combination.\u201d It then stated that \u201cthe patent does not claim as its invention valsartan-sacubitril complexes.\n\nBut the claims were construed so as not to be limited to separate components as MSN had urged. Thus, in reality, the \u2018659 patent as construed does claim as its invention, inter alia, bonded valsartan-sacubitril complexes.\n\nIt is well settled that where a claim is construed broadly\u2014as was the case here\u2014the question is whether the claim is enabled under the court\u2019s broad construction. See, e.g., Identix Pharms LC v. Gilead Scis. Inc., 941 F. 3d 1149, 1156 n. 3 (Fed. Cir. 2019).\n\nIt is equally well settled that an enabling disclosure must support the full scope of the claim as construed. Just two years ago, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that:\n\n\u201cIf a patent claims an entire class of\u2026compositions of matter, the patent\u2019s specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the entire class. In other words, the specification must enable the full scope of the invention as defined by its claims. The more one claims, the more one must enable.\u201d\n\nAmgen Inc. v. Sanofi, 588 U.S. 594, 609 (2023).\n\nThe Federal Circuit concluded its enablement discussion in Novartis by stating that was affirming on the issue of enablement \u201cbecause [i] the \u2018659 patent does not expressly claim complexes, and because [ii] the parties do not otherwise dispute that the \u2018659 patent enables that which it does claim\u2026.\u201d (Emphasis added). As to part [i], whether or not the \u2018659 patent \u201cexpressly\u201d claims complexes is neither here nor there. It does in fact claim complexes because Novartis sought and obtained a broad construction which does include complexes.\n\nAs for part [ii], it is difficult to discern from the appellate opinion exactly what the parties argued. If the court was suggesting here that the \u2018659 patent does enable some compositions within the scope of \u201ccombinations\u201d as construed\u2014viz., separate components\u2014that too is neither here nor there. It simply doesn\u2019t begin to address the question whether the full scope of the claims as construed are enabled.\n\nIn full effect, the Novartis case should have been treated in the same way as other cases where a patentee secured a broad claim construction to prove infringement, only to have the patent invalidated because the claims as construed were not enabled as to their full scope. For example, in Sitrick v. Dreamworks LLC, 516 F. 3d 993 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the patent at issue involved technology which was potentially applicable to both movies and video games. Because the defendant was only accused of infringement as to movies, the patentee sought and obtained a claim construction which encompassed both movies and video games. Even assuming that the claims were enabled as to video games, the claims were invalid if they were not enabled for movies\u2014and they were not.\n\nAn Unhelpful Distraction\n\nA critical element of the District Court\u2019s and the Federal Circuit\u2019s analysis was this fact: years after the 2002 critical date for the \u2018659 patent, Novartis obtained other patents which expressly disclosed non-covalently bound valsartan and sacubitril salts. What is difficult to unpack is how and why this fact figured in the Federal Circuit\u2019s enablement analysis\n\nBy way of background, the statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112(a), states that it is the specification of a patent that must provide a disclosure that is enabling to one of ordinary skill in the art. But a patent applicant need not include in the specification that which was generally and reasonably available to those skilled in the art as of the critical date. In re Howarth, 654 F.2d 103 (C.C.P.A. 1981). Thus, Novartis\u2019s post-2002 patents could not have been relied upon by Novartis to supplement the \u2018659 specification because their content was not generally known before 2002.\n\nNovartis appears to have urged that the post-2002 patents somehow established that the \u2018659 patent was excused from having to enable valsartan \u2013 sacubitril complexes. Part of that strategy seems to have been that because the later patents expressly disclosed and claimed complexes, the \u2018659 patent necessarily could not and did not claim complexes. Immediately after stating that the \u2018659 patent \u201cdoes not claim as its invention valsartan -sacubitril complexes,\u201d the Federal Circuit stated, as if by way of proof, that \u201cIndeed, Novartis obtained separate, later patents to such complexes.\u201d In fact, what Novartis obtained after 2002 were claims directed to a species of the genus broadly\u2014indeed, over-broadly\u2014claimed in the \u2018659 patent.\n\nNovartis relied on three cases from the Federal Circuit and its predecessor supposedly supporting the proposition that the mere fact that an invention can be improved upon does not establish the absence of an enabling disclosure and even excuses an absence of enablement. But of these cases were decided decades before Amgen conclusively held that all patent claims must be enabled as to their full scope.\n\nThe viewpoint of these outdated cases is well captured in Chiron Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 363 F. 3d 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2004), where the court stated that \u201ca patent document cannot enable technology that arises after the date of application. The law does not expect an applicant to disclose knowledge invented or developed after the filing date. Such disclosure would be impossible.\u201d Id. at 1254. To which the post-Amgen response might be something like: the law does not expect, or allow, inventors to seek claims covering that which they have not invented, for which they are incapable of providing sufficient enablement.\n\nThe analysis by the District Court and the Federal Circuit in Novartis would seem to support this anomaly. When the \u2018659 patent issued in 2002, with a specification devoid of bonded complexes, the claims may well have been invalid for want of enablement. But as soon as the later patents came into the picture, the claims were retroactively deemed enabled, and the failure of the \u2018659 specification to disclose bonded complexes became an excused absence.\n\nAccordingly, in this observer\u2019s view, the post-2002 patents were a red herring. They neither prove nor disprove enablement of the \u2018659 patent.\n\nSo where does this leave us? It must be kept in mind that MSN at all times had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that that there was no enabling disclosure of valsartan -sacubitril complexes as of 2002. Thus, MSN was necessarily required to prove a negative.\n\nBut the record seems to have the equivalent of such proof. The District Court flatly stated, \u201cIt is not disputed that the specification neither discloses nor suggests a complex of valsartan and sacubitril.\u201d It also found as a fact that \u201ccomplexes of valsartan and sacubitril were unknown in the art in 2002.\u201d Moreover, an effort to establish that pharmaceutical complexes, more generally, were known or were nascent technology as of 2002, had failed. (The effort had been made by MSN in an effort to address Novartis\u2019s pre-Amgen decisions.)\n\nIt thus seems hard to escape the view the \u2018659 patent claims as broadly construed per Novartis\u2019s request were required to enable valsartan-sacubitril complexes, and they did not.",

Early detection can lead to an over 99% survival rate**3. To inspire people across generations to prioritize their breast health, Novartis, in collaboration with actor, comedian, and breast cancer survivor Wanda Sykes, actress and musician Hailee Steinfeld, and patient advocacy organizations nationwide, is urging people to understand their breast cancer risk and prioritize screenings.\n\nBacked by evidence-based behavioral insights, \"Your Attention, Please\" shifts the focus from mere attention to actionable steps, empowering people to take control of their breast health and spark honest\u2014and potentially lifesaving\u2014dialogue around breast cancer. Kicking off with Novartis' first-ever commercial to air during Super Bowl LIX on FOX, the broader multi-channel campaign is set to bring this important message to an estimated 47.2 million women watching the big game on February 9, 2025\u20204.\n\nBy launching the campaign during Super Bowl LIX on FOX\u2014one of the world's biggest stages\u2014we're sparking a powerful conversation about breast health and inspiring true behavior change that drives early detection.\n\nEmpowering All Women to Own Their Breast Health\n\n\"Novartis has been raising the bar in breast cancer care for the past 30+ years, most recently advancing a new treatment option for the broadest population of early breast cancer patients. And, we know that early detection through regular screening provides the best chances for cure,\" said Victor Bult\u00f3, President, US, Novartis. \"We are proud to build on our legacy to deliver science-backed guidance, innovative resources, and steadfast support for patients, advocates, healthcare providers, and the wider breast cancer community. By reframing the conversation and sparking a dialogue that turns attention into action, we hope to empower individuals and their loved ones in better understanding their breast health, navigating their care with confidence, and ultimately, leading to better treatment outcomes.\"\n\nA centerpiece of the campaign is YourAttentionPlease.com, a website that aims to make information about breast health and risk factors more accessible and easier to understand, while supporting women from all backgrounds to learn more about their personal risk and schedule their routine screenings, if eligible.\n\nCurrent breast cancer screening guidelines recommend that women at average risk begin regular mammograms at age 40, with annual screenings being the gold standard for early detection5. Complex barriers\u2014ranging from time constraints and resource availability to cultural stigma and misinformation\u2014hinder the adoption of regular screening and more open discussions about breast health. Health disparities also play a significant role, especially among Black women, who have a higher rate of late diagnoses than their white counterparts.\n\n\"When I was 47, I went in for a breast reduction expecting a straightforward surgery,\" said Wanda Sykes, award-winning actress, writer, and comedian. \"I never imagined breast cancer would be lurking. It totally caught me off guard, and I'm pretty sure early detection saved my life. As an avid football fan, I know the big game is the perfect time to remind women to know their risks, get checked regularly, and encourage others to do the same.\"\n\nThe campaign also emphasizes the importance of vigilance for individuals under 40 as recent data indicate a rise in breast cancer among younger age groups, with breast cancer increasingly common in women under age 501.Those with a family history or possible genetic predisposition should discuss earlier screenings with their doctor to evaluate their personal risk.\n\n\"The number of women around me who have been impacted by breast cancer either personally, or in their family, has made me realize how important it is to stay proactive when it comes to breast health,\" said Hailee Steinfeld, award-winning actress and musician. \"We all play a role in encouraging women to prioritize their breast health, whether you're of screening age or not, and should make it a priority to discuss the steps we can all take to better understand our risk factors with our doctors, friends, family and community.\"\n\nAmplifying Impact with Patient Advocacy Organizations\n\nAddressing the devastating toll of breast cancer requires a broad, collaborative approach, especially with breast cancer incidence rates remaining on the rise and diagnoses happening in younger women1. Novartis has spent 30+ years advancing science and is committed to inspiring meaningful change that goes beyond medicine, together with breast cancer community partners.\n\n\"Expanding access to screening and early detection of breast cancer is not only a cornerstone of our mission but a critical lifeline that improves survival rates,\" said Paula Schneider, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen\u00ae. \"Working with Novartis, we're committed to driving education and action while supporting women in their journey. The more we can do as a collective, the more lives we will save. It will take industry, advocacy and countless other stakeholders to reduce barriers and increase screening rates, but it all starts with channeling our attention to what matters \u2013 breast health, for all of us and our loved ones.\"\n\nIn addition to the celebrity partnership and the website, Novartis is partnering with patient advocacy organizations including Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, TOUCH (The Black Breast Cancer Alliance), Breastcancer.org, and more to elevate awareness and bring resources and support to local advocacy community events.\n\n\"As an advocate and breast cancer survivor, I know firsthand how important it is to give breasts the attention they deserve,\" said Ricki Fairley, CEO, TOUCH the Black Breast Cancer Alliance. \"Black women are more likely to get diagnosed with breast cancer at later stages. By partnering with Novartis and fellow leaders in breast cancer advocacy, we're highlighting the importance of early detection and driving to resources that help women like me navigate screening and receive timely treatment. This is what true advocacy looks like\u2014communities uniting around better breast health for all.\"\n\nWith an attention-grabbing call to prioritize breast health, \"Your Attention, Please\" is a cornerstone of these efforts. But attention without access is not enough\u2014far too often, the cost of care stands between people and early detection. That's why Susan G. Komen, Novartis and advocacy partners across the country are also partnering to advance state and federal legislation that would help ensure affordable access to critical breast imaging that is necessary to diagnose breast cancer early and save lives.\n\nBuilding on Novartis' Legacy in Breast Cancer\n\nNovartis' commitment to improving breast cancer outcomes extends far beyond the campaign, working alongside healthcare providers, patients, additional advocacy partners, and the broader breast cancer community. Novartis is championing transformative progress for people affected by the disease by:\n\nLeveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance clinical trial representation, enrollment efforts and data collection to gather more accurate and relevant scientific insights across geographies and patient demographics;\n\nImproving access and support across the breast cancer journey for patients from all communities and backgrounds;\n\nBridging care gaps between people in historically underserved groups and providers in order to improve outcomes.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Novartis has been committed to tackling breast cancer with bold science, collaboration, and a passion for transforming patient care. With a deep understanding of the mechanism of the disease, Novartis has one of the most comprehensive breast cancer portfolios and pipeline, leading the industry in discovery of new therapies and combinations in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. By enhancing personalized medicine approaches, improving patient outcomes, and redefining standards of care, Novartis is reimagining medicine for people touched by breast cancer.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In it, the actor proclaims, \u201cLet\u2019s give breasts the attention they deserve most.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really is about reframing the narrative,\u201d Gail Horwood, chief marketing and customer experience officer for Novartis, said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually not trying to be provocative as much as just remind people that everybody spends a lot of time thinking about breasts, but maybe we should pay attention when it matters most.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horwood, the company, which serves patients in a variety of healthcare spaces\u2014from prostate cancer to skin diseases\u2014had been experimenting with its media mix in live sports over the last year, noticing that the events drove significant impact for viewers visiting websites and seeking information.\n\nSo, with cancer on the rise\u2014and one out of two women eligible for mammograms skipping them\u2014the Super Bowl was a \u201creal opportunity\u201d to reach a mass audience of women and steer them to the website YourAttentionPlease.com for a quiz and information, Horwood explained.\n\n\u201cThe website itself is: Get a screening, know your risk, find a place to get screened, or set a reminder for you or a loved one,\u201d Horwood said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be very simple and drive an action.\u201d\n\nThe company was intentional behind everything about the ad, including the talent participating. For instance, Sykes is a cancer survivor who credits early detection with saving her life. Meanwhile, Steinfeld has connections to the cancer community and is relevant to a younger audience (who may not be recommended for mammograms but should still know their risk).\n\n\u201cMaybe two years ago, this approach wouldn\u2019t have made sense, but you have the Taylor Swift Effect, you have the Hailee Steinfeld Effect\u2014young women and women in general are paying more attention to football,\u201d Horwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they weren\u2019t there before. Obviously, the Super Bowl is one of the largest TV audiences of the year\u2014maybe in the world\u2014but now they\u2019re really tuned in.\u201d\n\nThough other healthcare companies, such as Pfizer, have made splashes in the Super Bowl in recent years, Horwood explained the inspiration behind the ad was really doing what\u2019s right to get the message out rather than jumping on any trend.\n\nThe CMO explained the company is making a longterm commitment to getting people access and information on screenings, and more versions of the campaign will follow throughout the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to have an audience of this scale and be able to spark the conversation,\u201d Horwood said.\n\nWatch the full Novartis Super Bowl 59 ad below:\n\nCREDITS\n\nOmnicom Velocity\n\nHead of Global Health Accounts Leadership: Michele Markus\n\nPresident of Health & Wellness at Omnicom Advertising Collective: Michael Collins\n\nDirectors, Integrated Agency Team: Holly Moscatiello, Amy Demoreuille\n\nCreative Agency: Merkley+Partners\n\nCEO: Alex Gellert\n\nExecutive Director of Healthcare: Taylor Rhodes\n\nAccount Director: Julia Breckwoldt\n\nCo-Head of Strategy: Anderson Koeniger\n\nExecutive Creative Directors: Abi Aron Spencer, Aaron Hunt Eiseman\n\nGroup Creative Director: Craig Cimmino\n\nCreative Director: Jamie Silverman\n\nExecutive Design Director: Harris Shaw\n\nArt Director: Rhea Hanges\n\nCopywriter: Max Godsil\n\nExecutive Producer: Alex Kobak\n\nSenior Producer: Donovan Green\n\nCelebrity Talent & Licensing: TMA / Platinum Rye Entertainment\n\nCEO: Trina Roffino\n\nTeam Leadership: Liz Panich\n\nVP: Whitney DeMercurio\n\nEVP: Megan McMahon\n\nVP: Mary Semling\n\nSr. Director: Billy Blundell\n\nPublic Relations and Advocacy Agency: Ketchum\n\nSVP, Sports: Megan Garner\n\nSVP, Healthcare: Michelle Abtahi\n\nSVP, Advoacy: Valarie Clark\n\nConfidential \u2013 Not for Public Consumption or Distribution\n\nVP GM, Media Relations: Erica Saviano\n\nVP, Healthcare: Camille Ahearn\n\nAS, Sports: Elisabeth McClure\n\nMedia Agency: N2\n\nEVP, Head of Investment: Amy Ginsberg\n\nSVP, CX Strategy: Lauren Fitzgerald\n\nSVP, Client Lead: Kiersten Britton\n\nVP, Video Investment: Masud Karim\n\nVP, Paid Search: Brian Baseman\n\nVP, Programmatic: Cynthia Ho\n\nDirector, Direct Investment: Evan Spector\n\nVP, Paid Social: Kaitlin Tambuscio\n\nProduction Company\n\nCompany name: Moxie Pictures\n\nProduction Company City: LA, CA\n\nDirector: MJ Delaney\n\nPresident: Dan Levinson\n\nExecutive Producer: Karol Zeno\n\nHead of Production: Jodi Fisher\n\nProducer: Lucy Tate\n\nProduction Supervisor: Chris Hoggard\n\nDirector of Photography: Cristina Dunlap\n\nProduction Designer: Kate Bunch\n\nCostume Designer: Laura Diep Rundquist\n\nEditorial Company\n\nCompany name: Work Editorial\n\nEditor: Ben Jordan\n\nManaging Director: Erica Thompson\n\nExecutive Producer: Alejandra Alarcon\n\nSenior Post Producer: Samara Kelly\n\nAsst.

            "content": "Novartis is bringing breast cancer awareness to Super Bowl LIX \u2014 with the help of Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes.\n\nThe Swiss pharma giant announced Tuesday that it will air its first-ever Super Bowl ad as part of the launch of its Your Attention, Please campaign.\n\nThe drugmaker teased the commercial with a 15-second promo featuring Sykes \u2013 a breast cancer survivor \u2014 at midfield, noting that everyone is often too busy to pay attention to the \u201cimportant stuff\u201d right in front of them.\n\nIn this case, the \u201cimportant stuff\u201d is breast cancer \u2014 but viewers will have to wait for the full reveal during the game on February 9.\n\nThe multi-channel campaign is intended to raise the profile of breast cancer \u2014 which is the second most common form of cancer in the U.S. and the second leading cause of cancer death among American women \u2014 and boost annual rates of screenings.\n\nIn addition to the partnership with Steinfeld and Sykes, Novartis is collaborating on awareness efforts and advocacy events with organizations like the Susan G. Komen, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, TOUCH (The Black Breast Cancer Alliance) and Breastcancer.org.\n\nThe medical marketing push by Novartis also seeks to double down on the drugmaker\u2019s commitment to this disease state.\n\nThe move comes just over four months after the Food and Drug Administration approved Novartis\u2019 Kisqali (ribociclib) for treating early breast cancer.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to build on our legacy to deliver science-backed guidance, innovative resources, and steadfast support for patients, advocates, healthcare providers, and the wider breast cancer community,\u201d said Victor Bult\u00f3, president of U.S. at Novartis, in a statement. \u201cBy reframing the conversation and sparking a dialogue that turns attention into action, we hope to empower individuals and their loved ones in better understanding their breast health, navigating their care with confidence, and ultimately, leading to better treatment outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to airing the commercial during the largest single live TV audience of the year, Novartis is supporting Your Attention, Please with a campaign website featuring pertinent information related to breast health and risk factors.\n\nThe goal is to help patients from all backgrounds learn more about their breast health and have the resources available to them to schedule routine screenings and care appointments.\n\nThe site includes information for women over the age of 40, who have a higher risk of the disease, as well as information for women under the age of 40 so they can be proactive with their health.\n\nFor Sykes, she stated that early detection of cancer when she went in for a breast reduction procedure \u201csaved my life\u201d and she\u2019s hopeful this campaign will do the same for others.\n\n\u201cAs an avid football fan, I know the big game is the perfect time to remind women to know their risks, get checked regularly, and encourage others to do the same,\u201d she stated.\n\nAs for Steinfeld \u2014 who is engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen \u2014 her involvement in the campaign was borne out of the impact of breast cancer on the women in her life and the importance of being proactive with one\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cWe all play a role in encouraging women to prioritize their breast health, whether you\u2019re of screening age or not, and should make it a priority to discuss the steps we can all take to better understand our risk factors with our doctors, friends, family and community,\u201d she stated.\n\nNotably, Novartis isn\u2019t the only health brand making its advertising debut at the big game.\n\nHims & Hers also announced on Tuesday morning that it would release a minute-long ad highlighting its compounded GLP-1 weight loss drug offerings.\n\nTo read a February 2025 article on Novartis\u2019 chief marketing officer on the drugmaker\u2019s Super Bowl ad debut, click here.",

It is now concentrating on four core therapeutic areas \u2014 cardiovascular- renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nNVS\u2019 fourth-quarter sales are likely to have been boosted by strong growth in Kisqali and Pluvicto sales. The company raised its sales and earnings outlook for 2024 when it reported third-quarter results in October 2024.\n\nCardiovascular drug Entresto sales witnessed a solid year-over-year surge in the third quarter of 2024, driven by robust demand-led growth, with increased penetration in the United States and Europe following guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure, as well as in China with increased penetration in hypertension. The momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Entresto's fourth-quarter sales are pegged at $2 billion and $1.97 billion, respectively.\n\nCosentyx\u2019s sales have also likely witnessed a surge, driven by recent launches, including the hidradenitis suppurativa indication (HS) and the intravenous formulation (IV) in the United States, and volume growth in core indications.\n\nBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Cosentyx's fourth-quarter sales are pegged at $1.7 billion.\n\nIncreased demand has likely fueled multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta\u2019s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for Kesimpta's fourth-quarter sales are pegged at $889 million and $895.4 million, respectively.\n\nThe stellar performance of the breast cancer drug Kisqali has likely fueled the top line in the fourth quarter. Sales should have grown strongly across all regions, based on increasing recognition of consistently reported overall survival in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.\n\nKisqali had earlier obtained FDA approval for a broad indication for HR+/HER2- stage II and III early breast cancer (eBC) at high risk of recurrence, approximately doubling the population eligible for CDK4/6 inhibitor adjuvant therapy, with the inclusion of those without nodal involvement. The label expansion of the drug has likely given additional impetus to sales.",

But the company said its therapy showed a \u201cclinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit\u201d extending progression-free survival versus everolimus. Treatment was \u201cwell-tolerated,\u201d ITM added.\n\nITM, which is short for Isotope Technologies Munich, plans to present full trial data at an upcoming medical conference. The company also intends to discuss an approval application with the Food and Drug Administration this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nITM is a veteran member of a research field that, over the past few years, has undergone a renaissance of investment and industry interest. The company has directly benefited from this boom, receiving $205 million in new funding from a syndicate of private investors seven months ago.\n\nUnlike some other radiopharma drugmakers, ITM supplies the radioisotopes these drugs contain as well as develops them into therapies of its own.\n\nITM-11, the drug that ITM says succeeded in the Phase 3 neuroendocrine cancer study, contains the isotope lutetium-177, which is packaged together with a compound that targets a protein known as the somatostatin receptor. Both the isotope and the target of ITM-11 are the same as Lutathera, an approved radiopharmaceutical sold by Novartis.\n\nIn an interview last June, former ITM CEO Steffen Schuster acknowledged ITM-11 will compete with Lutathera, but noted how he hopes the arrival of his company\u2019s medicine will grow the overall market. \u201cThere are so many patients who could get this treatment who don\u2019t get treatment,\u201d said Schuster, who stepped down Sept. 1.\n\nITM\u2019s study, dubbed Compete, enrolled 309 people with inoperable neuroendocrine tumors that originated in the gut or pancreas and were positive for the targeted somatostatin receptor. Participants in the trial received either ITM-11 or everolimus for up to 30 months, or until their cancer progressed.\n\n\u201cThe patients included represent a real-life scenario, and the Compete study evaluates the important question of which therapy might be used first to provide greater benefit to patients,\u201d Jaume Capdevila, a study investigator and senior medical oncologist at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, said in a statement provided by ITM.\n\nITM is also studying ITM-11 in other forms of these so-called GEP-NET tumors, as well as in children with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors.",

But Steinfeld is gearing up for another arena.\n\nSteinfeld is teaming up with pharmaceutical company Novartis to raise awareness about breast cancer with a bold and empowering commercial that will air on one of the biggest platforms in the world, during Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans on Feb. 9.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been on my bucket list to be in a Super Bowl commercial,\u201d Steinfeld told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI cannot think of one that I could possibly feel more proud and honored to be apart of than this with Novartis.\u201d\n\nAD METER 2025: Register to vote on this year's best Super Bowl commercials\n\nThe Super Bowl is more than just a football game. It's a cultural phenomenon that transcends sports entirely, drawing in hundreds of millions of viewers who tune in not only for the championship matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, but the clever commercials and equally entertaining halftime show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to know that this is going to be entering so many people\u2019s homes,\" she added. \"Wherever they may be watching the game from, they are going to see this ad and I\u2019m confident it's going to grab their attention.\"\n\nEarly detection is a game changer\n\nOf the 120 million people who are estimated to tune into Super Bowl 59, nearly half are projected to be women, a demographic that continues to grow year after year. It\u2019s the perfect stage to promote early detection and breast cancer screening, a cause that Steinfeld said is \"incredibly important\" and personal to her.\n\n\u201dThis commercial is going to serve as a conversation starter between men and women,\" Steinfeld said. \u201cI hope (women) feel empowered. I hope they feel encouraged to go to YourAttentionPlease.com, take an assessment, understand their risk, understand their body, their health, their history and be inspired and encouraged to share it with others.\"\n\nBreast cancer is the second-most common type of cancer diagnosed in U.S. women, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. One in eight women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, approximately 13% of the female population in the country. But early detection can lead to a more than 99% survival rate.\n\n\u201cExpanding access to screening and early detection of breast cancer is not only a cornerstone of our mission but a critical lifeline that improves survival rates,\u201d Paula Schneider, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen, said in a press release. \u201cWorking with Novartis, we\u2019re committed to driving education and action while supporting women in their journey. The more we can do as a collective, the more lives we will save. It will take industry, advocacy and countless other stakeholders to reduce barriers and increase screening rates, but it all starts with channeling our attention to what matters \u2013 breast health, for all of us and our loved ones.\"\n\nSteinfeld is engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, who narrowly missed an opportunity to play in Super Bowl 59 after the Bills' 32-29 loss to the Chiefs in the AFC championship game on Sunday. The couple announced their engagement in a joint Instagram post in November.\n\n\"Time is precious and to be able to spend it doing things that we love and things we are inspired by and things we are moved by is so important,\" Steinfeld said. \"In this case, I couldn\u2019t be more grateful and honored to be apart of this much bigger conversation to help spread awareness for breast cancer.\"\n\nAD METER 2025: Vote on best commercials\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

            "content": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation v. Torrent Pharma Inc., No. 23-2218 (Fed. Cir. 2025) \u2014 On January 10, 2025, the Federal Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s opinion that claims of a Novartis patent are invalid for lack of adequate written description, but affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the claims were not proven invalid for lacking enablement or being obvious over the asserted prior art. The Federal Circuit emphasized that the proper analysis for enablement and written description challenges is focused on the claims and after-arising technology need not be enabled or described in the specification\u2014even when the after-arising technology is found to infringe the claims because the issues of patentability and infringement are distinct. \u201cIt is only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (\u201cNovartis\u201d) sued multiple defendants accusing them of infringing all claims (1-4) of U.S. Patent No. 8,101,659 (\u201cthe \u2019659 patent\u201d) titled \u201cMethods of treatment and pharmaceutical composition.\u201d The \u2019659 patent relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of valsartan and sacubitril, which Novartis markets and sells as a treatment for heart failure under the brand name Entresto\u00ae.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware found that although the claims of the \u2019659 patent were not shown to be invalid as being obvious, indefinite, nor lacking enablement, the claims were shown to be invalid for lacking a written description. The district court \u201cconstrued the asserted claims [of the \u2019659 patent] to cover valsartan and sacubitril as a physical combination and as a complex.\u201d After claim construction, defendants MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MSN Laboratories Private Ltd., and MSN Life Sciences Private Ltd. stipulated to infringement of the as-construed claims. However, the district court found that since complexes of valsartan and sacubitril (which included the accused product) were unknown to a person of ordinary skill in the art as of the priority date of the \u2019659 patent (i.e., the accused product was an after-arising technology), \u201cNovartis scientists, by definition, could not have possession of, and disclose, the subject matter of such complexes . . . and therefore, axiomatically Novartis cannot satisfy the written description requirement for such complexes.\u201d\n\nNovartis appealed the district court\u2019s determination of invalidity.\n\nIssues\n\nThe primary issues on appeal were:\n\nWhether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of written description? Whether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of enablement? Whether the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid as being obvious?\n\nHoldings and Reasoning\n\n1. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of written description.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found that the district court clearly erred in finding that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are invalid for lack of a written description. Specifically, the Federal Circuit found the district court erred when it \u201cconstrued [the claims] to cover complexes of valsartan and sacubitril.\u201d And the district court\u2019s written description analysis under this construction to be incorrect with respect to complexes of valsartan and sacubitril.\n\nThe Federal Circuit noted that the issue is whether the \u2019659 patent describes what is claimed (i.e., a pharmaceutical composition comprising valsartan and sacubitril administered in combination). And that the issue is not whether the \u2019659 patent describes complexes of valsartan and sacubitril\u2014because the \u2019659 patent does not claim complexes of valsartan and sacubitril. The Federal Circuit found that by stating the claims of the \u2019659 patent were \u201cconstrued to cover complexes of valsartan and sacubitril,\u201d the district court \u201cerroneously conflated the distinct issues of patentability and infringement.\u201d The Federal Circuit explained that \u201cclaims are not construed \u2018to cover\u2019 or \u2018not to cover\u2019 the accused product. . . . It is only after the claims have been construed without reference to the accused device that the claims, as so construed, are applied to the accused device to determine infringement.\u201d The Federal Circuit found that \u201cthe \u2019659 patent could not have been construed as claiming [] complexes [of valsartan and sacubitril] as a matter of law\u201d because it was undisputed that the accused product was unknown at the time of the invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found that since the district court gave the disputed claim term its plain and ordinary meaning during claim construction (i.e., \u201cwherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination\u201d), the \u2019659 patent need only to adequately describe combinations of valsartan and sacubitril to satisfy the written description requirement.\n\nThe Federal Circuit further found that the \u2019659 patent \u201cplainly described [combinations of valsartan and sacubitril] throughout the specification\u201d and that accordingly, the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as lacking a written description.\n\n2. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement.\n\nThe Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement \u201cfor reasons similar to those that led us to reverse its written description determination: a specification must only enable the claimed invention.\u201d The Federal Circuit found that \u201cbecause the \u2019659 patent does not expressly claim complexes, and because the parties do not otherwise dispute that the \u2019659 patent enables that which it does claim . . . [the defendants] failed to show that the claims are invalid for lack of enablement.\u201d\n\nIn affirming the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid for lack of enablement, the Federal Circuit agreed with the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cvalsartan sacubitril complexes . . . are part of a \u2018later-existing state of the art\u2019 that \u2018may not be properly considered in the enablement analysis.\u2019\u201d\n\n3. The claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as being obvious.\n\nThe Federal Circuit found \u201cno clear error warranting reversal of the district court\u2019s obviousness analysis\u201d and thus affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the claims of the \u2019659 patent are not invalid as being obvious. The Federal Circuit agreed that the district court\u2019s rejection of the defendants\u2019 two theories of obviousness: (1) that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to modify a prior art therapy with valsartan and sacubitril to arrive at the claimed invention; and (2) that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to individually select and combine sacubitril and valsartan from two different prior-art references to arrive at the claimed invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit distinguished the cases defendants relied upon: Nalproprion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., 934 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2019) and BTG International Ltd. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, 923 F.3d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Federal Circuit reasoned that in Nalproprion and Actavis, the prior art showed that the claimed drugs \u201cwere both together and individually considered promising . . . treatments at the time of the invention.\u201d In contrast, the district court found that \u201cthere was no motivation in the relied-upon prior art to combine valsartan and sacubitril, let alone with any reasonable expectation of success.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit agreed \u201cwith the district court that [the defendants\u2019] obviousness theories impermissibly use valsartan and sacubitril as a starting point and \u2018retrace[] the path of the inventor with hindsight.\u2019\u201d",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Biological Drugs - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Biological Drugs was estimated at US$345.3 Billion in 2023 and is projected to reach US$634.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2023 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\nBiological drugs have transformed the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes by offering highly targeted, effective therapies. Biologics are also at the forefront of precision medicine, enabling treatments to be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, which enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces side effects.\n\nHow Is the R&D Pipeline Shaping the Future of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe biological drugs market is witnessing significant innovation, particularly in monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and therapeutic proteins. New biologics are being developed to address unmet medical needs, especially in areas like oncology, neurology, and rare genetic disorders. Advances in biotechnology, including CRISPR and CAR-T therapies, are allowing for the development of personalized biologics that can modify disease pathways or even repair defective genes. The growing number of biologics in the development pipeline, coupled with advances in manufacturing techniques like continuous bioprocessing, is making it easier to produce biologics at scale, which will be key to meeting global healthcare needs in the future.\n\n\n\nHow Is the Adoption of Biological Drugs Impacting Healthcare Systems?\n\n\n\nAs biologics become more prevalent in treating chronic and life-threatening diseases, they are reshaping healthcare delivery systems. However, their high cost has led to challenges in terms of affordability and accessibility, particularly in developing markets. To address this, biosimilars - essentially, cheaper, highly similar versions of biologic drugs - are gaining traction.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of biosimilars is expected to reduce the overall healthcare burden and make these life-saving treatments more accessible to a broader population. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to facilitate the approval and market entry of biosimilars, which could significantly influence pricing dynamics and competition in the biological drugs market.\n\n\n\nWhat Role Does Regulatory Approval Play in the Expansion of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe regulatory landscape for biological drugs is a critical factor in market growth. Stringent approval processes ensure that biologics meet the highest safety and efficacy standards, which can be a lengthy and expensive endeavor for drug manufacturers. However, as regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) streamline pathways for both biologics and biosimilars, the pace of approvals has increased, particularly for drugs targeting rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Favorable regulations and accelerated approval processes for orphan drugs and breakthrough therapies are helping to bring innovative biologics to market more quickly, contributing to the overall expansion of this sector.\n\n\n\nThe growth in the biological drugs market is driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the rise of precision medicine, and advancements in biotechnological research. The growing demand for personalized therapies that offer more effective treatment with fewer side effects is a major driver.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of novel biologics for rare and complex conditions, along with favorable government policies supporting biologics R&D, is boosting market expansion. The rise of biosimilars is also playing a critical role, as they are poised to increase market accessibility and reduce treatment costs, thereby further driving growth in the biologics segment.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2023 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of major players in the Global Biological Drugs Market such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Biogen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and more.\n\nComplimentary Updates: Receive free report updates for one year to keep you informed of the latest market developments.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nMarket Growth: Understand the significant growth trajectory of the Therapeutic Protein segment, which is expected to reach US$289.1 Billion by 2030 with a CAGR of a 10.3%.

Cunningham explained the firm is being very intentional on the activities they can and should control internally versus those that a vendor can handle.\n\nOn the learned experience, Cunningham told delegates, \"I'm investing in market access and market research earlier. I'm buying data earlier. All those things that I now know about, I can obviously apply them a lot earlier.\"\n\nBalance during early phase development\n\nOne of the challenges biotech companies can face is balancing the focus between technical development and commercial planning, said Abdullah. Cunningham agreed: \u201cI see that as a pitfall all the time, where companies focus on the technical aspects and getting the product through the clinic but ignore how they're going to get it onto the market.\u201d\n\nShe said no matter the path to commercialization (out-license, selling assets or go-to-market themselves) it is crucial to understand that path, its challenges, and have a clear direction on how the product will be prescribed, reimbursed, distributed.\n\nCunningham shared that balance may have been inherently easier in her situation. Chief technical officer and co-founder of Shorla, Orlaith Ryan, focuses on product development with regulatory and clinical decisions.\n\nAs the only person making those decisions early on, she surrounded herself with experts in various fields, which she said was key. \u201cIf you're in a position to be able to appoint board members, ensure that you have a commercial presence early on. You need that voice and that person that will back you up when it comes to commercial discussions.\"\n\nShe also relied on a network of reimbursement, market access and other consultants and experts to build an advisory team. She noted that these are just some ways to make decisions cost-effectively, but you do have to focus on it.\n\nFaruk Abdullah, president, professional services & CBO for Eversana, was clear that there is not one path to early commercialization choices, which are heavily dependent on the type of product and market dynamics. However, he shared that an iterative approach seems to work very well.\n\n\u201cStart with broad strokes [\u2026] the key points or topics that will have the greatest disproportionate impact on the commercial potential of the product.\n\n\u201cUsually around Phase II, Phase III that would be pricing and reimbursement. Make sure you get a healthy access environment based on the data you're generating that will connect to value.\u201d",

Palbociclib extended median progression-free survival by more than 15 months, potentially extending the use of this CDK4/6 inhibitor to patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer as initial therapy combined with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal women or with fulvestrant in patients who experienced disease progression after endocrine therapy.\n\n\n\nOtto Metzger, MD\n\n\u201cPATINA is the first phase III trial to show that the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib was of benefit as first-line maintenance therapy in HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy,\u201d said Otto Metzger, MD, study principal investigator. \u201cThese results suggest that palbociclib overcomes resistance to anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy. The data support the potential of this maintenance treatment to slow disease progression and improve clinical outcomes in this patient population. This may represent a new standard of care for patients diagnosed with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\u201d Dr. Metzger is Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\n\nHR-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for about 10% of all breast cancers. Most patients who are treated with the standard of care will develop resistance to anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy, and there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for this subtype.\n\nStudy Details\n\nThe randomized, open-label, international, phase III PATINA trial was sponsored by the Alliance Foundation Trials, in collaboration with six international cancer research groups in the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand. Patients were enrolled with histologically confirmed HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and no prior therapy in the advanced setting; they received six to eight cycles of induction chemotherapy with anti-HER2-therapy and chemotherapy. If there was no evidence of disease progression, they were randomly assigned to receive anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy plus palbociclib (n = 261) or anti-HER2-therapy and endocrine therapy alone (n = 257). Options for endocrine therapy included aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant; ovarian suppression was required for premenopausal patients.\n\nStratification factors were pertuzumab use (yes or no); prior anti-HER2 therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting (yes or no); response to induction therapy (complete response or partial response vs stable disease); and type of endocrine therapy (fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitor). Median patient age was 53, and the majority were White. Nearly all patients (97%) received pertuzumab; about 28.2% received prior anti-HER2 therapy; 90% received an aromatase inhibitor; and 68.5% achieved a complete or partial response as best response to induction treatment prior to randomization.\n\nData cutoff for this analysis was October 2024. A total of 97.3% of patients received dual anti-HER2 therapy, and 90.9% received an aromatase inhibitor. The final analysis of the primary endpoint\u2014investigator-assessed progression-free survival\u2014was performed at a median follow-up of 53 months.\n\nKey Results\n\nThe addition of palbociclib significantly improved progression-free survival by 26% compared with the control arm. Median progression-free survival was 44 months in the palbociclib arm compared with 29 months in the control arm. Palbociclib performed better in all stratification groups.\n\nConfirmed objective response rate was 29.2% in the palbociclib arm compared with 22.2% in the control arm, respectively (P = .046). The clinical benefit rate was 89.3% in the palbociclib arm vs 81.3% in controls.\n\nThe most frequent adverse event in the palbociclib-containing arm was grade 3 neutropenia (63.2% vs 2% in controls). Additionally, grade 2 and 3 fatigue, stomatitis, and diarrhea occurred in more patients on the palbociclib arm (28.3% vs 12.9%, respectively; 21.4% vs 1.2%, respectively; 37.5% vs 12.1%, respectively). The incidence of grade \u2265 4 adverse events was similar across study arms (12.3% vs 8.9% for palbociclib-containing arm vs control; P = .21). No treatment-related deaths were reported in either arm of the study.\n\nAt this time, overall survival remains immature. Median overall survival was not reached in the palbociclib arm vs 77 months in the control arm. The 5-year survival rates were 74.3% vs 69.8% in the palbociclib and control arms, respectively.\n\nAdditional Commentary\n\n\n\nVirginia Kaklamani, MD\n\nAt a press conference where these late-breaking results were revealed, Virginia Kaklamani, MD, Co-Director of SABCS and leader of the Breast Cancer Program at UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, said the median progression-free survival approaching 4 years \u201cshows that patients can tolerate this treatment, and it continues to work for at least 4 years. The message from the control arm is that the progression-free survival of 29 months supports the common use of the addition of endocrine therapy in this patient population. Hopefully, we will be able to add palbociclib soon.\u201d\n\nDr. Kaklamani continued: \u201cThis study is extremely important. We know that patients with HER2-positive disease live a long time. It\u2019s a chronic disease that I describe as a marathon, not a sprint. Giving patients chemotherapy for a long time is detrimental to their quality of life. This regimen is more tolerable. We are trying to tackle two pathways at once with our treatments: the estrogen receptor pathway and the HER2 pathway. The good news is that these less toxic regimens help maintain quality of life for a long period of time,\u201d she stated.\n\n\n\nSara A. Hurvitz, MD, FACP\n\nEXPERT POINT OF VIEW\n\nFormal discussant of the presentation on the AFT-38 PATINA trial, Sara A. Hurvitz, MD, FACP, of the University of Washington School of Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, explained that data supporting the rationale for PATINA have been available for about 15 years. \u201cThe wide acceptance that HER2 is the driver of HER2-positive breast cancer may have limited the development of other therapies, with the exception of hormonal therapies for estrogen receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. There is ample evidence of the crosstalk between the estrogen receptor and HER2. Inhibiting CDK4/6 plus anti-HER2 therapy is synergistic and has an anticancer effect,\u201d she explained.\n\nDr. Hurvitz shared these comments on the PATINA results: \u201cThese data are impressive. The median progression-free survival of 29.1 months in the control arm is historic. Though it is important to note that since only patients with stable disease or a complete and partial response to induction chemotherapy were included, patients with primary resistance were eliminated. This may be the reason that progression-free survival was so high in both arms. The safety was reassuring, and we await patient-reported outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be moving away from a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to HER2-positive breast cancer,\u201d predicted Dr. Hurvitz. \u201cThis study provides definitive proof that there is benefit to targeting more than just the HER2 pathway in HER2-positive breast cancer. We need the right treatment for the right patient.\u201d\n\nDISCLOSURE: The AFT-38 PATINA trial was sponsored by Alliance Foundation Trials and conducted with support from Pfizer.

Higher demand for novel treatments and rehabilitation equipment accelerates market growth.\n\nSports medicine is a medical branch that works on the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of injuries associated with physical activity as well as sports. Such a field involves the usage of medical, physical, and therapy techniques to improve athletic performance in addition to managing injuries. Sports medicine specialists include medical doctors, physical therapists, athletic trainers, and other health providers who work together to heal different injuries, from common sprains to more dangerous fractures and joint problems.\n\nSports medicine assists athletes in the healing process from injuries, recovery time, and overall performance. Common treatments include physical therapy, joint injections, and surgical interventions when necessary. It also involves injury prevention strategies such as proper training techniques, warm-up routines, and equipment recommendations. Apart from professional athletes, sports medicine benefits people involved in recreational activities or surgery recovery. It promotes general health, fitness, and injury-free sports and physical activity participation and leads to a healthier lifestyle and better quality of life.\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Sports Medicine Market\n\nIncreasing Participation in Sports and Fitness Activities\n\nThe increasing global emphasis on fitness and wellness drives the demand for sports medicine. With more people involving themselves in professional sports as well as recreational fitness pursuits, there is a growing demand to prevent injuries, treat existing injuries, and rehabilitate injuries. Athletes and fitness fanatics generally require sports medicine solutions in the form of restoration after injuries, optimization for improved performance, and general physical condition improvement. The increasing education towards fitness and injury maintenance alongside higher participation in activities across all levels greatly favors growth in the market.\n\nTechnologies in Treatment and Rehabilitation\n\nMedical technologies that include innovative techniques such as regenerative medicine, minimally invasive surgeries, and advanced physiotherapy techniques are changing sports medicine. Advances in stem cell therapy, cryotherapy, and laser therapy have dramatically changed the face of recovery time and injury management. Additionally, wearable devices and AI-powered diagnostic tools improve the accuracy and effectiveness of sports medicine. All these enable quicker recovery, more precise treatments, and personalized care for athletes, thus increasing the adoption of sports medicine solutions across sectors.\n\nRise in Sports-Related Injuries\n\nThe higher the participation in competitive sports, fitness regimes, and outdoor activities, the more the cases of sports-related injuries are increasing. Ligament tears, fractures, strains, and sprains are some common types of injuries that are increasing and hence demanding more services related to sports medicine.\n\nThe market will experience growth due to a growing awareness of the necessity of specialized care in order to treat and manage such injuries effectively. As a result, the sports medicine industry continues growing due to the increasing rate of injuries. More than 3.5 million children ages 14 and younger get hurt annually playing sports or participating in recreational activities. In the United States, around 30 million children and adolescents participate in some form of organized sports.\n\nChallenges in the Sports Medicine Market\n\nHigh Cost of Treatments and Services\n\nSports medicine treatments, advanced surgeries, rehabilitation programs, and new therapies like stem cell injections or regenerative medicine are often very expensive. Some patients cannot afford these services because of the high cost, especially in low-income or underdeveloped areas. Specialized sports medicine treatments are not covered by many healthcare systems, and therefore there is a financial barrier to access. The high cost of the most recent equipment, consultations with experienced professionals, and long-term rehabilitation programs may discourage the adoption rate, especially for casual athletes or those without complete insurance cover.\n\nInadequate Training Professionals and Infrastructure\n\nThere is a shortage of skilled specialists who include sports physicians, physical therapists, and rehabilitation personnel. Many areas lack appropriate infrastructure and facilities to ensure comprehensive care for sports-related injuries, especially in rural and underserved regions. Moreover, sports medicine is rapidly changing and has to be educated continuously and trained about the latest techniques and technology. The shortage of skilled practitioners and available resources in sports medicine hinders its popularity and affects market growth as well as the delivery of appropriate treatment to patients.\n\nBody Monitoring & Evaluation in the Sports Medicine Industry\n\nThe application of advanced technology in body monitoring and assessment in sports medicine involves monitoring and evaluating an athlete\u2019s physical condition, performance, and recovery. Wearable devices such as fitness trackers and smart clothing collect data regarding heart rate, body temperature, muscle activity, and movement patterns. Data collected by wearable devices is used by medical professionals to identify potential injuries, optimize training regimens, and enhance recovery strategies. Continuous monitoring of an athlete\u2019s body allows sports medicine professionals to provide individualized care, prevent injuries, and improve overall performance, making body evaluation an essential component of modern sports medicine.\n\nFoot and ankle injuries are common in sports and are a significant focus of sports medicine\n\nSports-related injuries are common due to the physical demands put on the foot and ankle while running, jumping, and making quick direction changes. Injuries range from sprains, strains, fractures, tendonitis, and ligament tears. Such injuries may severely impact the performance of an athlete and their recovery. Sports medicine is the practice of diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitating injuries through techniques such as physical therapy, surgery, and advanced therapies like cryotherapy or stem cell treatments. Effective management is crucial for athletes to recover fully, return to competition, and prevent future injuries to the foot and ankle.\n\nHospitals have become the leading segment in the sports medicine Market\n\nHospitals have become a leading segment in the sports medicine market due to their advanced facilities, skilled specialists, and comprehensive care capabilities. As sports-related injuries increase, hospitals increasingly offer specialized sports medicine services, including diagnosis, surgical treatments, rehabilitation, and recovery programs.

            "content": "The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a district court\u2019s ruling of invalidity for lack of written description, finding that the district court erred in its analysis of written description because patents must be evaluated based on the claims themselves, not on their construction. In re Entresto, Case No. 23-2218 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 10, 2025) (Lourie, Prost, Reyna, JJ.)\n\nNovartis owns an approved new drug application (NDA) for a combination therapy of valsartan and sacubitril that Novartis markets under the brand name Entresto\u00ae. The term \u201ccombination therapy\u201d is used to describe pharmaceuticals where two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients are combined in a single method of treatment. Entresto\u00ae is protected by several patents, including the patent at issue. Several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, including MSN, filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) seeking to market generic versions of Entresto\u00ae prior to the expiration of Novartis\u2019 patent. Novartis sued for infringement.\n\nA unique property of Entresto\u00ae is the specific form taken by the active pharmaceutical ingredients, valsartan and sacubitril. The valsartan and sacubitril in Entresto\u00ae are present in what is known as a \u201ccomplex,\u201d meaning the two drugs are bonded together by weak, noncovalent bonds. At issue before the district court was the construction of the claim term \u201cwherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination.\u201d The inquiry focused on whether \u201cin combination\u201d required the valsartan and sacubitril to be chemically separated molecules (not in the form of a complex). The district court adopted Novartis\u2019 proposal to give the term its plain and ordinary meaning because the intrinsic record was silent as to whether the molecules must be separate and not complexed. The complexed form of valsartan and sacubitril was not developed until four years after the priority date of the patent.\n\nAfter the district court declined to adopt MSN\u2019s \u201ccomplexed\u201d claim construction, MSN stipulated to infringement. The case proceeded to a bench trial on the issue of validity. The district court found the patent not invalid for obviousness, lack of enablement, and indefiniteness. However, the district court ruled that because the patent did not disclose the complexed form of valsartan and sacubitril, it was invalid for lack of written description. Novartis appealed.\n\nNovartis argued that a complex of valsartan and sacubitril was an after-arising invention that need not have been enabled or described. The Federal Circuit agreed, finding that because the patent did not claim the complexed form of valsartan and sacubitril, those complexes need not have been described. The Court cited its \u201clong-recognized\u201d rule that \u201cthe invention is, for purposes of the written description inquiry, whatever is now claimed.\u201d All that was required to meet the written description requirement was a disclosure sufficient to show that the inventors possessed a pharmaceutical composition comprising valsartan and sacubitril administered in combination. The Federal Circuit found that by considering what the claims were \u201cconstrued to cover,\u201d the district court improperly conflated the distinct issues of patentability and infringement. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s finding of invalidity for lack of written description.\n\nHaving found no reversible error, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the patent was not invalid for obviousness or lack of enablement. The parties did not address definiteness on appeal.",

            "content": "On January 10, 2025, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a precedential opinion in Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Torrent Pharma Inc., reversing a lower court decision that claims of a Novartis patent covering its blockbuster drug Entresto were invalid for lack of written description, and affirming the lower court\u2019s decision that the claims were not proven invalid for lack of enablement or obviousness. An issue addressed in the opinion is the role of after-arising technology in the written description and enablement analyses \u2013 namely, that such technologies need not be described nor enabled, but may still be \u201ccovered\u201d by the claims, and thus infringed, as was the case here. In addition, in reaching its written description conclusion, the court emphasized that claim scope is a separate issue from infringement, a distinction the court also drew in its recent precedential decision regarding Orange Book listings in Teva v. Amneal.\n\nBackground\n\nNovartis sued a host of generic companies, including MSN Pharmaceuticals, in the US District Court for the District of Delaware under the Hatch-Waxman Act after receiving notice they were seeking US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market and sell generic versions of Entresto. These cases were consolidated in multidistrict litigation in front of Judge Richard G. Andrews.\n\nEntresto is an oral combination of sacubitril and valsartan used to treat heart failure in various patient populations. Importantly, Entresto includes the two active ingredients \u2013 sacubitril and valsartan \u2013 in a form referred to as a \u201ccomplex,\u201d which combines the two drugs into a single unit through noncovalent bonds.1\n\nNovartis\u2019s US Patent No. 8,101,659 (the \u2019659 patent) was the centerpiece of the case. The \u2019659 patent explains the benefit of combination therapy of valsartan, a known angiotensin receptor blocker that reduces blood-vessel constriction, and sacubitril, which is a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor that also reduces blood vessel constriction but through another pathway. The patent explains that not every combination of drugs with these features will be advantageous, but that this specific combination therapy is effective and has less side effects.\n\nNovartis asserted all four of the \u2019659 patent\u2019s claims. Independent claim one recites:\n\n1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising:\n\n(i) the AT 1-antagonist valsartan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;\n\n(ii) the NEP inhibitor [sacubitril] or [sacubitrilat] or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and\n\n(iii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier;\n\n(iv) wherein said (i) AT 1-antagonist valsartan or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and said (ii) NEP inhibitor [sacubitril] or [sacubitrilat] or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are administered in combination in about a 1:1 ratio.\n\nClaim 2 specifies that the combination is used to treat hypertension or heart failure. Claim 3 recites that the NEP inhibitor in the combination is sacubitril, and claim 4, which depends from claim 3, requires the combination be in a capsule or tablet.\n\nThe parties disputed the claim term \u201cwherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination.\u201d The district court agreed with Novartis and applied the term\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning. In rejecting MSN\u2019s construction that would require administration of valsartan and sacubitril \u201cas two separate components,\u201d the court remarked that the specification \u201cis silent\u201d on whether the two claimed actives must be chemically distinct or if they may form a complex. The district court noted that \u201cthe absence of any indication in the written description that the patentee limited its invention solely to separate compounds means, in context, that a person of ordinary skill in the art [] would not read the claims as so limited.\u201d The district court also referenced Novartis\u2019s statement to the US Patent Office in its patent term extension application that the claims encompass Entresto, which is \u201cnon-separate, complexed valsartan and sacubitril.\u201d\n\nBased on the district court\u2019s ordinary meaning construction, MSN stipulated to infringement. MSN raised multiple invalidity defenses, including obviousness, lack of written description and nonenablement.\n\nThe district court held a three-day bench trial on validity. 2 The district court rejected MSN\u2019s nonenablement theory that a \u201ccomplex\u201d of valsartan and sacubitril, which were covered by the claims, were not enabled. The district court reasoned that after-arising technology \u2013 such as valsartan-sacubitril \u201ccomplexes\u201d that were unknown at the priority date \u2013 may not be considered in the enablement analysis, relying on extensive case law, including Chiron Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 363 F.3d 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Because of this, the district court held that the complexes need not be enabled by the specification.\n\nOn the other hand, the district court held that the claims lacked written description support, specifically with respect to the complex of valsartan and sacubitril. The district court reasoned that \u201cthe facts that helped [Novartis] with respect to enablement proved fatal for written description.\u201d It remarked that it was undisputed that the claimed complexes were unknown to a person of skill in the art, and therefore Novartis cannot satisfy the written description for those complexes.\n\nThe district court also rejected MSN\u2019s obviousness theories related to the combination of valsartan and sacubitril, finding they hinged on impermissible hindsight.\n\nNovartis appealed the district court\u2019s findings regarding written description. MSN cross-appealed for the court\u2019s determinations on obviousness and enablement.\n\nThe Federal Circuit decision\n\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision first addressed the written description issue and initially focused on the meaning and scope of the claim term \u201cin combination.\u201d In doing so, it noted \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the \u2019659 patent describes valsartan-sacubitril complexes.\u201d Stating that, \u201c[b]ecause the \u2019659 patent does not claim valsartan-sacubitril complexes, those complexes do not need have been described.\u201d The court went on to explain how the \u2019659 patent plainly describes its invention as referring to \u201ccombinations\u201d and \u201ccombination therapy\u201d; thus, the use of the two actives in combination, as expressly claimed, was supported by an adequate written description.\n\nThe complex of the two actives as utilized in Entresto, however, the Federal Circuit remarked was not discovered until four years after the priority date of the \u2019659 patent, and that complex \u201cis not what is claimed.\u201d The Court noted that by construing the claims to cover complexes of valsartan and sacubitril, \u201cthe district court erroneously conflated the distinct issues of patentability and infringement, which led it astray in evaluating written description.\u201d It noted that claim interpretation must be done \u201cat the time of invention,\u201d and because the complexes at issue were unknown at the time of the invention, as a matter of law, the \u2019659 patent cannot be construed as claiming them.\n\nThe court went on to affirm the district court\u2019s findings regarding nonenablement and obviousness. Regarding enablement, the court emphasized that a specification need only enable the claimed invention (here, sacubitril and valsartan administered \u201cin combination\u201d), and that later-discovered technology (such as the specific complexes of sacubitril and valsartan in Entresto) cannot be used to \u201creach back\u201d and invalidate the claims.\n\nThe Federal Circuit also found the claims not proved obvious. In particular, the court found there was no motivation to combine valsartan and sacubitril with an expectation of success when sacubitril was one of many neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, it had never been administered to humans, and other neutral endopeptidase inhibitors presented discouraging results in humans. These facts distinguished other cases holding combination treatments obvious when both the claimed drugs were \u201ctogether and individually considered promising \u2026 treatments at the time [of the invention].\u201d\n\nWhat remains\n\nThe instant patent case is just one of many interesting issues involving Entresto that are relevant in the field. The \u2019659 patent expired on January 15, 2025, but its life would be effectively extended for six months because the FDA awarded pediatric exclusivity. With the expiration date in mind, on January 13, 2025, Novartis requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting MSN from launching its generic product, which had received final FDA approval while the appeal was pending. Novartis is seeking relief under \u00a7 271(e)(4)(A) to effectively reset the date of MSN\u2019s final approval to coincide with the expiration of pediatric exclusivity.\n\nOn January 16, 2025, the Federal Circuit temporarily enjoined MSN from launching \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The next day, MSN requested that the Federal Circuit allow it to launch, challenging Novartis\u2019s reliance on pediatric exclusivity and stating that Novartis\u2019s entitlement to pediatric exclusivity is an \u201copen and unresolved issue.\u201d The timing of the Federal Circuit mandate \u2013 and what the mandate means in terms of MSN\u2019s infringement position \u2013 are among the many issues raised by the parties in this hotly contested launch dispute. The pharmaceutical community will surely stay tuned for developments in and the outcome of this latest dispute involving Entresto.\n\nNotes",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBioAge Labs is returning to its aging roots after a failed attempt in obesity R&D. To get the ball rolling again, the biotech has entered into a multi-year research collaboration worth up to $550 million with Novartis to identify and validate drug targets related to aging, specifically around exercise biology.\n\nSince its founding a decade ago, BioAge has targeted what it calls the \u201cbiology of human aging.\u201d It hopped on the obesity bandwagon with azelaprag, a small molecule pill that became its lead candidate.\n\nHowever, BioAge\u2019s obesity bet didn\u2019t pay off. The company discontinued its azelaprag trial in December after phase 2 data raised liver-related safety concerns, a move that CEO and co-founder Kristen Fortney called a \u201csignificant disappointment\u201d in a press release announcing the program\u2019s discontinuation.\n\nAlthough Fortney said the idea that BioAge is now going back to its aging roots is \u201cone way of thinking about it,\u201d she noted that every target, including obesity, is drawn from its AI-driven discovery platform.\n\n\u201cOur focus has always been on those molecular mechanisms of healthy aging, and of course once you get to clinical development and you\u2019re focused on a particular indication, like obesity, you can forget the genesis,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those were also targets that emerged from the platform originally.\u201d\n\nAs part of its Novartis partnership, BioAge will tap that platform, which analyzes longitudinal data from a human biobank, along with detailed health records, \u201cto identify and validate multiple novel therapeutic drug targets,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for targets that haven't been developed before.\" Kristen Fortney CEO, co-founder, BioAge Labs\n\n\u201cThey're one of the pharma companies excited about the potential of aging biology to bring us new targets to treat disease,\u201d Fortney said, pointing to Novartis\u2019 newly formed Diseases of Aging and Regenerative Medicine Group, noting they \u201chave very interesting human data sets of their own.\u201d\n\nA key element of the partnership is identifying the \u201cmolecular mediators of the benefits of exercise.\u201d Exercise can influence gene expression, but \u201cas you get older, your capacity to exercise goes down, and often your body's response to exercise goes down,\u201d Fortney said.\n\n\u201cIs there some other way you can induce gene changes to recapitulate some of the best benefits of exercise with a pill, with a drug?\u201d she asked.\n\nWhile the partnership is still in early stages and BioAge hasn\u2019t disclosed targets, Fortney said the company will choose to focus on those with a \u201cstrong link between the target and positive metabolic aging outcomes in our human cohort data and [where] we believe there\u2019s indications in the metabolic sphere where these targets could have applications.\u201d\n\nFortney said another key element of the partnership is a drive for new approaches.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for targets that haven't been developed before,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nWith so many companies flooding the obesity space, BioAge\u2019s stumble will likely be among the first of more to come. Amgen\u2019s obesity candidate, MariTide, squeaked through mid-stage development with phase 2 results that matched its potential competitors Zepbound and Wegovy, but indicated a potentially higher dropout rate among patients. Despite plans to advance into phase 3, the news sent shares tumbling in November.\n\nAnd BioAge\u2019s azelaprag saga isn\u2019t over. The biotech now faces a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege they were misled about the company\u2019s future. BioAge abandoned the azelaprag trial less than three months after closing an IPO in October.\n\nFortney declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe company also said it will \u201cshare updated plans for azelaprag\u201d in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, BioAge is looking to the future. In addition to the Novartis partnership, Fortney said the company will file an IND for its internally discovered NLRP3 inhibitors by the end of this year and move into the clinic.\n\n\u201cNLRP3 is an immune and brain aging target strongly linked to human longevity in our human data,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a target that shows promise in many different indications, from metabolic aging to brain aging.\u201d\n\nFortney also remains optimistic about the platform and the company\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of promising targets we want to advance for different indications related to metabolic aging,\u201d she said.",

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, he emphasised the company\u2019s commitment to India despite the domestic pharmaceutical market's relatively smaller size compared to global peers.\u201cFrom a market standpoint, we continue to watch and wait to see how the Indian pharmaceutical market evolves. It\u2019s still a relatively small market versus other global markets. Hopefully, the market will grow as the government invests more in healthcare and innovation. That\u2019s probably 10 years out,\u201d Narasimhan said.Earlier, CNBC-TV18 reported on September 26 that Alkem Laboratories , one of India\u2019s top pharmaceutical companies, had entered discussions to acquire Novartis India. The \u20b92,000-crore deal has since moved into advanced stages, with non-binding bids submitted by multiple players, including Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories and Zydus.This divestment, announced in February 2024, is part of Novartis AG\u2019s strategic review of its India operations. It is important to note that the sale pertains only to Novartis India Ltd, the public-listed entity, while Novartis Healthcare Pvt Ltd\u2014responsible for R&D and clinical trials at over 300 sites in India\u2014will remain unaffected.Despite the planned sale, Narasimhan highlighted the importance of the Indian market to Novartis\u2019 long-term strategy, underpinned by its robust R&D footprint in Hyderabad and collaborations with local players, such as Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories. Sources have told CNBC-TV18 that Dr. Reddy\u2019s is going neck and neck with Alkem in this race so far.Novartis India has delivered strong financial performance, with Q1 FY24 net profit soaring 91% YoY to \u20b9550 crore, alongside EBITDA margins improving to 20.1%. The divestment aligns with Novartis AG\u2019s global restructuring and realignment goals.On the global front, Narasimhan emphasized Novartis\u2019 robust pipeline and growth trajectory. \u201cI mean, 2024 was really one of our record years, both in terms of financial performance and our pipeline. We expect 2025 to continue that trend. We've really guided to consistent growth through the end of the decade,\" he added.

Chip Somodevilla | Afp | Getty Images\n\nEurope's CEOs appeared to watch on with envy as President Donald Trump overturned a slew of regulations on Monday, with a growing chorus of voices calling for similar moves on the continent. Trump wasted no time on his first day in office, announcing a series of executive orders designed to shore up key industries, including curbing electric vehicle production targets and accelerating oil and gas production. The returning president has long argued that regulation is stifling innovation and U.S. competitiveness, campaigning for a second term with pledges to roll back the red tape. And, in the face of a more assertive U.S. and increased global rivalry, European business leaders are echoing that view. Morten Wierod, CEO of Swiss robotics firm ABB , warned that excessive regulation and the associated high costs were pushing frontier businesses to relocate to other markets, ultimately risking the \"deindustrialization of Europe.\" \"It needs to be a clear reset on regulation and let business get on with it,\" Wierod told CNBC \"Squawk Box Europe\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Wierod added that European Union regulations, while often well-meaning, had become too bureaucratic and needed to be simplified to give firms the flexibility needed to innovate and grow.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Each regulation is set with good intentions. But it's when you take and you put everything together, it just becomes too much. It gets too complex,\" he said. Dutch bank ING 's CEO Steven van Rijswijk agreed that the bloc needs to simplify and harmonize regulation to boost investment and labor productivity, a growing bugbear for the continent. \"There are a lot of investments that are needed to be made in infrastructure, a lot of investments that need to be made in the strategic autonomy of Europe when it comes to tech infrastructure, those are the things that need stimulation,\" he said.\n\nTackling Europe's 'regulatory-first' approach\n\nThe EU has one of the strictest regulatory business environments globally, often priding itself on being a first-mover in developing guidelines to manage industries and protect consumers. However, Borje Ekholm, CEO of Swedish telecom firm Ericsson , said there was no merit in Europe's \"regulatory-first approach,\" arguing that it was curbing technological progress. \"I don't think you can be frontrunner in regulation, I don't think that creates value,\" he said. \"Where you have to be frontrunner is innovation, you need a framework that supports innovation. That's where the U.S. has been really successful \u2014 Europe needs that.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nEuropean policymakers appear aware of the need to innovate and deregulate in the face of burgeoning economic competition and rivalry from the U.S. and China, but have thus far been slow in moving. Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco said that Europe needs to \"wake up\" if it is to compete with other global markets, particularly now with a new U.S. administration in office. \"Europe is always lagging behind. It's always busy with itself,\" he said. \"In a world which is going very fast forward, with lots of innovation, it's a wake-up call, again, for Europe,\" he added. Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis' CEO Vas Narasimhan agreed that now marked a \"big moment\" for Europe, arguing that the bloc faces a fork in the road with two quite differing outcomes.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Europe has to decide now \u2014 in a world where the U.S. is so heavily deregulating and trying to increase competitiveness \u2014 is Europe going to continue to sit on its hands, continue to increase regulation in the Commission, increase regulation in the various individual countries. Or, are we finally going to get a more pro-competitive, pro-innovation environment in Europe,\" he said. \"We'll have to see. History suggests that while there's a lot of talk, not a lot of action comes out of the Commission. And right now, this is the moment.\"\n\nwatch now",

(\u201cPharming\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces today that the Board of Directors has nominated Fabrice Chouraqui to become Pharming\u2019s new Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Sijmen de Vries.\n\nPharming will nominate Mr. Chouraqui for the appointment as Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer for a term of four years at an upcoming Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM). Information regarding the EGM, including the notice to convene, will be shared shortly in a separate press release.\n\nUpon the appointment of Mr. Chouraqui, Sijmen de Vries will resign from the Board of Directors. To ensure a smooth hand-over of tasks and responsibilities, Mr. de Vries will remain a strategic advisor to the new CEO until December 31, 2025.\n\nDr. Richard Peters, Chairman of the Board of Directors, commented:\n\n\u201cAfter an extensive search, the Board and I are confident that Fabrice Chouraqui is the right candidate to lead Pharming and continue to implement our growth strategy, shaping Pharming into the rare disease company of choice. Fabrice is a deeply experienced global pharmaceutical and biotechnology executive, who brings a wealth of profound global expertise and experience, across the entire biopharmaceutical value chain, to Pharming.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would like to thank Sijmen de Vries for his great commitment to Pharming over the past 16 years and for creating the company that it is today, serving patients and paving the way for delivery on the company\u2019s strategy for growth. We are grateful that Sijmen will continue to be available through the end of the year to ensure a smooth hand-over with Fabrice.\u201d\n\nSijmen de Vries, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\n\u201cI am very pleased with the nomination of Fabrice Chouraqui as my successor. Fabrice brings strong leadership experience with global pharmaceutical companies and highly innovative biotechnology companies to Pharming. To make way for Fabrice to take over the executive leadership of the Company, I will resign from the Board of Directors upon the appointment of Fabrice by our shareholders. I look forward to supporting Fabrice, working closely together through the remainder of the year, and ensuring a smooth hand-over.\u201d\n\nFabrice Chouraqui commented:\n\n\u201cI am honored to have the opportunity to take over the leadership of Pharming, building on the strong foundation and joining at a time when I can help propel the company through its next stage of growth in the rare disease space. I am impressed by Pharming\u2019s growing portfolio of products and commercial opportunities which will pave the way for us to become the rare disease company of choice.\u201d\n\nProfile\n\nMr. Fabrice Chouraqui (date of birth: August 1, 1970, French national, U.S. citizen) is a global pharmaceutical executive with a record of value creation at Flagship Pioneering, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. A purpose-driven leader with a passion for bringing innovative treatments to patients, Mr. Chouraqui has a reputation for building strong followership in organizations. He is scientifically minded, with a deep understanding across the business spectrum, from research and development to access and commercialization, including strong expertise in investor management and business development.\n\nAcross his career, Mr. Chouraqui has led the launch of treatments in many therapeutic areas, including highly targeted specialty care drugs and large primary care medicines. He consistently demonstrates strategic and innovative thinking to achieve long-lasting results and has a strong record of developing next generation talents and highly diverse teams.\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Chouraqui was a CEO-Partner at Flagship Pioneering, one of the largest Biotech Venture Capital firms in the US. Mr. Chouraqui also served as CEO of Cellarity, Inc., one of the companies created by Flagship Pioneering. In his CEO capacity, Mr. Chouraqui was leading the development of Cellarity, a company which is driving a radically new approach to drug discovery by working at the intersection of AI and biology. Mr. Chouraqui raised over $250M and attracted world-renowned investors. He initiated a collaboration with Novo Nordisk and had Cellarity recognized as a top biotech to watch by several sources. Today, Mr. Chouraqui holds the position of Executive Chairman at Cellarity.\n\nPrior to joining Flagship Pioneering, Mr. Chouraqui spent 10 years at Novartis. He was President of Novartis Pharmaceuticals USA from 2016 to 2019, during which he delivered strong growth despite negative price impact and significantly improved profitability. Promoted to turn around performance after the business suffered issues with recent launches, Mr. Chouraqui developed sophisticated commercial and access capabilities to meet the new market environment. He achieved strong market positions for two significant growth drivers (Cosentyx and Entresto), drove the uptake of the rare disease drug Ilaris, initiated the landmark PIONEER clinical trial in heart failure, and championed several business development initiatives. Mr. Chouraqui moved the organization\u2019s culture from \u201cconsensus building, conservative and siloed\u201d to \u201cquestioning, experimenting and collaborative.\u201d He also served as Novartis representative on the board of BIO.\n\nBefore leading the US organization, Mr. Chouraqui was President, Latin America & Canada (2014-2016) for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, responsible for leading a portfolio shift from established primary care medicines to innovative specialty care drugs. He also served as Global Head, Business Franchise Neuroscience (2012-2014). In this role, he relaunched Gilenya (Multiple Sclerosis) following a post-launch regulatory review and made Gilenya the largest growth contributor in the Novartis five-year strategic plan. Mr. Chouraqui also addressed late-stage pipeline gaps with the start of the siponimod program in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (approved in 2019) and the identification of business development opportunities, which led to the in-licensing of ofatumumab in MS from GSK (launched as Kesimpta) and a partnership with Amgen on erenumab for migraine (launched as Aymovig).\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, Mr. Chouraqui held multiple international roles at Bristol-Myers Squibb, ultimately serving as Vice President, Commercial Operations, Asia-Pacific and General Manager, Southeast Asia (2008-2010). He began his career in R&D roles at Roussel Uclaf and Hoechst Marion Roussel, pharmaceutical companies that were predecessors to today\u2019s Sanofi.\n\nMr. Chouraqui earned a MBA from INSEAD and a Doctorate in Pharmacy, a Post-Graduate Degree in Quality Assurance of Medicines, and a MSc in Biological and Medicinal Sciences from University of Paris V.\n\nMr. Chouraqui shall have stepped down as Executive Chairman of Cellarity, Inc., a non-listed company, no later than upon his appointment as the new Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Pharming. Thereafter, Mr. Chouraqui intends to serve as a non-executive Board member of Cellarity.\n\nMr. Chouraqui also holds the position of independent Board member of OranoMed, a non-listed (and therefore private) subsidiary of Orano Group. OranoMed is a company specialized in the research and development of Pb-212 based radioligand alpha therapies for the treatment of various types of cancers.\n\nThe resume of Mr. Chouraqui is available on our website.\n\nFor further public information, contact:\n\nPharming Group, Leiden, the Netherlands\n\nMichael Levitan, VP Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nT: +1 (908) 705 1696\n\nE: investor@pharming.com\n\nFTI Consulting, London, UK\n\nVictoria Foster Mitchell/Alex Shaw/Amy Byrne\n\nT: +44 203 727 1000\n\nLifeSpring Life Sciences Communication, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nLeon Melens\n\nT: +31 6 53 81 64 27\n\nE: pharming@lifespring.nl\n\nAbout Pharming Group N.V.\n\nPharming Group N.V.

            "content": "Novartis on Thursday secured a last-minute win against MSN Pharmaceuticals and its push to market a generic form of the pharma\u2019s heart failure drug Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan).\n\nLate in the day, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily enjoined MSN Pharma from commercializing its Entresto generic \u201cuntil further notice\u201d while Novartis\u2019 outstanding appeal to bar generics for the drug remains open.\n\nAccording to reporting from Reuters, this latest court order comes just hours after the appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit lifted a pause on MSN Pharma\u2019s generic it had placed the day before, writing that Novartis as the appellant \u201chas not satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\u201d\n\nThis latest legal push-and-pull are the latest developments in what has turned out to be a complex court saga between Novartis and MSN Pharma.\n\nThe fight dates back to September 2022, when Novartis filed a citizen petition asking the FDA to refrain from approving drugs that referenced Entresto until after Feb. 16, 2024, when its exclusivity was set to expire. Novartis also referenced two additional patents specific to the heart failure treatment, which would expire in 2033 and 2036, respectively.\n\nThe FDA in July 2024 rejected the petition. The first request, according to the regulator, was moot given that the date had already lapsed, while the two Entresto-specific patents could be side stepped through labelling tweaks. In addition, a Delaware court in August 2024 denied to grant Novartis\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against MSN\u2014a decision that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld in December of the same year.\n\nLast week, however, the appellate court released a new ruling, handing Novartis a victory and finding that MSN Pharma\u2019s generic infringes on one of Entresto\u2019s patents that is set to expire in July 2025.\n\nElsewhere in generic approvals, the FDA on Thursday granted tentative approval to Amneal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 generic version of Bausch Health\u2019s Xifaxan (rifaximin). Tentative approval is given to drugs that satisfy the regulator\u2019s requirements for licensing but which cannot otherwise be marketed in the U.S. due to patents, exclusivities and other restrictions.\n\nThe branded reference product, Xifaxan, is an oral antibacterial indicated for travelers\u2019 diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and to reduce the recurrence risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nIn an attempt to protect Xifaxan\u2019s market exclusivity, Bausch Health in 2024 sued Amneal for patent infringement, claiming at the time that the New Jersey biotech insisted that some of the drug\u2019s Orange Book patents are \u201cunenforceable, invalid, and/or not infringed\u201d by its generics application.",

We also hope to hold yet another listening party, where the rotation will likely include this, this, this, this and this. And what about you?

But be safe. Enjoy, and see you on Tuesday, since we have an extended break due to a holiday on this side of the pond.\n\nMedicare officials announced plans to negotiate the prices of blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, further complicating big decisions the Trump administration will have to make about how to cover the medications, STAT writes. The drugs are on a list of 15 whose prices will be negotiated this year in a program created by one of President Biden\u2019s signature accomplishments, the Inflation Reduction Act. The inclusion of these high-profile medications could raise the public profile of the negotiation program, which has struggled to break through. Right now, Medicare is not allowed to cover Wegovy, the obesity drug, for weight loss alone, but the Biden administration released an eleventh-hour proposal to change that. The program can cover it for some conditions related to obesity, including heart disease, and covers Ozempic for diabetes. The choices facing the incoming Trump administration over weight loss drug coverage have massive consequences for the Medicare program, for patients, and for Novo Nordisk, which makes the drugs. Eli Lilly makes rival diabetes and weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNovartis filed a lawsuit accusing the Biden administration of unlawfully preventing the company from changing payment terms to some hospitals that participate in the 340B Drug Discount Program, the latest instance in which a pharmaceutical company has gone to court in recent months over such a dispute. In its lawsuit, the company argued the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration has wrongfully interpreted a federal law concerning the use of rebates in the program, which was created to help hospitals and clinics care for low-income and rural patients. Novartis had an additional motive for filing its lawsuit. The company sells the Entresto heart drug, which was selected by Medicare for price negotiations. The agency wants manufacturers to ensure the 340B discount and maximum fair price under the Inflation Reduction Act are not applied to the same drug. By offering rebates instead of discounts, drug companies are trying to avoid this conundrum.",

The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% from 2025 to 2030.\n\nThe key factors contributing to the industry growth include the increased prevalence of skin disorders coupled with strategic collaborations between key players. The increasing prevalence of skin infections, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and eczema, coupled with the rising demand for eye and ear therapies is expected to drive the demand for transdermal or dermal medicines during the forecast period. For instance, in October 2021, AbbVie Inc. received FDA approval for Vuity, a pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution for treating presbyopia.\n\n\n\nIn addition, according to the NCBI, the prevalence of psoriasis is nearly 1.92% and 1.5% among European and North American populations. The launch of topical medicines to treat skin diseases is also anticipated to propel the demand for dermal drugs. For instance, in September 2020, Bausch Health, Canada launched a novel antipsoriatic agent, Duobrii lotion for psoriasis patients.Advancements in technology and increased acquisitions and mergers activities among key players, such as Alcon, Inc. and Novartis AG, are anticipated to boost the industry's growth. For instance, in June 2022, Novartis AG acquired Kedalion Therapeutics, thereby acquiring AcuStream technology to facilitate accurate dermal delivery of ophthalmic medicines.\n\n\n\nMoreover, in May 2022, Alcon Inc. acquired Eysuvis (loteprednol etabonate suspension) for topical ophthalmic use from Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., thereby adding to its existing portfolio of dry eye drugs.A high incidence of burn injuries is expected to render high utilization of topical medicines in treating burn injuries. For instance, according to the WHO, an estimated 11 million burn injuries occur annually worldwide, out of which about 180,000 cases are fatal. Various topical agents are used in treating burn injuries including silver sulfadiazine cream, bismuth-impregnated petroleum gauze, cerium nitrate, mafenide acetate, and nanocrystalline silver among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopical Drugs Market Report Highlights\n\nDermal drug delivery dominated the market and accounted for a share of 54.1% in 2024, fueled by its capacity to offer targeted treatment, user-friendly application, and improved patient compliance.\n\nSemi-solid formulations led the market with a revenue share of 61.9% in 2024 due to their versatility, ease of use, and effectiveness in delivering active ingredients directly to the skin.\n\nHospitals & clinics held the largest revenue share of 38.9% in 2024, driven by the growing prevalence of skin disorders and chronic diseases necessitating professional intervention.\n\nNorth America topical drugs market dominated the global market in 2024, driven by a high prevalence of skin disorders, advanced healthcare infrastructure, and robust investments in research and development.\n\nThis report addresses:\n\nMarket intelligence to enable effective decision-making\n\nMarket estimates and forecasts from 2018 to 2030\n\nGrowth opportunities and trend analyses\n\nSegment and regional revenue forecasts for market assessment\n\nCompetition strategy and market share analysis\n\nProduct innovation listing for you to stay ahead of the curve\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 100 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $190.5 billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $269.3 billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 6.0% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

An attorney for MSN declined to comment.\n\nIndia-based MSN's version of Entresto was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year. Novartis sued MSN and others seeking to launch Entresto generics for patent infringement.\n\nEntresto is Switzerland-based Novartis' best-selling drug, which brought the company more than $6 billion in revenue in 2023.\n\nThe Federal Circuit last week reversed a 2023 decision that invalidated one of the patents. Novartis argued in a court filing that the ruling maintained the company's exclusive rights to sell Entresto until July.\n\nThe company said MSN was preparing to launch its generic on Thursday, the day Novartis' patent expired.\n\nU.S. district courts in Washington and Delaware rejected Novartis' requests on Wednesday for a mandate that would immediately block the generic.\n\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by David Bario, Rod Nickel and Deepa Babington)",

            "content": "Credit: Novartis\n\nOne year ago this week, Novartis biomedical research president Fiona Marshall called artificial intelligence a technology with \u201cthe potential to transform how we discover new drugs.\u201d Marshall was adding some color to the pharma giant\u2019s then-new collaboration with Isomorphic Labs, the DeepMind spin-off launched in 2021 by Demis Hassabis, coinventor of the protein-folding software AlphaFold and a winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nNow, Marshall says, Novartis\u2019s partnerships with Isomorphic and other AI firms are beginning to bear fruit. Novartis has leaned into these relationships to bolster its computational abilities and help unlock the secrets of targets that its own chemists haven\u2019t quite cracked. Novartis is also working with Microsoft, Deciphex, Generate:Biomedicines, and, as of November, Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the original computational chemistry firms. Novartis has doled out hundreds of millions of dollars on these collaborations with the promise of billions in return.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using AI end-to-end across all the things that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Marshall says.\n\nC&EN\u2019s Rowan Walrath spoke to Marshall during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this week about the possibilities of AI. This interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen we last spoke, it was right after the Nobel Prize announcement. We talked about the Isomorphic partnership in that context. I thought this would be a good opportunity to catch up on where these AI partnerships stand.\n\nThe AI partnerships are fully up and running. We\u2019re already starting to see some ways that AI can change how we do things. For example, some of the programs that we\u2019re working on with Isomorphic; we\u2019ve already found chemical material for some of these targets we\u2019ve worked on for a long time that is different from what we found by traditional means. It can definitely lead you into new chemical space. This is AI-enabled virtual screening, essentially. We tried to pick targets that we were really struggling with.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing people who were skeptics about the use of AI\u2014which is obviously one of the barriers to entry, how do you bring everybody along with you?\u2014starting to say, \u201cOK, actually, this looks quite good. I\u2019d like to have it in my program.\u201d\n\nWith Schr\u00f6dinger, we\u2019re doing a multitarget collaboration. They have a very good platform called LiveDesign where everyone can access it and see how compounds can be designed through computational chemistry. Again, it\u2019s about bringing the tools to people so that they can engage in this. That even applies to basic things like [Microsoft] Copilot.\n\nGenerate:Biomedicines is taking AI into the biologics design space. It\u2019s all about reducing the cycle time, improving the productivity, reducing attrition. We can really now use AI to understand safety profiling of compounds. We have a collaboration with the company Decipherex about digitizing all our historical safety data and then seeing if you can see safety signals earlier on, which allows you to stop one molecule and then move to another.\n\nYou mentioned that you are trying to focus these AI efforts on targets that you have struggled with in the past. Can you shed any light on what those targets are or what properties have been challenging?\n\nI can\u2019t name the specific targets, but they cover totally different target classes. Some are intracellular, some are cell-surface receptors. There are some targets where the issue is safety and selectivity, where the protein may be closely related to other proteins. Sometimes certain targets, you get stuck in a particular chemical space that always tends to have some tox[icological] effects, and you sort of go deeper and deeper. No matter how many compounds you bring through, you get stuck on the tox. Trying to go to a totally other chemical series is a way of getting out of that hole.\n\nIf you were to run a million-compound screen, that\u2019s a tiny, tiny fraction of total chemical space. Whereas when you use AI and virtual screening, you can actually explore an infinitely large chemical diversity space that you couldn\u2019t if you were doing lab screening. If you now have a really good understanding of the 3D structure of the protein\u2014which you can get from AlphaFold\u2014that allows you to go into new chemical space.\n\nWhen it comes to using software to help with clinical trial design and to speed up recruitment, what does that look like in concrete terms?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re going to design a clinical study. You have to set all the parameters of that study in terms of what type of patients would be enrolled, what stage of the disease would they be at, what other drugs are they already taking. Can you add your drug onto standard of care, or would you be taking them off the drug? How long does it take to collect data? What are the endpoints of the trial? How would you power it from a statistical point of view? Think of all these different parameters that have to go into the trial design.\n\nThen, what you want to understand is: How long would it take to recruit 200 patients? Then, by changing the parameters\u2014let\u2019s say a simple thing like age, or we only want patients who\u2019ve been on this drug but not this drug; we don\u2019t want patients with these comorbidities\u2014you can start to alter all the parameters, and then you can say, \u201cOK, if I alter this, how is that going to change the recruitment rate?\u201d\n\nAI can really help bring all this data together.\n\nHow do you balance that need for speed with the need to reach patients who have been underserved by the medical establishment, who haven\u2019t been targeted to be enrolled in clinical trials because of their race or gender or because they live far from a hospital system or don\u2019t have proper transportation?\n\nThis is a very important thing. We do want the trials to represent the total patient population. Of course, that\u2019s very important. This can actually help with that because, for example, we could put in the parameters that we want to make sure we include this percentage of people by gender or ethnic diversity, and that can be set up as a prior part of the protocol design. It would then help you to see, OK, if you want to recruit this number of Black African Americans, these are the hospitals where you would be most likely to be able to access those patients. That\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re very committed to, making sure we have that clinical diversity.\n\nFrom a change management perspective, for chemists and other scientists within Novartis who are not accustomed to working with software tools, how do you onboard them?\n\nIt is through training, basic training but also sharing best practices. We have virtual communities where people share, like \u201cthis is a thing you should try out,\u201d and sharing ideas and best practices and really trying to upskill everybody to the same sort of standard, basic understanding of how you can use AI. We\u2019re finding people are very enthusiastic about learning.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not just about doing the new things. It\u2019s also letting go of the old ways of working. Take a chemistry program, for example. You could use AI to design your molecules, or you could design them by making hundreds and hundreds of compounds like you always used to make. Now, what you quite often find is that the chemist will now do both\u2014the new approach and the old approach at the same time\u2014and see what comes out.",

This is the latest round of restructuring at the site, following similar moves in recent years. Union representatives have described it as an \"annual tradition\" and expressed concern about repeated job cuts.\n\nThe company attributed the decision to declining volumes in its eyecare portfolio and external cost pressures such as energy prices and labour costs, which have led to higher unit costs. Despite these challenges, Novartis has signalled its confidence in the future of the site by committing to invest 40 million euros in the Puurs site by 2025 to expand biologics production capacity and attract manufacturing for other companies' products.\n\nConsultation phase\n\nThe restructuring process has entered the consultation phase under the Renault Law, a labour law introduced in 1998 to regulate collective redundancies. This law requires employers to enter into a consultation period with trade unions before implementing redundancies and sets out provisions for redundancy payments. It was introduced following the controversial mass redundancies at Renault's Vilvoorde plant in 1997.\n\nNovartis said it would work closely with the social partners and keep employees informed throughout the process, as well as offering support for mental health and well-being.\n\n\"This decision is harsh, especially as Novartis is a highly profitable company\"\n\nTrade unions have given mixed reactions, acknowledging the investment as a positive step but lamenting the impact on the nearly 200 affected employees and their families. \"This decision is harsh, especially as Novartis is a highly profitable company,\" said union representative Danny Absillis.\n\nThe Puurs site, which employs 1,160 of Novartis' 1,750 employees in Belgium, will face weeks of intense discussions as unions and management seek solutions to minimise job losses and provide clarity for those affected.\n\n#FlandersNewsService | \u00a9 PHOTO BELGIAN FREELANCE\n\nRelated news",

The news comes after a year of mass layoffs in Belgium, with job losses reaching a record high of over 27,000 in the country.\n\nUnions say this is not the first restructuring at the Puurs site (Antwerp province), which they describe as an \"annual tradition\". In 2022, Novartis announced a significant global restructuring, but only a few dozen jobs were lost in Flanders. At the time, Belgian unions criticised the \"poor management\" and noted it was the \"third restructuring in five years\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Novartis stated its aim to make the Puurs production site more competitive and meet evolving production needs. The company plans to invest \u20ac40 million towards these goals by 2025.\n\nThis investment will primarily enhance the site's expertise in producing Novartis' medicines and developing products for other companies. The union ACV-CSC noted that the Puurs site has long been a leader in its field, particularly due to Alcon, a former Novartis subsidiary that specialised in eye surgery kits before becoming a stand-alone company in 2019.\n\nHowever, the Puurs site must adapt to declining volumes in the ophthalmic product portfolio and reduced efficiency from external factors, said a Novartis spokesperson. These issues are increasing unit costs.\n\nUnions and management began the mandatory information and consultation phase on Wednesday in line with Belgium's Renault law on collective redundancies.\n\nApproximately 1,160 people work at the Puurs site. Novartis employs a total of 1,750 workers across Belgium.\n\nRelated News",

Alongside these, the company identified four drugs in clinical development, which it expects to drive growth in the 2030s; remibrutinib, OAV101 IT, and ianalumab, all in Phase III trials, and pelacarsen, currently in a Phase II trial (NCT04023552) for aortic valve stenosis.\n\nNarasimhan said Novartis expects 15 submission-enabling data readouts in the next two years from their core assets, which will maintain profits in the face of patent expiries for their current blockbuster drugs.\n\nPatent expiries of major drugs have been a key issue for big pharma, and is expected to be a major macroeconomic trend affecting the sector this year, as per GlobalData\u2019s State of the BioPharmaceutical Industry 2025 report. GlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology. This in turn has increased the scrutiny on companies\u2019 research and development strategies.\n\nNovartis has refocussed its clinical pipeline, moving from 155 active projects in Q3 2021 to 94 in Q3 2024. This, Narasimhan says, has allowed Novartis during this period to invest 49% more full-time equivalent (FTE) per project\u2014the ratio of working hours spent on R&D. The company will continue focusing on four core therapeutic areas-cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nThe company now expects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 6% between 2023 and 2028 with roughly similar growth projected for 2029 and beyond. Much of this growth is likely to be found in East Asian markets such as China, where Novartis achieved over 25% constant currency growth in sales during the first 9 months of 2024 over the same period in 2023, as well as Japan where Narasimhan stated continuing regulatory reforms will aid the company.\n\nWith an emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) integration in its R&D and implementation of its fast-to-IND strategy for preclinical assets, Novartis has over 30 potentially high-value new molecular entity (NME) candidates in clinical Phases I-III, which Narasimhan said are set to drive long term revenue growth.\n\nThe therapeutic areas of focus for the company include immunology, in which Novartis expects over six Phase III and over 10 Phase II readouts in the next five years, and gene therapies, driven by recent acquisitions like Kate Biotherapeutics, which acquired for $1.1bn in November 2024.\n\nNote: The seventh paragraph was updated to add context on the period over which a 25% sales growth was recorded and additional comments on growth in specific countries.",

(Novartis) is pleased to announce that eligible patients in Ontario now have access to Pluvicto\u2122 (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan injection), a targeted radioligand therapy for adult patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received at least one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (APRI) and at least one taxane-based chemotherapy. We commend Ontario for being the first province to provide access to this innovative treatment for patients in need.\n\nThe decision by Ontario Health to reimburse Pluvicto\u2122 follows the announcement of an agreement between Novartis and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) and underscores the critical need for additional treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. This milestone is a meaningful step forward for patients with progressing mCRPC, their families and loved ones.\n\n\"Our government is proud to be the first Canadian jurisdiction to administer the first publicly funded dose of Pluvicto\u2122, a targeted radioligand therapy that utilizes medical isotopes to treat advanced-stage prostate cancer,\" said Sylvia Jones, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. \"Expanding the province's publicly funded drug program to connect more people to new, life-changing treatment, is one more way our government is championing innovation to connect people to the care they need, when they need it.\"\n\nAs Ontario sets the standard, Novartis remains focused on collaborating with publicly funded drug plans, provinces and territories across Canada to ensure that all eligible patients in Canada living with advanced prostate cancer have access to Pluvicto\u2122 without delay.\n\nThe first publicly funded patient was treated on December 27, 2024, at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) in London, Ontario.\n\n\"This marks a breakthrough moment for those in the province facing advanced prostate cancer,\" said Dr. David Laidley, a nuclear medicine physician at LHSC. \"Public reimbursement of Pluvicto\u2122 brings much-needed hope to patients facing this aggressive and advanced form of cancer who have exhausted all other options.\"\n\n\"This is a step in the right direction for the Canadians living with advanced prostate cancer who can benefit from this therapy,\" Dr. Abby Collier, Executive Director, Prostate Cancer Foundation Canada. \"Ongoing innovation is critical to advance patient care and reduce the burden of prostate cancer on individuals, families and society but the true impact is only realized when patients can access these innovations. We are encouraged by Ontario's leadership and remain optimistic that other provinces will also recognize the importance of making this innovation available to eligible patients.\"\n\n\"We commend the Ontario government for taking this decisive step. Seeing the first patient in Ontario treated under public funding highlights the tangible impact this innovative therapy can have on those living with advanced prostate cancer.\" said Mark Vineis, Country President, Novartis Canada \"We look forward to continuing to work closely with the provinces to ensure that eligible patients and their families across Canada have equitable access to Pluvicto\u2122.\"\n\nAbout Pluvicto\u2122\n\nPluvicto\u2122 (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan injection) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received at least one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and taxane-based chemotherapy1. It is a type of precision cancer treatment combining a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope (a radioactive particle)1. After administration into the bloodstream, Pluvicto\u2122 binds to target cells, including prostate cancer cells that express PSMA, a transmembrane protein1. Once bound, energy emissions from the radioisotope damage the target cells and nearby cells disrupting their ability to replicate and/or triggering cell death1.\n\nAbout Novartis\n\nNovartis is a focused innovative medicines company. Every day, we work to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives so that patients, healthcare professionals and societies are empowered in the face of serious disease. Our medicines reach more than 250 million people worldwide.\n\nIn Canada, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. employs approximately 600 people to serve the evolving needs of patients and the healthcare system and invests over $30 million in R&D yearly in the country.

Credit: Taljat David / Shutterstock.\n\nAnalytics company GlobalData has shared its optimism regarding the future of Novartis\u2019 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene transfer therapy \u2013 onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) \u2013 which could become available to a broader patient population.\n\nThis is following positive results from Novartis\u2019 Phase III STEER study (NCT05089656), which met its primary endpoint when testing the intrathecal formulation of the drug.\n\nNovartis\u2019 has already marketed an intravenous formulation of OAV101 IT, called Zolgensma. Approved by the FDA in 2019, it is currently the only gene therapy for SMA.\n\nHowever, the eligible patient population indicated for Novartis\u2019 Zolgensma is limited; the drug is only available to paediatric patients under two years of age with SMA with biallelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.\n\nGlobalData expects that the intrathecal formulation will shakeup the market. According to the company\u2019s managing neurology analyst Christie Wong, \u201cIf approved, OAV101 IT could significantly enhance patient outcomes in markets where NBS or early diagnosis remains a challenge.\u201d\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nWith FDA approval, Novartis\u2019 gene transfer therapy would be made available to type II SMA patients under 18 years of age, representing a much broader patient population. Key opinion leaders (KOLs) consulted by GlobalData also pointed out that OAV101 IT would offer patients the convenience of a one-time infusion, compared to other treatments on the market. These include Biogen\u2019s once-quarterly IT administration of Spinraza (nusinersen) and Roche\u2019s once-daily Evrysdi (risdiplam).\n\nConsidering the growing market in its recent report, Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Opportunity Assessment and Forecast, GlobalData forecasts that, across the seven major markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, the US and Japan), the combined sales of intrathecal and intravenous formulations of OAV101 IT will increase from $660.6m in 2023 to $763.8m by 2033.\n\nThe analytics company attributes the predicted growth in the OAV101 IT market to the shift in awareness of SMA and the associated implementation of newborn screening (NBS) across the markets.\n\nWong commented that: \u201cThe KOLs previously interviewed by GlobalData noted that the implementation of NBS initiatives in their countries has greatly facilitated disease detection during the pre-symptomatic stage and has enabled many eligible patients to receive Zolgensma. The availability of OAV101 IT would be most beneficial to patients where NBS for SMA is not yet adopted in their country and/or patients who received a delayed diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe results of the STEER trial will be shared with the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The Phase III study was a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, which involved 100 paediatric patients aged between two and 17, all of whom had type II SMA. It met its primary endpoint, showing an increase from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE) total score in patients with SMA treated with intrathecal OAV101 IT.\n\nHowever, despite optimism for the intrathecal OAV101 IT, the intravenous formulation hasn\u2019t had the smoothest of rides. In October 2019, the FDA implemented a partial clinical hold on OAV101 IT, after results of preclinical animal study showed dorsal root ganglia mononuclear cell inflammation, sometimes accompanied by neuronal cell body degeneration or loss.\n\nThe hold was lifted in August 2021, following data from Novartis\u2019 nonclinical toxicology study in non-human primates, which addressed questions around dorsal root ganglia (DRG) injury after injection.\n\nEditorial content is independently produced and follows the highest standards of journalistic integrity.

The ruling restores protections for U.S. Patent No. 8,101,659, which has been central to Novartis\u2019 efforts to block generic versions of the $6 billion-per-year medication.\n\nFederal Circuit: Patent Sufficiently Describes Invention\n\nThe three-judge appellate panel concluded that the patent provided an adequate written description, ensuring its validity. \u201cThe invention is plainly described throughout the specification,\u201d the court stated, highlighting that the patent disclosed a pharmaceutical composition combining valsartan and sacubitril.\n\nThe panel also noted that even MSN Pharmaceuticals\u2019 expert conceded the patent sufficiently described administering valsartan and sacubitril as a physical mixture.\n\nIn contrast to the district court\u2019s 2023 ruling, which found that a skilled person could not have visualized the combination of the two active ingredients when the patent was filed in 2002, the appellate judges determined that the inventors clearly had possession of the claimed invention.\n\nRuling Comes Amid Multidistrict Litigation\n\nThe revived patent is part of ongoing multidistrict litigation where Novartis is fighting to stave off generic competition for Entresto, its best-selling drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved MSN Pharmaceuticals\u2019 generic version on July 24, 2023, and the district court ruling that invalidated the Novartis patent was a significant win for the generics industry.",

Image credit: Shutterstock/ Hyejin Kang.\n\nLight Horse Therapeutics has galloped on to the biotech scene with $62m in Series A financing and a multi-target collaboration with Novartis that will see the big pharma company use the new biotech\u2019s drug discovery platform.\n\nThe Series A was led by founding investor Versant Ventures with participation from Mubadala Capital, Bristol Myers Squibb, Taiho Ventures, and AbbVie, as per a 9 January press release.\n\nThe news comes as Light Horse announced a partnership with Novartis in a deal that involves the former receiving a $25m upfront payment. The US-based company is also in line for $1bn in milestone payments, as well as royalties on products that make it to market.\n\nLight Horse says it \u201cturns conventional drug discovery on its head\u201d by pursuing a function-first approach with its genetic editing-based platform. The biotech\u2019s technology uncovers novel functional sites in targets associated with diseases and then screening for chemistry.

            "content": "\u201cAs we have long recognized, \u2018[t]he invention is, for purposes of the \u2018written description\u2019 inquiry, whatever is now claimed.\u201d \u2013 CAFC opinion\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) today issued a precedential decision reversing a district court\u2019s determination that certain claims of a patent for Novartis\u2019 heart failure drug Entresto were invalid for lack of written description, and affirming a finding that the claims were not shown to be invalid for obviousness, lack of enablement, or indefiniteness. Judge Lourie authored the opinion.\n\nMSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and other generic companies submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking approval to market a generic version of Entresto. Entresto includes the active ingredients valsartan and sacubitril \u201cin a specific form known as a \u2018complex,\u2019 which combines the two drugs into a single unit-dose-form through weak, non- covalent bonds,\u201d according to the CAFC opinion.\n\nNovartis sued, alleging the ANDA directly infringed claims 1\u20134 of Novartis\u2019 U.S. Patent 8,101,659. The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware agreed with Novartis that the single term of the \u2018659 patent under dispute\u2014i.e., \u201cwherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination\u201d \u2014should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. While MSN attempted to argue that the plain and ordinary meaning \u201cwould render the claims invalid for lack of written description and enablement because the specification nowhere describes such complexes,\u201d the district court found that there was \u201cno basis to believe that the construction [the court] adopt[ed was] necessarily consigning the asserted claims to a judgment of invalidity.\u201d MSN stipulated to infringement of the asserted claims based on the court\u2019s claim construction and the case proceeded to a three-day bench trial.\n\nAt trial, the court was unpersuaded by MSN\u2019s obviousness arguments and ultimately said the claims were not proven invalid by clear and convincing evidence. But on the subjects of written description and enablement, the district court agreed with MSN that the claims lacked written description and with Novartis that the claims were enabled. MSN\u2019s argument was that the patent must enable and describe the relevant complexes \u201csince a patent must enable and describe the full scope of the claims,\u201d while Novartis said that \u201ca complex of valsartan and sacubitril was an after-arising invention that need not have been enabled or described.\u201d Novartis specifically noted that its \u201clater, nonobvious discovery of valsartan and sacubitril in the form of a complex should not invalidate the \u2019659 patent claims to Novartis\u2019s earlier invention: the novel combination of valsartan and sacubitril.\u201d\n\nWhile the district court agreed with Novartis that later-existing state of the art may not be properly considered as part of the enablement analysis because enablement is judged as of the priority date, it added that \u201cthe facts that helped [Novartis] with respect to enablement proved fatal for written description.\u201d In other words, since complexes were unknown to a person of ordinary skill in the art, \u201c\u2018[Novartis] scientists, by definition, could not have possession of, and disclose, the subject matter of [such complexes]\u2019 in 2002, and therefore, \u2018axiomatically, [Novartis] cannot satisfy the written description requirement\u2019 for such complexes,\u201d wrote the court.\n\nOn review, the CAFC said that \u201c[b]ecause the \u2019659 patent does not claim valsartan-sacubitril complexes, those complexes need not have been described.\u201d Citing Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the opinion explained that \u201cas we have long recognized, \u2018[t]he invention is, for purposes of the \u2018written description\u2019 inquiry, whatever is now claimed.\u201d The CAFC continued:\n\n\u201cRecall that, at claim construction, MSN sought\u2014as accused infringers often do\u2014a construction that would exclude from infringement the accused product: a valsartan-sacubitril complex. The court ultimately rejected MSN\u2019s proposed construction because the \u2019659 patent \u2018is silent on whether sacubitril and valsartan must be separate (and not complexed).\u2019\u2026 The term was therefore given its plain and ordinary meaning: \u2018wherein said [valsartan and sacubitril] are administered in combination.\u2019 Id. That invention is plainly described throughout the specification.\u201d\n\nThe \u2019659 patent\u2019s lack of description for a complexed form of valsartan and sacubitril \u201cdoes not affect the validity of the patent,\u201d said the CAFC, because that complex, which wasn\u2019t discovered until four years after the priority date of the \u2018659 patent, is not what was claimed. The appellate court thus found that the district court clearly erred in its analysis of written description and reversed.\n\nThe CAFC found no error with respect to the district court\u2019s enablement or obviousness analyses and affirmed those.",

For the next four years, he held residencies at various hospitals in Bern and Z\u00fcrich before serving (1984\u201388) as the attendant physician at C.L. Lory-Haus at Bern University Hospital. He left medicine in 1988 and joined the marketing department of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. in New Jersey, the U.S.-based division of Sandoz Pharma Ltd. The following year Vasella graduated from Harvard Business School, and he moved up quickly in the marketing and sales department at Sandoz to become department head of special-product marketing. He was appointed assistant vice president in 1992 and became head of the corporate-marketing department the following year. In 1994 Vasella returned to Switzerland and accepted the position of head of the worldwide development office at Sandoz\u2019s headquarters in Basel. He was named CEO of Sandoz the following year.\n\nEarly in 1996 Vasella was named CEO of the newly formed Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, which was established as a result of the largest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry. The combined company united industry giants Sandoz Ltd. and Ciba-Geigy Ltd., two Swiss-based health care groups, in a $29 billion merger that made Novartis second in size and influence only to Britain\u2019s Glaxo Wellcome, the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical concern. As CEO, Vasella was responsible for coordinating the integration of the Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy product lines. He assumed a joint leadership role with Novartis chairman Alex Krauer, who had served as chairman of Ciba-Geigy. The two were responsible for overseeing the company\u2019s overall development and direction, and Vasella also served as head of the company\u2019s executive committee. After Krauer retired in 1999, Vasella was appointed chairman of Novartis. In 2003 he published the book Magic Cancer Bullet: How a Tiny Orange Pill Is Rewriting Medical History (reissued in 2004), written with Robert Slater, in which he discussed Novartis\u2019s breakthrough cancer drug Gleevec, also known as Glivec. In 2010 Vasella stepped down as CEO, and three years later he retired as chairman.\n\nVasella also joined the boards of PepsiCo, Inc. (2002), and XBiotech (2014). The recipient of numerous honours, in 2003 he received Harvard Business School\u2019s Alumni Achievement Award and the CancerCare Human Services Award.",

ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 From April, nearly 360 Republic Polytechnic (RP) students will get an early edge for jobs in the biopharmaceutical sector through a new talent programme.\n\nThe Talent Advancement Programme, which is headlined by a 36-week in-depth internship, was unveiled on Jan 9 as a joint effort between RP and 16 out of 18 companies in the Biopharmaceutical Manufacturer\u2019s Advisory Council, with the support of the Economic Development Board.\n\nIndustry giants Pfizer, GSK, Novartis and equipment manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific are among the participating members of the council, which is an industry body that aims to drive home Singapore\u2019s advantage in biopharma manufacturing.\n\nThe programme comes off the back of numerous investments into new and expanded plants in recent years by major pharma players, including Pfizer and Novartis, which have staked their chips on Singapore as an advanced manufacturing and research hub, creating skilled jobs to fill.\n\nUnder the programme, first-year students will get to take part in site visits and career talks, while second-year students can attempt job shadowing and short-term attachments before deciding if they wish to apply for the extended internship in their final year.\n\nThe scheme was launched at the RP campus in Woodlands at an event during the poly\u2019s open house, which runs from Jan 9 to 11.\n\nAs a start, second-year students pursuing diploma studies in pharmaceutical science, as well as those in electrical and electronics engineering, will be eligible for the programme in the 2025 academic year.\n\nCome 2027, about 1,000 students are expected to qualify, as the programme is gradually expanded to cover nine or so diploma programmes under RP\u2019s School of Applied Science and School of Engineering as part of an ongoing curriculum revamp.\n\nThe programme is expected to put students in good stead for roles in manufacturing, automation, engineering and supply chain within the sector.\n\nRP chief executive and principal Jeanne Liew said students in other fields, such as marketing, may join too if the companies involved have relevant opportunities in the future.\n\nShe added that the 36-week internship would appeal to students who are already very clear about their career aspirations and wish to deepen their expertise in specific skill sets.\n\nAs all components of the programme are designed to be in line with the national-level Biopharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skills Framework, Ms Liew said students who take part stand to be \u201cvery sought after\u201d by employers.\n\nMr Lim Hock Heng, vice-president and site director at GSK and co-chair of the Biopharmaceutical Manufacturer\u2019s Advisory Council, said: \u201cHaving early access to these talents enables us to build a skilled workforce ready to have an impact on the rapidly growing biopharma sector and, ultimately, for patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nOn this point of early access, Ms Liew said the recognition offered by pharma companies for the skills and exposure gained through the rigorous programme could spur more students to join the workforce earlier, rather than pursue further studies out of concerns that their diploma qualifications are not adequately valued.\n\nShe added that the biopharma sector is a progressive one that recognises skills, rather than just academic qualifications.\n\n\u201cThere will be more students who are more willing to start work immediately if they see that potential for career development is high (and) based on the competencies they gain on the job,\u201d she said, but added that it remains up to students to decide if further studies are needed for their goals.\n\n\u201cOur job is to really get students to join high-growth sectors with good potential for wage growth and that are really focused on competencies \u2013 and we think that biopharma is one of these sectors that we therefore would want to encourage more students to enter.\u201d\n\nWhile participation in the programme does not guarantee higher wages or a full-time job offer with the companies, Ms Liew said the deepened skills and familiarity with company operations translate to a substantial advantage over fellow job seekers.\n\nThe programme is said to be the first of its kind in the applied sciences across the local polytechnics, though RP rolled out a similar programme for its School of Hospitality in 2024.\n\nMr Joshua Lee, 19, an RP student entering the final year of his diploma in pharmaceutical science, is an aspiring pharmaceutical researcher who reckons the new programme will build on existing efforts to impart relevant technical and soft skills, such as using virtual reality in class.\n\nHe said a longer internship, like through the Talent Advancement Programme, would not only offer more working experience, but also provide more networking opportunities.\n\nTay

This comprehensive research report focuses on the global and regional market size and forecasts from 2024 to 2035.\n\n\n\nThe global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market was estimated to be USD 0.985 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 2.43 billion by 2035, with a CAGR of 8.57% during the forecast period 2025-2035. The market will grow due to rising cancer rates, growing precision medicine use, advances in genomic research, more FDA approvals and expanding indications, partnerships and collaborations, and government funding and initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition towards precision medicine, which involves customizing treatments based on individual genetic profiles, has catalyzed greater reliance on biomarkers for patient stratification, particularly those related to PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitors. These biomarkers are crucial for identifying patients who are more likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor therapies, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes. A notable example is the introduction of the PARP Activity Screening and Inhibitor Testing Assay (PASTA) in January 2023, this innovative method is designed for semi-high-throughput in vitro analysis using a 96-well plate configuration to evaluate the selectivity of PARP inhibitors. The primary objective of the PASTA assay is to measure the relative selectivity of various PARP inhibitors while assessing ADP-ribosylation levels facilitated by individual PARPs under diverse conditions. Overall, this assay advances the understanding of PARP-related therapies and improves the precision of treatment modalities tailored to individual patient needs.\n\n\n\nBy product, the kits segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the widespread adoption of ready-to-use diagnostic kits in clinical settings for ease of use and rapid detection of biomarkers. For instance, Myriad Genetics, Inc., a manufacturer of precision medicine and genetic testing, declared in January 2024 that it supports the criteria for germline testing for patients with breast cancer set forth by the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The company views the ASCO-SSO's update to its guidelines as a major step forward in incorporating genetics into patient clinical treatment. Additionally, the assays segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the increasing demand for high-precision testing methods and advancements in assay technologies, particularly in research and drug development settings.\n\n\n\nBy service, the BRCA 1 & 2 testing segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high prevalence of BRCA mutations in breast and ovarian cancers and the critical role of BRCA testing in determining patient eligibility for PARP inhibitor treatments. For instance, the Intermountain Precision Genomics (IPG) laboratory business of Intermountain Health sold some assets to Myriad Genetics, Inc., a company that specializes in genetic testing and precision medicine, in February 2024. Precision Fluid Testing, Precision Oncology Testing, and his CLIA-certified laboratory in St. George, Utah, are all part of the deal. Additionally, the HRD testing segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rising focus on identifying broader patient populations, beyond BRCA mutations, who may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapies.\n\n\n\nBy application, the breast cancer segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high incidence of breast cancer and the growing adoption of PARP inhibitors as a targeted therapy for BRCA-mutated breast cancer patients. For instance, Myriad Genetics, Inc., a precision medicine and genetic testing firm, will expand its portfolio of Precise Oncology Solutions and present new research at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in June 2023. Additionally, the ovarian cancer segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the expanding use of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer treatments and increasing research into biomarkers for improved patient stratification.\n\n\n\nBy end-user, the hospitals and clinics segment accounted for the highest revenue-grossing segment in the global PARP inhibitor biomarkers market in 2024 owing to the high patient volume and preference for hospitals for cancer diagnosis and treatment services, including biomarker testing for therapy selection. For instance, in March 2023, the biotechnology company F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche), which creates medications and diagnostics to treat serious illnesses, said that it has partnered with Eli Lilly and Company to support the development of Roche's Elecsys PARP Inhibitor Biomarkers. One cutting-edge blood test designed to help with early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is the PARP. Additionally, the diagnostic laboratories segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the growing outsourcing of specialized biomarker testing services to laboratories and the increasing demand for high-throughput and sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.\n\n\n\nNorth America is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the well-established healthcare infrastructure, high adoption of precision medicine, the presence of leading pharmaceutical companies, and increasing prevalence of cancer, particularly breast and ovarian cancers, where PARP inhibitors are commonly used. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapidly expanding healthcare infrastructure, increasing awareness of cancer diagnostics and treatment options, rising healthcare spending, and growing patient population, particularly in countries like China and India. For instance, in January 2023, technology played a significant role in identifying novel markers of prostate cancer resistance to PARP inhibitors. Researchers have investigated how various genetic variants affect the effectiveness of PARP medicines using genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens. The identification of MMS22L, a gene that, when deleted, dramatically improves the susceptibility to PARP inhibitor, is a noteworthy finding from these investigations.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\nBase Year: 2024\n\nForecast Period: 2025-2035\n\nStudy Coverage\n\nMarket Forecast by Product, Service, Application, and End-User\n\nMarket Forecast for 5 Regions and 17+ Countries North America (U.S. and Canada) Europe (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Russia, Rest of Europe) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, Rest of APAC) Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of LATAM) MEA (South Africa, GCC, Rest of MEA)\n\nExhaustive Company Profiles of the Top 10+ Market Players AstraZeneca GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Pfizer, Inc.

            "content": "In a significant ruling, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently expanded the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS).The Court joined other circuit courts across the country in adopting, for the first time, the \u201cat-least-one-purpose rule,\u201d whereby a defendant violates the AKS when at least one purpose, rather than the sole or primary purpose, of a payment (or \u201cremuneration\u201d) is to induce the purchase of federally reimbursable healthcare products or services. This ruling significantly lowers the bar for proving AKS violations in the Second Circuit.\n\nThe Case: Novartis and \u201cSham\u201d Speaker Programs\n\nThe decision stemmed from a non-intervened qui tam lawsuit against Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The relator alleged that Novartis used \u201csham\u201d speaker programs to funnel illegal kickbacks to doctors, incentivizing them to prescribe the company\u2019s multiple sclerosis drug, Gilenya. These alleged \u201csham\u201d programs included: (1) lavish speaking events with no legitimate attendees and minimal educational content; (2) excessive payments for canceled speaking engagements; and (3) deliberately selecting high-prescribing physicians as speakers.\n\nAfter relator\u2019s Third Amended Complaint was dismissed with prejudice in 2022, by Judge Kimba Wood of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, relator appealed. On December 27, 2024, Judge Myrna Perez of the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal as to several categories of allegations in relator\u2019s complaint but revived the qui tam lawsuit by vacating the dismissal as to these three categories of allegations.\n\nAccepting relator\u2019s allegations as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Second Circuit ruled that all three categories of activities were pled with the requisite particularity and suggest that Novartis operated its speaker program at least in part to remunerate physicians to prescribe Gilenya, in violation of the AKS.\n\nThe Court thereby rejected Novartis\u2019s argument that relator must prove that the only purpose of the speaker program was to induce prescriptions, and for the first time adopted the at-least-one-purpose rule. As the Court noted, the at-least-one-purpose rule was first adopted by the Third Circuit in 1985 (United States v. Greber, 760 F.2d 68, 69, 72 (3d Cir. 1985)), and has since been adopted by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. Importantly, the Court also held that an allegation of an AKS violation does not require proof of any quid pro quo, or establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between payments and prescription volumes. Taken together, these two holdings provide a powerful tool for whistleblowers and government enforcement to prosecute all manner of payments to healthcare providers made by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other companies selling healthcare products and services.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe key takeaways from the opinion are:\n\nAt Least One Purpose is Enough: The court rejected the argument that remuneration to physicians is unlawful under the AKS only if the \u201csole purpose\u201d or \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the payment is to induce healthcare purchases. Rather, it is enough under the AKS to show that at least one purpose of the payment is to induce future purchases.\n\nThe court rejected the argument that remuneration to physicians is unlawful under the AKS only if the \u201csole purpose\u201d or \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the payment is to induce healthcare purchases. Rather, it is enough under the AKS to show that of the payment is to induce future purchases. No Quid Pro Quo Required: The court emphasized that proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship between payment and prescriptions is not necessary.\n\nThe court emphasized that proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship between payment and prescriptions is not necessary. Particularity is Paramount: While the \u201cat least one purpose\u201d standard broadens liability, courts will still scrutinize the level of detail in the allegations, in accordance with the heightened pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n\nPleading with Particularity: Facts Matter\n\nThe Court\u2019s analysis greatly turned on the degree of particularity with which relator pled the allegations. For the categories of allegations that the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal, the Court ruled that they were not pled with the \u201cspecific detail\u201d necessary to satisfy the at-least-one-purpose rule. In contrast, for the three categories of allegations that the Court vacated dismissal, it cited to specific allegations that met the heightened pleading requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and gave rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent. With respect to relator\u2019s allegations that (1) Novartis paid physicians via lavish speaking events with no legitimate attendees and minimal educational content, the Court cited particularly illustrative examples of these \u201csham\u201d events, such as a $1,000 three-person steak dinner where all three attendees were Novartis-speaker physicians from the same practice. Notably, the District Court looked at the same complaint and found that \u201crelator still has not provided a basis on which to infer that these events were fraudulent,\u201d and \u201cwithout more detail as to the composition of the audience at these events, and the content covered, Relator\u2019s claim that they are \u2018shams\u2019 is merely a \u2018conclusory allegation.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegarding relator\u2019s allegations that (2) Novartis provided excessive payments for canceled speaking engagements, the Second Circuit cited to relator\u2019s identification by name and location physicians whom Novartis paid, including for each the amount paid for canceled speaker events (approximately $20,000 per physician over a two-year period) and the volume and dollar value of Medicare claims for Gilenya prescriptions (from $1 to $1.7 million each over the same period). Again, the District Court was unsatisfied by the same complaint, dismissing it because the Relator did not identify \u201cthe circumstances or timing of the cancellation for any of these events.\u201d\n\nFor relator\u2019s allegations that (3) Novartis deliberately selected high-prescribing physicians as speakers, the Second Circuit cited to specific details showing that Novartis selected the physician speakers based on driving volume of Gilenya prescriptions, for example witness statements that Novartis representatives knew that a particular physician \u201cwould not prescribe Gilenya without speaking engagements.\u201d The District Court did not find this satisfactory, dismissing because \u201cRelator\u2019s allegations do not link\u201d Novartis\u2019s analysis to the actual prescribing habits.\n\nSo, what one Court sees as pleading with particularity, another may not.\n\nImpact\n\nThis ruling has major implications for the healthcare industry:\n\nIncreased Scrutiny of Marketing Practices: Pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare providers must carefully review their interactions with physicians to ensure compliance with the AKS.\n\nPharmaceutical companies and other healthcare providers must carefully review their interactions with physicians to ensure compliance with the AKS. Heightened Risk of Enforcement: The broader scope of liability increases the risk of government investigations and whistleblower lawsuits based on AKS violations.\n\nThis decision sends a clear message: even if a payment has legitimate purposes, it can still violate the AKS if inducing prescriptions (or other healthcare purchases) is one of them.\n\n[View source.]",

These clinics are considered excellent achievers and will be the company's Florida expansion base. Additionally, the retail pharmacies segment is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the expanding reach of retail pharmacy chains, rising over-the-counter availability of CNS medications, and the growing preference for outpatient treatment, particularly in emerging markets.\n\n\n\nNorth America is anticipated to have the highest revenue share during the forecast period owing to the well-established healthcare infrastructure, high prevalence of neurological and mental health disorders, significant investments in R&D, and the presence of key market players driving the adoption of innovative CNS therapies. Additionally, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapidly increasing healthcare spending, growing awareness of neurological and psychiatric disorders, expanding access to advanced treatments, and a large, aging population that is more susceptible to neurodegenerative conditions. For instance, Biogen reallocated its resources in January 2024, putting LEQEMBI ahead of ADUHELM, concentrating on developing novel Alzheimer's medicines, and stopping the development of ADUHELM because of safety and efficacy issues.\n\n\n\nReport Scope\n\nBase Year: 2024\n\nForecast Period: 2025-2035\n\nStudy Coverage\n\nMarket Forecast by Disease, Drug Class, and Distribution Channel\n\nMarket Forecast for 5 Regions and 17+ Countries North America (U.S. and Canada) Europe (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy, Russia, Rest of Europe) Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea, Rest of APAC) Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Rest of LATAM) MEA (South Africa, GCC, Rest of MEA)\n\nExhaustive Company Profiles of the Top 10+ Market Players Pfizer Inc.

This year, there will be even greater pressure to make a good match, as the pharmaceutical industry, which drives more than $1 trillion in economic activity and thousands of jobs, faces one of the largest patent cliffs in recent history.\n\nBetween now and 2033, the patents on dozens of brand-name medications will expire, allowing generic drugmakers to begin selling cheaper versions. Drug companies stand to lose more than $400 billion in revenue as patents expire for Keytruda, Eliquis, Jardiance, Opdivo, and other blockbuster therapies. (By comparison, the last major patent cliff that hit the industry, in 2011, jeopardized around $250 billion in drug revenue.)\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne of the few tried-and-tested methods for navigating a patent cliff is to acquire startups and new drugs \u2014 and lots of them.

            "content": "BIOSECURE Act\n\nHaving had 12 months of political insecurity courtesy of the US BIOSECURE Act, 2025 has seen the beginning of upheaval in China\u2019s contract manufacturing space.\n\nThe Act, introduced in January 2024, aimed to block \u201cforeign adversary biotech companies of US national security concern,\u201d naming such big players as BGI Group, MGI, Complete Genomics, WuXi AppTec, and WuXi Biologics. The bill achieved broad bipartisan support and passed with a 306 to 81 vote in the US House of Representatives back in September, triggering rumors that non-China based assets run by these companies could be divested.\n\nAnd such rumors have come to pass\u2026 to an extent. WuXi AppTec has announced a deal to sell its Advanced Therapies Unit (ATU) to Altaris for an undisclosed fee. The US-based investment firm will pick up a late phase/commercial viral manufacturing facility, a testing laboratory, a non-viral cell therapy plant, and a process development/early phase clinical manufacturing site, all in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It will also add capabilities in Oxford, UK inherited from WuXI AppTec\u2019s $135 million acquisition of Oxgene in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, WuXi Biologics is set to sell an Ireland vaccines manufacturing plant run by its joint venture WuXi Vaccines to its sole client, Merck & Co. (known as MSD outside of North America), who inked a 20-year $3 billion deal with the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) back in 2019.\n\nHowever, Jefferies analyst Cui Cui said in a note this sale is less to do with BIOSECURE and more because the facility \u201cno longer meets Wuxi Bio's ROI [return on investment] standards.\u201d In fact, Cui questions whether BIOSECURE \u2013 which was excluded from the US defense spending bill in December, causing WuXi Apptec and WuXi Biologics shares to spike \u2013 will actually come to fruition under the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cSenator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky), a key opponent of the BIOSECURE Act, is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee under the Trump presidency, whereas key supporter Brad Wenstrup is retiring,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMoreover, many believe Trump\u2019s government will likely be more business-oriented and that usage of Chinese CDMOs could help US pharma cut costs by 30-60%. Given lowering drug prices in the US is supported by both parties, allowing US pharma companies the flexibility to operate efficiently and maintain an optimal cost structure is essential.\u201d\n\nMerck and Hansoh\n\nOver to dealmaking, and the aforementioned Merck & Co. has entered into an exclusive global license agreement with China\u2019s Hansoh Pharma for preclinical candidate HS-10535.\n\nMerck will pay Hansoh $112 million upfront, though the Chinese firm, which retains the rights to the candidate in China, could receive up to $1.9 billion in milestone payments and royalties.\n\n\u201cThrough this agreement, we aim to build on our experience targeting incretin biology to evaluate HS-10535 and its potential to provide additional cardiometabolic benefits beyond weight reduction,\u201d Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories said.\n\nHS-10535 is an oral version of a small molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1s represent the current wave in blockbusters, specifically for diabetes and weight loss (though other indications are being investigated).\n\nThe modality has been driving the toplines for pioneers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, though other Big Pharma firms are looking to join the party through licensing deals. For Merck, the Hansoh deal brings a second GLP-1 into its pipeline, having forged a partnership with Korea\u2019s Hanmi Pharma in 2020 to codevelop efinopegdutide for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nHansoh itself has a history of collaborating with Western pharma firms, with the firm inking with two billion-dollar-plus antibody drug conjugate deals with GSK in 2023.\n\nRoche and Innovent\n\nAnd talking of ADCs, fellow Big Pharma firm Roche has also been busy partnering in China, entering a collaboration with Suzhou-headquartered Innovent Biologics to develop DLL3-targeted candidate IBI3009.\n\nRoche, which is no stranger to ADC development with two products \u2013 Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin) and Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) \u2013 on the market, will pay $80 million upfront though Innovent could receive up to $1 billion depending on development success.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to enter this partnership with the Innovent team to further develop this promising investigational treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Boris Za\u00eftra, head of Corporate Business Development at Roche, said. \u201cThis partnership builds on Roche's long history of innovation in the area of ADCs, to address the unmet needs of patients with solid tumors with transformational medicines.\"\n\nHaving shown encouraging anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor-bearing mouse models, IBI3009 entered into a Phase I study for small cell lung cancer began in December.\n\nSamsung Life Science Fund\n\nOver to Korea, and the Samsung Life Science Fund \u2013 a venture investment fund jointly established by Samsung C&T Corporation and its subsidiaries Samsung Biologics and Samsung Bioepis \u2013 has pledged to invest KRW 240 billion ($165 million) in Generate Biomedicines, a US-based biotech venture aimed at developing new technologies and businesses in life sciences.\n\nSpecifically, Generate Biomedicines focuses on protein design technologies using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The venture is also developing large-scale data accumulation capabilities to improve AI model performance and boost the success rate of novel drug development.\n\n\u201cWe have recognized Generate Biomedicine\u2019s potential to develop groundbreaking treatments,\u201d John Rim, CEO of Samsung Biologics, told Korean outlet The Bio. \u201cWe look forward to leveraging their expertise in AI and machine learning to build a collaborative ecosystem in development, manufacturing, and R&D, advancing the next-generation pharmaceuticals that our customers need.\u201d\n\nGenerate Biomedicine plans to launch three to six clinical programs over the next 18 months.",

This funding round was co-led by Frazier Life Sciences and Droia Ventures, with participation from Novartis Venture Fund, RTW Investments, RV Invest, Thuja Capital, and SSI Strategy.\n\nHeaded by a team of seasoned industry veterans with a strong chemistry background and expertise in rare disease drug development, the company is developing two small molecule therapeutics designed for oral administration. It expects to initiate clinical studies this year.\n\nThe company\u2019s lead asset ALE1 is a unique, orally active therapeutic candidate for hypophosphatasia (HPP), which is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ALPL gene. This condition leads to defective bone and tooth mineralization, causing fragile bones, early tooth loss, and clinically significant muscle weakness and fatigue in adult patients.\n\nALE1 inhibits a novel target for reducing inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels, a key metabolite central to the disease\u2019s pathology. Preclinical data supports ALE1 as a clinical candidate, demonstrating the desired reduction of PPi levels across multiple animal models following oral administration.\n\nALE1 is currently progressing through GLP toxicology studies, and Alesta expects to initiate clinical studies in 2025. And the company believes that ALE1 has the potential to address the entire spectrum of HPP and fundamentally transform patient care across this underserved disease. This asset was in-licensed from 1cBio, and the 1cBio team continues to support Alesta.\n\nAlesta is also developing ALE2 for addressing tRNA mutations that cause specific forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies that lead to progressive muscle weakness, sensory loss, and limb deformities. And this condition affects over 10,000 patients across the US, EU and Japan.\n\nALE2 targets chronic neurotoxicity by inhibiting GCN2, which is a key regulator of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) that becomes activated by ribosomal stalling caused by tRNA synthase mutations associated with CMT. The preclinical data supports ALE2 as a promising candidate for clinical development.\n\nThe Alesta team combines in-house chemistry and rare disease drug development expertise with insights from global academic and industry experts. Alesta is led by:\n\n\u2014 Ilan Ganot, Chief Executive Officer\n\n\u2014 Matthias Van Woensel, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer\n\n\u2014 Benit Maru, MBChB, Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer\n\nAlong with the CEO, Alesta\u2019s Board of Directors includes:\n\n\u2014 Laura Brass, Ph.D., Novartis Venture Fund\n\n\u2014 Luc Dochez, Droia Ventures\n\n\u2014 Dan Estes, Ph.D., Frazier Life Sciences\n\n\u2014 Janwillem Naesens, Droia Ventures\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\u201cClosing this financing marks an important moment for Alesta. With the support of our investors, the expertise and commitment of our team and collaborations with leading academics and disease advocacy groups, we are poised to make significant strides in addressing the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. This funding enables us to advance ALE1 toward clinical proof of concept and accelerate the development of ALE2, bringing us closer to delivering transformative therapies to those who need them most.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ilan Ganot, Chief Executive Officer of Alesta Therapeutics\n\n\u201cWe are proud to support Alesta Therapeutics in its mission to address critical unmet needs in rare diseases. The preclinical progress of ALE1 and ALE2 underscores the company\u2019s potential to deliver much-needed treatment options, and we are excited to support the continued advancement of these programs in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Luc Dochez, Chairman of the Board",

The study involved paediatric patients aged 2\u201317 with type II spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nGlobalData\u2019s report reveals that combined sales of IT and intravenous formulations of onasemnogene abeparvovec are projected to increase due to growing SMA awareness and newborn screening (NBS) implementation.\n\nNovartis\u2019 Zolgensma, an IV formulation, was FDA-approved in 2019 for patients under two with SMA.

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novartis (NVS)\n\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of varied drugs that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. It continues to build depth in core therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, renal and metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology in geographies like the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Novartis\u2019 efforts to strengthen its wide portfolio by developing breakthrough treatments have made it even more formidable in this space. Cosentyx, Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto, Scemblix, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio should fuel growth through 2030 and beyond.\n\nNVS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 11.62; value investors should take notice.\n\nFour analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $7.63 per share. NVS also boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.2%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, NVS should be on investors' short list.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: AMLX) (\u201cAmylyx\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the appointment of Dan Monahan as Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Monahan will also join the Company\u2019s Leadership Team. Mr. Monahan joined Amylyx in January 2024, bringing more than 20 years of commercial leadership experience in the biopharmaceutical industry overseeing sales, marketing, and market access for multiple product lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to announce the appointment of Dan Monahan to Chief Commercial Officer as Amylyx prepares for the first participant dosed in the Phase 3 LUCIDITY clinical trial of avexitide for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia planned in the first quarter of 2025. Dan has a strong track record of launching medicines and excels in building and leading high-performing teams that have brought new medicines to communities with high unmet needs,\u201d said Joshua Cohen and Justin Klee, Co-CEOs of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx earlier this year, Mr. Monahan has demonstrated invaluable leadership as we work towards ensuring launch readiness for the avexitide program ahead of Phase 3 data expected in 2026 and potential future launches. We are confident that the addition of Mr. Monahan to our leadership team will play a crucial role in delivering a meaningful impact to the PBH community as we continue to move forward in our goal for avexitide to be the first therapy approved for people living with PBH.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Monahan has remained deeply committed to launching therapies that address high unmet medical needs, bringing critical treatments to those who need them most. Prior to joining Amylyx, Mr. Monahan served as Vice President, Head of CNS Marketing and Portfolio Strategy at Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, where he led the U.S. commercialization efforts for the company\u2019s CNS franchise, including REXULTI\u00ae and ABILIFY MAINTENA\u00ae, which played a critical role in treating serious mental health conditions. Before joining Otsuka, Mr. Monahan held senior leadership roles at Novartis. He led the commercial execution of the company\u2019s flagship blockbuster dermatology brand, COSENTYX\u00ae, for patients with autoimmune conditions. Prior to Novartis, Mr. Monahan spent 14 years at Sanofi in positions of increasing leadership responsibility across sales, marketing and market access. He received an MBA from Seton Hall University, and is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Dan served as a Field Artillery Officer in the U.S. Army.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to collaborate with the team on advancing novel therapies from development through commercialization, with our first focus on avexitide for the potential treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dan Monahan, Chief Commercial Officer of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx, I have seen first-hand both the resilience of those with post-bariatric hypoglycemia and the significant quality of life impacts that this debilitating condition can have. I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to support people living with PBH and potentially addressing the critical unmet need for a treatment option.\u201d\n\nIn this role, Mr. Monahan will lead the Company\u2019s commercialization efforts, particularly as Amylyx prepares for the potential approval of avexitide, an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). Amylyx plans to initiate LUCIDITY, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAbout Avexitide\n\nAvexitide is an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist that has been evaluated in five clinical trials for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) and has also been studied in congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted avexitide Breakthrough Therapy Designation for both indications, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in congenital HI, and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (which includes PBH and congenital HI). Avexitide is designed to bind to the GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic islet beta cells and inhibit the effect of GLP-1 to mitigate hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin secretion and stabilizing blood glucose levels. In PBH, excessive GLP-1 can lead to the hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent debilitating hypoglycemic events. In two Phase 2 PBH trials, avexitide demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in hypoglycemic events. These events can lead to autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that can have a devastating impact on daily living.\n\nAbout the LUCIDITY Trial\n\nLUCIDITY (NCT06747468) is a 75-participant, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH. The Phase 3 trial will be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the U.S. Participants will be randomized 3:2 to receive either 90 mg of avexitide subcutaneously once daily or placebo. The trial will include a three-week run-in period and a 16-week double-blind treatment period. Participants who complete the double-blind period of the planned study will be eligible to enter an open-label extension (OLE) period with a duration of 32 weeks. The primary efficacy objective of LUCIDITY will evaluate the FDA-agreed upon primary outcome of reduction in the composite of Level 2 and Level 3 hypoglycemic events through Week 16. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.\n\nAbout Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)\n\nSymptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a condition that affects approximately 8% of people who have undergone bariatric surgery, or approximately 160,000 people, in the U.S. PBH is thought to be caused by an excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response leading to hypoglycemia and impaired quality of life. PBH can cause debilitating hypoglycemic events associated with inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, known as neuroglycopenia. Clinical manifestations can include impaired cognition, loss of consciousness, and seizures. PBH is also associated with a high degree of disability that can result in major disruptions to independent living. There are no approved therapies for PBH.\n\nAbout Amylyx Pharmaceuticals\n\nAmylyx is committed to the discovery and development of new treatment options for communities with high unmet needs, including people living with serious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions. Since its founding, Amylyx has been guided by science to address unanswered questions, keeping communities at the heart and center of all decisions. Amylyx is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, visit amylyx.com and follow us on LinkedIn and X.

            "content": "Novartis has recently announced that its intrathecal (IT) formulation of onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) successfully achieved the primary endpoint in a Phase III STEER study (NCT05089656) involving pediatric patients aged 2\u201317 years with type II spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These positive results have the potential to broaden the eligible patient population for this gene transfer therapy, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company.\n\nGlobalData\u2019s report, \u201cSpinal Muscular Atrophy: Opportunity Assessment and Forecast,\u201d reveals that the combined sales of IT and intravenous (IV) formulations of onasemnogene abeparvovec are projected to increase from $660.6 million in 2023 to $763.8 million by 2033 in the seven major markets (*7MM) due to the growing awareness of SMA and the implementation of newborn screening (NBS) across the markets, coupled with an increase the eligible population for gene transfer therapy.\n\nNovartis\u2019 Zolgensma, an IV formulation of onasemnogene abeparvovec, received FDA approval in 2019 and represents the first and only gene transfer therapy for the treatment of SMA. However, the eligible patient population indicated for Zolgensma is restricted to pediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA with biallelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.\n\nAlso Read Zydus Lifesciences partners with CVS Caremark for diabetes drugs template formulary\n\nIn the STEER study, OAV101 IT demonstrated clinical benefit in treatment-na\u00efve type II SMA patients ages 2-17, who were able to sit but had never walked independently. In addition, the safety profile of OAV101 IT was favorable, with overall adverse events and serious adverse events comparable in the investigational and control arms. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and vomiting.\n\nChristie Wong, Managing Neurology Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cHowever, safety concerns have previously been raised with OAV101 IT. In 2019, the FDA implemented a partial clinical hold on OAV101 IT due to a preclinical study in which animal findings showed dorsal root ganglia mononuclear cell inflammation, which was sometimes accompanied by neuronal cell body degeneration or loss. However, the clinical hold was lifted on OAV101 IT in August 2021, based on non-clinical data from a toxicology study in non-human primates that addressed safety concerns.\u201d\n\nNovartis plans to share STEER results with regulatory agencies including the FDA in 2025. If approved, OAV101 IT could broaden the patient population eligible for gene transfer therapy to include type II SMA patients under 18 years of age.\n\nAlso Read Can gel treat breast cancer? Indian scientists develop new injectable therapy with less side effects\n\nWong adds: \u201cThe key opinion leaders (KOLs) previously interviewed by GlobalData noted that the implementation of NBS initiatives in their countries has greatly facilitated disease detection during the pre-symptomatic stage and has enabled many eligible patients to receive Zolgensma. The availability of OAV101 IT would be most beneficial to patients where NBS for SMA is not yet adopted in their country and/or patients who received a delayed diagnosis.\u201d\n\nKOLs added that OAV101 IT would be welcomed by patients due to its treatment convenience of a one-time infusion, compared to Biogen\u2019s once-quarterly IT administration of Spinraza (nusinersen) and Roche\u2019s once-daily Evrysdi (risdiplam).\n\nWong concludes: \u201cIf approved, OAV101 IT could significantly enhance patient outcomes in markets where NBS or early diagnosis remains a challenge.\u201d",

            "content": "Atrazine is the second-most widely used weed killer in the United States, with more than 70 million pounds applied across the nation each year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It is an endocrine disruptor and also linked to various cancers, premature birth and birth defects.\n\nThe herbicide has been banned for use in the European Union since 2004. In the U.S., it is one of the most commonly reported contaminants in groundwater and public drinking water, according to the EPA.\n\nWhile atrazine is applied to a wide range of crops, it is primarily used on sugarcane, soy, sorghum, and corn; the USDA notes that more than 65 percent of all corn crops in the U.S. have been treated with the herbicide. It is also a weed killer for golf courses, fields, and residential and commercial lawn spaces across the United States.\n\nAtrazine is among the most prevalent herbicides used in Canada and Australia, as well.\n\nThe primary manufacturer of atrazine is Syngenta, a Swiss-based corporation owned by the Chinese state-owned company ChemChina.\n\nStudies of atrazine suggest health dangers\n\nEndocrine disruption\n\nA significant body of scientific research suggests that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor. An endocrine disruptor is a general term for a chemical that impedes normal functioning of the endocrine system, which \u201cregulates all biological processes in the body from conception through adulthood and into old age, including the development of the brain and nervous system, the growth and function of the reproductive system, as well as the metabolism and blood sugar levels,\u201d according to the EPA.\n\nEndocrine disruption in humans\n\nIn humans, atrazine has been linked to irregular estrogen levels and menstrual cycles, abnormal birth weight and unexplained infertility.\n\nIn a 2011 study published in the journal Environmental Research, scientists compared women\u2019s menstrual cycles in areas of Illinois, where atrazine was widely used on crops, with Vermont, where it was used rarely. The public drinking water in Illinois had double the amount of atrazine than in Vermont, though both places were within the legal limits. Researchers found that the women in agricultural areas of Illinois were five times more likely to report having irregular menstrual cycles than those in Vermont. The Illinois women were also more likely to report lower estrogen levels. The researchers wrote: \u201cWe present preliminary evidence that atrazine exposure, at levels below the US EPA [Maximum Contaminant Level], is associated with increased menstrual cycle irregularity, longer follicular phases, and decreased levels of menstrual cycle endocrine biomarkers of infertile ovulatory cycles.\u201d\n\nResearch published in 2004 in the American Journal of Epidemiology sought to examine the cross-sectional association between pesticides and the menstrual cycles of women living on farms in North Carolina and Iowa. The researchers found that \u201cwomen who used pesticides experienced longer menstrual cycles and increased odds of missed periods compared with women who never used pesticides.\u201d And specifically when they used probable endocrine-disrupting pesticides, including atrazine, women \u201chad a 60 to 100% increased odds of experiencing long cycles, missed periods, and intermenstrual bleeding compared with women who had never used pesticides.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 2001 in Environmental Health Perspectives, researchers collected and analyzed self-reported information from about 2,000 couples living on farms regarding the effects of various pesticides on the risk of spontaneous abortion in a farm population in Ontario, Canada. They found that preconception exposure to atrazine was among the pesticides associated with a 20 to 40 percent relative increase in risk of spontaneous abortion in pregnancies less than 20 weeks gestation. Researchers wrote: \u201cOur findings of an association between preconception exposure and an early abortion may imply that for some pesticides, preconception exposures lead to gross chromosomal anomalies. On the other hand, our finding of an association between late abortions and postconception exposure may suggest that postconception exposure to specific pesticides tends to damage the fetus or fetus\u2013placenta complex rather than cause chromosomal anomalies.\u201d\n\nIn a 2007 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives, researchers compared steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) expression in atrazine responsive and non-responsive cell lines and transfected SF-1 into nonresponsive cell lines to assess SF-1\u2019s role in atrazine-induced aromatase. They found that \u201catrazine-responsive adrenal carcinoma cells (H295R) expressed 54 times more SF-1 than nonresponsive ovarian granulosa KGN cells. Exogenous SF-1 conveyed atrazine-responsiveness to otherwise nonresponsive KGN and NIH/3T3 cells. Atrazine induced binding of SF-1 to chromatin and mutation of the SF-1 binding site in ArPII eliminated SF-1 binding and atrazine-responsiveness in H295R cells.\u201d Researchers concluded that the findings \u201care consistent with atrazine\u2019s endocrine-disrupting effects\u201d in aquatic life, along with the links between mammary and prostate tumors in rats and reproductive cancers in humans. Researchers wrote, \u201cThis study highlights the importance of atrazine as a risk factor in endocrine disruption in wildlife and reproductive cancers in laboratory rodents and humans.\u201d\n\nEndocrine disruption in mammals\n\nAnimal studies have shown that atrazine may affect reproductive function in mammals, including estrous cycles, sperm motility, testosterone levels, and prolactin, luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormone levels.\n\nIn a comprehensive review published in the journal Toxics in 2015, researchers examined 20 years of animal studies that focused on atrazine exposure and reproductive dysfunction. They were particularly interested in how the herbicide affected the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which is vital for maintaining proper reproductive function. For female animals, researchers concluded: \u201cFemale mammalian models have addressed the effects of atrazine at numerous life stages. Gestational and prenatal studies have demonstrated a significant delay in vaginal opening and a controversial effect on mammary gland epithelium. Adult exposure studies report robust alterations in reproductive hormones. \u2026 In combination, atrazine is reported to elicit a prolonged estrous cycle and histological alterations of ovarian tissue including an increase in atretic follicles.\u201d For males, the researchers wrote: \u201cPrenatal and adult studies show decreased levels of testosterone and altered testicular morphology in response to atrazine exposure. In addition, numerous steroidogenic genes and upstream regulators are altered due to atrazine exposure in both granulosa and Leydig cells.\u201d\n\nIn a meta-analysis published in 2021 in Environmental Science and Pollution Research, researchers analyzed the results of 36 relevant studies related to male rats exposed to atrazine. They found that, when compared to rats that were not exposed to atrazine, those exposed experienced a significant decrease in the weight of the testis, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and other organs. The serum testosterone concentration was also reduced in atrazine-exposed rats. Researchers wrote that atrazine may significantly reduce the number of sperm in the epididymis, along with daily sperm production. Rats had worse sperm motility, and they produced more dead sperm than non-exposed rats. The researchers concluded: \u201cAtrazine exposure may have toxic effects on many aspects of [the] rodents\u2019 male reproductive system, and has a cross-species effect and a dose-dependent trend. \u2026 Pathways related to oxidative stress and apoptosis may be responsible for the toxicity of the male reproductive system.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 2020 in Frontiers in Endocrinology, researchers examined the effects of long-term exposure to atrazine beginning in utero in male mice and how it affected their metabolic and reproductive traits. Researchers then examined whether mating these males to females unexposed to atrazine changed in vitro embryo characteristics. The scientists wrote: \u201cAtrazine exposure caused a decrease in liver weight and changes in both liver and testis gene expression, specifically in genes involved in lipid uptake and fatty acid metabolism in the liver, as well as androgen conversion in the testis. Notably, atrazine exposure decreased epididymal sperm concentration and subsequent embryo cell numbers generated from the 12-week cohort males.\u201d\n\nA study published in 2012 in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology found that atrazine acts as an endocrine disruptor by inhibiting cAMP levels in cultured rat pituitary and testicular Leydig cells. Researchers wrote: \u201cAtrazine-induced changes in cAMP levels were sufficient to stimulate prolactin release in pituitary cells and androgen production in Leydig cells, indicating that it acts as an endocrine disruptor both in cells that secrete by exocytosis of prestored hormones and in cells that secrete by de novo hormone synthesis.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 2017 in Scientific Reports, French researchers examined the effects of atrazine exposure on meiosis. They found that \u201cembryonic exposure to atrazine increases the level of 8-oxo-guanine in the nucleus of meiotic cells, reflecting oxidative stress and affecting meiotic double-strand break repair, chromosome synapsis and crossover numbers. Finally, embryonic exposure to atrazine reduces the number of primordial follicles and increases the incidence of multi-oocyte follicles in adult mice. Our data demonstrate that embryonic exposure to atrazine disrupts prophase I of meiosis and affects normal follicle formation in female mice.\u201d\n\nA 2019 study conducted by researchers at the University of Melbourne and published in the journal Reproduction, Fertility and Development, found that, when male mice were exposed to atrazine, at levels permitted in public drinking water in Australia, they experienced reduced sperm viability and increased weight gain. The herbicide also altered the expression of key metabolic genes in the liver and testis. Researchers concluded that \u201ca chronic reduction in sperm quality and increased weight gain could have negative consequences on the reproductive capacity of males, and further studies should consider the effects of long-term atrazine exposure on male reproductive health.\u201d\n\nIn a comparison study published in 2000 in the journal Toxicological Sciences, researchers conducted a variety of experiments on female rats to examine estrogen-induced surges of luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin when exposed to atrazine. They found that atrazine changed these levels in the animals by modifying the hormones\u2019 hypothalamic control. The scientists wrote that the results \u201csupport the hypothesis that the effect of atrazine on LH and prolactin secretion is mediated via a hypothalamic site of action.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 1994 in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, researchers evaluated the effects of atrazine exposure in two types of female rats, Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344. They examined their body, ovaries, uterus, and adrenal weights, estrous cycle stages, vaginal cytology, along with plasma hormone estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and corticosterone levels. The scientists found that both types of rats experienced significant decreases in body weights of both Sprague\u2010Dawley and Fischer 344 female rats when exposed to atrazine. They also had a significant reduction in ovarian and uterine weights, and a decrease in circulating estradiol levels. Both types of female rats also had a longer estrous cycle. Researchers wrote: \u201cThese findings suggest that treatment with doses of triazine at or above the MTD may result in prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen in the Sprague\u2010Dawley but not the Fischer 344 rat. These changes may account for the observed earlier onset and/or increased incidence of mammary tumors in chlorotriazine\u2010treated female Sprague\u2010Dawley rats.\u201d\n\nIn a research article published in 1996 in Toxicology Letters, Croatian researchers assessed the effects of atrazine exposure in low doses in female pigs by examining the biochemical and histopathological parameters of the ovarian function. They specifically examined serum 17\u03b2-oestradiol (17\u03b2-E) and progesterone (P) concentrations. When compared with pigs not exposed to atrazine, the researchers found that the atrazine-treated pigs had a significantly higher serum P concentration and significantly lower serum 17\u03b2-E concentration before the next expected oestrus, which then did not occur. The pigs exposed to atrazine also experienced more multiple ovarian follicular cysts and benign cysts.\n\nA 2020 study conducted by researchers at the University of Melbourne and published in the journal Reproduction, Fertility and Development examined the effects of atrazine on marsupials, which have experienced significant population decline throughout Australia over the last several decades. Scientists found that, when adult female wallabies were exposed to high levels of atrazine throughout pregnancy, birth and lactation, the expression of genes required for normal testis function was altered in their male offspring. The researchers also found that the male offspring also had \u201ca significant reduction\u201d in penis length. The researchers wrote: \u201cThese results demonstrate that atrazine exposure during gestation and lactation can significantly affect the development of male young by affecting virilisation. Given the known vulnerability of macropodid marsupials to endocrine disruption, as well as their overlapping distribution with agricultural areas, these data raise major concerns for the use of pesticides in areas with fragile marsupial populations.\u201d\n\nBirth defects\n\nScientific research has linked atrazine to several birth defects, including choanal atresia, stenosis, gastroschisis, and more.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study published in 2024 in JAMA Network Open, researchers investigated county-level atrazine use with the rate of infant diagnoses of gastroschisis, a rare birth defect where an opening in the newborn\u2019s abdomen wall causes the intestines to spill outside the body. The research included data of all live births in the U.S., along with data on atrazine application in the U.S., between 2009 and 2019. The study authors found that \u201chigher county levels of atrazine were associated with infant diagnoses of gastroschisis.\u201d\n\nIn a 2013 study published in Pediatrics, researchers at the University of Texas School of Public Health found that, \u201ccompared to [children] of mothers with low levels of estimated residential atrazine exposure, those with high levels had nearly a two-fold increase in risk for choanal atresia or stenosis.\u201d This congenital condition is caused by a narrowing or blocking of the back of the nasal passage, which can lead to life-threatening respiratory symptoms.\n\nA 2012 study published in Maternal and Child Health Journal examined maternal exposure to atrazine and the risk of gastroschisis. Researchers examined birth data in Texas between 1999 and 2008. They found the risk of gastroschisis in newborns significantly increased in mothers who were less than 25 years old and exposed to high levels of residential atrazine exposure compared to low exposure. Interestingly, the association was not seen in mothers over 25 years old who were also exposed to high levels of atrazine.\n\nResearch presented in 2010 at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine found, by using data from the Washington State Birth Certificate and U.S. Geological Survey databases, that gastroschisis was more common in mothers who lived within 25 kilometers of an area with elevated exposure to atrazine and other agrichemicals. The researchers concluded, \u201cMaternal exposure to surface water atrazine is associated with fetal gastroschisis, particularly in spring conceptions.\u201d\n\nIn a study published in 2011 in Environmental Health Perspectives, researchers at the University of Rennes in France assessed the link between adverse birth outcomes and urinary biomarkers of prenatal atrazine exposure before the 19th week of gestation. After collecting urine samples from 579 pregnant women, scientists found that pregnant women who had a positive biomarker for atrazine had an association with reduced fetal growth and small head circumference, when compared with women who did not have atrazine biomarkers in their urine samples. Researchers concluded, \u201cEvidence of associations with adverse birth outcomes raises particular concerns for countries where atrazine is still in use.\u201d\n\nPreterm delivery\n\nIn a 2017 study published in Environmental Research and conducted by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago, researchers found that exposure to atrazine in public drinking water was associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery. The study examined more than 130,000 single births between 2004 and 2008 in 46 counties in the midwest that were part of the EPA\u2019s Atrazine Monitoring Program (AMP). The study authors wrote: \u201cOur findings do raise concerns about the potential adverse effects of these common water contaminants on human development and health, and the adequacy of current regulatory standards.\u201d\n\nAbnormal birth weight and unexplained infertility\n\nIn a 2008 study published in the journal PLoS ONE, researchers from the University of California at San Francisco tested the effects of atrazine on human placental cells in vitro. They found that the herbicide \u201cincreased the activity of a gene associated with abnormal human birth weight when over-expressed in the placenta. Atrazine also targeted a second gene that has been found to be amplified in the uterus of women with unexplained infertility.\u201d\n\nBreast cancer\n\nIn a study conducted by scientists at China\u2019s Jilin University who examined cells in vitro and in vivo, findings showed that atrazine suppressed immune cell function, and in turn promoted tumor proliferation and migration in triple-negative breast cancer. Researchers concluded that \u201cthis study demonstrated that atrazine accelerated the cell cycle and encouraged the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells.\u201d The research was published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety in March 2023.\n\nIn a 1997 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives, researchers at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine analyzed low, medium, and high exposure levels of atrazine in Kentucky counties, alongside data on county breast cancer rates in the state registry. The results showed a \u201cstatistically significant increase in breast cancer risk with medium and high levels of triazine exposure. The results suggest a relationship between exposure to triazine herbicides and increased breast cancer risk, but conclusions concerning causality cannot be drawn, due to the limitations inherent in ecologic study design.\u201d\n\nNeurotoxicity\n\nIn a study published in the January 2024 issue of Science of the Total Environment, researchers examined the neurotoxic effects of atrazine by exposing floor plate progenitors (FPPs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to low concentrations of the herbicide for two days. The scientists noted a \u201csignificant decrease in the complexity of neurite network, increase of neuronal activity, and elevated tau- and \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) pathologies after atrazine exposure.\u201d The changes, the researchers wrote, \u201calign with pathological characteristics in Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d and the findings support \u201ca strong evidence base that low-concentration ATZ exposure during development can elicit increased risk of neurodegeneration.\u201d\n\nIn a review published in 2021 in the journal Toxics, scientists wrote, \u201cThere is evidence of crosstalk between systems that can be affected by atrazine exposure, causing widespread dysfunction and leading to changes in behavior even with no direct link to the hypothalamus. The hypothetical mechanism of toxicity of atrazine endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity can therefore be described as a web of pathways that are influenced through changes occurring in each and their multiple feedback loops with further research needed to refine [no-observed-adverse-effect-levels] for neurotoxic outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn a 2023 study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology, researchers examined the toxic effects of atrazine on the hippocampus and examined whether lycopene offers protective benefits of atrazine-induced impairment in male mice. The researchers wrote: \u201cAtrazine can cause spatial learning and memory impairments by inducing histopathological changes in the hippocampus and ferroptosis in the hippocampal cells.\u201d\n\nLow birthweight\n\nIn a study published in 2018 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, researchers examined adverse birth outcomes between 2006 and 2008 in Ohio communities with high atrazine contamination in public drinking water. The researchers wrote: \u201cSignificantly increased odds of term low-birthweight birth was associated with atrazine exposure over the entire gestational period and second trimesters of pregnancy.\u201d They continued: \u201cOur results suggest that atrazine exposure is associated with reduced birth weight among term infants and that exposure to atrazine in drinking water in early and mid-pregnancy may be most critical for its toxic effects on the fetus.\u201d They concluded: \u201cThese results suggest that the current maximum contaminant level for atrazine may not be protective against some adverse birth outcomes such as term low birth weight.\u201d\n\nA 2005 study published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine examined the link between atrazine levels in public drinking water in France and various adverse reproductive outcomes. Researchers found that atrazine levels were slightly associated with premature births. They also found that atrazine levels were linked to an increased risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) status when the third trimester was around the same time as the summer season, when atrazine levels in drinking water were highest. \u201cFindings point to the third trimester of pregnancy as the potential vulnerable period for an increased risk of SGA birth.\u201d\n\nSlowed metabolism and weight gain\n\nIn a 2009 study published in PLoS ONE, researchers examined the effects of chronic atrazine exposure on mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in rats. Researchers fed the rats drinking water with low concentrations of atrazine for five months. They found that the rats exposed to atrazine had a \u201cdecreased basal metabolic rate, and increased body weight, intra-abdominal fat and insulin resistance without changing food intake or physical activity level.\u201d They concluded: \u201cThese results suggest that long-term exposure to the herbicide ATZ might contribute to the development of insulin resistance and obesity.\u201d\n\nGestational diabetes\n\nA small study published in 2007 in the journal Diabetes Care examined data from the Agricultural Health Study to see whether exposure to certain pesticides, including atrazine, put pregnant women in their first trimester at higher risk of gestational diabetes. Researchers found that risk of gestational diabetes was \u201csignificantly associated\u201d when women self-reported ever having used atrazine. The exposure of three other herbicides (2,4,5-T; 2,4,5-TP; atrazine; or butylate) and three insecticides (diazinon, phorate, or carbofuran) were also significantly associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nRenal failure\n\nA 2016 study published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine examined the link between end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) and dozens of pesticides from data in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. The results showed that farmers who were chronically exposed to atrazine and other pesticides throughout their lives were at higher risk of kidney failure. The more significant use of atrazine was associated with a higher risk of the disease. The researchers wrote: \u201cOur findings support an association between ESRD and chronic exposure to specific pesticides and suggest pesticide exposures resulting in medical visits may increase the risk of ESRD.\u201d\n\nRespiratory issues\n\nIn a 2002 study published in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, researchers examined the risk of wheeze among applicators of various pesticides by examining the data of a large cohort of certified pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina from the Agricultural Health Study. They found that atrazine was associated with wheeze. Researchers specifically noted that \u201catrazine had a significant dose\u2013response trend with participants applying atrazine more than 20 days [per] year having an odds ratio of 1.5.\u201d\n\nEndocrine disruption in aquatic life\n\nIn amphibians and various fish, atrazine has been shown to damage reproductive organs and systems.\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Tyrone Hayes of the University of California, Berkeley conducted research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) that showed African clawed frogs experienced \u201ccomplete feminization and chemical castration\u201d when living in water contaminated with atrazine, at levels within the legal limit in public drinking water in the United States. Hayes writes: \u201cOur study showed that atrazine-induced females are indeed genetic males. Furthermore, we showed that feminization is persistent and complete, resulting in reproductively functional females capable of producing viable eggs.\u201d\n\nPrior to his 2010 study, Hayes published several other studies with similar results. In a 2002 study published in Nature, Hayes examined the effects of atrazine contamination in water on wild leopard frogs in various regions of the U.S. He found that, in males, atrazine was linked to significant gonadal abnormalities, including incomplete development. Hayes wrote, \u201cthese results are supported by laboratory observations, which together highlight concerns over the biological effects of environmental atrazine on amphibians.\u201d\n\nA 2011 review published in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which included Hayes along with 21 co-authors around the world presented \u201ca state of the art summary of the mechanisms by which atrazine acts as an endocrine disruptor to produce these effects.\u201d The researchers wrote, \u201cAtrazine demasculinizes male gonads producing testicular lesions associated with reduced germ cell numbers in teleost fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, and induces partial and/or complete feminization in fish, amphibians, and reptiles. These effects are strong (statistically significant), consistent across vertebrate classes, and specific.\u201d\n\nA 2009 qualitative meta-analysis of atrazine effects on aquatic life found evidence that atrazine \u201ccan have indirect and sublethal effects.\u201d Specifically, the research, which was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives and conducted by scientists at the University of South Florida noted, \u201cthe relationship between atrazine concentration and timing of amphibian metamorphosis was regularly nonmonotonic, indicating that atrazine can both accelerate and delay metamorphosis.\u201d Furthermore, \u201catrazine reduced size at or near metamorphosis in 15 of 17 studies and 14 of 14 species. Atrazine elevated amphibian and fish activity in 12 of 13 studies, reduced antipredator behaviors in 6 of 7 studies, and reduced olfactory abilities for fish but not for amphibians. Atrazine was associated with a reduction in 33 of 43 immune function end points and with an increase in 13 of 16 infection end points. Atrazine altered at least one aspect of gonadal morphology in 7 of 10 studies and consistently affected gonadal function, altering spermatogenesis in 2 of 2 studies and sex hormone concentrations in 6 of 7 studies.\u201d\n\nIn a 2008 animal study published in PLoS One, researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found atrazine affects \u201chormone signaling and endocrine transcriptional networks in zebrafish and in mammalian cells.\u201d Scientists wrote, \u201cWe propose that this pervasive and persistent environmental chemical alters hormone networks via convergence of NR5A activity and cAMP signaling, to potentially disrupt normal endocrine development and function in lower and higher vertebrates.\u201d\n\nWhat is atrazine?\n\nSource: American Chemical Society\n\nAtrazine (6-chloro-N2-ethyl-N4-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) is a chlorinated herbicide that is derived from triazine. It is water soluble and used to kill broadleaf and grassy weeds. In broadleaf and grassy weeds, the chlorotriazine herbicide works by interfering with photosynthesis by disrupting the electron transport chain.\n\nScientists at Swiss-based CIBA-GEIGY (now Novartis AG) invented atrazine in 1958 and has been widely used in the U.S. since the 1960s. It is usually applied to crops to preemptively ward off weeds, but it can also be used post-emergently. Only people who have been trained with the product can now apply atrazine in the U.S.\n\nManufactured by Swiss-based, China-owned Syngenta\n\nThe Syngenta Group is a multinational agricultural corporation based in Basel, Switzerland. In May 2017, state-owned Chinese corporation ChemChina bought Syngenta for $44 billion, the largest foreign purchase ever by a Chinese state-owned company. The U.S. Department of Defense has listed ChemChina among companies that are \u201c\u2018Chinese military companies\u2019 operating directly or indirectly in the United States.\u201d\n\nSyngenta\u2019s main products include herbicides, pesticides, and seeds; it is the primary manufacturer of atrazine. The company reported $33.4 billion in sales in 2022.\n\nWhy did the EU ban atrazine?\n\nIn 2004, the EU banned the use of atrazine after it was found to surpass the regulatory limits of pesticide (0.1\u00b5g/L) in groundwater, according to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).\n\nIn the EU Commission\u2019s decision letter regarding atrazine in 2004, the commission wrote: \u201cThe Committee is \u2026 of the opinion that available monitoring data does not demonstrate that concentrations of atrazine or its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l in groundwater and it expects that for soils with pH above six concentrations of atrazine and its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued: \u201cIn particular, available monitoring data were insufficient to demonstrate that in large areas concentrations of the active substance and its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l in groundwater. Moreover it cannot be assured that continued use in other areas will permit a satisfactory recovery of groundwater quality where concentrations already exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l in groundwater. These levels of the active substance exceed the limits in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC and would have an unacceptable effect on groundwater.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the EU committee found that atrazine not only regularly exceeded the maximum limits in groundwater but also deemed there were insufficient monitoring and measures in place to mitigate such excess.\n\nOn its Substance Infocard, the ECHA warns about atrazine: \u201cAccording to the harmonised classification and labelling (CLP00) approved by the European Union, this substance is very toxic to aquatic life, is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects, may cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure and may cause an allergic skin reaction.\u201d\n\nIn the EU, atrazine is also subject to export notification and explicit consent requirements of the prior informed consent regulation (PIC), the ECHA told U.S. Right to Know. In other words, any exporting of atrazine from the EU to third countries requires consent from the receiving end before the export takes place. In 2012, Switzerland also banned atrazine. The country is not an EU member state, but it is where the primary manufacturer of atrazine, Syngenta, is headquartered.\n\nThe persistence of atrazine in groundwater\n\nFor decades, research has demonstrated atrazine persistence in groundwater and surface water, even long after it has been used; it is among the most frequently detected contaminants in public drinking water in the U.S.\n\nThe herbicide\u2019s \u201cchemical properties make it susceptible to leaching and runoff, especially during heavy rains,\u201d according to the USDA. Research has shown that atrazine can remain in soil and groundwater for decades.\n\nA study published in 2014 in the journal Water Research found that in Germany, \u201ceven 20 years after the ban of atrazine, the groundwater concentrations of sampled [observation wells] remain on a level close to the threshold value of 0.1 \u03bcg l\u22121 without any considerable decrease.\u201d\n\nIn a commentary piece published in 2010 regarding atrazine\u2019s persistence, scientists in Germany wrote in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research that, \u201ceven more than 18 years after it was banned in Germany, atrazine remains the most abundant pesticide in groundwater samples.\u201d They continued: \u201cThat, after decades of weathering, atrazine is still detectable, and metabolites (apparently with triazine ring intact) are still abundant in soil, underscores the need to assess the environmental behavior of this herbicide on longer time scales.\u201d\n\nClick here to see a map from the U.S. Geological Survey of estimated atrazine use across the United States in 2019.\n\nWhat are the legal levels of atrazine in drinking water?\n\nIn the U.S., the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of atrazine is 3 \u00b5g/L (parts per billion) in public drinking water. In the European Union, atrazine is banned for use, but the EU\u2019s Water Directive Framework has set a general precautionary standard level for pesticides in groundwater at 0.1\u00b5g/L, 30 times lower than the U.S. limit on atrazine.\n\nAccording to the EU\u2019s 2006 Groundwater Directive, the decision to set the level at 0.1\u00b5g/L \u201cincludes the objective to achieve water quality levels that do not give rise to significant impacts on, and risks to, human health and the environment.\u201d\n\nAtrazine contamination in groundwater\n\nA 2018 report published by the Environmental Working Group found that around 30 million Americans in 28 states have some level of atrazine in their drinking water. In general, levels of atrazine in tap water are highest in the late spring and early summer, when farmers typically spray their crops with the herbicide. The report also found that several locations monitored in the EPA\u2019s Atrazine Monitoring Project had, at times, particularly during the late spring and summer months, tested for atrazine three to seven times above the legal limit in public drinking water. Furthermore, the dispatch noted that officials did not report the contamination levels to people living in those communities.\n\nA study published in 2010 in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry tested soils in Belgium and Germany and found that \u201catrazine application history dramatically influences its degradation and mineralization.\u201d Their soil tests also suggested that \u201catrazine is not completely mineralized and remains extractable even in adapted soils, and \u2026 appears to be conserved on long time scales after the last application.\n\nA study conducted by scientists at the U.S. Geological Society and published in 2021 in the journal Environmental Science and Technology found that, of the 442 U.S. streams tested, atrazine contaminated 55 percent of surface water and 70 percent of the groundwater.\n\nAtrazine-related lawsuits\n\nIn 2012, dozens of U.S. water-utility companies hit Syngenta with a federal class-action lawsuit, alleging that the company knew the herbicide was contaminating local drinking water supplies. The lawsuit also cited atrazine\u2019s potential danger it posed to the environment and pregnant women. Syngenta agreed to a settlement and paid $105 million, which was split between the water utility companies.\n\nIn 2020, advocacy groups sued the EPA after it reapproved the use of atrazine, claiming that the government agency failed to uphold its duties to monitor and confirm the herbicide did not pose risks to public health through water contamination.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn 2016, the state of California added atrazine to its Prop 65 list of toxic chemicals, and listed the herbicide as causing developmental toxicity and reproductive toxicity.\n\nRecent changes proposed by the EPA\n\nIn June 2022, the EPA proposed, for public comment, changes to atrazine use in the United States in order to reduce runoff and leaching. As shown on the EPA website, they are as follows:\n\nProhibit application when soils are saturated or above field capacity (i.e., the soil\u2019s ability to retain water);\n\nProhibit application during rain or when a storm event, likely to produce runoff from the treated area, is forecasted to occur within 48 hours following application;\n\nProhibit aerial applications of all formulations; and\n\nRestrict annual application rates to 2 pounds of active ingredient or less per acre per year or less for applications to sorghum, field corn, and sweet corn.\n\nFarmers choose from a \u201cpicklist\u201d of EPA-approved counter-measures to reduce leaching and runoff\n\nBoost record-keeping by atrazine-users to ensure safe practices\n\nIn an email statement to U.S. Right to Know, the U.S. EPA wrote: \u201cEPA expects to make a final decision on atrazine in mid- to late-2024, after the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) meeting on August 22 to 24. Currently, the Agency is working on the upcoming SAP meeting, as well as reviewing and considering more than 500 comments received on the proposal. Once the final decision is released, the new mitigation measures would appear on labels within 1 to 2 years.\u201d\n\nDispute between Syngenta and scientist Tyrone Hayes\n\nDr. Tyrone Hayes, a professor of integrative biology of University of California, Berkeley, has studied atrazine for decades. In 1997, Hayes was recruited to conduct research for the herbicide on an expert committee for Syngenta (then Novartis). While conducting his research, he discovered that, when exposed to atrazine, male frogs underwent significant reproductive changes and developed abnormal gonads.\n\nHayes explained to Mother Jones in 2012 that, for decades, scientists had been sounding the alarm about decreasing amphibian populations all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019re asking, \u2018How come there aren\u2019t any new frogs?\u2019 Atrazine isn\u2019t killing the frogs. But if they\u2019re reproductively impaired, that\u2019s killing the population.\u201d\n\nWhen he brought his findings to Syngenta, Hayes said executives did not appear concerned and even questioned the veracity of his findings. Eventually Hayes quit working for the corporation, and then repeated the experiment multiple times and found similar results. He published several peer-reviewed research papers over the course of the following decade.\n\nSyngenta representatives began attending Hayes\u2019 academic talks and testimonies; sometimes Hayes would get into arguments about his research with the attending representatives. Other times, they would insult one another on professional and personal levels, Nature reported in 2010. Hayes continuously expressed concern that Syngenta was spying on him and trying to ruin his reputation. In 2013, unsealed court documents related to the federal class-action lawsuit against Syngenta revealed that the corporation had put forward a multi-million-dollar public relations strategy to discredit atrazine critics, and specifically singled out Hayes.\n\nSyngenta document shows \u201cdiscredit Hayes\u201d as the first action item under \u201cscience.\u201d\n\nAs Rachel Aviv described the conflict in the New Yorker in 2014, \u201cThe company documents show that, while Hayes was studying atrazine, Syngenta was studying him, as he had long suspected. Syngenta\u2019s public-relations team had drafted a list of four goals. The first was \u2018discredit Hayes.\u2019 In a spiral-bound notebook, Syngenta\u2019s communications manager, Sherry Ford, who referred to Hayes by his initials, wrote that the company could \u2018prevent citing of TH data by revealing him as noncredible.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a perspective piece published in the journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in 2020, biologist Jason Rohr of the University of Notre Dame offered a timeline of the most important events in the \u201catrazine saga\u201d between Syngenta and Hayes. Rohr argued, \u201cThe atrazine controversy must be \u2026 used as an example of how manufacturing uncertainty and bending science can be exploited to delay undesired regulatory decisions and how greed and conflicts of interest\u2014situations where personal or organizational considerations have compromised or biased professional judgment and objectivity\u2014can affect environmental and public health and erode trust in the discipline of toxicology, science in general, and the honorable functioning of societies.\u201d\n\nSyngenta\u2019s defense of atrazine\n\nSyngenta stands by atrazine as a safe and effective product, and the corporation estimates that the herbicide, along with simazine, saves U.S. consumers between $4.3 billion to nearly $6.2 billion yearly. On Syngenta\u2019s website, it states: \u201cGovernments and international agencies continue to approve atrazine because there is no credible connection between the herbicide and any health problem in humans.\u201d\n\nIn a recent webinar moderated by Dr. Tyrone Hayes, U.S. Right to Know co-founder Stacy Malkan presented her 2022 report Merchants of Poison, which investigated and demonstrated the various strategies pesticide manufacturers have used to discredit scientists.\n\nOne of these ways is to make use of organizations like the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH). The agency refers to itself as a \u201cpro-science consumer advocacy organization\u201d but is a front organization that solicits money in exchange for dispensing research and communications that champions and advocates for controversial products.\n\nAn example of this was in 2011, when the ACSH funded the publication of a book by Jon Entine about \u201cchemophobia,\u201d or the unfounded fear of chemicals. The book maintained that atrazine was safe. Today, Entine is the executive director of the Genetic Literacy Project, a nonprofit group similar to ACSH that works with Monsanto.\n\nInternal company files obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy in the midst of the major 2012 lawsuit against Syngenta demonstrated that the chemical giant channeled millions of dollars toward strategies to get external allies to influence public opinion of atrazine.\n\nIn a 2009 email, ACSH staff requested an additional $100,000 from Syngenta \u2013 \u201cseparate and distinct from general operating support Syngenta has been so generously providing over the years\u201d \u2013 to create a \u201cconsumer-friendly booklet\u201d on atrazine to educate journalists and scientists.\n\nThe ACSH staffer continued in the email: \u201cWe will widely distribute the report to the media, and use it as the basis for Op-eds, letters to the editors, media appearances etc. \u2026 In the course of the project, we would bring our 400 scientists up to the date on the subject.\u201d\n\nEPA review of atrazine studies\n\nIn early 2010, the EPA announced it would be conducting a new scientific review of the risk of atrazine. That same year, the Huffington Post Investigative Fund reported that the EPA relied heavily on industry-backed research in its assessment, with studies funded by Syngenta, its affiliates, or Syngenta-backed researchers.\n\nResearch on Syngenta\u2019s website\n\nOn its website, Syngenta links to several studies that demonstrate a lack of association between atrazine and various health risks, including cancer, hyperthyroidism, and breast cancer. Still, other research linked on its website does indeed demonstrate risk, including a study that found an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among women who had exposure to pesticides (including atrazine) in their first trimester, and another study that showed pesticides, including atrazine, might lead to respiratory problems in farmers.\n\nOther fact sheets\n\nJournalism",

            "content": "Aetna Files Lawsuit Against Major Drugmakers Alleging Price-Fixing Conspiracy\n\nAetna, a leading health insurer, has initiated a lawsuit against major pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Novartis, and Teva Pharmaceuticals, accusing them of conspiring to manipulate the market for generic drugs. The lawsuit alleges that the drugmakers colluded to artificially inflate prices, disadvantaging insurers, federal programs, and consumers. This legal action highlights growing concerns over anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry, with potential implications for healthcare costs nationwide.\n\nDetails of the Lawsuit\n\nAccording to Aetna\u2019s complaint, filed in Connecticut on December 31, the alleged price-fixing conspiracy dates back to 2012. The company claims that executives from various pharmaceutical giants coordinated through clandestine meetings, phone calls, and even social gatherings to manipulate market share, set bid terms, and artificially maintain elevated drug prices.\n\nSpecifically, Aetna asserts that these companies engaged in the following practices:\n\nMarket Allocation: Drugmakers allegedly refused to bid for certain contracts or submitted excessively high bids, enabling competitors to dominate specific market segments.\n\nDrugmakers allegedly refused to bid for certain contracts or submitted excessively high bids, enabling competitors to dominate specific market segments. Coordinated Price Hikes: By controlling market dynamics, the companies collectively raised prices for certain generics. Some instances involved price increases exceeding 1,000%.\n\nBy controlling market dynamics, the companies collectively raised prices for certain generics. Some instances involved price increases exceeding 1,000%. Destruction of Evidence: Aetna contends that written evidence of the agreements was intentionally destroyed to evade detection.\n\nKey figures named in the lawsuit include former Teva executive Maureen Cavanaugh, who previously pled guilty to price-fixing charges in 2020. The complaint also ties this alleged conspiracy to broader investigations, including congressional probes and findings by the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nHistorical Context of Price-Fixing in the Pharmaceutical Industry\n\nPrice-fixing allegations are not new to the pharmaceutical world. Over the years, numerous cases have shed light on anticompetitive practices, with widespread effects on healthcare affordability.\n\nHere are a few notable examples of prior cases in the sector:\n\nTeva Pharmaceuticals and Others (2020): Teva faced accusations from a coalition of state attorneys general for orchestrating a scheme to inflate generic drug prices. The DOJ stated that over 300 drugs were impacted, with some experiencing extraordinary price increases.\n\nTeva faced accusations from a coalition of state attorneys general for orchestrating a scheme to inflate generic drug prices. The DOJ stated that over 300 drugs were impacted, with some experiencing extraordinary price increases. UnitedHealthcare Lawsuit (2019): UnitedHealthcare filed a lawsuit asserting that generic drugmakers colluded to inflate prices for a wide range of medications.\n\nUnitedHealthcare filed a lawsuit asserting that generic drugmakers colluded to inflate prices for a wide range of medications. Humana\u2019s Actions (2018): Humana alleged that pharmaceutical companies created a scheme to suppress competition and artificially raise medication prices.\n\nHumana alleged that pharmaceutical companies created a scheme to suppress competition and artificially raise medication prices. Multistate Settlements: Several drug manufacturers opted to settle with various states, with penalties amounting to tens of millions of dollars, rather than contest the allegations in court.\n\nThese cases underscore a troubling trend in the industry, particularly with generics that aim to reduce healthcare costs by offering more affordable alternatives to branded drugs.\n\nReactions and Statements\n\nThe latest lawsuit has drawn sharp criticism from state officials and consumer advocates, further intensifying scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong described the lawsuit as consistent with prior findings about industrywide antitrust violations. \u201cOur litigation is active and ongoing, and we are confident in our case heading toward our first trial in Connecticut,\u201d Tong stated.\n\nThe Connecticut trial, set to begin in 2026, aims to hold accountable the companies implicated in the alleged conspiracy. Aetna is seeking compensation for damages incurred after paying inflated generic drug prices.\n\nOn the corporate side, Pfizer, Novartis, and Teva have yet to issue public comments regarding the lawsuit. Historically, many pharmaceutical firms have denied wrongdoing in similar cases, even when opting to settle or pay penalties.\n\nKey details from the legal proceedings include documents alleging thousands of improper communications between executives at competing companies. Some situations even suggest that rivals shared customer bid documents to steer contracts and preserve a \u201cfair share\u201d of market profits\u2014a phrase that appeared in communications cited in the complaint.\n\nConclusion\n\nAetna\u2019s lawsuit against Pfizer, Novartis, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and other drugmakers signals another flashpoint in the larger debate over corporate ethics in the pharmaceutical industry. If Aetna\u2019s claims hold in court, the case could mark significant legal consequences and possibly force reforms to prevent future anticompetitive practices.\n\nHowever, with similar cases often drawn-out, this lawsuit serves as a reminder of the long road to accountability. Trials like the one planned in Connecticut for 2026 reveal how patient and taxpayer interests are intertwined with broader systemic challenges in controlling healthcare costs. Ultimately, the outcome could add to growing calls for increased regulation, transparency, and ethical responsibility in the pharmaceutical sector.",

            "content": "Treatment with OAV101 IT, a formulation of the gene therapy Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi) that\u2019s delivered directly into the spinal canal, safely led to motor improvements for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 who were at least 2 years old, top-line results from the Phase 3 STEER trial show.\n\nNovartis plans to share the data with regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this year toward making the treatment available to SMA patients. The data will also be presented this year at a medical meeting.\n\n\u201cThese positive top-line results from the STEER trial underscore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged 2 and above,\u201d Shreeram Aradhye, MD, president, development and chief medical officer at Novartis, said in a company press release. \u201cThe totality of evidence clearly supports a positive risk benefit profile of OAV101, which is expected to support registration [approval] covering a broad range of SMA patients.\u201d\n\nZolgensma is a gene therapy that\u2019s designed to deliver a functional version of the SMN1 gene, mutations in which are the cause of SMA. The treatment is packaged into a viral carrier that helps it be taken up by cells when given via a one-time infusion into the bloodstream (intravenous delivery). In the U.S., Zolgensma is approved for patients with any type of SMA up to age 2.\n\nOAV101 IT is an intrathecal formulation of Zolgensma that\u2019s designed to be injected directly into the fluid-filled spaces in the spine. This gives the treatment more direct access to the brain and spinal cord than an via intravenous infusion, requiring a lower dose to be effective. The treatment was tested in the open-label Phase 1/2 STRONG (NCT03381729) trial, which showed the gene therapy led to clinically meaningful improvements in motor function, as assessed by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), for children with SMA type 2 and type 3, ages 2-5.\n\nInitial misdiagnosis common for adults with SMA type 2, 3 in Korea Recommended Reading\n\nSTEER results\n\nThe Phase 3 STEER trial (NCT05089656) was designed to build upon those results. It enrolled more than 100 children with SMA type 2, ages 2-17, who were able to sit, but had never walked independently. None had been previously treated with disease-modifying therapies.\n\nThe participants were randomly assigned to receive OAV101 IT at a dose of 1.2 x 1014 vector genomes or a sham procedure to mimic the administration but without any active treatment. A year after treatment, patients given the sham procedure could receive OAV101 IT and those who\u2019d received the gene therapy were given the sham procedure, and monitored for three more months. The main goal was to evaluate changes in motor function, as assessed by total scores on the HFMSE, a year after treatment.\n\nPatients treated with intrathecal Zolgensma saw improved HFMSE scores a year after receiving the gene therapy compared with before treatment, meeting the main goal. Gains seen in the treatment group were greater than in the sham group.\n\n\u201cMaintaining motor function is a key goal for many older patients with SMA,\u201d said Crystal Proud, MD, a neurologist and principal investigator for the study at the Children\u2019s Hospital of the King\u2019s Daughters in Virginia. \u201cThis may allow them the capacity to continue to propel their electric wheelchair, feed themselves with intact hand-to-mouth function, and perform other activities of daily living as independently as possible. OAV101 IT administration has not only been demonstrated to maintain motor function, but also increased it in indicating the impact a one-time therapy could have.\u201d\n\nThe treatment\u2019s safety profile was also favorable, with similar rates of adverse events in the two arms, according to the company. The most common side effects were upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and vomiting.\n\nAnother open-label Phase 3b study called STRENGTH (NCT05386680) is designed to evaluate OAV101 IT in 27 SMA patients, ages 2-17, who had discontinued other SMA therapies, namely Spinraza (nusinersen) or Evrysdi (risdiplam). Its main outcome measure is safety, with other functional assessments as secondary trial goals.",

In patients treated with Cosentyx every four weeks, the rate of HiSCR was 46 percent, compared to 31 percent in the placebo group.\n\nIn addition, HiSCR achievement in the Cosentyx arm continued to improve through week 52 of treatment, indicating that continued treatment with Cosentyx is associated with even greater symptom improvement.\n\nIn addition, Cosentyx was shown to impact patients' quality of life positively. For example, pain is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, with more than 80 percent of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa reportedly experiencing periodic flares once a month.\n\nThis can negatively impact the course of the disease and patients' quality of life, which was also significantly reduced in the Cosentyx group compared to the placebo group.\n\nIn the SUNNY study, in week 16 of treatment, the achievement rate of NRS (numerical rating scale)30, a skin disease pain score, was 39 percent in the second week and 36 percent in the fourth week in the Cosentyx treatment arms, compared to 27 percent in the placebo arm. Additionally, by week 52, 79.6 percent of patients treated with Cosentyx every two weeks and 72.7 percent treated with Cosentyx every four weeks experienced no worsening disease.\n\n\u201cPatients with hidradenitis suppurativa are often accompanied by various complications, making it not just a skin disease but a significant impairment in their quality of life,\u201d said Dr. Lee Weon-ju, a professor of dermatology at Kyungpook National University Hospital and president of the Korean Acne and Rosacea Society (KARS). \u201cThis recommendation is very encouraging news for patients with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa, who have had very limited treatment options, as it allows the use of biologics as a first-line treatment and expands the options available to them.\u201d\n\nProfessor Lee continued, \u201cWe hope this will be quickly reflected in national guidelines and insurance reimbursement so that patients will have greater access to effective treatment options.\u201d",

            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMLX) (\u201cAmylyx\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the appointment of Dan Monahan as Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Monahan will also join the Company\u2019s Leadership Team. Mr. Monahan joined Amylyx in January 2024, bringing more than 20 years of commercial leadership experience in the biopharmaceutical industry overseeing sales, marketing, and market access for multiple product lines.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to announce the appointment of Dan Monahan to Chief Commercial Officer as Amylyx prepares for the first participant dosed in the Phase 3 LUCIDITY clinical trial of avexitide for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia planned in the first quarter of 2025. Dan has a strong track record of launching medicines and excels in building and leading high-performing teams that have brought new medicines to communities with high unmet needs,\u201d said Joshua Cohen and Justin Klee, Co-CEOs of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx earlier this year, Mr. Monahan has demonstrated invaluable leadership as we work towards ensuring launch readiness for the avexitide program ahead of Phase 3 data expected in 2026 and potential future launches. We are confident that the addition of Mr. Monahan to our leadership team will play a crucial role in delivering a meaningful impact to the PBH community as we continue to move forward in our goal for avexitide to be the first therapy approved for people living with PBH.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Monahan has remained deeply committed to launching therapies that address high unmet medical needs, bringing critical treatments to those who need them most. Prior to joining Amylyx, Mr. Monahan served as Vice President, Head of CNS Marketing and Portfolio Strategy at Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, where he led the U.S. commercialization efforts for the company\u2019s CNS franchise, including REXULTI\u00ae and ABILIFY MAINTENA\u00ae, which played a critical role in treating serious mental health conditions. Before joining Otsuka, Mr. Monahan held senior leadership roles at Novartis. He led the commercial execution of the company\u2019s flagship blockbuster dermatology brand, COSENTYX\u00ae, for patients with autoimmune conditions. Prior to Novartis, Mr. Monahan spent 14 years at Sanofi in positions of increasing leadership responsibility across sales, marketing and market access. He received an MBA from Seton Hall University, and is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Dan served as a Field Artillery Officer in the U.S. Army.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to collaborate with the team on advancing novel therapies from development through commercialization, with our first focus on avexitide for the potential treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dan Monahan, Chief Commercial Officer of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx, I have seen first-hand both the resilience of those with post-bariatric hypoglycemia and the significant quality of life impacts that this debilitating condition can have. I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to support people living with PBH and potentially addressing the critical unmet need for a treatment option.\u201d\n\nIn this role, Mr. Monahan will lead the Company\u2019s commercialization efforts, particularly as Amylyx prepares for the potential approval of avexitide, an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). Amylyx plans to initiate LUCIDITY, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAbout Avexitide\n\nAvexitide is an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist that has been evaluated in five clinical trials for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) and has also been studied in congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted avexitide Breakthrough Therapy Designation for both indications, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in congenital HI, and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (which includes PBH and congenital HI). Avexitide is designed to bind to the GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic islet beta cells and inhibit the effect of GLP-1 to mitigate hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin secretion and stabilizing blood glucose levels. In PBH, excessive GLP-1 can lead to the hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent debilitating hypoglycemic events. In two Phase 2 PBH trials, avexitide demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in hypoglycemic events. These events can lead to autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that can have a devastating impact on daily living.\n\nAbout the LUCIDITY Trial\n\nLUCIDITY (NCT06747468) is a 75-participant, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH. The Phase 3 trial will be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the U.S. Participants will be randomized 3:2 to receive either 90 mg of avexitide subcutaneously once daily or placebo. The trial will include a three-week run-in period and a 16-week double-blind treatment period. Participants who complete the double-blind period of the planned study will be eligible to enter an open-label extension (OLE) period with a duration of 32 weeks. The primary efficacy objective of LUCIDITY will evaluate the FDA-agreed upon primary outcome of reduction in the composite of Level 2 and Level 3 hypoglycemic events through Week 16. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.\n\nAbout Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)\n\nSymptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a condition that affects approximately 8% of people who have undergone bariatric surgery, or approximately 160,000 people, in the U.S. PBH is thought to be caused by an excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response leading to hypoglycemia and impaired quality of life. PBH can cause debilitating hypoglycemic events associated with inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, known as neuroglycopenia. Clinical manifestations can include impaired cognition, loss of consciousness, and seizures. PBH is also associated with a high degree of disability that can result in major disruptions to independent living. There are no approved therapies for PBH.\n\nAbout Amylyx Pharmaceuticals\n\nAmylyx is committed to the discovery and development of new treatment options for communities with high unmet needs, including people living with serious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions. Since its founding, Amylyx has been guided by science to address unanswered questions, keeping communities at the heart and center of all decisions.

            "content": "Bloomberg BusinessWeek recently highlighted the growing trend of CFOs transitioning into CEO roles. How has the role of the CFO evolved in recent years?\n\nThe role of the CFO has evolved significantly, expanding far beyond traditional responsibilities, according to Natalia Torbus, chief financial officer at Novartis Bulgaria. In an era defined by rapid change, growing challenges and highly competitive markets, the CFO must not only oversee the organization\u2019s financial framework but also serve as a strategic advisor. This shift has brought our role closer to that of the CEO. However, the transformation is ongoing, and in today\u2019s volatile, uncertain and unpredictable environment, it is essential that we continue to develop the skills and capabilities required to navigate through complexity.\n\nWhat are the key strategies a CFO should implement in a large healthcare organization?\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry faces numerous challenges, including rapidly evolving technologies, increasing regulatory constraints and growing pricing pressures. To position the company for success, CFOs must master the art of agile resource allocation, enabling organizations to swiftly adapt to unforeseen changes. At Novartis Bulgaria, we focus on building highly agile, cross-functional teams capable of responding quickly to market dynamics across diverse therapeutic areas. We prioritize brands with strong growth potential and ensure effective resource management to create value for the company, stakeholders and society.\n\nHow do you address the balance between driving financial growth and ensuring the delivery of life-saving treatments?\n\nI am confident that the right mix of strategies can successfully balance our business objectives with ethical considerations. The evolving role of the CFO requires the integration of creativity, empathy and a sense of vulnerability into our work. Despite ongoing pricing pressures, Novartis remains committed to implementing ethical pricing strategies. By focusing on sustainable long-term growth and a patient-centric approach, we ensure that our treatments are both profitable for the company and accessible to society. Our true business success is driven by our commitment to delivering life-saving innovations to patients and improving healthcare outcomes, rather than solely by financial results.\n\nHow do you envision the role of artificial intelligence in the pharmaceutical industry?\n\nIn today\u2019s business landscape, artificial intelligence tools have transitioned from being optional to essential resources. As CFO, it is crucial to adopt these technologies to optimize financial processes and free up resources for more strategic tasks. In 2024, Novartis introduced a new AI-driven solution that utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze large datasets, identify trends and forecast future financial outcomes with greater precision. By no longer being absorbed by time-consuming, traditional forecasting processes, we have developed robust long-term strategies. Leveraging advanced technologies, we shifted our focus from routine operational tasks to a deeper analysis of our capabilities, market opportunities and competitive positioning, ensuring that our plans are not only ambitious but also actionable.\n\nWhat can we expect from Novartis in the coming years?\n\nWe are committed to improving patient access to innovative therapies in key therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, cardiology, neurology, dermatology and immunology. Our pipeline features new molecules, targeted therapies, gene therapies and treatments for rare diseases, all of which have the potential to significantly elevate standards of care for patients in Bulgaria.",

We are returning from an extended respite and hope that you similarly had an opportunity to power down and refresh over the past week or so. Of course, all good things must come to an end, so time to confront the usual routines once again. We understand this may be difficult, but perhaps firing up the coffee kettle for a cup of stimulation can help. Nothing like a good habit, yes? Our choice today is strawberry creme, so please feel free to join us. Meanwhile, we have attempted to play catch up and assembled a few items for you to peruse as you ease back in. We hope you have a meaningful and manageable day. Best of luck, and do keep in touch. \u2026\n\nNovo Nordisk filed another citizen\u2019s petition with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking to block compounding pharmacies in the U.S. from making versions of one of its GLP-1 agonist drugs, Pharmaphorum notes. The latest attempt focuses on liraglutide, an older, once-daily injectable product sold as Victoza and Xultophy for diabetes and Saxenda for obesity. While Victoza sales are falling as patients switch to newer, once-weekly drugs like semaglutide-based Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 used for diabetes and obesity \u2014 the once-daily product still made more than $550 million in sales in the first nine months of 2024. In its petition, Novo Nordisk says that the Outsourcing Facilities Association, a trade group representing compounding pharmacies, has incorrectly nominated liraglutide on the list of bulk substances with a \u201cclinical need\u201d to compound \u2014 for example, if there is a shortage in the marketplace.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new report suggests that Paxlovid might help some long Covid patients, but which patients might benefit remains unclear, The New York Times writes. The report, published Monday in the journal Communications Medicine, describes the cases of 13 long Covid patients who took extended courses of the antiviral drug. Results were decidedly mixed: Nine patients reported some improvement, but only five said it lasted. Four reported no improvement at all. Perhaps more than anything, the report underscores that nearly five years after the pandemic began, there is still little known about what can help the millions of people with long Covid. While some people improve on their own or with various therapies and medications, no treatment has yet been shown to be widely successful.",

It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.\n\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevent abnormal blood cell proliferation. Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.\n\nAt the recent SEC meeting for Oncology held on 19th December 2024, the expert panel reviewed the Protocol Amendment Version 06 dated 29 Aug 2024 protocol no.

The company raised $16 million to accelerate the development of treatments targeting undruggable proteins associated with cancer, cardiometabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and longevity.\n\nThis oversubscribed seed round was led by Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner at Felicis, a firm renowned for backing biotech giants like Recursion, Ginkgo Bioworks, and BioAge. Other notable investors include Y Combinator, age1, Modi Ventures, Wilson Sonsini, as well as several angel investors including Jeff Dean (Head of Google AI), Uri Lopatin (Khosla, YC, Pardes), Ben Mann (Co-Author GPT-3, Co-Founder Anthropic), Alec Nielsen (CEO Asimov), Trevor Martin (CEO Mammoth), Juan Benet (Founder Filecoin), Nish Bhat (Co-Founder Color Health), Jim Dahl (Rock Creek Capital), and De Thompson V (Legends Capital).\n\nGeneral Proximity founder and CEO Armand B. Cognetta III, PhD, is a veteran of renowned chemical biologist Benjamin Cravatt\u2019s research group. And the founding team behind General Proximity includes an array of top scientists from institutions such as Scripps Research Institute, the Broad Institute of Harvard/MIT, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, UPenn, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and UCSF, with deep experience from top pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, Merck, GSK, Genentech, Roche, and Alnylam), as well as multiple veterans from the labs of induced proximity innovators Craig Crews and Amit Choudhary.\n\nGeneral Proximity also assembled a world-class Scientific & Strategic Advisory Board featuring key opinion leaders from top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies such as Martin Babler (Genentech, Principia, Alumis), Lawrence Hamann (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis, Celgene, Takeda, Interdict), and Andy Crew (Astellas, Arvinas, Siduma) alongside several academic experts in cancer biology and neurodegeneration.\n\nThe team is responsible for hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and patents. They have also been a driving force behind over 200 clinical programs and 36 FDA-approved medicines.\n\nThis team has also attracted significant interest from the pharmaceutical industry, securing a record five \u2018Golden Ticket\u2019 awards from major pharma pitch competitions (AbbVie, Servier, Astellas, Ono, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and winning a coveted spot in Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JLabs biotech incubator.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\u201cWe believe proximity medicines are the future of small-molecule drug discovery and have the potential to lower global disease burden more than any other current therapeutic modality. Biological proximity\u2014the nearness or interaction of two or more (macro)molecules\u2014is a master regulator of biology. By achieving precise control of proximity through our OmniTAC platform, we are able to modulate \u2018undruggable\u2019 targets more effectively than other approaches. Control of proximity equals control of biology.\u201d\n\nArmand B. Cognetta III, PhD, Founder and CEO of General Proximity\n\n\u201cIt was clear from our first meeting with Armand that General Proximity is going to be one of the technologies that propels us towards cures for cancer and many other diseases. We quickly became convinced that their cutting-edge proximity approach would enable them to solve some of the most ambitious and consequential challenges in drug discovery, paving the way for a bold new era of human healthspan and longevity extension.\u201d",

            "content": "Lawsuits concerning medicinal products are still a rarity at the Unified Patent Court. Alexion is in dispute with Amgen and Samsung Bioepis over Soliris, a drug for treating rare blood diseases. Amgen and Sanofi extended their epic battles over the cholesterol-lowering drugs Repatha and Praluent respectively. Sanofi has also challenged various generics manufacturers such as Accord over cancer drug cabazitaxel, while GSK sued Pfizer over a patent regarding an RSV vaccine.\n\nBut compared to the number of mobile communications and medical devices cases, pharmaceutical cases at the UPC are still few and far between. Now, however, the next major dispute is on the horizon. Accord filed a declaration of non-infringement with the Milan central division at the end of November. Andrea Postiglione will lead the case as presiding judge, assisted by Dutch judge Marije Knijff.\n\nThe secret sauce\n\nThe exact motions are not known to JUVE Patent. What is certain, however, is that Accord wants to establish that its product for the active ingredient nilotinib does not infringe Novartis patent EP 2 501 384. The patent protects a method of treating proliferative disorders and other pathological conditions mediated by BCR-ABL, C-KIT, DDR1, DDR2 or PDGF-R kinase activity. In simpler terms, it protects the administration of the active ingredient nilotonib together with apple sauce.\n\nNilotonib is an anti-cancer medication used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but Novartis is also currently researching its use in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company sells nilotonib under the brand name Tasigna. Nilotonib is mainly administered in the form of capsules. Novartis recommends taking the capsules on an empty stomach because taking it with food can lead to side effects. However, this poses problems for patients with difficulties swallowing. Administration with apple sauce therefore ought to alleviate this.\n\nThe basic patent for nilotonib has already expired, which makes the market entry of generic products likely. In August 2024, for example, Accord received approval for a generic hard-capsule preparation called Nilotinib Accord. However, Accord is not yet selling this.\n\nAccord has already carved out the new form of administration together with apple sauce from is labels. By means of its declaration of non-infringement lawsuit in Milan, Accord now apparently wants to establish that its generic product is not at risk from an infringement suit at the UPC or national courts in Europe. Originators usually file PI applications against new generic products.\n\nOpt-out, opt-in\n\nIn 2023, Novartis initially opted EP 384 out of the UPC\u2019s jurisdiction. In June 2024 the Swiss company then withdrew the opt-out. Generic drug manufacturers are likely to have understood this as a preparatory measure for attacks on generic nilotinib products. So far, however, JUVE Patent is not aware of any lawsuits filed by Novartis.\n\nPreviously, the patent\u2019s path to grant was eventful. In 2018, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office initially withdrew the grant of EP 384 due to a lack of inventive step. Various pharmaceutical companies and law firms had filed oppositions against the grant as straw men. However, Novartis, with the support of Hoffmann Eitle, appealed against the decision to the EPO Boards of Appeal. They then granted EP 384 in amended form in 2023.\n\nAccord and Novartis no newcomers\n\nBoth companies already have experience with UPC lawsuits. Novartis, for example, sued Celltrion at the local division D\u00fcsseldorf for infringing a patent for the asthma drug Xolair but failed to get a PI in September 2024. Accord is one of the generics companies sued by Sanofi regarding cancer drug cabazitaxel.\n\nNovartis is relying on Bristows partners Gregory Bacon and Brian Cordery for the dispute with Accord. Novartis is one of the UK law firm\u2019s most important clients. Bacon is a UK solicitor, but also has a licence in Belgium and therefore with the UPC.\n\nBristows backed the UPC early on, even after the UK pulled out of the UPC project. So far, however, the patent team has only represented Winnow Solutions in a suit concerning a technology for food waste monitoring at the local division The Hague. The Novartis case is therefore a success for the UK law firm \u2014 especially if active infringement claims extend the dispute.\n\nIn the dispute with Celltrion, Novartis is relying on lawyers from Freshfields and Carpmaels & Ransford. Both law firms are also regular advisors to the Swiss pharmaceutical giant.\n\nTaylor Wessing for Accord\n\nTaylor Wessing is currently one of the busiest law firms at the UPC. It is highly active for Abbott, for example, in medical devices proceedings against Dexcom. In the pharmaceuticals segment, the firm has so far only represented Zentiva in the dispute with Sanofi. Here, Accord relies on a team from Pinsent Masons.\n\nFor the lawsuit against Novartis at the Milan central division, however, Accord chose the Dutch Taylor Wessing partner Wim Maas. Alexander Rubusch from D\u00fcsseldorf, David Mulder and Iris van der Heijdt from the Amsterdam office and Charlotte Garnitsch from Eindhoven complete the team. According to JUVE Patent information, Accord has also retained Fabrizio Jacobacci from the law firm of the same name as local advisor in Milan.",

The Court of Appeals held that a plaintiff states a federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) violation where the plaintiff alleges with the requisite particularity that at least one purpose of the purported scheme was to induce fraudulent conduct.\n\nWhile the Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiff in this case did not sufficiently allege that at least one purpose of the alleged remuneration Novartis provided was to induce higher prescriptions, the court nonetheless vacated the district court ruling and remanded the plaintiff\u2019s other claims. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff adequately pleaded \u201ccertain categories of factual allegations that give rise to a strong inference\u201d of AKS violations, including that Novartis allegedly held sham speaker events with no legitimate attendees, excessively compensated physician-speakers for canceled events, and selected and retained speakers to incentivize the writing of prescriptions.\n\nOn remand, the district court is instructed to evaluate whether the plaintiff\u2019s allegations as to those categories state all the elements for an AKS violation and to assess the adequacy of the plaintiff\u2019s claims under state and municipal law.\n\nThe Second Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision is available here.\n\nClinics, Laboratory, and Owners Resolve AKS Allegations for $10 Million\n\nSouthern California Medical Center (SCMC), R & B Medical Group Inc. (doing business as Universal Diagnostic Laboratories (UDL)), and their owners, Mohammad Rasekhi and Sheila Busheri, have agreed to pay $10 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false claims to Medicare and Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program, for paying kickbacks and making self-referrals. The allegations were part of claims brought by former employees of SCMC and UDL under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act.\n\nIn particular, the government alleged that the defendants violated the AKS by paying kickbacks to (1) marketers to refer Medicare and Medi-Cal beneficiaries to SCMC clinics and (2) third-party clinics in the form of above-market rent payments, complimentary and discounted services to clinic staff, and write-offs of balances owed by patients and clinic staff in exchange for referring Medicare and Medi-Cal beneficiaries to UDL for laboratory tests. The government also alleged that the defendants violated the Stark Act\u2019s prohibition on self-referrals by referring Medicare and Medi-Cal beneficiaries from SCMC clinics to UDL for laboratory tests.\n\nThe relators reached a separate settlement with the defendants for $5 million to resolve additional allegations in their qui tam complaint. Neither the United States nor California intervened as to those allegations, and therefore were not party to this separate settlement.\n\nThe settlement with the United States and California is available here.\n\nTwo Men Charged in NFT Scheme\n\nOn December 20, 2024, two California men were charged with defrauding investors of more than $22 million in cryptocurrency through a scheme involving nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAccording to the indictment, for three years, Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo sponsored and promoted several NFT and other digital asset projects. In doing so, Hay and Mayo allegedly made or caused others to make materially false and misleading statements regarding the digital asset projects before those projects were launched and provided false and misleading plans for projects after their scheduled launch.\n\nHowever, the two men allegedly abandoned the projects after collecting millions in funds from investors, a type of fraud scheme called a \u201crug pull.\u201d In a \u201crug pull,\u201d the creator of an NFT or other digital asset project solicits funds from investors for the project, but abruptly abandons the project while fraudulently retaining investors\u2019 money. Hay and May allegedly used \u201crug pulls\u201d with multiple digital asset projects and concealed their involvement by falsely identifying others as the owners of those projects.\n\nHay and Mayo are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking.\n\nThe indictment is available here.\n\nDOJ Proposes New Regulations to FARA\n\nOn January 2, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to update and clarify regulations issued under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). FARA requires US persons who are acting as agents of foreign principals and engaged in certain specified activities to make periodic public disclosures of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts, and disbursements in support of those activities.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s proposed rule would make changes to certain exemptions: the commercial exemption, the exemption for persons whose activities do not serve predominantly a foreign interest, and the exemption for persons qualified to practice law. The proposed rule would also update FARA regulations regarding informational materials, including by factoring in that informational materials are now disseminated in many mediums (such as television, radio, and social media platforms).\n\nThe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is available here.",

However, the eligible patient population indicated for Zolgensma is restricted to paediatric patients less than two years of age with SMA with biallelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 gene. In the STEER study, OAV101 IT demonstrated clinical benefit in treatment-naive type II SMA patients aged 2-17 who were able to sit but had never walked independently. Patients who received OAV101 IT treatment showed an increase from baseline across the study population in total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded scores compared to the control arm who received a sham procedure.\n\nThe safety profile of OAV101 IT was favourable in the STEER trial, with overall adverse events and serious adverse events comparable in the investigational and control arms. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and vomiting. However, safety concerns have previously been raised with OAV101 IT. In 2019, the FDA implemented a partial clinical hold on OAV101 IT due to a preclinical study in which animal findings showed dorsal root ganglia (DRG) mononuclear cell inflammation, which was sometimes accompanied by neuronal cell body degeneration or loss. However, the clinical hold was lifted on the IT formulation in August 2021 based on nonclinical data from a toxicology study in nonhuman primates that addressed safety concerns relating to the risk of DRG injury following IT administration. Novartis plans to share STEER results with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, in 2025. If approved, OAV101 IT could broaden the patient population eligible for gene transfer therapy to include type II SMA patients under 18 years of age. However, key opinion leaders (KOLs) previously interviewed by leading data and analytics company GlobalData noted that the implementation of newborn screening (NBS) initiatives in their countries has greatly facilitated disease detection during the presymptomatic stage and has enabled many eligible patients to receive Zolgensma. As such, the availability of OAV101 IT would be most beneficial to patients where NBS for SMA is not yet adopted in their country or for patients who received a delayed diagnosis. KOLs added that OAV101 IT would be welcomed by patients due to its treatment convenience of a one-time infusion, compared to Biogen\u2019s once-quarterly IT administration of Spinraza and Roche\u2019s once-daily Evrysdi. According to GlobalData\u2019s report Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Opportunity Assessment and Forecast, the combined sales of IT and IV formulations of onasemnogene abeparvovec are projected to increase from $660.6m in 2023 to $763.8m by 2033 in the seven major markets (7MM: US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, and Japan) due to the growing awareness of SMA and the implementation of NBS across the markets, coupled with an increase in the eligible population for gene transfer therapy.",

            "content": "Novartis has shared positive top-line results from a late-stage study of its investigational gene therapy in patients aged two to less than 18 years with the rare neuromuscular disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nThe phase 3 STEER study has been evaluating intrathecal onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with SMA type 2 who were able to sit but had never walked independently.\n\nResults were compared against a sham control, which is designed to mimic the administration of an investigational drug without delivering any active treatment.\n\nThe trial met its primary endpoint, with OAV101 IT demonstrating an increase from baseline in total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE) scores, used to assess motor ability and disease progression, compared to sham control.\n\nThe safety profile of OAV101 IT was also shown to be favourable, and the overall adverse and serious adverse events were similar between arms, according to Novartis.\n\nAffecting an estimated one in 10,000 infants globally, SMA is caused by a lack of a functional SMN1 gene and results in the loss of motor neurons.\n\nThe disease affects muscle functions such as breathing, swallowing and basic movement and its severity varies across a spectrum of types. Type 2 occurs in approximately 30% of all SMA patients who, if left untreated, will never walk without support and will need a wheelchair or other mobility aids.\n\nOAV101 IT, which is administered as a one-time injection into the spine, uses a genetically engineered adeno-associated virus serotype 9 to deliver a working copy of the SMN1 gene into cells.\n\nShreeram Aradhye, president, development and chief medical officer, Novartis, said: \u201cMany patients with SMA currently rely on chronic treatments to manage their disease.\n\n\u201cThese positive top-line results from the STEER trial underscore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged two and above.\u201d\n\nThe results build on those from the phase 1/2 STRONG study, in which OAV101 IT was associated with a clinically meaningful increase in HFMSE scores in one year, as well as a clinically meaningful response in patients aged two to five years with SMA type 2 who were able to sit but had never walked independently.\n\nNovartis said it is planning to share results for OAV101 IT with regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, this year.",

            "content": "At the end of December, the Second Circuit joined several other circuit courts in holding that a plaintiff adequately pleads an Anti-Kickback Statute (\u201cAKS\u201d) violation when she states with the requisite particularity that at least one purpose of the alleged scheme was to induce fraudulent conduct, the \u201cat-least-one-purpose\u201d rule.\n\nIn United States ex rel. Camburn v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Relator Steven Camburn alleged that Novartis violated the AKS, and the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), in marketing its drug Gilenya, which is prescribed for multiple sclerosis (\u201cMS\u201d). Since approving Gilenya in 2010, the FDA has imposed a first-dose observation requirement for new patients, who must be monitored by a doctor while attached to an electrocardiogram machine for six hours.\n\nFirst-dose observation is burdensome for physicians, so Novartis sought to market Gilenya through a peer-to-peer speaker program during which physicians shared insights about Gilenya with other healthcare professionals. Camburn alleged that these programs were a pretextual scheme through which Novartis offered remuneration to physicians in exchange for prescribing Gilenya to patients.\n\nThe Second Circuit held, as a matter of first impression, that \u201cin relator-initiated actions, a defendant violates the AKS when at least one (rather than the primary or sole) purpose of the remuneration she provides is to induce purchase of a federally reimbursable healthcare product.\u201d The Court noted that this rule aligns with that of seven other circuit courts. In addition, the Court held that a plaintiff pleading an AKS violation as a predicate to an FCA claim need not state a quid pro quo exchange. As a result, Camburn needed only to allege that at least one purpose of the remuneration from Novartis was to induce prescriptions, without alleging a cause-and-effect relationship (a quid pro quo) between the payments and the physicians\u2019 prescribing habits.\n\nIn determining whether the pleadings were sufficient, the Court noted that the analysis is always a \u201ccontext-specific\u201d exercise. The Court determined that for three alleged categories, the Relator had pled factual claims with the requisite particularity to allow an inference that one of the purposes of Novartis\u2019s conduct was to induce physicians to prescribe Gilenya at a higher volume. These allegations involved: (1) speaker events with few or no legitimate attendees; (2) excessive compensation of speakers for canceled events; and (3) the selection of speakers to reward and influence high prescribers. The Court found that \u201c[t]ogether, these allegations give rise to a strong inference that one purpose of Novartis\u2019s conduct was to illicitly compensate physicians in order to induce them to write a higher volume of prescriptions for Gilenya.\u201d\n\nThe Court upheld the district court\u2019s dismissal of other factual allegations, because they did not have enough details to satisfy the at-least-one-purpose rule. The Court stressed, however, that \u201cour analysis is necessarily context-specific,\u201d so that a future AKS-based FCA action based on similar allegations could survive if greater particularity led to a \u201cstrong inference of fraud.\u201d\n\nThe Second Circuit\u2019s AKS decision is an important one, as it confirms that under the AKS: (1) a relator need only allege that one purpose of the remuneration is to induce the purchase of a healthcare product, and not the more demanding requirement of showing it to be the sole or primary purpose, and (2) a relator need not show a cause-and-effect relationship between the payment and the physician\u2019s prescription. However, whether a complaint survives a motion will be heavily dependent on the strength and particularity of the allegations, and the court\u2019s \u201ccontext-specific\u201d analysis of the specific facts alleged in each case.\n\n[View source.]",

            "content": "Mice\n\nB10.D2/nSnSlc and BALB/cCrSlc mice (7\u20139 weeks old) were purchased from Sankyo Laboratory Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The mice underwent bone marrow transplantation after a one-week acclimatization period. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement, the ARRIVE guidelines and the Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experimentation at Keio University. All animal and genetically modified mouse experimental protocols were approved by the Keio University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (# A2022-178). All animals were monitored daily to ensure their well-being. To avoid excessive distress and pain, a stop criterion was defined.\n\nWhole bone marrow transplantation\n\nTo create the sclerodermatous GVHD mouse model, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed using 7\u20139-week-old male B10.D2/nSnSlc and female BALB/cCrSlc mice as transplant donors and recipients, respectively, as previously reported, representing major histocompatibility complex-compatible, miHA-mismatched BMT22,54. As a non-GVHD control, syngeneic BMT was conducted by transplanting donor cells from male BALB/cCrSlc mice into female BALB/cCrSlc mice, which were irradiated with 7 Gy X-rays as a single dose using a Gammacell 137 Cs source (Hitachi Medico Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Donor cells (1 \u00d7 106 bone marrow cells/mouse and 2 \u00d7 106 spleen cells/mouse) were suspended separately in 100 \u03bcL of RPMI1640 medium, and then combined. Six hours after irradiation, the 200-\u03bcL suspension was injected into the recipient via the tail vein. Mice were randomized after BMT. Random numbers were generated using the standard = RAND() function in Microsoft Excel. The recipient animals were maintained in sterile cages and provided with autoclaved food and acidified water. Mice were monitored for characteristic signs of GVHD by clinical assessment using a standard scoring system, as described previously55. This system assessed seven systemic clinical traits: activity, posture, fur texture, weight loss, skin integrity, presence of diarrhea, and degree of alopecia. Each clinical parameter was awarded a score from 0 to 2, with a total available score of 0\u201314. This sclerodermatous GVHD model showed prominent ocular GVHD phenotypes including corneal epithelial damage and MGD 3\u20134 weeks after BMT30, so the GVHD and syngeneic control mice were used for experiments 28 days after BMT. Several samples were excluded due to human error during scoring. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend.\n\nTreatment of allogeneic BMT recipient mice with delgocitinib\n\nThe JAK inhibitor, delgocitinib (JTE-052), was synthesized by Japan Tobacco (JT) (Osaka, Japan). Delgocitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 with IC50 values of 2.8, 2.6, 13, and 58 nM, respectively19. JT provided 0.5% delgocitinib ointment and solvent vehicle ointments. To prepare 0.5% delgocitinib eye drops, delgocitinib was mixed with 0.9% sodium chloride solution and adjusted with hydrochloric acid to achieve a pH of 5.0\u20136.0. A 0.9% sodium chloride solution with pH of 5.0\u20136.0 was used as vehicle-eye drops. Regarding the dose of the delgocitinib used in our study, the chosen dose was based on the clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of delgocitinib ointment for atopic dermatitis56. Previous studies showed that donor cells engraft approximately 7\u201310 days after BMT57 and the inflammatory cell infiltration into the ocular surface tissues occurs from around 7 days after BMT in this model48. To assess the efficacy of topical administration of a pan-JAK inhibitor for ocular GVHD, allogeneic BMT recipients were treated with either 0.5% delgocitinib ointment or solvent vehicle ointment applied to the eyelids twice a day for 21 consecutive days, starting from 7 to 28 days after BMT (Fig. 1a). Syngeneic mice were used as the controls. Another group of allogeneic BMT recipients were treated with either 0.5% delgocitinib ointment or solvent vehicle ointment applied to the back skin twice a day for 21 consecutive days, starting from 7 to 28 days after BMT. In the experiment where ointment was applied to the eyelids, the control vehicle-treated GVHD group and the delgocitinib-treated GVHD group, and the syngeneic control group initially consisted of 8, 8, and 5 mice, respectively. One animal each from the control vehicle-treated group and the delgocitinib-treated group was excluded due to death. As a result, vehicle ointment-treated GVHD mice, delgocitinib ointment-treated GVHD mice, and syngeneic control mice numbered 7, 7, and 5 animals respectively for observation on day 28 post-BMT. In the experiment where ointment was applied to the back skin, the control vehicle-treated GVHD group and the delgocitinib-treated GVHD group, and the syngeneic control group initially consisted of 8, 8, and 5 mice, respectively. One animal each from the control vehicle-treated group and the delgocitinib-treated group was excluded due to death. As a result, vehicle ointment-treated GVHD mice, delgocitinib ointment-treated GVHD mice, and syngeneic control mice numbered 7, 7, and 5 animals respectively for observation on day 28 post-BMT.\n\nTo observe the effects of delgocitinib eye drops, allogeneic BMT recipients were treated with either 0.5% delgocitinib eye drops, or the solvent vehicle eye drops twice daily for 21 consecutive days, starting from 7 to 28 days after BMT. Vehicle eye drops-treated GVHD mice, delgocitinib eye drops-treated GVHD mice, and syngeneic control mice originally numbered 7, 7, and 5 animals respectively. All mice survived and did not meet the exclusion criteria, allowing analysis to be conducted on day 28 post-BMT.\n\nMG area analyzed using eyelid imaging and corneal epithelial damages assessed by CFS score at 28 days after BMT were set as primary endpoints. The inclusion criteria were not set in advance. Exclusion criteria were established from the perspective of animal welfare in advance. In cases where mice exhibited motor dysfunction, inability to maintain an upright posture, breathing difficulties, dehydration, prolonged reduction in food intake, muscle atrophy, rapid weight loss (more than 20% from the start of the experiment), self-injury, unconsciousness, or lack of response to external stimuli, they were to be euthanized. Mice were euthanized with intraperitoneal injection of Sodium Pentobarbital (Y0002194, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a dose of 250 mg/kg58. All experiments were performed twice, and the data are representative of the independent experiments. This study was exploratory in nature, aiming to investigate potential trends and generate hypotheses for future confirmatory research. As such, no formal sample size calculation was conducted prior to the experiment. However, the sample size was determined based on previous studies using this model mouse42,44.\n\nEyelid imaging\n\nAfter 28 days of BMT, the eyelids were collected from the right eye of each mouse. The MG area was analyzed using a topographical method, as previously reported30,31,59. After harvesting, photographs of the upper eyelid were taken immediately under a microscope (SZ61, Olympus, Japan) with white light. Several samples were excluded from the analysis because the eyelid area required for analysis could not be secured due to technical issues during sampling. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend. The percentage of the MG area was analyzed using ImageJ software. The central 3 mm eyelid area, including the eyelid margin and the furthest endpoint of the MGs, was measured (area A) using the freehand tool. The depletion area of the MG was semiautomatically selected and measured (area B) using the threshold tool. The percentage of MG Area was calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$ {\\text{MG}}\\;{\\text{Area\\% = (area}}\\;{\\text{A - B)/area}}\\;{\\text{A}}. $$\n\nHistological analysis\n\nThe mice were euthanized 28 days after BMT. The eyeballs with eyelids were harvested and fixed with 10% neutralized buffered formalin for 12 h at room temperature, embedded in paraffin wax, and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Mallory staining21,60. To quantify the fibrotic areas in the eyelids in the tissue sections, images were acquired at 400 \u00d7 magnification, and three images of the Mallory-stained sections were examined. Samples in which sufficient tissue area for analysis could not be secured due to technical limitations were excluded from the final analysis. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend. These images were analyzed using Color Deconvolution, a plugin for ImageJ (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD, USA), in which the colors of each image were separated into blue, green, and red. The blue area was measured using the same threshold. The average value obtained from the three images of each sample was considered the value of the fibrotic area42.\n\nImmunofluorescence\n\nImmunofluorescence were performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections as described previously31. Following deparaffinization and dehydration, the target antigens were unmasked using the microwave method at 100\u2103 for 10 min. This process was applied to antibodies against STAT1, phospho Ser727, (dilution of 1:500, A7221, Assay Biotechnology Inc, San Francisco, CA), STAT3, phospho Ser727 (dilution of 1:500, A7223, Assay Biotechnology Inc), STAT5A, phospho Ser780 (dilution of 1:500, A7226, Assay Biotechnology Inc), Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled CD4 (dilution of 1:100, 100510, RM4-5, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), and Allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled CD45 (dilution of 1:200, 103112, 30-F11, Biolegend), or through autoclave techniques at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min for antibodies, fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1) (dilution of 1:500, 072274, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (dilution of 1:100, ab7817, 1A4, Abcam). Sections were double-stained for pSTAT1 and CD45, pSTAT3 and CD45, pSTAT5A and CD45, pSTAT3 and CD4, pSTAT5A and CD5, and \u03b1-SMA and FSP-1. Antigens were processed in a target retrieval solution (S169984; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Subsequently, the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (012-000-120; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with appropriately diluted primary antibodies. This was followed by 45-min incubation at room temperature with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) and secondary antibodies, including (1) Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (dilution of 1:200, A11011, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for pSTAT1, pSTAT3, pSTAT5A, and FSP-1; and (2) Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (dilution of 1:200, A11029, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for \u03b1-SMA. Isotype-matched antibodies used as negative controls included (1) rabbit IgG antibody (dilution of 1:500, 2729, Cell Signaling Technology) for pSTAT1, pSTAT3, pSTAT5A, and FSP-1; and (2) mouse IgG2a, \u03ba antibody (dilution of 1:100, ab18415, abcam) for \u03b1-SMA; and (3) APC-labeled Rat IgG2b,\u03ba antibody (dilution of 1:200, RTK4530, Biolegend) for CD45; (4) and FITC-labeled Rat IgG2a, \u03ba antibody (dilution of 1:100, RM4-5, Biolegend) for CD4 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Subsequently, we captured 1\u20133 images of each eyelid margin, MG, and eyelid skin area from each stained section, using THUNDER Imager 3D Cell Culture (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Samples in which sufficient tissue area for analysis could not be secured due to technical limitations were excluded from the final analysis. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend. The positive areas and cells in each field were then quantified manually.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections as described previously31. Following deparaffinization and dehydration, the target antigens were unmasked using the microwave method at 100\u2103 for 10 min. To demonstrate activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the skin and eyelids of GVHD mice, we performed immunobiological analysis. Sections treated with pSTAT1, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5A antibodies were incubated with Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled antibodies, followed by diaminobenzidine development and H&E staining using the Dako Real Envision Detection system (K5007, Agilent Technologies, CA)61. Subsequently, we captured 1\u20133 images of each eyelid margin, MG, and eyelid skin area from each stained section, using a digital slide scanner (Nanozoomer S60, Hamamatsu, Japan). Samples in which sufficient tissue area for analysis could not be secured due to technical limitations were excluded from the final analysis. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend. The positive areas and cells in each field were then quantified automatically using ImageJ.\n\nCorneal whole-mount staining\n\nWhole-mount corneal staining was performed. Eyeballs were fixed in a solution consisting of 1% formaldehyde (133-10311, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), 2mM MgCl2 (95812-85, Nakarai, Kyoto, Japan), 5mM Ethylene Glycol Bis (2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (37346-05, Nakarai), and 0.02% Nonidet p40 (NP 40) (25223-04, Nakarai) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4\u2103 for 75 min. After washing by 0.02% NP40 in PBS at 23\u2103 for 15 min, eyeballs were fixed in 80% methanol diluted with Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (13407-45, Nakarai) at -20\u2103 for 2 h. After fixation, the cornea was removed from the eyeballs using forceps and scissors. Corneas were permeabilized by incubation in 25% Triton X-100 (35501-02, Nakarai) diluted with methanol for 15 min, 50% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and 75% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing with PBS three times at 23\u2103 for 30 min, corneas were incubated in the blocking solution consisting of 10% normal goat serum (50062Z, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 23\u2103 for two hours. Corneas were incubated in APC-labeled CD45 (103112, 30-F11, Biolegend) and PE-labeled F4/80 (157303, QA17A29, BioLegend) antibodies diluted in PBS (1:200) at 4\u2103 for 12 h. After washing five time with by 0.02% tween 20 in PBS at 23\u2103 five times for an hour, corneas were incubated in DAPI (62247, Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted with PBS for 5 min. After washing three times with PBS at 23\u2103, corneas were mounted using Fluorescence Mounting Medium (S302380-2, Agilent Technologies) on slide glass (MAS-01, Matsunami, Osaka, Japan). Samples in which the appropriate tissue morphology was not preserved due to technical errors during corneal sampling were excluded from the final analysis. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend. The positive areas in each field were then quantified automatically using ImageJ.\n\nRNA isolation and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from mice eyelids using a miRNeasy mini kit (217004, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and converted to complementary DNA using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (FSQ-101, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Real-time qPCR was performed using the StepOnePlus system (4379216, Thermo Fisher Scientific)60. The primers used for qPCR, including, Mm00434256_m1 for Il2, Mm01168134_m1 for Ifng, Mm00434228_m1 for Il1b, Mm00446190_m1 for Il6 were purchased from Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific. All data were analyzed using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method62, with GAPDH as the internal standard to measure the mRNA expression measurement. Samples that could not be properly analyzed due to technical errors during sampling or RNA extraction were excluded from the analysis. The final number of samples analyzed is indicated in the figure legend.\n\nCorneal fluorescein staining\n\nAfter 4 weeks (28 days) post-BMT, the recipient mice were evaluated for corneal epithelitis. One microliter of 0.5% fluorescein sodium solution (Fluorescite, 877290; Novartis Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) was instilled into the temporal conjunctival sac without anesthesia. The ocular surface was observed under cobalt blue light using a Smart Eye Camera (13B2 \u00d7 10198030101; OUI Inc., Tokyo, Japan)42,63. The CFS score was used to assess corneal epithelial damage and was calculated using a 4-point scale: 0, absent; 1, slightly punctate staining with < 30 spots; 2, punctate staining with > 30 spots but does not diffuse; 3, severe diffuse staining but no positive plaques; and 4, positive fluorescein plaques64. The scores for the three segments including upper, middle, and lower parts of the cornea were summed to produce a final grade (0 to 12 points). The average of the total score for the left and right eyes was used as the CFS score for that individual.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTo avoid bias, each final image analysis (systemic GVHD scoring, CFS scoring, and cell count in immunohistochemical images) was performed in a blinded manner by two independent, experienced observers. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality, and the Bartlett\u2019s test was employed to verify the homogeneity of variance. One-way analysis of variance with the Tukey\u2013Kramer post-hoc test was used for statistical analyses. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.",

Sometimes, that research results in breakthroughs that can enhance diagnostics, treatment, or the understanding of disease mechanisms.\n\n\u201cWe welcome NIEHS employees seeking guidance on issues relating to copyrights, patents, and intellectual property to contact us, so we can have a confidential discussion on how to proceed,\u201d said Soucek. (Photo courtesy of Steve McCaw / NIEHS)\n\nThe Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) acts as the contact point within NIEHS for all new inventions made by intramural researchers and protects the institute\u2019s intellectual property interests. It enables NIEHS researchers to more effectively partner with their counterparts in academia, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector to deliver innovations that will benefit human health.\n\nLearn more about NIEHS researchers\u2019 tech advances in 2024 and other key activities by OTT below.\n\nLung disease and allergies\n\nMichael Fessler, M.D., Clinical Director of NIEHS, received a patent February 6, 2024, for his technology targeting a specific protein called EMP2 on the lining of airways. It is currently the focus of a collaboration with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research Inc. to develop antibodies to treat lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis.\n\nGeoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., director of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Research Core Facility, has altered the major peanut allergen, called Ara h 2, to stop its binding to patient antibodies. This technology is being used to develop improved treatments for peanut allergies by inducing a more sustained response and fewer side effects than current therapies. In addition, the technology forms the basis of a diagnostic that can track patient response to a peanut allergen.\n\nNicholson helps negotiate a variety of agreements that allow potential partners to leverage the institute\u2019s unique and wide-ranging resources, and helps with efforts to protect and commercialize inventions. (Photo courtesy of Steve McCaw / NIEHS)\n\nData sharing and acquisition\n\nAccording to Sharon Soucek, Ph.D. ,director of OTT, the office has been busy over the last year sharing data with a variety of collaborators for projects related to the Personalized Environment and Genes Study (PEGS) and the Virtual Pooled Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS).\n\nPEGS is a long-term project to collect health, exposure, medical, and genetic data from a diverse group of more than 19,000 people in North Carolina. It integrates genetic and environmental data to understand causes, identify risk factors, and improve prevention of disease. Providing access to PEGS data through data use agreements to a variety of collaborators expands the scientific reach of this dataset, while protecting patient privacy.\n\nRegarding the data being received through the VPR-CLS, \u201cThe transfer agreements we\u2019ve executed ensure researchers can obtain data from cancer registries of several states and analyze data from patients enrolled in the Sister Study and the GuLF Study,\u201d said Cindo Nicholson, Ph.D., OTT\u2019s technology transfer and patent specialist.\n\nEpidemiology Branch Chief Dale Sandler, Ph.D., leads both the Sister Study and the GuLF Study \u2014 the former involving sisters of women who have had breast cancer, and the latter involving people participating in oil spill response and cleanup.\n\nHands-on education\n\nOTT is joining forces with RTI International and the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) to pilot the FLC/RTI Entrepreneurial Education and Technology Exchange Collaborative (FREETEC), according to Soucek. FREETEC provides an incubator for student researchers to conduct critical proof-of-concept experiments to advance federal lab technologies toward commercialization.\n\nThe pilot study will use technology developed by Stavros Garantziotis, M.D., head of the Matrix Biology Group in the Immunity, Inflammation, and Disease Laboratory. This technology involves a new class of compounds that can block hyaluronan, a naturally occurring molecule that plays a role in the onset of airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD. NIEHS researchers plan to collaborate with RTI, due to its expertise performing translational science, and North Carolina Central University students to develop a research project that enhances the commercial potential of the invention.\n\n\u201cWe are also excited to have rolled out a pilot program to train NIEHS fellows in technology transfer, where they conduct market research and analysis for invention disclosures,\u201d Soucek explained.",

            "content": "Without the anti-inflammatory medication for his rheumatoid arthritis, John Crider, a 67-year-old retiree who lives north of Denver, suffers from intense pain that can hinder his ability to walk or do other daily activities.\n\n\n\nWhen he was still covered by private insurance through his employer, he could afford the $10-a-month cost for his prescription. But when he retired and switched to Medicare, he learned his out-of-pocket cost would be $585 per month.\n\n\n\nIt was \u201ca rude awakening,\u201d says Crider, who worked in the health care field.\n\n\n\nThe drug Crider needs is called Enbrel, and it\u2019s the first medication that Colorado\u2019s Prescription Drug Affordability Board has deemed \u201cunaffordable\u201d for consumers. The board\u2014created by the General Assembly in 2021\u2014has the power to set upper payment limits for certain pricey drugs.\n\n\n\nOther states have set up similar boards, but Colorado\u2019s is the first in the country to label a drug unaffordable. The board found that 3,406 Coloradans used the drug in 2022, at an average annual out-of-pocket cost of $2,295, according to its report.\n\n\n\nThe board\u2019s staff is now in the midst of a lengthy process to calculate a maximum price that may be paid or billed for Enbrel, also known as etanercept. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several other conditions.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the drug\u2019s maker, Amgen Inc., has sued to stop the board\u2019s actions. The case is now pending in a Denver federal court.\n\n\n\nThe board\u2019s actions\u2014and the drugmaker\u2019s lawsuit\u2014put Colorado at the \u201cforefront\u201d in the battle to address high drug costs, says Jon Bartholomew, a government affairs director in AARP\u2019s national office. The outcome will help inform how other state policymakers address high drug costs, he adds.\n\n\n\nHigh costs, tough choices\n\n\n\nMore than 540,000 Coloradans\u2014nearly 10 percent\u2014reported not filling a prescription because of costs in 2021, according to a survey by the Colorado Health Institute, a nonprofit research and consulting group. Of those, 40 percent said their condition worsened.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, policymakers are considering a range of strategies to keep their constituents from having to choose between paying for their medications or food, gas and housing. Drug affordability review boards have been deployed as a tool in several states.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Colorado, legislators in Maryland, Minnesota and Washington have created boards with the authority to determine upper payment limits for expensive medications. Nine other states have boards that cannot set payment limits but can make recommendations on policies to lower costs, AARP research shows.\n\n\n\nIn October, Maryland\u2019s board received approval to conduct cost reviews of six drugs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese states are ... putting in a lot of effort to really do a lot of due diligence and understand the market and take these steps, but it\u2019s still early days in terms of actual implementation,\u201d says Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan organization working with states to develop innovative health policies.\n\n\n\nColorado\u2019s drug board determined in February of 2024 that Enbrel was unaffordable after reviewing everything from the drug\u2019s effectiveness to the out-of-pocket costs for Coloradans. Last summer, the board ruled that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Stelara and Novartis AG\u2019s Cosentyx\u2014also anti-inflammatory drugs\u2014were unaffordable as well.\n\n\n\nAmgen\u2019s suit over Enbrel, filed in March of 2024, argues the board's regulatory powers conflict with federal patent laws and violate several clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Colorado attorney general\u2019s office is seeking to dismiss the suit.\n\n\n\nAmgen did not respond to the Bulletin\u2019s request for comment. But in a legal brief, the company said the board's \u201cdecision-making is effectively a black box\u201d and the criteria it uses to label a drug unaffordable are \u201cextraordinarily broad and vague.\u201d\n\n\n\nKaren Moldovan, AARP Colorado\u2019s advocacy director, says the board has \u201can incredibly rigorous process\u201d in which they look at every facet of the medication, from supply chain to manufacturing issues to the consumer perspective.\n\n\n\nCrider, the Denver-area retiree, is among those who have had to ration medication. Instead of taking Enbrel once a week\u2014as prescribed\u2014he stretched out the dosing, first to two weeks, then three, then six. The price for that strategy? Two episodes of severe discomfort.\n\n\n\nStarting in 2025, he and other Medicare beneficiaries will get some relief in the form of Medicare\u2019s new out-of-pocket maximum of $2,000 a year for prescription drugs. That\u2019s still \u201cnot cheap,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s something I can afford.\u201d \u25a0\n\n\n\nCynthia Pasquale is a freelance writer and former editor at The Denver Post. She has written for the Bulletin since 2011.\n\n\n\nAlso of interest:\n\n",

Credit: Novartis AG.\n\nNovartis has reported positive topline outcomes from the Phase III STEER trial of an investigational gene therapy, intrathecal onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) in treating individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 2.\n\nThe randomised, sham-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of the gene therapy in treatment-na\u00efve individuals aged two to less than 18 years who can sit but have never walked independently.\n\nIt randomised over 100 subjects to receive either gene therapy by intrathecal injection or a sham procedure.\n\nThe study\u2019s primary endpoint was met, indicating an increase in total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE) scores from baseline. This finding indicated \u2018improved\u2019 motor function in subjects treated with gene therapy compared to sham controls.\n\nFurthermore, the gene therapy\u2019s safety profile was reported as \u2018favourable\u2019, with the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events being similar between the treatment and control arms.\n\nNovartis Development president and chief medical officer Shreeram Aradhye said: \u201cMany patients with SMA currently rely on chronic treatments to manage their disease. These positive topline results from the STEER trial underscore the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged two and above.\n\n\u201cThe totality of evidence clearly supports a positive risk benefit profile of OAV101 which is expected to support registration covering a broad range of SMA patients. We remain committed to leading innovation in SMA treatment through our one-time gene therapies, uniquely designed to replace the function of the missing or defective SMN1 gene.\u201d\n\nAssessing the therapy\u2019s efficacy and safety using the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) scale were the secondary objectives of the trial.\n\nThe company is preparing to present these findings to regulatory bodies in 2025, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aiming to make the therapy available for SMA patients.\n\nIn August this year, the company reported that its Phase III V-MONO trial of Leqvio for treating individuals at low or moderate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), met its primary endpoints.\n\nEditorial content is independently produced and follows the highest standards of journalistic integrity.

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novartis (NVS)\n\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of varied drugs that has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. It continues to build depth in core therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, renal and metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology in geographies like the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Novartis\u2019 efforts to strengthen its wide portfolio by developing breakthrough treatments have made it even more formidable in this space. Cosentyx, Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto, Scemblix, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio should fuel growth through 2030 and beyond.\n\nNVS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. NVS has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 10.9% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $7.65 per share. NVS boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.2%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, NVS should be on investors' short list.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard.

            "content": "Novartis has reported positive phase 3 results with intrathecal dosing of its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene therapy Zolgensma, which could extend the range of children eligible for the drug.\n\nAt the moment, Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is administered intravenously, which means it is only an option for younger children under a certain weight. The new intrathecal formulation \u2013 codenamed OAV101 IT \u2013 is administered by an injection given directly into the cerebrospinal fluid through the lower back and has been shown to be effective in older children.\n\nNovartis has revealed top-line results from the phase 3 STEER study, which involved treatment-na\u00efve patients with SMA type 2 aged from two to 17 who can sit, but who have never walked independently.\n\nThe trial met its primary objective, showing an increase from baseline in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) total score \u2013 which measures motor function skills \u2013 compared to a sham injection.\n\nZolgensma replaces the mutated SMN1 gene responsible for causing SMA, which in severe manifestations prevents infants from standing and sitting and can eventually rob them of the ability to breathe, making it a fatal condition if untreated.\n\nNow, Novartis hopes to be able to share the data with regulatory authorities in 2025, including the US FDA, in the hope of making OAV101 IT available to treat a wider range of SMA patients. At the moment, Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of patients less than two years of age only.\n\nOAV101 IT has had a chequered path through development, as it was placed on a temporary clinical hold by the FDA in 2021 after inflammation was seen in the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves that was sometimes accompanied by neurodegeneration, although, that was relaxed a few months later after data from a toxicity study in non-human primates restored confidence in the safety of the therapy.\n\nZolgensma is already a major success for the gene therapy category, with sales reaching $1.2 billion in 2023 while some other therapies have struggled to make it commercially. There have been signs of flattening sales growth, as use of the gene therapy has shifted to newly-diagnosed infants and the pool of already diagnosed patients has started to dry up.\n\nAnalysts have previously suggested that, if OAV101 IT gets approved, a new group of patients will come into the frame, allowing peak sales of the franchise to rise above the $2 billion threshold.\n\nNovartis' chief medical officer, Shreeram Aradhye, said that the new data supports the approval of the drug in patients aged two and above, many of whom rely on chronic treatments to manage their disease. That includes blockbuster therapies like Biogen's Spinraza (nusinersen) and Roche's Evrysdi (risdiplam).\n\n\"These positive topline results from the STEER trial underscore the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of OAV101 IT,\" added Aradhye.",

            "content": "Biden Judge Rules that Drug Company Improperly Promoted Drug Used to Treat MS, Partly Reversing Lower Court\n\nJudge Myrna Perez, nominated by President Biden to the Second Circuit court of appeals, partly reversed a lower court and allowed a complaint contending a drug company had improperly and fraudulently marketed a drug used to treat MS to go forward. The December 2024 unanimous decision by Perez was in US ex rel Camburn v Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, .\n\nWhat happened in this case?\n\nSteven Camburn worked for Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp. in sales for its drug Gilenya, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). Camburn filed a False Claims Act lawsuit against Novartis, contending that Novartis had violated a federal anti-kickback law (AKL) by fraudulently promoting and offering remuneration to physicians for prescribing and helping promote Gilenya. Shortly after Camburn filed the complaint against it, Novartis fired Camburn.\n\nAfter discovery and the filing of an amended complaint, the district court dismissed Camburn\u2019s complaint, maintaining that it did not allege the AKL scheme \u201cwith sufficient particularity.\u201d Camburn appealed to the Second Circuit.\n\nHow did Judge Perez and the Second Circuit rule and why is it important?\n\nJudge Perez wrote a unanimous opinion that reversed the court below and ruled that several aspects of the complaint against Novartis were sufficiently specific to go forward. Judge Perez ruled, for the first time in the Second Circuit, that a plaintiff has adequately pleaded an AKS violation \u201cwhen she states with sufficient particularity that at least one purpose of the alleged scheme was to induce fraudulent conduct.\u201d\n\nBased on this principle, Judge Perez found that three categories of alleged Novartis activity met the legal standard. These included (1) speaker programs \u2018with no legitimate attendees,\u201d apparently intended to pay off speakers who frequently prescribed the drug; (2) \u201ccompensation of speakers for cancelled events;\u201d and (3) the \u201cselection and retention of certain speakers deliberately\u201d in order to \u201cinduce a higher volume\u201d of prescription of the drug. Judge Perez accordingly sent the case back to the lower court so it can consider on the merits these three claims against Novartis.\n\nJudge Perez\u2019s opinion was obviously important to Steven Camburn and to others who may have been improperly victimized by Novartis\u2019 improper promotion of its MS drug. The decision may also be significant in other cases concerning improper promotion and marketing of drugs, particularly in the Second Circuit, which includes New York, Connecticut and Vermont. In addition, it serves as a reminder of the importance of confirming fair-minded judges to our federal courts.",

As the firm noted in a press release, the trial successfully met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a clinically meaningful increase from baseline in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale \u2013 Expanded (HFMSE) scores among participants treated with OAV101 IT compared to sham controls.\n\nKey highlights from the STEER trial\n\nThe trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in motor function in terms of HFMSE measures. This achievement in the primary endpoint is noteworthy given the trial\u2019s focus on treatment-na\u00efve patients aged 2 to <18 years with Type 2 SMA who could sit but had never walked independently.\n\nIn addition, the treatment led to an improvement in motor functions for some patients.

It stems from a mutation or deletion in the SMN1 gene and affects patients across a spectrum of severity. Historically, treatment has tended to focus on treating infants early to prevent irreversible motor neuron loss. Consequently, there has been a significant unmet need for older SMA patients.\n\nGene therapy with OAV101 IT delivers a functional copy of the SMN1 gene via an AAV9 vector directly into the central nervous system. This approach aims to restore SMN protein expression in older patients who may already have some degree of motor impairment or established disease progression.\n\nNext steps for Novartis\n\nNovartis plans to share the full STEER results with global regulatory authorities in 2025, including FDA. Novartis plans on sharing full data and additional analyses at a major medical conference next year.\n\nIf approved, OAV101 IT would be the first one-time, intrathecal gene therapy for older children and adolescents living with SMA.\n\nMore information on the Phase 3 NCT04971226 and Phase 2 NCT05384587 are available from clinicaltrials.gov.",

            "content": "Novartis (NVS, Financial) has announced that its new experimental drug has shown improvements in motor function for children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) during an advanced study. This pivotal study assessed the efficacy and safety of investigational intrathecal onasemnogene abeparvovec (OAV101 IT) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 2, aged two to less than 18 years who are able to sit but have never walked independently. This new therapy shares the active ingredient with Novartis's gene therapy, Zolgensma, which could help the company expand its offerings in the lucrative rare disease treatment market.\n\nSMA is a rare genetic neuromuscular disease and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality, resulting from a deficiency or malfunction of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The SMN1 gene primarily generates this protein, while the SMN2 gene contributes a smaller portion. Dysfunction in SMN1 can severely impact motor functions and vital organs.\n\nZolgensma, approved by the FDA in 2019, uses an AAV9 viral vector to deliver the SMN gene, designed for long-term expression after a single treatment. However, it is priced at $2.1 million in the U.S.",
