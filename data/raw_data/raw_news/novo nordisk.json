Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:\n\nhttps://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137374&wire=4\n\nNVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at [email protected] or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their \"REDEFINE 1\" trial, \"a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.\" The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo's targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo's stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.\n\nWHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

            "content": "A class action lawsuit was filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) by Levi & Korsinsky on January 24, 2025. The plaintiffs (shareholders) alleged that they bought NVO stock at artificially inflated prices between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024 (Class Period) and are now seeking compensation for their financial losses. Investors who bought Novo Nordisk stock during that period can click here to learn about joining the lawsuit.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S is a Denmark-based multinational pharmaceutical company, with two focus areas of specialization, including diabetes and obesity, and rare diseases.\n\nThe company\u2019s claims about the efficacy and potential weight loss outcomes expected during the REDEFINE-1 study of CagriSema are at the heart of the current complaint. CagriSema is an obesity and weight loss drug candidate, comprising a combination of amylin analogue cagrilintide and GLP-1 analogue semaglutide. CagriSema is designed for once-weekly subcutaneous treatment.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Misleading Claims\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Novo Nordisk and two of its senior executives (Individual Defendants) repeatedly made false and misleading public statements throughout the Class Period. Particularly, they are accused of omitting truthful information about the dosing method used in the REDEFINE-1 study, and ancillary issues, from SEC filings and related material.\n\nFor instance, during the Class Period, the company showed great enthusiasm about the commencement of the first 68-week trial for CagriSema, named REDEFINE-1. The trial was designed to study the efficacy and safety of once-weekly CagriSema, with dosage of 2.4 milligram semaglutide and 2.4 milligram cagrilintide, compared to placebo.\n\nFurthermore, during an earnings call dated November 3, 2022, the company stated that it expected the REDEFINE-1 trial to result in a 25%+ weight loss in the patients.\n\nMoreover, in a June 2023 call, one of the defendants stated that the company was considering testing 7.2 milligrams of semaglutide in a potential Phase III trial, since they believed it would result in more weight loss at the higher dose.\n\nHowever, subsequent events (discussed below) revealed that the defendants wilfully misled investors about the efficacy and weight loss potential of CagriSema, since the trial did not follow the claimed dosage escalation during the 68-week trial period.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Arguments\n\nThe plaintiffs maintain that the defendants deceived investors by lying and withholding critical information about the business practices during the Class Period. Importantly, the defendants are accused of misleading investors about the result from the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nThe information became clear on December 20, 2024, when Novo Nordisk announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, in which CagriSema had achieved weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The company attributed the poor results to the \u201cpreviously undisclosed \u2018flexible\u2019 nature of the protocol,\u201d which led to less than 60% of patients completing the dose escalation period. This simply meant that the patients undergoing the trial did not increase the dosage to the pre-defined \u201c2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once weekly,\u201d resulting in diminished results. Following the news, NVO stock fell by 17.8% the same day.\n\nTo conclude, the defendants allegedly misled investors about the efficacy and potential weight loss from the once-weekly subcutaneous administration of CagriSema during the REDEFINE-1 trial. In the past year, NVO stock has lost 38.8%.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Enjoy, and see you soon. \u2026\n\nEli Lilly launched its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drug Mounjaro in India on Thursday, beating rival Novo Nordisk for a much-awaited entry into the world\u2019s most populous country grappling with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, Reuters reports. Mounjaro, a once-weekly injection approved by India\u2019s drug regulator, is priced at $50.67 for a 5-milligram vial and $40.54 for a 2.5-milligram vial, its lowest doses. A patient in India may have to spend about $200 a month when taking a weekly dose of 5 milligrams, subject to a doctor\u2019s prescription. Mounjaro carries a list price of $1,086.37 for each monthly fill in the U.S., but the amount patients pay largely depends on their insurance plan. Lilly, however, said that pricing in different geographies cannot be compared given significant variation in health care systems, economies, and reimbursement policies in each country.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe move by President Trump to fire two Democrats on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission leaves a question mark over the future of an agency antitrust action alleging pharmacy benefit managers used illegal rebate programs that spiked the price of insulin, Bloomberg Law explains. Last September, the agency sued CVS Caremark, OptumRx, and Express Scripts in its administrative court. The case gained bipartisan support in Washington, with key Republican lawmakers publicly backing it. Commissioners have ultimate authority over decisions in the FTC in-house court. But at the time of their dismissal on March 18, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were the only commissioners overseeing the proceedings because the GOP members had recused themselves. The case, which the PBMs are fighting to block, shines a spotlight on the downstream consequences of Trump\u2019s attempt to fire Bedoya and Slaughter, who have each called the move illegal and vowed to challenge it in court.",

The proposal targets compounding pharmacies that create these alternatives, which are not FDA-approved but often marketed as lower-cost options. Telehealth companies and compounding pharmacies have expressed opposition to the proposed restrictions, signaling potential challenges ahead for regulatory enforcement.\n\nCompounded medications are typically tailored for individual patients who cannot use commercially available drugs due to allergies or other medical reasons. However, the FDA has raised concerns about the growing trend of mass-producing compounded versions of weight loss drugs in response to high demand. These copycat products have gained traction among consumers seeking more affordable options amid shortages and rising costs of brand-name treatments. Telehealth platforms have also played a role in expanding access to these alternatives by connecting patients with prescribing providers and compounding pharmacies. The agency\u2019s move reflects broader efforts to ensure drug safety and efficacy while addressing concerns over unregulated production practices.\n\nDate: March, 2025\n\nNewsflash | Powered by GeneOnline AI",

            "content": "Since the start of the artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) boom, the healthcare sector has been lagging the S&P 500, with investors parking their funds primarily in mega-cap tech and growth stocks. Healthcare has been one of the S&P 500\u2019s worst-performing sectors over the past two years. It grew just 2.5% in 2024 compared with the benchmark index\u2019s 23.3% jump.\n\nWhile the healthcare sector's weighting in the S&P 500 has declined to a 25-year low of about 10%, total U.S. healthcare spending has more than tripled in roughly the same period, from $1.4 trillion in 2000 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. The segment has witnessed major technological upheavals that should have a long-standing impact. Growth in key areas like telehealth, surgery, data analytics and biotechnology have aided in a big way.\n\nThe current year started with visible underperformance in the sector, channeled by skepticism over the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health Secretary. However, while RFK Jr. has long been a vaccine skeptic and some of his past comments have criticized groundbreaking drug developments, during the confirmation hearing, he distanced himself from the anti-vaccine movement and voiced support for HIV treatment and prevention drugs. As a result, healthcare as a sector has picked up, with some semblance of confidence returning. In fact, the S&P 500 Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) has grown 6.9% year to date as of March 20, after the bloodbath witnessed in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nAn aging population has also helped the sector grow. Moreover, these stocks are considered defensive, meaning they tend to remain stable regardless of the prevalent market conditions. Regular demand for healthcare services is not dependent on the peaks and troughs of a market that has risen and fallen over the past two years over the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nThe healthcare sector is poised for significant long-term changes, including the integration of AI in medical research. The sector also seems lucrative for investors looking for a steady cash flow, as pharmaceutical companies are known to offer regular dividends. While it is not having a great time currently, with the measures in place and the new technology delivering them, the time may be ripe to invest in the sector.\n\nHence, astute investors should bet on healthcare mutual funds at present. Mutual funds, in general, reduce transaction costs and diversify portfolios without an array of commission charges that are mostly associated with stock purchases (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).\n\nOur Picks\n\nWe have thus selected three such healthcare mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), have positive three-year and five-year annualized returns, minimum initial investments within $5000, and carry a low expense ratio.\n\nT.

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "As China embarks on its three-year \"weight management\" campaign, Novo Nordisk has stepped forward with its powerful tools to combat obesity. The company's commitment aligns with the national initiative to address the growing issue of weight-related health problems, which have become a significant concern in the country.Camilla Sylvest, Executive Vice President of Commercial Strategy and Corporate Affairs at Novo Nordisk, said in an interview with huanqiu.com that obesity is a very serious chronic disease that is also a multi-factorial disease. \"Obesity is then leading to a lot of other series of diseases, like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic diseases, with unfortunately an increased probability. So, this is not just for China, but for the whole world too. And today there is more than 1 billion people in the world living with obesity,\" she said.\n\nCamilla Sylvest, Executive Vice President of Commercial Strategy and Corporate Affairs at Novo Nordisk\n\nFrom a medical perspective, obesity is a complex chronic disease influenced by biological, genetic, social, psychological, and environmental factors. It affects overall health in a multifaceted manner and is associated with over 200 comorbidities. In the field of weight loss medications, Novo Nordisk has emerged as a leading global representative of GLP-1 RA (glucagon-like peptide-1). Semaglutide, its flagship product, has been approved for obesity treatment for nearly four years. In 2024, semaglutide (Wegovy\u00ae) for long-term weight management, was approved and commercially launched in China, and received positive market feedback, according to the company.\n\nWegovy (semaglutide) injection for long-term weight management\n\nNovo Nordisk's SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial demonstrated that semaglutide 2.4 mg could reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% in adults who are overweight or have obesity. \"We currently offer three products containing semaglutide, targeting both type 2 diabetes treatment and long-term weight management. These products have not only enriched Novo Nordisk's portfolio in China but also provide patients with more treatment options,\" Camilla said.Chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, etc. require long-term management and treatment. Effective management can improve patients' quality of life and significantly reduce healthcare costs. Novo Nordisk views cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), as interrelated cardiometabolic conditions that often coexist in patients.The SELECT trial, covering approximately 17,500 patients globally, showed that semaglutide has the potential to reduce the risks of major adverse cardiovascular events in individuals who are overweight or have obesity who had previously experienced one or more cardiovascular events. The FLOW trial demonstrated that semaglutide could significantly reduce the risk of death by 24% in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease. \"These findings indicate that Novo Nordisk's products can reduce the incidence of these costly and life-threatening conditions, improve patients' quality of life, and alleviate the societal healthcare burden,\" Camilla said.According to Camilla, to address the challenge of chronic disease management, Novo Nordisk emphasizes the importance of raising public awareness of obesity and other chronic diseases. It also partners with Chinese government agencies and universities to conduct educational programs on diabetes and obesity, leveraging local expertise.In 2019, Novo Nordisk launched its \"China Essentials\" program, integrating China into its global synchronized R&D system. This initiative aims to achieve simultaneous development of innovative drugs between China and the world, ensuring that Chinese patients can benefit from latest treatments simultaneously with the rest of the world.In 2024, Novo Nordisk achieved historic breakthroughs in China. The company's insulin icodec injection was approved by NMPA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults, realizing the synchronized clinical trials and approvals both domestically and internationally.Novo Nordisk continues to introduce more innovative products in China. By the end of 2024, Novo Nordisk brought 22 innovative treatments and 11 injection devices to China.According to Camilla, Novo Nordisk has a full value chain presence in China with nearly 7,000 employees. The company established the first research and development center of a pharmaceutical in China. Site Tianjin, one of Novo Nordisk's strategic global production sites, has achieved local production supply. As of December 2024, the company's \"Clinical Research Strategic Cooperation Center\" expanded to over 40 departments across more than 10 medical institutions.\n\nNovo Nordisk Production Site Tianjin, one of Novo Nordisk\u2019s strategic global production sites\n\nKezhou Zhang, Corporate Vice President of Clinical Operation and Development, Regulatory affairs and Medical Affairs at Novo Nordisk Region China, noted, \"Over the past five years, the 'China Essentials' program has made significant progress. We are actively preparing or conducting multiple clinical trials in new therapeutic areas such as obesity, hemophilia, growth disorders, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, MASH, and Alzheimer's disease.\"\"As a purpose-driven company, our mission is to drive change to address global health challenges and accelerate our multi-disease footprint. Looking ahead, we will continue to fulfill our long-term commitment to patients through driving innovation and forging new partnerships to continue to the building of a Healthy China,\" said Christine Zhou, Senior Vice President and President of Novo Nordisk Region China.",

Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services and second following the release of Phase III results of its Cagri-Sema obesity drug. Regarding RFK\u2019s nomination, we are going to wait until he is confirmed and sets an agenda before we leap to the conclusion that he is going to somehow eliminate one of the most popular and important drug classes (GLP-1s) in the country. We\u2019d also point out that a well-known car company executive who seems to have President Trump\u2019s ear as well is a GLP-1 success story in weight loss. Regarding Cargri-Sema, we think the 20% decline in Novo shares following the release of its Phase III results was more than a bit harsh. Currently, there are two GLP-1 products approved for obesity- Novo\u2019s Wegovy (Semaglutide) and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (Tirzepatide). There are many drugs from numerous companies in development. Novo\u2019s next product in the space will be Cagri-Sema, which is a combo treatment featuring Cagrilintide and Semaglutide. In mid-December, Novo released results of its Phase III trials for Cagri Sema which showed an average weight loss of 22.7% across a test group whose average weight at the start of the trial was 235 pounds. This was short of the 25% target that management had implicitly endorsed in conversations with analysts which explains the disappointment with what on the surface looked like pretty solid results. It is worth pointing out that these results are in-line with Zepbound, which typically delivers average weight loss of 20% and better than Wegovy, which typically delivers average losses in the 15% range. Obesity is going to be the biggest drug class in history and we have not even reached the point where enough supply is available to even allow Lilly to advertise in the US. This market has a long way to grow and will certainly comfortably support more than one winner. Further, we think it is a little presumptive for investors to permanently jettison Novo to a distant #2 in the market with questionable long-term relevance in a single morning of trading on the heels of results that would have likely been favorably received but for the 25% target that had become the expectation.: Shares of Novo-Nordisk were under consistent pressure during the fourth quarter, first following the nomination of Robert F.

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \u201cflexible\u201d nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \u201c2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\u201d the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo\u2019s revelation. The price of Novo\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo\u2019s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Novo Nordisk offers these smart, connected insulin pens. Dexcom plans to bring this integration to more markets in the future, too.\n\nAccording to Dexcom, integrating CGM data with the insulin pen data in one app offers a comprehensive, actionable view of glucose and insulin patterns. This adds to other insulin delivery integrations around the world, as Insulet expanded the availability of its Omnipod 5. The Omnipod 5 integrates with multiple CGMs, including Dexcom\u2019s G6 and G7.\n\nDexcom also plans to share new data for its 15-day G7 CGM at ATTD, highlighting its accuracy. The company said the 15-day CGM delivered a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 8%. It says this improves upon the existing 10-day G7\u2019s accuracy and will be the company\u2019s most accurate CGM offering.\n\nThe company submitted its 15-day G7 CGM to the FDA in October 2024.

            "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Novo Nordisk (NVO).\n\nNovo Nordisk currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.76, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.76 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 64.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVO\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Novo Nordisk here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Novo Nordisk, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVO Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Novo Nordisk, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.4% over the past month to $3.93.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Novo Nordisk. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Novo Nordisk may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

The company reported that after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of CagriSema patients remained on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% for semaglutide 2.4 mg.

The company was one of the rare enterprises seeing an increase in price on what was generally a down day for the market; it closed 1% higher, against the 1.1% decline of the bellwether S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.07%).\n\nThumbs up from one pundit\n\nThat gravity-defying boost was due in no small part to an analyst's note distributed before market open. UBS's Jo Walton reiterated the Swiss bank's buy recommendation on Novo Nordisk stock at a price target of 750 Danish kroner ($110) per share.\n\nIt wasn't immediately apparent why the analyst published the update. Although it's been something of an up-and-down stock so far this year, Novo Nordisk remains the pacesetter in the market for GLP-1 drugs, of which Wegovy -- indicated specifically for weight loss -- is the product most identified with the category.\n\nWegovy was also the first of (so far) the two obesity medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), followed by Eli Lilly's Zepbound. In this market, first-mover advantage is powerful, however, and Wegovy is still the drug most readily associated with pharmaceutical-assisted weight loss.\n\nHere comes the competition\n\nThe big question hanging over Novo Nordisk stock is how long that advantage will last. With the runaway success of this still relatively new drug category, other pharmaceutical companies and biotechs are eager to get in on the action.

This had value and was given to individuals for their benefit to run private clinics, which was bribing health professionals with an inducement to prescribe.\n\n\"Over the past two years, Novo Nordisk has responded positively and actively to the requirements laid down by the ABPI Board, and I am pleased to welcome them back into full engagement as ABPI members,\" said Richard Torbett, CEO of the ABPI, on Monday.\n\nIn March, Novo Nordisk introduced NovoCare Pharmacy, a direct-to-patient delivery service to improve access to Wegovy (semaglutide) for cash-paying patients.\n\nThe program offers all dosage strengths of the weight-loss medication at a reduced price of $499 per month for uninsured individuals or those whose insurance does not cover obesity treatments.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nPhoto by KK Stock via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Patients who were placed on the placebo lost 3.1%, according to the data.\n\nThe trial included 1,206 people with obesity or who were overweight and had type 2 diabetes. They had a mean baseline body weight of about 224 pounds.\n\nShares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant fell more than 9% after the company released the results.\n\nWall Street had been eyeing the results of the trial to see how the drug compared to the company's other drugs, Ozempic, which is approved by the FDA for diabetes, and Wegovy, which is approved for chronic weight management.\n\nEli Lilly's Zepbound Reduces Type 2 Diabetes Risk, Study Shows\n\nRead On The Fox Business App\n\nIn December, the company saw its market value drop by as much as $125 billion following the results of a separate trial, Redefine 1, of CagriSema in overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes.\n\nHeadquarters of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Sept. 26, 2023.\n\nIn the latest trial that spanned 68 weeks, 61.9% of patients were given the highest dose of the drug, which combines the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, and a cagrilintide, a synthetic version of the hormone amylin, which is released by the pancreas.\n\nOzempic, Wegovy Among Drugs Subject To Medicare Price Controls\n\nCagrilintide is currently being developed in combination with semaglutide to see if it helps overweight and obese people achieve sustained weight loss.\n\nNovo said it will detail results from both trials that will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025, and expects to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nWegovy is an injectable prescription weight-loss medicine that has helped people with obesity.\n\n\"The Redefine 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes,\" said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been ramping up their offerings and creating direct-to-consumer platforms for patients without insurance to boost demand as competition in the highly lucrative market stiffens.\n\nNovo\u2019s revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations in its latest fiscal quarter, but it forecast slower sales growth in 2025, partly due to increasing competition.\n\nLast week, Novo cut the cost of its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy in half for U.S. patients paying cash through its direct-to-patient online pharmacy to try and boost sales.\n\nThe company's announcement came just after Lilly announced it is expanding the supply and cutting the costs of its weight-loss drug Zepbound, again, effectively broadening access to more patients without insurance with its own self-pay pharmacy.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: Novo Nordisk shares fall on weight-loss drug trial",

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/NVO.\n\nCase Details\n\nThe Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk's projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk's phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \"REDEFINE-1,\" while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk's repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the \"flexible protocol\" limited the study's ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.

The ABPI code was updated in 2023 with specific guidance on social media postings.\n\nAt the time, the once-daily injectable Saxenda was the only drug in the GLP-1 class available for obesity treatment, although it has since been joined by others, including Novo Nordisk's once-weekly follow-up Wegovy (semaglutide).\n\n\"The UK rightly has some of the highest standards in the world for how pharmaceutical companies can behave and operate \u2013 embodied by the ABPI Code of Practice,\" commented ABPI chief executive Richard Torbett.\n\n\"In 2021, Novo Nordisk fell short of these standards, and it is right that their peers held them accountable,\" he added. \"Over the past two years, Novo Nordisk has responded positively and actively to the requirements laid down by the ABPI Board, and I am pleased to welcome them back into full engagement as ABPI members.\"\n\nThe suspension of Novo Nordisk \u2013 the first since Astellas UK had its membership removed in 2016 \u2013 was unusual in that the company had to submit a quarterly update to the ABPI board to gauge the progress being made in its remediation plan.\n\n\"Throughout the audit process we have considerably strengthened our compliance processes and we firmly believe that we now have the right foundations and governance in place to be fully and effectively self-regulating,\" said Sebnem Avsar Tuna, general manager of Novo Nordisk UK.\n\nThe company's return to ABPI membership comes despite another breach of the code was recorded by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) last year over failure to disclose 'transfers of value' of approximately \u00a37.8 million (around $10 million) \u2013 payments to more than 150 different health professionals (HCPs) and healthcare organisations (HCOs), over a three-year period between 2020 and 2022.",

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novo Nordisk (NVO)\n\nBagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company and a prominent player in the diabetes market with a full portfolio of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, modern insulins and human insulins. The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity.\n\nNVO is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 20.57; value investors should take notice.\n\nThree analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $3.90 per share. NVO also boasts an average earnings surprise of 2%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, NVO should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO)?\n\nBefore you invest in Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm\u2019s site: bgandg.com/NVO.\n\nCase Details\n\nThe Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk\u2019s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1,\u201d while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk\u2019s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the \u201cflexible protocol\u201d limited the study\u2019s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm\u2019s site: bgandg.com/NVO. or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660. If you suffered a loss in Novo Nordisk you have until March 25, 2025, to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff.\n\nThere is No Cost to You\n\nWe represent investors in class actions on a contingency fee basis. That means we will ask the court to reimburse us for out-of-pocket expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees, usually a percentage of the total recovery, only if we are successful.\n\nWhy Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman\n\nBronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is a nationally recognized firm that represents investors in securities fraud class actions and shareholder derivative suits. Our firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors nationwide.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, X, Facebook, or Instagram.\n\nAttorney advertising.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Novo Nordisk falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Novo Nordisk is expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share, indicating a change of +12.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.9%. This estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.77 indicates a change of +22.5% from what Novo Nordisk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Novo Nordisk is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Novo Nordisk, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +18.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.89 billion and $57.86 billion estimates indicate +18.5% and +16% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNovo Nordisk reported revenues of $12.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.9%. EPS of $0.91 for the same period compares with $0.71 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +9.64%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Novo Nordisk surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNovo Nordisk is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Novo Nordisk. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\n\nThis top pick is among the most innovative financial firms. With a fast-growing customer base (already 50+ million) and a diverse set of cutting edge solutions, this stock is poised for big gains. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "M edical research increasingly recognises obesity as more than just a cosmetic issue. Many governments, including India, now classify it as a diseasea metabolic abnormality marked by excess fat. Obesity is linked to 229 health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, infertility and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, combating obesity isn\u2019t just about willpower. According to Vikrant Shrotriya of Novo Nordisk India, who spoke on obesity treatments at the India Today Conclave, genetic and metabolic factors predispose individuals to consume more calories than needed. While food availability may have increased, human bodies remain wired to store fat for survival.\n\nWith the rise of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, which Novo Nordisk markets as a medication for type 2 diabetes, many see them as a \u2018magic pill\u2019 for obesity. But Shrotriya busts this myth: \u201cThis is not a magic pill. This is not an excuse that I can party and take an injection [later]. This is a medicine for those who can\u2019t change their weight despite diet and exercise.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut effective weight loss requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond medication. Shrotriya refers to it as \u201cABCAttitude, Behaviour and Choices\u201d. The benefits are substantial. According to Shrotriya, even a 5 per cent reduction improves glycemic control and lowers blood pressure. At 10 per cent, the risk of type 2 diabetes and fatty liver decreases, and with 10-15 per cent loss, some may experience diabetes remission. A combination of medication, mindful eating, regular exercise and medical guidance can, thus, significantly enhance the quality of life.\n\nTHE SCIENCE AND SECRETS OF ANTI-AGEING\n\nA healthy fight against wrinkles\n\n(Photo: Bandeep Singh)\n\nadvertisement\n\nEven before you get into a physical activity, you need to understand how your body behaves and evaluate yourself.

            "content": "NEW YORK, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

And if not, is one coming?\n\nWith all the market turmoil, they also discuss what investors should do right now. What stocks should investors buy?\n\nJohn is the editor of Zacks Large-Cap Trader portfolio so he had some suggestions about what he was looking at in the large caps. Tracey is the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio so she mentions some value stocks.\n\n5 Stocks After the Sell-Off: Should They Be On Your Short List?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nTesla is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks. They have all corrected in the sell-off, which means they are down at least 10%. But Tesla is down even more, falling 38.6% year-to-date.\n\nTesla's earnings are expected to rise 23.5% in 2025 and another 25.9% in 2026. Tesla has gotten more attractive on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis since the shares have sold off. It is now trading at 77x. That is not cheap, however. A P/E under 15 is considered a value.\n\nShould Tesla be on your short list after the sell-off?\n\n2. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA is also one of the Magnificent 7 stocks. Over the last 5 years, shares of NVIDIA are up 2040%. But year-to-date, shares have fallen 13.8%.\n\nNVIDIA saw record revenue in fiscal 2025 of $130.5 billion, up 114% year-over-year. NVIDIA's earnings are expected to jump 46.8% in fiscal 2026 and another 24.3% in fiscal 2027.\n\nAfter the stock sell-off, it now has a forward P/E of just 24.8. This is historically low for NVIDIA.\n\nShould NVIDIA be on your short list at this valuation?\n\n3. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM\n\nJPMorgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the United States. Over the last year, shares are up 20%. But year-to-date, JPMorgan Chase shares have fallen 4.9%.\n\nEarnings of JPMorgan Chase are expected to fall 8.1% in 2025. It now trades with a forward P/E of 12.6. JPMorgan Chase also pays a dividend, which yields 2.2%.\n\nShould a big bank like JPMorgan Chase be on your short list?\n\n4. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM\n\nExxon Mobil is a large, integrated American energy company. Oil stocks have been weak over the last year as oil prices have tumbled. Exxon Mobil shares are up in the last year, but just 0.8%. In 2025, with all the market turmoil, Exxon Mobil is still up 1.5%.\n\nHowever, earnings are expected to fall 4.9% in 2025. Exxon Mobil has a forward P/E of 14.7. A P/E under 15 usually indicates a stock is a value. Exxon Mobil also pays a dividend, yielding 3.6%.\n\nShould energy stocks like Exxon Mobil be on your short list?\n\n5. Novo Nordisk A/S NOV\n\nNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company headquartered in Denmark. It specializes in diabetes and weight loss. Shares of Novo Nordisk soared on increased sales of the weight loss drugs, gaining 180% in the last 5 years. But year-to-date, shares have fallen 12.8%.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 17% in 2025 and another 21.3% in 2026. Novo Nordisk now trades with a forward P/E of 20.3. Novo Nordisk also pays a dividend, yielding 0.9%.\n\nShould a big healthcare company like Novo Nordisk be on your short list?\n\nWhat Other Stocks Do Tracey and John Talk About After the Sell-Off?\n\nTune into this week's podcast to find out.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "Kepler Cheuvreux's David Evans just flipped his stance on Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), upgrading the stock to buy after years of skepticism. The move comes as Novo's stock has taken a beating, dropping nearly 50% from its peak last year, weighed down by disappointing CagriSema trial results and broader valuation concerns. But Evans now sees the selloff as overdone. With competition and pricing fears already baked into the stock, he's calling this finally the entry point, setting a 12-month price target of DKK 630implying a potential 24% upside. Investors took notice, sending shares up nearly 3% at 11.17am today\n\nNovo isn't just waiting for the market to turnit's making moves. The company launched NovoCare Pharmacy to expand access to its blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy, offering FDA-approved versions at lower prices. The ripple effect? Smaller players like Hims & Hers saw their stock take a hit as Novo tightens its grip on the weight-loss drug market. Meanwhile, the FDA's resolution of the Wegovy shortage gives Novo another tailwind, with analysts expecting supply to ramp up and further fuel demand. Even with some investor hesitation around the REDEFINE 2 trial's flexible dosing concerns, the fundamentals are looking strong.\n\nAnalysts are split on what happens next. Bernstein is holding steady with a Market Perform rating, pointing to supply-chain risks, while TD Cowen remains bullish, citing better drug availability and aggressive marketing as growth drivers. But Evans is clearhe believes the market has swung too far in the wrong direction, turning Novo into an opportunity. After years of caution, he's now backing the stock, signaling a major shift in sentiment for one of the biggest players in the obesity drug race.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Professor Julia Vorholt\u2019s work has changed how we think about plant health. Her innovative research on plant microbiomes holds the potential to transform agriculture. For her achievements, the microbiologist is receiving the Novonesis Biotechnology Prize.\n\nPlants are not alone. Just as humans rely on gut bacteria for digestion and immunity, plants also have communities of beneficial microbes living on and inside them. These allies, invisible to our eyes, help plants to fight pathogens, withstand environmental stress and grow more vigorously.\n\nBut how do these microbial communities work? And can we harness their power to make agriculture more sustainable? These questions have driven Professor Julia Vorholt\u2019s groundbreaking research work, which has now earned her the 2025 Novonesis Biotechnology Prize, awarded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\n\u201cReceiving this prize is a tremendous honour,\u201d says Vorholt, who is Professor of Microbiology at ETH Zurich. \u201cThe recognition is overwhelming, and it highlights the importance of understanding microbial communities and their role in plant health,\u201d she adds.\n\nDeciphering the hidden world of plant microbiomes\n\nHistorically, plant microbiology research focused on microbes that make plants sick. But Julia Vorholt took a different perspective. Rather than concentrating on plant diseases, she looked at the microbes that naturally inhabit leaves, known as the phyllosphere. Her research revealed that these tiny organisms do not exist randomly but rather form structured, functional communities as ecosystems in their own right.\n\nSome of these microbes protect against disease, and others assist plants in nutrient uptake or help them to survive harsh conditions. In turn, plant-associated microbes benefit from their host by gaining access to fixed carbon and multiplying steadily, colonising new leaves as the plant grows.\n\n\u201cThese microbial communities follow assembly rules,\u201d Vorholt states. \u201cBy understanding how they establish themselves and how the microbes interact in a community, we may find natural and sustainable ways to improve plant health.\u201d\n\nVorholt\u2019s approach began with isolating and identifying individual bacteria (altogether several hundred different species from leaves), eventually enabling her and her team to construct defined microbial communities that colonise plants under controlled conditions in the laboratory. By studying them in isolation and in a multitude of combinations, the team uncovered interactions that promote plant resilience and growth.\n\n\u201cWhen I started studying plant microbiomes more than 20 years ago, most research focused on pathogens, which harm plants, or mutualists, such as rhizobial bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, which help plants to absorb nutrients,\u201d Vorholt explains. \u201cI wanted to explore the many other microbes living on plants that were thought to be neutral or unimportant.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the idea that complex microbial communities as a whole could influence plant health was not widely accepted. But as research on the human microbiome grew, scientists began seeing similarities with plants, and interest in the field took off.\n\nFrom understanding to application\n\nJulia Vorholt\u2019s research has the potential to revolutionise agriculture. By studying how tiny microbes interact with plants, scientists can develop biosolutions \u2013 natural ways to help crops resist pathogens more effectively or to grow better while reducing the need for chemical pesticides and fertilisers.\n\nProfessor Detlef Weigel, Chair of the Novonesis Biotechnology Prize Committee, explains: \u201cHer work has changed how we think about plant health. The myriad microbes on plants are not just passengers \u2013 they can actively protect crops from disease and help them to thrive. By figuring out how these tiny organisms work together, Professor Vorholt is paving the way for farming methods that rely less on chemicals and more on nature, making agriculture both more sustainable and more productive.\u201d\n\nMads Krogsgaard Thomsen, CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, adds: \u201cJulia Vorholt\u2019s discoveries are groundbreaking. She has shown that microbes play a fundamental role in the survival of plants. Her ability to distil complex science down to its mechanistic basis could lead to transformative agricultural innovations that will help crops to grow healthier and withstand climate challenges while reducing environmental impact.\u201d\n\nSummarising her vision, Vorholt states: \u201cIf we can predict how complex plant microbiomes come together and function, we can develop strategies that naturally enhance crop resilience and productivity.\u201d\n\nUnlocking the power of the microbiome\n\nJulia Vorholt\u2019s research has already shown promise in making a model plant more resistant to disease, and this knowledge can now be exploited in designing natural treatments that support crop health and productivity.\n\n\u201cInitially, many experts dismissed the idea that commensal microbes had any real impact on plant health,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut our research and that of others has since shown that plants are highly attuned to these microbes. They recognise even harmless bacteria and modulate their immune responses accordingly, tuning their microbiomes in ways that affect overall health.\u201d\n\nHer team has also discovered that plants use specific molecular components to maintain a balanced microbiome \u2013 paralleling how disruptions in immunity can lead to dysbiosis in the human microbiome.\n\n\u201cDespite the obvious differences between plants and humans, we see striking similarities in how the respective hosts manage their microbial communities,\u201d Vorholt adds.\n\nMuch more to discover\n\nJulia Vorholt\u2019s research has helped to shift how scientists think about plant health, positioning microbiomes as fundamental components of plant well-being.\n\n\u201cWe are only beginning to unlock the full potential of microbes in agriculture,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is to advance fundamental understanding of how microbial communities are built and to help us translate that knowledge into strategies that preserve beneficial microbes. By investigating these microbial communities and their interactions, we aim to contribute to advancing targeted strategies to protect crops and enhance food security.\u201d\n\nBy studying plant microbiomes, Vorholt\u2019s team has shown that the composition of microbial communities follows predictable patterns. More importantly, they could predict interaction outcomes solely based on the properties of individual microbes \u2013 an essential step toward developing biotechnology solutions, including tailored microbial treatments that naturally suppress harmful microbes.\n\nReceiving the 2025 Novonesis Biotechnology Prize not only honours Vorholt\u2019s work but also highlights its potential to transform agriculture. By leveraging beneficial microbes instead of synthetic chemicals, her research is paving the way for healthier crops, higher yields and a more sustainable future for global food production.\n\nAbout Julia Vorholt\n\n1997 : PhD in Microbiology, University of Marburg; research work at Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany\n\n: PhD in Microbiology, University of Marburg; research work at Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany 1998 : Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Washington, Seattle, USA\n\n: Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Washington, Seattle, USA 1999\u20132001 : Group Leader, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany\n\n: Group Leader, Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany 2001\u20132006 : Independent Group Leader, CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research), Toulouse, France\n\n: Independent Group Leader, CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research), Toulouse, France 2006\u2013present : Professor of Microbiology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland\n\n: Professor of Microbiology, ETH Zurich, Switzerland 2012 : Elected Member, German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina\n\n: Elected Member, German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina 2019 : Elected Member, European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)\n\n: Elected Member, European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) 2020\u2013present : Co-Director, National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Microbiomes, Switzerland\n\n: Co-Director, National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Microbiomes, Switzerland 2024 : Feodor Lynen Medal\n\n: Feodor Lynen Medal 2024: Elected International Member, United States National Academy of Sciences\n\nAbout the Novonesis Biotechnology Prize\n\nThe Novonesis Biotechnology Prize recognises outstanding research or technological contributions that benefit the development of biotechnological science for innovative solutions.

            "content": "Roche (RHHBY) is increasing its investment into the obesity space with an up to $5.3 billion deal with Danish drugmaker Zealand Pharma (ZLDPF), the companies announced Wednesday.\n\nThe deal would give Zealand a partner to co-develop petrelintide, an amylin therapy, as a new anti-obesity drug. The drug is currently in phase II trials.\n\nAmylin therapies are considered the next generation of obesity medication from the current GLP-1 products sold by Danish drug giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Novo's stock slid earlier this week on news that CargriSema, its combination therapy using the GLP-1 semaglutide and the amylin cagrilintide, didn't have a significantly higher weight-loss result than the current market products.\n\nThe deal with Zealand includes a standalone treatment as well as exploring a combination product with Roche's GLP-1 candidate, which is still in its clinical phase.\n\nRoche is paying Zealand $1.65 billion upfront of which $1.4 billion will be paid after the deal closes. The remainder will be paid out over the next few years.\n\nThe news sent Roche's stock up more than 4% in trading Wednesday, and Zealand's stock skyrocketed 40% on the news. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's stock was hit, sliding 4%, and Eli Lilly's stock was down just under 1%.\n\nThe impact to Novo's stock is largely due to the CagriSema news earlier this week, along with the increased competition in the amylin space. Lilly, meanwhile, is focused on changing the game with a weight-loss pill, so its stock was less affected.\n\nMizuho Securities healthcare sector expert Jared Holz noted that Novo will need to take \"proactive [measures] to get ahead of various pricing dynamics \u2014 both in terms of the IRA and patent expiry. Needs an oral option no doubt \u2014 that will likely remain the focus for investors over the next couple of quarters.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Hardik Parikh wrote in a note to clients Wednesday that the deal adds to Roche's efforts in the obesity space and that the next-gen amylin space is likely to heat up.\n\n\"Roche had already acquired Carmot in early 2024 for $3 billion and we could see other pharma companies taking multiple shots on goal in this space with multiple MOAs. And as evidenced by ABBV\u2019s [AbbVie's] partnership with Gubra (also an amylin analog) earlier this month, we see a broad group of companies interested including those who don\u2019t historically have a major foot print in the cardiometabolic space,\" Parikh wrote.\n\nMADRID, SPAIN - JANUARY 2025: Headquarters of Roche, multinational pharmaceutical industry on 28 January, 2025 in Madrid, Spain.

            "content": "Over the past few days, as the rest of the stock market melted down, a revolution has been quietly brewing in the market for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Current runners-up Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) and Roche Holdings (OTC: RHHBY), up 11.3% and 4%, respectively, through 10:05 a.m. ET today, are behind it.\n\nAnd Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) stock, down 4.9%, is the victim.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nGood news for Viking\n\nLet's start with the background. Currently there are four branded and patent-protected GLP-1 weight-loss drugs on the market. Novo Nordisk owns two of them: Ozempic and Wegovy. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) owns the other two: Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nBoth Viking and Roche are attempting to horn in on this market, however.\n\nYesterday, Viking signed a \"broad manufacturing agreement\" with Germany's CordenPharma to produce for it a \"multi-ton annual supply\" of Viking's own VK2735 GLP-1 weight-loss drug. VK2735 is still in clinical trials and not yet available for general sale, but Viking seems confident the drug will come to market and has hired CordenPharma to produce for it up to:\n\n100 million autoinjectors annually\n\n100 million units of vials and syringes for injections\n\nMore than 1 billion oral tablets, for when it gets FDA approval to sell VK2735 in pill form.\n\nViking told investors that this agreement \"provides Viking with sufficient long-term supply of both subcutaneous and oral VK2735 product forms to support a potential multibillion-dollar annual product opportunity.\" And at the risk of taking Viking's optimism for granted, that means \"multibillions\" of dollars in sales will soon not be going to Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly.\n\nAnd good news for Roche, too\n\nSeparately, Roche announced this morning its own \"exclusive collaboration & licensing agreement with Denmark's Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialise petrelintide.\" (That's a name to remember. Similar to Novo Nordisk's semaglutide and Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, petrelintide mimics a naturally occurring hormone, causing patients to feel full so that they eat less and lose more weight.)\n\nTogether with Zealand, Roche will co-develop and co-commercialise petrelintide. The companies plan to sell it both separately and in combination with Roche's CT-388 incretin drug.\n\nWhat this means for Novo Nordisk\n\nBoth petrelintide and CT-388, by the way, are still in clinical trials. But the alliance between Roche and Zealand Pharma indicates Roche is still forging ahead and trying to find a way into this market -- and still intends to compete with Novo and Lilly to dominate it.\n\nIndeed, just yesterday Bloomberg reported that Roche has created a new \"head for cardiovascular, renal and metabolism\" position within its headquarters and poached Morten Lammert, Novo Nordisk corporate vice president for obesity strategy and projects, to fill it.\n\nThese two factors combined probably explain why Viking and Roche stocks are up today and Novo Nordisk stock is down.\n\nWhich of these GLP-1 stocks should you buy?\n\nAnd now, at last, the question of the hour: How does this recent news affect your strategy of investing in pharmaceutical stocks that manufacture GLP-1 weight-loss drugs? And honestly, I'm not sure it really should.\n\nWhile Viking's and Roche's drugs hold promise, neither one is on the market yet. And even when they are on the market, they'll be trying to compete with incumbents that already hold large market shares and even larger \"mind shares.\" Unless they are significantly more effective, easier to take, or less expensive (ideally all three), despite their best efforts, Viking and Roche probably aren't going to earn outsize profits.\n\nThat means that in Roche, we're still looking at a stock costing nearly 29 times earnings -- paying a decent 3.3% dividend yield, sure, but still basically growing in the mid-single-digits at less than 7% annually. That's not fast enough to justify a 29x P/E ratio, I fear.\n\nViking's even trickier. Not yet profitable and not expected to earn even pro forma profits before 2029 at the earliest, Viking seems a pretty speculative stock to me. And as some analysts have observed, the fact that Viking is partnering with CordenPharma to manufacture drugs on its own implies that Viking is not looking to sell itself to a larger drug company. That lessens the likelihood of investors receiving a quick cash-out in a mergers-and-acquisitions scenario.\n\nThat leaves investors with basically the same two GLP-1 drug stock prospects they began with: Lilly stock, which costs 70 times earnings and pays only a 0.7% dividend, and Novo Nordisk stock, which costs less than 24 times earnings and pays 2.1%! I know which one I would pick.\n\nDo you?\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk launched a direct-to-consumer program last week to sell Wegovy at a reduced price for people who are uninsured or insured on commercial plans that don't cover the obesity drug.\n\nThrough the NovoCare program, patients can purchase a month\u2019s supply of Wegovy for $499. All dose strengths, from 0.25 milligrams to 2.4 milligrams, are priced the same. The list price for Wegovy is around $1,350 per month.\n\nNovo Nordisk says that 90% of U.S. patients who take Wegovy have a co-pay of $0 to $25 per month. The new program intends to lower costs for people who are uninsured or whose commercial insurance plans don\u2019t cover the cost of obesity medications. People who have drug coverage through Medicare and Medicaid are ineligible, even if their plans won't pay for obesity medications.\n\nNovoCare also offers home deliveries and refill reminders for Wegovy prescriptions.\n\nThis initiative comes after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed Wegovy from the drug shortage list in late February. When a drug is in shortage, compounding pharmacies can legally create off-brand versions of the drug. Insurance doesn\u2019t cover the cost of compounded drugs because they are not approved by the FDA.\n\n\u201cNovoCare Pharmacy offers patients access to authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy, helping to avoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace, as warned by respected organizations, experts in the medical community, and the FDA,\u201d the company said in a press release.\n\n\u201cWith an FDA-approved medicine like Wegovy, healthcare professionals and patients can have clarity and confidence in knowing the medicine they are using has undergone rigorous review for safety, effectiveness, and quality.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, telehealth companies have emerged to offer lower-cost, off-brand obesity medications. Companies such as Hims & Hers and Ro partner with state-licensed compounding pharmacies to provide unbranded semaglutide and tirzepatide at a fraction of the cost of brand-name versions. However, some companies and unregulated pharmacies have sold versions of these drugs that are neither FDA- nor state-regulated.\n\nPrices for compounded semaglutide through telehealth providers ranged from $130 to $300 per month.\n\nThe FDA has set an April 22 deadline for traditional compounding pharmacies to transition patients from compounded semaglutide to the brand-name drug or an alternative.\n\n\n\nEli Lilly has expanded a similar program, called LillyDirect, to reduce the price of its obesity medication, Zepbound, for people lacking insurance coverage. Lilly is offering single-dose vials that patients self-administer using a needle and syringe. Prices vary by dose, and the highest-strength vials are not available through the program.\n\n\n\nLillyDirect also offers telehealth consultations, which allow patients to meet virtually with a provider to get a Zepbound prescription. This offering has raised concerns about overprescription.\n\n\n\nIn a statement posted last year, the American College of Physicians emphasized the importance of an \u201cestablished and valid patient-physician relationship\u201d for high-quality care.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese direct-to-consumer services have the potential to leave patients confused and misinformed about medications. While efforts to remove barriers to care are important, they should not devalue the proven benefits of the patient-physician relationship,\u201d the ACP said in the statement.\n\n\n\nWhile patients using NovoCare will have access to a case manager to help answer questions about Wegovy, Novo Nordisk is not offering a telehealth service to dispense prescriptions.",

The drop followed the release of phase 3 trial results for its next-generation obesity drug, CagriSema.\n\nOver 68 weeks, CagriSema produced an average 15.7% weight reduction in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, according to the research results. Weight reduction under the trial product estimand (if all adhered to treatment) was 15.7%, while the treatment policy estimand (regardless of adherence) showed 13.7%. In the placebo group, the corresponding figures were 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nThe outcomes fell short of previous expectations even with the claimed efficiency. December study results from Novo Nordisk revealed that the medication only achieved about 20% weight reduction aim, failing the 25% target set by the business. Furthermore, fewer than two-thirds of subjects attained the maximum dosage of the drug by the conclusion of the study, which calls into question dosage flexibility.\n\nTwo different programsREDEFINE, aimed at obese and overweight patients, and REimagine, aiming for type 2 diabetesare evaluating CagriSema. For CagriSema, the business anticipates submitting a regulatory file in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nIn the competitive weight-loss drug market, where Novo Nordisk faces competition from Eli Lilly (LLY, Financials), Structure Therapeutics (GPCR, Financials), among others, the weaker-than-expected trial results could affect its position.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \u201cflexible\u201d nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \u201c2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\u201d the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo\u2019s revelation. The price of Novo\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo\u2019s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

In December 2024, the company\u2019s stock dropped by more than 26% after the Phase III Redefine 1 trial (NCT05669755) of the drug missed out on the 25% weight loss promise.\n\nMartin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, said: \u201cThe Redefine 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.\u201d\n\nThe Redefine 2 trial recruited 1,200 patients with T2D who were also obese or overweight across 169 international sites. The trial comes as part of the Redefine series of trials all examining CagriSema in different forms of obesity or diabetes.\n\nIn the Redefine 1 trial, there was a weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks on CagriSema compared to a reduction of 11.8% with cagrilintide 2.4mg or 16.1% with semaglutide alone.\n\nLast month, the company announced plans to launch its Redefine 11 trial with a longer duration and focus on dose escalation and re-escalation set to launch in the first half of this year.\n\nDesigned as an alternative to the company\u2019s weight loss blockbuster drug Wegovy, CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of an amylin analogue, cagrilintide and semaglutide. It is also being investigated as a treatment for adults with T2D in the company\u2019s Reimagine trial (NCT06065540).\n\nNovo Nordisk plans to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in Q1 2026. If it is approved, research by GlobalData estimates that by the end of 2027, CagriSema could bring in as much as $2bn for the Danish mega-company, with that figure estimated to continue rising to $10bn by the end of 2030.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nElsewhere in the field of weight loss therapies, Bloom Science\u2019s trial examining its primary pipeline weight loss drug, designed to replicate the positive effects of the ketogenic diet, has seen 80% of patients sustain weight loss for two weeks after the last dose.",

REDEFINE 2 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg) compared to placebo. The trial included 1,206 randomised people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes and a mean baseline body weight of 102 kg.\n\nThe trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with CagriSema versus placebo.\n\nThe REDEFINE 2 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial. After 68 weeks, 61.9% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose.\n\nWhen evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 15.7% after 68 weeks compared to 3.1% with placebo. Weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks was a co-primary endpoint and was achieved by 89.7% of patients on CagriSema, compared to 30.3% by placebo.\n\nWhen applying the treatment policy estimand2, people treated with CagriSema achieved a superior weight loss of 13.7% compared to 3.4% with placebo.\n\nIn the trial, CagriSema appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.\n\n\u201cThe REDEFINE 2 results confirmed the superior efficacy of CagriSema in people with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes\u201d, said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk expects to file for the first regulatory approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026. The detailed results from REDEFINE 1 and REDEFINE 2 will be presented at a scientific conference in 2025.\n\nAbout CagriSema\n\nOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby helping people eat less and reduce their calorie intake.\n\n\n\nAbout the REDEFINE clinical trial programme\n\nREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme consists of two pivotal phase 3 trials, which have enrolled approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. The phase 3 trial programme includes:",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s experimental drug CagriSema helped people who are overweight or obese and have diabetes lose about 14% of their body weight over 68 weeks, or 11 percentage points more than those given placebo, the company said Monday.\n\nThe Danish company aims to position CagriSema as a more potent successor to its popular obesity drug Wegovy, which recorded sales of 58 billion kroner, or about $8.4 billion, in 2024. But earlier trial results in people without diabetes also fell short of expectations, casting doubt on CagriSema\u2019s potential.\n\nNovo Nordisk shares fell nearly 10% following the announcement, continuing a monthslong stock slide fueled by concerns over the company\u2019s competitive standing versus top rival Eli Lilly. The company has already outlined plans for a new Phase 3 trial to test whether CagriSema can generate greater weight loss at higher doses.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNovo had an early lead on Lilly, with Wegovy reaching market before Lilly\u2019s rival Zepbound and, at least so far, securing broader insurance coverage.\n\nBut that early advantage may be dissipating. Zepbound drives greater weight loss than Wegovy, giving it an edge commercially. And both companies have made steady progress shoring up their drug supply.\n\nNovo has hoped CagriSema might answer Lilly\u2019s competitive threat. The drug combines semaglutide, the main ingredient in Wegovy, with a second drug called cagrilintide. Executives believed doing so might spur greater weight loss than Zepbound, which works differently.\n\nSo far in testing, CagriSema appears to be an improvement on Wegovy alone. But it hasn\u2019t lived up to the expectations of investors or company executives. Novo executives had set a target of 25% weight loss for a Phase 3 trial in people with obesity but not diabetes, a mark it missed in December. In a smaller Phase 2 trial in diabetics, CagriSema was associated with 16% weight loss after 32 weeks, raising expectations it might have bigger benefits in a longer Phase 3 study.\n\n\u201cWe had believed that adults living with both overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes represent the patient segment for which CagriSema has the best chance to outperform Zepbound,\u201d wrote William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh, in a Monday note to clients. \u201cTherefore, we believe today\u2019s results are especially disappointing.\u201d\n\nSelling CagriSema, if approved, may prove to be difficult, too. While Zepbound has a single main ingredient, CagriSema\u2019s two components can\u2019t be dissolved together, requiring them to be manufactured separately and then delivered with a dual-chambered pen. Novo\u2019s \u201cfuture manufacturing capacity is TBD,\u201d wrote Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger, in a separate note.\n\nHsieh added that the result may prove Zepbound\u2019s mechanism of action \u2014 stimulating the gut hormones GLP-1 and GIP \u2014 yields better results. That, in turn, could boost other developers working on similar approaches, such as Amgen, Roche and Viking Therapeutics.",

That's comparable to Eli Lilly's blockbuster, Zepbound, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a report to clients. He said CagriSema is also more difficult than Zepbound to manufacture due to the type of device it uses, and Novo has yet to lay out its manufacturing plans.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said CagriSema stood the best chance of outperforming Zepbound in this patient population \u2014 people with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Shares undercut their 50-day moving average. Lilly stock also slipped 4.6% to 829.76.\n\nNovo Nordisk Stock: Testing A Combo\n\nCagriSema is a combination of Novo's semaglutide and a drug called cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which Novo sells as the diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss med Wegovy, mimics the GLP-1 hormone to lower appetite and improve blood sugar markers. Cagrilintide mimics the amylin hormone. The pancreas secretes amylin alongside insulin.\n\nIn the study, CagriSema appeared safe and well tolerated, Novo Nordisk said in its news release. The most common side effects mirrored the GLP-1 class and included gastrointestinal problems. Notably, Novo used a flexible dosing schedule, allowing patients to change their dosage throughout the study. By the end of the test, 61.9% of patients were on the highest dose.\n\nNovo expects to file for approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAbbVie Enters The Obesity Arena.

            "content": "When James Norris, a 56-year-old mechanic from Roxbury, New Jersey, went on a low dose of Mounjaro, a GLP-1 medication similar to Ozempic, to lose weight in March 2023, he thought it would be a miracle drug.\n\nAt 289 pounds, he had struggled to lose weight for years with diet and exercise. His wife had lost 60 pounds in several months on the medication, and her success convinced him to give it a shot.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t keep weight off \u2014 [the drug] seemed like a good alternative,\u201d he said.\n\n13 James Norris, 56, a mechanic from Roxbury, New Jersey, went on a low dose of Mounjaro to lose weight in March 2023. He experienced vision loss months later. LP Media\n\nIn the year that followed, he lost 89 pounds and was able to wean off medications he was taking for high blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nThen, in March 2024, shortly after his doctor upped his dosage to 2.5 milligrams (he\u2019d started at 1.5 mg), he woke up one morning with clouded vision in his left eye. Two weeks later, vision in his right eye became blurry.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d said Norris, who initially thought a sinus infection might be to blame.\n\nBut, after getting a CT-scan and seeing a neuro-ophthalmologist, it was revealed he had non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a condition in which the loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes sudden vision loss.\n\n13 Recent studies have revealed a correlation between drugs such as Ozempic and similar GLP-1 medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro. dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare to get NAION in both eyes.\u201d\n\nRecent studies have shown an association between drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy \u2014 which have become phenomenally popular for weight loss \u2014 and an increased risk of NAION.\n\nOf the estimated 15 million Americans now taking such medications for Type 2 diabetes and weight loss, only a relative few have experienced the issue, but for those who have, it\u2019s life-altering.\n\n13 James Norris, pictured before he started using Mounjaro in 2023. At the time, he weighed 289 pounds. Credit: Courtesy of James Norris\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a mechanic my whole life \u2014 I can\u2019t do anything hands on anymore,\u201d said Norris, who stopped taking Mounjaro around July 2024 but still has significantly impaired vision.\n\nHe now mostly does administrative work from a computer and believes the risk of the medications, particularly at higher doses, isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how many people on these drugs are experiencing vision issues, Norris\u2019s attorney, Robert King, said his firm alone has received \u201chundreds\u201d of GLP-1 medication and vision-loss related cases.\n\n13 Norris pictured on his eighth month taking Mounjaro. He was motivated to take the drug for weight loss after his wife (right) had success with the medication and lost 60 pounds in several months. Courtesy of James Norris\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is the sheer number of eye injury cases related to something that is supposed to be gastrointestinal medication and the fact that no one would ever suspect a weight loss drug is going to make them immediately blind in one eye,\u201d King, who is based in Rochester, NY, told The Post.\n\nA review conducted by physician-scientists from the University of Utah\u2019s John A. Moran Eye Center published in JAMA Ophthalmology on January 30, 2025, looked at nine patients who reported vision loss after taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, the active ingredients in Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\n13 Norris at his current weight of 230 pounds and off the Mounjaro. He has NAION in both eyes as a frightening and unexpected side effect. LP Media\n\nThey found the patients taking these drugs developed three potentially blinding conditions affecting the optic nerve \u2014 the part of the eye that sends visual signals to the brain.\n\nOf the nine patients, seven reported NAION-like symptoms; one had papillitis, an inflammation of the optic nerve head; and one individual developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy, which can cause a blind spot in vision.\n\nThe January study came on the heels of July 2024 research from Mass Eye and Ear, a teaching hospital at Harvard Medical School. It found an association between semaglutides and an increased risk of NAION.\n\n13 Michael Sabellico, 60, had near perfect vision before he went on Ozempic in March 2024, starting on a 1.5 milligram dosage. Here he is shortly before starting the medication. Credit: Courtesy of Mike Sabellico\n\nDiabetics taking the medication were found to be four times more at risk for NAOIN than those not on the drugs. Those who were overweight or obese and taking the drug to lose weight were seven times more at risk.\n\nNorris wasn\u2019t aware of any such dangers when he went on the drug.\n\n\u201cI had no idea this could happen,\u201d he said, noting that he plans to file a lawsuit against Mounjaro drugmaker Lilly and Company.\n\nOzempic and Mounjaro list \u201cchanges in vision\u201d as a potential side effect on their websites, while Wegovy lists \u201cchange in vision in people with type 2 diabetes.\u201d None of the websites explicitly warn users about NAION.\n\n13 Sabellico pictured the first month he was on Ozempic. He lost around five pounds in eight weeks. Courtesy of Mike Sabellico\n\nA spokesperson for Lilly, the US company that makes Mounjaro, as well as the similar Zepbound, said patient safety is a \u201ctop priority\u201d and they \u201cactively engage in monitoring, evaluating, and reporting safety information for all our medicines.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the Danish manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, told The Post \u201cNAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction.\u201d They said that after evaluating the research and an internal safety assessment, \u201cNovo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nDr. Joseph Rizzo, professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and a senior author on the study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, told The Post that he isn\u2019t outright discouraging people from taking these medications, but those who already have vision loss should proceed with caution.\n\n13 Sabellico today, off the Ozempic. He has since gained back the five pounds he lost. Courtesy of Mike Sabellico\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say they don\u2019t have diabetes but they have advanced glaucoma, then I would be exceptionally careful about taking the medicine \u2014 you\u2019re not starting from a normal visual status,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nSan Diego-based Michael Sabellico, 60, did have normal vision when he went on Ozempic in March 2024 to both lose weight and manage his Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhen he started, he weighed 185 pounds and had near perfect sight. After eight weeks on a dose of 1.5 mg, he was down five pounds. But then he woke up one morning and couldn\u2019t see clearly.\n\n13 Cheryl Bovee, who has Type 2 diabetes, is pictured before she began taking Ozempic.\n\nAn optometrist found his optic nerve was inflamed and diagnosed him with NAION. He was given a steroid to help with the inflammation.\n\nBut, because there was no research at the time linking NAION to GLP-1s, doctors also upped his dosage of Ozempic to manage his blood sugar.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop the Ozempic until May, 2024, at which point his vision was permanently impaired.\n\n13 Bovee pictured after going off Ozempic. She is now legally blind after developing NAION following use of the drug as directed by her physicians to manage her Type 2 Diabetes. Courtesy of Cheryl Bove\n\nHe now has 20/70 vision in his left eye and below average 20/30 vision in his right eye.\n\n\u201cIf I had a patch over my right eye it would be difficult to read,\u201d said Sabellico, who is now managing his diabetes with the drug Trulicity and plans to take legal action. \u201cThe letters jump around.\u201d\n\nCheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old former retail worker from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has already taken legal action against Novo Nordisk. She filed a lawsuit in February alleging that the company\u2019s marketing was \u201cdeceptive and misleading about the true risks associated with [the] use of Ozempic.\u201d\n\n13 Mass General Brigham ophthalmologist discovered people with diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide were more than four times more likely to get a NAION diagnosis than people with diabetes who did not take semaglutide medications. REUTERS\n\n13 \u201cNovo Nordisk has failed to warn the medical community and patients about the risk of suffering NAION despite multiple studies revealing this concerning risk,\u201d Danielle Gold, an attorney at Weitz and Luxenberg representing Bovee told the Post. alones \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nShe is legally blind after developing NAION while using Ozempic as directed by her physicians to manage her Type 2 Diabetes last year. She was not on the medication for weight loss and it\u2019s unclear how much her weight changed while on it, her lawyer noted.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that her vision is severely degraded.\n\n\u201cI can no longer work. I can no longer drive. I have to be careful just walking around my block. I can\u2019t see at night,\u201d Bovee said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely changed my life.\u201d\n\n13 \u201cI no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can\u2019t have any sort of independence \u2013 I\u2019m no longer going to be able to live by myself,\u201d Bovee told The Post. Courtesy of Cheryl Bovee\n\nA widow, she had hoped to spend her retirement traveling and spending time with her family. Now she worries about being able to care for herself.\n\n\u201cI no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can\u2019t have any sort of independence \u2014 I\u2019m no longer going to be able to live by myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAll of my hopes and dreams have been dashed.\u201d",

            "content": "Thursday, Reuters reported that Martin Holst Lange, head of development at Novo, had told an online conference on Thursday that his company plans to investigate how its GLP-1 medicines can help people with addiction.\n\nHowever, in response to questions from Biospace, a Novo spokesperson said that Lange was referring to already ongoing work studying semaglutide on liver damage and alcohol use, and that the company has no plans to study the drug in broader addiction indications.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing else in terms of clinical trials we have ongoing in this space at the moment,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nNovo currently markets its GLP-1 treatments, which both contain the active ingredient semaglutide, as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for type II diabetes. However, there is an early but growing interest in the potential of these molecules to treat substance abuse disorders, their related effects and a bevy of other conditions.\n\nThe Phase II trial, launched in May 2024 and currently recruiting globally, is studying the effectiveness of semaglutide and two other drugs\u2014cagrilintide, an amylin analogue, and NNC0194-0499, an FGF21 analog\u2014used alone or in combination, in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Treatment of liver damage is that trial\u2019s primary endpoint and alcohol consumption is a secondary endpoint.\n\nThree months ago, Novo\u2019s biggest competitor Eli Lilly shared its plans to study its own GLP-1 medicines in alcohol and drug abuse. While Lilly has not officially announced any trials, CEO David Ricks said at an event in December that the company would begin large studies of its obesity drugs in alcohol and drug abuse next year, according to Endpoints News .\n\nCurrently, pharmaceutical treatment for addiction and substance-use disorders is limited, with most treatments aimed at avoiding overdoses or reducing withdrawal symptoms. But the industry is attempting inroads, with psychedelic therapies like LSD and ketamine drawing attention from researchers and biopharma companies. Another area of interest is in vaccination. In 2021 the NIH awarded a $25 million grant to scientists at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to study a vaccine against opioids. The hope is that the vaccine would generate antibodies to prevent the molecules from crossing into the brain.",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \u201cflexible\u201d nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \u201c2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\u201d the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo\u2019s revelation. The price of Novo\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo\u2019s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\n\n\n\nBack to Healio\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nAdults with obesity who have a prescription for Wegovy can purchase the medication from NovoCare Pharmacy.\n\nThe program is aimed at uninsured patients or those whose insurance does not cover obesity drugs.\n\nAdults with obesity who have a prescription for Wegovy but do not have insurance coverage for the drug can now purchase the medication through a new Novo Nordisk direct-to-consumer program.\n\nIn a March 5 press release, Novo Nordisk announced the launch of NovoCare Pharmacy, a direct-to-patient program that will provide any available dose of Wegovy (semaglutide, Novo Nordisk) for $499 per month. According to a statement from the company sent to Healio, the program provides patients without health insurance or patients whose commercial health insurance does not cover obesity medications a way to self-pay for the medication and avoid the \u201csignificant risks that can be posed by fake or illegally compounded semaglutide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith an FDA-approved medicine like Wegovy, it\u2019s important that health care professionals and patients can have clarity and confidence in knowing the medicine they are using has undergone rigorous review for safety, effectiveness and quality,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. \u201cAdditionally, most patients with insurance coverage for anti-obesity medicine, including Wegovy,will pay $0 to $25 per month \u2014 however, we recognize that cash-paying patients without insurance or whose commercial insurance does not cover obesity medicine need options, too, so that is why this option was developed.\u201d\n\nKatherine H. Saunders, MD, DABOM, co-founder of FlyteHealth and obesity physician at Weill Cornell Medicine, said the program attempts to fill a void, since insurance coverage of obesity medications remains a barrier to treatment.\n\n\u201cThere is a tremendous need to improve access to obesity medications for individuals who don\u2019t have insurance coverage,\u201d Saunders told Healio.\n\nProgram details and pricing\n\nAccording to the company press release, NovoCare Pharmacy is providing Wegovy in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg. 1 mg, 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg doses. Patients who want to purchase the drug through the program can have a prescription sent to NovoCare Pharmacy from a licensed health care professional. NovoCare Pharmacy prescriptions are being dispensed through CenterWell Pharmacy. Patients can schedule monthly shipments of the drug to be delivered to their home.\n\nDiana Isaacs\n\nNovoCare Pharmacy is offering Wegovy at a price of $499 for a 28-day supply. The Novo Nordisk website states the 28-day list price for Wegovy is $1,349. Before the launch of NovoCare Pharmacy, patients without insurance coverage for Wegovy could use a savings card to lower their monthly cost to $650 per month.\n\nDiana Isaacs, PharmD, BCPS, BCACP, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, FCCP, an endocrine clinical pharmacy specialist and co-director of Endocrine Disorders in Pregnancy at Cleveland Clinic, and a Healio | Endocrine Today Editorial Board Member, said even with the reduction in price, there may still be many patients who cannot afford Wegovy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot of money, so I don\u2019t know what the uptake will be,\u201d Isaacs told Healio. \u201cI\u2019m sure [uptake] will be better than when it was $650. But it\u2019s still pretty expensive.\u201d\n\nSaunders agreed and said the price for Wegovy remains \u201cout of reach\u201d for most patients without insurance coverage. She added that NovoCare Pharmacy only addresses some of the barriers people face for acquiring obesity medications.\n\n\u201cOther critical barriers include insurance coverage, number of qualified clinicians and weight bias, stigma and discrimination,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nIncreasing access\n\nThe NovoCare Pharmacy announcement came less than 2 weeks after the company and the FDA announced the removal of all doses of semaglutide from the agency\u2019s drug shortage list. As Healio previously reported, state-licensed compounding pharmacies and physicians under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may no longer distribute compounded semaglutide after April 22, and outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the law must stop manufacturing compounded semaglutide after May 22.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the FDA has updated the status of Wegovy to \u2018resolved\u2019 on their drug shortage website, indicating that the supply of this prescription-only GLP-1 medicine now meets or exceeds current and projected demand in the U.S. and that all doses of Wegovy are being shipped regularly to our customers,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email.\n\nIsaacs said she was pleased to see Novo Nordisk take a step toward improving access to semaglutide. She also praised the company for providing the medications prefilled in pens rather than selling it in vials and having patients draw up the medication in syringes.\n\n\u201cI appreciate what they\u2019re trying to do, because most likely the people who are using compounding pharmacies, with the shortage being resolved, [will have] less access to compounded semaglutide,\u201d Isaacs told Healio. \u201cI think it\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d\n\nNovoCare Pharmacy vs. LillyDirect\n\nThe launch of NovoCare Pharmacy comes a little more than 1 year after Eli Lilly launched LillyDirect in January 2024. As Healio previously reported, LillyDirect is a direct-to-consumer platform that connects patients with health care professionals for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, migraines and sleep apnea. The platform allows patients to fill prescriptions for select Eli Lilly medications through LillyDirect Pharmacy Solutions.\n\nNovoCare Pharmacy differs from LillyDirect in several ways. In an email, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said NovoCare Pharmacy is only available for patients prescribed Wegovy and is not partnered with any health care practices or telehealth companies. LillyDirect offers multiple types of medications beyond its GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound, Eli Lilly) and partners with several telehealth providers to connect patients who need to see a health care professional.\n\nNovoCare Pharmacy is also a cash-pay only program, according to its terms and conditions of use. Patients enrolled in any federal or state health program, including Medicare or Medicaid, are not eligible for NovoCare Pharmacy. Commercial health insurance plans are also not accepted with NovoCare Pharmacy. LillyDirect accepts most health insurance plans with some of its medications, with other drugs being self-pay only, according to a frequently asked questions page on its website.\n\nIsaacs said she does not feel that LillyDirect has had a huge impact on tirzepatide uptake since its launch due to costs and the availability of cheaper compounded drugs. She said although she believes that it is possible more patients gravitate toward NovoCare Pharmacy and LillyDirect with both semaglutide and tirzepatide off the FDA drug shortage list, some forms of compounded medications may be available for a little while longer.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a while before the compounding pharmacies fully dissipate [with semaglutide and tirzepatide],\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cI think that they\u2019re going to try to keep compounding, and it\u2019s going to take Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly a long time to litigate all of this. ... I think both programs might be slow-growing.\u201d\n\nReferences:\n\nFAQs about LillyDirect. https://lillydirect.lilly.com/faq.

            "content": "The Ozempic shortage is over and the Ozempic era is here.\n\nNovo Nordisk launched its latest campaign \u2013 My Ozempic Era \u2013 just a few weeks after the Food and Drug Administration took semaglutide, the active ingredient in its popular GLP-1s Ozempic and Wegovy, off its shortages list.\n\nMy Ozempic Era represents another push forward by the drugmaker in the diabetes and obesity treatment space.\n\nEarlier this week, the company unveiled NovoCare Pharmacy, offering home shipments of the popular GLP-1 Wegovy at $499 per month for cash-paying patients.\n\nThis campaign features the testimony of three patient ambassadors living with type 2 diabetes who pair Ozempic with diet and exercise. The goal is to encourage others living with the condition to have their own \u201cOzempic eras.\u201d\n\nTivonnia Harvey, head of Novo\u2019s diabetes therapeutic area, said the team was initially inspired to create the campaign when the FDA expanded Ozempic\u2019s indication to treat chronic kidney disease for type 2 diabetes patients in January.\n\nShe said that regulatory greenlight provided a perfect opportunity for Novo to think about what this new campaign needed to look like.\n\n\u201cWe knew that it all needs to start with the patients, so it was critical for us to use real patient ambassadors that are suffering with type 2 diabetes and bring their stories to life,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nAmong the patient ambassadors are country musicians Michael and Tanya Trotter, critically-acclaimed chef Franklin Becker and entrepreneur and hair stylist Maria.\n\nAccording to Harvey, the team chose all three because of how they manage living with diabetes while pursuing their creative passions.\n\nVideos of each patient ambassador shows them singing the catchy \u201cOh, oh, oh Ozempic\u201d jingle in various backgrounds \u2013 whether onstage, in the kitchen or at the hair salon.\n\n\u201cThroughout all of this, [the campaign] shows how they have taken control of their type 2 diabetes and how they haven\u2019t allowed that to stop them from living their lives and doing the things they love to do,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nBy launching My Ozempic Era, Harvey said Novo wants people living with type 2 diabetes to see themselves in the campaign and feel empowered to have conversations with their healthcare providers about whether these injections are right for them.\n\nGLP-1s have been the subject of unprecedented demand since coming on to the market in the past few years, so much so that off-label use caused prolonged shortages impacting manufacturers like Novo and rival Eli Lilly.\n\nThroughout the GLP-1 shortages, patients struggled to pick up their prescriptions and many had to pause or halt treatment.\n\nHowever, the dynamics in the obesity treatment space has started to change over the past few months, with Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide coming off the FDA shortage list in December.\n\nLast month, the FDA removed semaglutide from the shortages list after nearly three years of demand outpacing supply.\n\nOne sector that took off during the scarcity challenge were compounding pharmacies, which offered compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs.\n\nNovo and Lilly have fought back \u2013 through advertising and in the courts \u2013 against these compounders as well as telehealth companies that connect patients with the products.\n\nWith Novo\u2019s shortage concerns shelved for now and legal rulings in favor of drugmakers over compounders, Harvey emphasized that the Danish pharma giant is \u201cfully stocked at all doses\u201d for both Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nIn the initial stage of the campaign, My Ozempic Era will roll out via television, social media and digital platforms. Harvey said the company will soon unveil a Spanish language version to target Hispanic populations.\n\nBoth Hispanic and Black populations are predominantly impacted by type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease, Harvey said, so the campaign aims to resonate with both of those groups.",

            "content": "Every month, roughly 100,000 people buy Zepbound directly from Eli Lilly through its website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the size of a small city,\u201d says David Ricks, Eli Lilly\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s about 10% of the 1 million people who use the blockbuster obesity drug every month, though the numbers can vary, he says.\n\nThe customers are getting a significant discount, but there\u2019s a catch: they can\u2019t use their health insurance.\n\nLast summer, Lilly started selling vials of the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of Zepbound online through its LillyDirect platform. Patients either need a prescription from their doctor or can get one online through a Lilly partner. Now, the company is adding the 7.5 mg and 10 mg vials.\n\nAnd on Wednesday the maker of Wegovy, a similar weight-loss drug, announced that it, too, would offer direct-to-consumer discounts for patients paying cash.\n\nThe drugs usually come as autoinjector pens \u2014 like an EpiPen. But the LillyDirect Zepbound offer is for vials that patients inject themselves with, using an old-fashioned syringe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural phenomena,\u201d Ricks says of the drug. \u201cIt\u2019s used by millions of people in the U.S. and millions more would like to use it. So I think it\u2019s incumbent on us not just to invent great new medicines, but get them to patients.\u201d\n\nThe syringe option is cheaper for consumers: It costs between $349 and $699 a month for the vials compared to a list price of $1,086.37 per monthly injector pen.\n\nWegovy\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, is charging $499 per month for its direct-to-consumer product.\n\nCustomers can\u2019t get their health insurance to pay for the either Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound vials or the discounted Wegovy, though.\n\nThat\u2019s because a lot of health insurers don\u2019t cover Zepbound or Wegovy \u2014 or any drug specifically used to treat obesity. It\u2019s especially difficult for people with government insurance, because Medicare, for example, isn\u2019t allowed to cover weight-loss drugs. (It can cover Wegovy if the patient also has heart disease risk, but not for obesity alone.)\n\nIn fact, coverage is getting worse, according to a new report by GoodRx, a company that helps patients find discounts on drugs. The report determined that 4.9 million people whose health insurance covered Zepbound last year actually lost coverage of the drug in 2025.\n\nWhile the same report found Wegovy coverage is improving, many people still don\u2019t have insurance coverage for it.\n\nThe number of people who need obesity drugs coupled with their price has made it difficult for health insurance plans to cover them. For example, in North Carolina, the state health plan decided not to cover the drugs because it would have to increase monthly premiums for everyone by about $50 a month to do it.\n\nRicks says the LillyDirect model is \u201cnot a panacea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think actually a better way would be to have the normal health care system. Doctors and patients connect and then use the insurance they\u2019ve already paid the premium on to reimburse them for a chronic disease like obesity. That\u2019s not working perfectly right now. Here, we\u2019ll do what we can.\u201d\n\nStill, the company is not losing money on the discounted vials, Ricks says.\n\nZepbound brought in almost $5 billion in revenue last year, according to recent company data.\n\n\u201cThis is not a question of is Eli Lilly going to make enough money to recoup investment on the drug? They absolutely will,\u201d says Dr. Ben Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nRome, an internist, says he talks with patients about these medicines every week. But he says most Americans won\u2019t be able to afford even the discounted Zepbound vials.\n\n\u201cRemember Americans are already spending thousands of dollars a year on health care. So to say, well there is this medicine available but you have to pay for it out of pocket, it really serves a small percentage of the population.\u201d\n\nMost Americans \u201ccannot afford $500 or $600 per month,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not surprising to see Novo Nordisk jump in with a similar direct-to-consumer discount strategy as Lilly\u2019s. \u201cObviously, the two companies are competing to sell their products to people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 out of every 5 American adults have obesity.\n\nIn the coverage void, many patients have turned to telehealth and compounding pharmacies to get weight-loss drugs like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s drug Wegovy. Compounders are allowed to make alternatives that aren\u2019t generics during drug shortages \u2013 and their prices tend to be well below list price.\n\nBut not all businesses selling those alternatives are licensed and following rules to keep their products safe.\n\nAnd now that the Zepbound shortage is over, the compounding is expected to stop.\n\nRicks says the company is pushing to expand health insurance coverage.\n\nOne thing Eli Lilly could do, says Rome, is give insurers the option of covering the cheaper Zepbound vials, so they can be more affordable to health plans and patients don\u2019t have to pay for them out of pocket.\n\n\u201cWe will see if Eli Lilly and Novo [Nordisk] come to the table and want to make these widely available, or if they\u2019re going to prioritize high prices and short-term profits over widespread access to the treatments,\u201d he says.",

Image credit: Shutterstock/ KK Stock.\n\nNovo Nordisk is introducing a direct-to-patient delivery option for its flagship weight loss drug Wegovy (semaglutide), slashing the price of the drug for cash-paying patients without insurance coverage.\n\nThe Danish drugmaker has launched a new online pharmacy called NovoCare Pharmacy to cut out the middlemen it so frequently opposes.\n\nNovo is slashing the cost for all doses of its glucagon-like peptide-receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to $499 per month, a hefty discount to the current list price of $1,349.\n\nNovoCare Pharmacy will work with CenterWell Pharmacy to give patients prescribed Wegovy an option to have the medication shipped directly to their home. Novo\u2019s executive vice president of US operations and global business development Dave Moore said over 55 million people in the US have coverage for weight management medicines, commenting that the vast majority of Wegovy-insured patients pay $0 to $25 a month.\n\nAlong with home delivery, the online platform also aids patients with benefit verification, refill reminders, and access to live support. The current savings model for Wegovy via NovoCare will also be updated in the near future for patients who use traditional retail pharmacies, Novo stated.\n\nMoore said that the new option \u201cprovides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen\u201d.\n\nThe launch of NovoCare is a direct counter to fend off the boom in popularity of compounding pharmacies. Many patients seeking GLP-1RAs turned to compound pharmacies as demand for drugs far outpaced supply, leading to shortages.\n\nNovo has been vocal in highlighting the safety risks of compounded semaglutide, pointing to the fact the drugs are not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated.\n\nFDA-approved drugs can be compounded under certain conditions such as if the original approved drug is in shortage and unavailable. Compounding pharmacies still follow a strict set of regulations and standards.\n\nCompounders offer their versions of semaglutide at a cheaper price than Wegovy and, with many sellers operating online, found a way to cater to patient needs through home-delivery options.\n\n\u201cNovoCare Pharmacy offers patients access to authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy, helping to avoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace, as warned by respected organizations, experts in the medical community, and the FDA,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBy cutting the price of its flagship product and offering a direct channel to patients, Novo has followed suit of its obesity market rival Eli Lilly. Lilly last week cut the price of higher-dose vials of weight loss drug Zepbound (tirzepatide) by nearly 23% for self-paying patients through its online pharmacy LillyDirect.\n\nMarket pressures from the compounding sector will soon alleviate for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, however. With the shortages for semaglutide and tirzepatide now over, compounders are no longer permitted to make their own versions of the weight loss drugs. Some pharmacies have filed a lawsuit against the FDA however claiming that the shortage still persists.",

CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen cautioned that the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports could drive up drug prices and disrupt supply chains. With new 25% tariffs already in place on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, the pharmaceutical giant faces rising costs, especially for generics that rely on overseas ingredients. If these tariffs expand to Europe, Novo may be forced to raise prices or rethink its sourcing strategyboth moves that could have ripple effects on its bottom line.\n\nAt the same time, Novo is stepping into a legal showdown over the FDA's decision to end the semaglutide shortage, a move that impacts Ozempic and Wegovy. A federal judge just granted the company permission to intervene in a case challenging the FDA's decision to end the shortage status of semaglutide, the key ingredient in both drugs. With compounding pharmacies forced to stop producing alternative versions, Novo is defending its exclusivity in a battle that could determine the future availability of lower-cost alternatives. A similar fight is playing out with Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) tirzepatide, signaling broader tensions between regulators, pharmaceutical giants, and compounding pharmacies.\n\nFor investors, the stakes are high. If tariffs take a bite out of margins, Novo could face pricing pressure just as demand for its weight-loss and diabetes treatments soars. On the flip side, if the court ruling swings in Novo's favor, it locks in its dominance over semaglutide, reinforcing its competitive moat. Either way, the next few months will be a critical test for the pharma giant as it navigates trade headwinds and regulatory scrutiny in a fast-evolving landscape.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tina Teng\n\nNovo Nordisk announced launching a direct-to-patient online pharmacy NovoCare, offering a more than half-price cut for its weight-loss treatment Wegovy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEurope\u2019s largest pharmaceutical firm, Novo Nordisk, has announced that it will offer its most popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, for less than half of its listed price. This follows a similar move by its biggest US rival, Eli Lilly, last week, intensifying the competition in the obesity drug market.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s shares rose by 3.8% in US markets following the announcement, while Eli Lilly\u2019s stock gained 2% after an initial drop of 0.7% on Wednesday. However, the Danish pharmaceutical firm\u2019s shares have continued to underperform, rising only 4.2% this year in contrast to a 19% rally for Eli Lilly.\n\nA price battle\n\nUnder US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policy, compounding pharmacies are permitted to sell copies of drugs when those medications are in short supply. This has allowed smaller telehealth rivals, such as Hims & Hers Health, to offer cheaper versions of obesity medication through compounding pharmacies.\n\nHowever, the FDA recently declared that shortages of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy had ended. As a result, the availability of lower-cost, compounded weight-loss drugs at these pharmacies will soon diminish, forcing patients to purchase the medications elsewhere. Both Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy cost over $1,300 per month before insurance and other rebates at retail prices. Many consumers have complained that these expensive GLP-1 drugs are unaffordable, particularly as at least half of large employers in the US do not provide insurance coverage for them. Regulators have also urged major pharmaceutical firms to lower their prices.\n\nIn response, Eli Lilly reduced the monthly price of lower-dosage vials of Zepbound by $50 for cash-paying consumers through its LillyDirect online store. Patients can now purchase a monthly supply of 2.5 mg vials for $348 and 5 mg vials for $499. Novo Nordisk followed suit, offering cash-paying customers a reduced price of $499 per month through its direct-to-patient online pharmacy, NovoCare.\n\nNovo Nordisk stated: \u201cWhile 90% of patients taking Wegovy have a co-pay of $0 to $25 per month, this offer was designed to support cash-paying patients without insurance coverage. Amidst the dangers of fake or illegitimate compounded semaglutide, NovoCare Pharmacy offers reliable access to authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy in our once-weekly, single-dose pen.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has authorised a transition period for compounded versions of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro. Compounded semaglutide, sold under Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic, has a slightly longer transition period before sales cease on 22 April.\n\nDave Moore, executive vice president of US operations and global business development, commented: \u201cNovo Nordisk continues to advance solutions for patients that improve affordability and access to our medicines, whether they have insurance or not. Today, over 55 million people in the US have coverage specifically for weight management medicines, and 90% of Wegovy patients with coverage pay $0 to $25 a month for Wegovy.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk expects slower growth in 2025\n\nNovo Nordisk exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations in its fourth-quarter earnings but provided a cautious outlook for 2025, as the pharmaceutical giant faces growing competition from its largest rival, Eli Lilly. Novo Nordisk has heavily invested in research and development, as the patent for its blockbuster drug Wegovy is set to expire in the early 2030s.\n\nA recent trial of its next-generation obesity treatment, amycretin, showed positive results, temporarily lifting its share price in January. However, investors will continue scrutinising the company\u2019s profit margins, which declined in the fourth quarter amid price cuts and rising expenditure.",

Following the removal of these drugs from the FDA shortage list, the compounders trade group Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) filed lawsuits in an attempt to continue making the lucrative drugs.\n\nNow, Novo has followed Lilly in inserting itself in the nuanced legal situation just as a U.S. federal judge denies an injunction that would have given the OFA permission to continue making copies of Zepbound, Reuters reported.\n\nJudge Mark T. Pittman of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled on Wednesday that Novo Nordisk can intervene in the case brought against the FDA by OFA in response to the removal of Wegovy from the agency\u2019s shortage list, multiple outlets reported. This decision comes two months after a court granted Lilly similar permission for a separate lawsuit the OFA filed following Zepbound\u2019s removal from the FDA\u2019s shortage list and the same day that it sided with Lilly in denying an OFA injunction.\n\nIn the OFA\u2019s most recent lawsuit , the trade organization calls the FDA\u2019s decision \u201creckless and arbitrary decision,\u201d contending that it will deprive patients of vital treatments for type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and other serious medical conditions.\n\nPittman originally denied Novo\u2019s request to get involved in the case, ruling it premature, but reversed its decision Wednesday after the Danish pharma filed a renewed motion. With Wegovy and Ozempic far and away its top selling products\u2014over $8 billion in 2024 sales for the former and $16.9 billion for the latter\u2014Novo has substantial interest in ensuring the FDA comes out ahead in this lawsuit, effectively prohibiting compounders from making knock-off copies.\n\nWhen the agency declares a drug in shortage, Congress determined a doctor, pharmacist or licensed outsourcing facility is allowed to compound the drug appropriate to patient needs. With semaglutide no longer in that status, compounding pharmacies are no longer legally approved to make their own versions of the drug. According to the lawsuit, since the FDA placed semaglutide on the shortage list in 2022, patient demand has been satisfied thanks to pharmacies and outsourcing facilities.\n\nThe latest lawsuit closely mirrors the one filed by the OFA in October 2024 when the FDA ended the shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s GLP-1 + GIP combo, tirzepatide. The agency confirmed in December that tirzepatide was no longer in shortage status and gave compounders 90 days to cease production of their copycats. Lilly was eventually approved to intervene in that fight, which is before the same federal court.\n\nThe OFA has since filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA was making a decision applicable to the entire compounding industry, which would constitute as a rule. It is not clear at this time whether this is the injunction that was denied on Wednesday. Rulemaking for the agency comes with strict requirements including engaging the public with a notice-and-coment period, per the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPrior to the overturning of Chevron deference last year, questions have swirled about the FDA\u2019s protocols for managing the drug shortage list. With pressures from parties like the OFA, the agency could face challenges in regulating the drug supply chain through this mechanism. The GLP-1 weight loss space is a particularly thorny area, with a thriving shadow market of not just compounders but research peptide makers all cashing in on the insatiable demand that originally sent Wegovy and Zepbound to the FDA\u2019s shortage list.\n\nEditor\u2019s note (March 6): This story has been udpated to include news of the court\u2019s Wednesday ruling in the case involving Eli Lilly.\n\n",

That's at a steep discount to the list price \u2014 which doesn't take into account insurance, rebates or discounts \u2014 of $1,349 for a 28-day supply.\n\nThe news was a blow to Hims stock, which tumbled as much as 7.6%. But shares managed to claw back and close with a 1.1% gain at 40.94. The Food and Drug Administration recently determined the active ingredient behind Wegovy, semaglutide, is no longer in shortage. This means Hims & Hers will soon have to stop selling lower-cost versions of the same dosages Novo sells.\n\nHims has said it plans to focus on personalized semaglutide doses. But the price cut for Wegovy could sway some patients to buy from the original manufacturer. Novo reiterated safety concerns with \"fake or illegitimate\" compounded semaglutide in its news release.\n\n\"NovoCare Pharmacy offers reliable access to authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy in our once-weekly, single-dose pen,\" the company said.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk popped 3.8%, closing at 90.85.\n\nNovo Nordisk Follows Lilly's Trail\n\nNovo Nordisk is following in the footsteps of Eli Lilly (LLY) which, last year, launched its own direct-to-consumer platform called LillyDirect. LillyDirect sells treatments for obesity, diabetes and migraines.\n\nNovoCare will focus on uninsured patients and patients with commercial insurance who don't have coverage for weight-loss drugs. The company notes it now has the capacity to meet or exceed \"both current and projected U.S. demand.\"\n\nDemand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed in recent years. According to MarketsandMarkets, the obesity treatments space was worth $37.4 billion in 2023 and $47.4 billion in 2024. By 2032, it will soar nearly tenfold to $471.1 billion.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are projected to be big participants in that market \u2014 but not the only ones. In 2030, the latest year for which FactSet has estimates, Wegovy is expected to bring in nearly $23 billion in sales. Zepbound, Lilly's obesity drug, is forecast to generate $22.7 billion in sales.\n\nAnalysts expect the first sales from Viking Therapeutics' (VKTX) obesity drug to come online in 2028 with $241.1 million, growing to $704.2 million and $1.35 billion in 2029 and 2030, respectively. In the same three years, Amgen's (AMGN) MariTide is projected to generate a respective $43.3 million, $999 million and $2.47 billion.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBiohaven Slumps, Again, As Bipolar Setback Outweighs A $4 Billion Opportunity\n\nIllumina Recoups Losses After China Retaliates Against Trump's Tariffs\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

This includes 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg dose strengths.

These home shipments are fulfilled by CenterWell Pharmacy. NovoCare also offers benefit verification, refill reminders and gives patients access to live support from a NovoCare case manager, according to the pharmaceutical giant.\n\nThe company said its offering came shortly after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that the shortage of this medication is resolved. All dose strengths of Wegovy meet or exceed both current and projected U.S. demand, according to the pharmaceutical giant.\n\nELI LILLY'S ZEPBOUND REDUCES TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK, STUDY SHOWS\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, the company limited the supply of certain dose strengths to wholesalers for distribution to retail pharmacies since May 2023, impacting sales.\n\nIn its latest fiscal quarter, Novo\u2019s revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations, but it forecast slower sales growth in 2025, partly due to increasing competition. Its rivals have also cut prices and expanded offerings to uninsured patients to boost demand as well.\n\nJust last week, Eli Lilly announced it is expanding the supply and cutting the costs of its weight-loss drug Zepbound, again, effectively broadening access to more patients without insurance with its own self-pay pharmacy.\n\nThe company, which has also seen a significant boost in profits from Zepbound and Mounjaro \u2014 essentially the same drug with different FDA-approved uses \u2014 announced that the new vials and pricing are exclusively available through LillyDirect Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThis isn't the first time Lilly has expanded the supply of its weight-loss drug and cut its cost to effectively compete in the highly lucrative market.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % LLY ELI LILLY & CO. 813.48 +11.83 +1.48% NVO NOVO NORDISK A/S 77.15 +1.20 +1.58%\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant announced in August it was offering 2.5 mg and 5 mg single-dose vials of tirzepatide for the first time in response to growing demand. At the time, Lilly said the doses were also \"priced at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of all other incretin (GLP-1) medicines for obesity.\"",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk said Wednesday it will sell Wegovy for $499 a month in cash to patients who can\u2019t get the blockbuster weight-loss drug through insurance, a bid to reach consumers who can\u2019t afford the $1,349 list price. The Danish drugmaker is launching a pharmacy operation that will provide the prescription medication at all doses directly to patients who lack insurance or whose health plan doesn\u2019t cover obesity medications. The move comes less than two weeks after the Food and Drug Administration declared an end to the shortage of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy as well as diabetes drug Ozempic.\n\nThe FDA had listed semaglutide in shortage for more than two years as Novo Nordisk struggled to meet the seemingly bottomless demand for its appetite-suppressing drugs. Under government rules, the listing allowed compounding pharmacies to make their own, cheaper versions and spawned an alternative marketplace for off-brand weight-loss drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Novo Nordisk and rival Eli Lilly are seeking to capture the large market of consumers who purchased compounded weight-loss drugs to get lower prices.\n\nDavid Kim, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, said that the popularity of compounded weight-loss drugs has shown how much demand there is for lower-cost options. The drugmakers, he said, \u201care kind of recruiting back patients who are on those compounded drugs.\u201d\n\nHe added that even with Novo Nordisk\u2019s latest discount, Wegovy\u2019s $6,000-a-year price tag would still only be within reach to relatively affluent consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s a welcome development that they actually lowered the out-of-pocket price, but it\u2019s still far from where it needs to be,\u201d he said.\n\nNovo Nordisk emphasized increased access Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWith NovoCare Pharmacy, patients and prescribers alike have another option that provides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen,\u201d Dave Moore, an executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement, adding that most patients with insurance pay $25 or less a month for Wegovy. The statement also took aim at the versions made by compounding pharmacies, saying Novo Nordisk\u2019s discounted product will help \u201cavoid the significant risks that can be posed by the compounding marketplace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil now, Novo Nordisk had offered Wegovy at a discounted price of $650 a month to cash-paying patients. With the launch of its own pharmacy service, the company said it will also offer the $499-a-month price to those paying cash at traditional pharmacies \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s new offering follows a model that Eli Lilly launched last year, offering vials of its weight-loss drug Zepbound at a discount directly to consumers paying cash. Last week, Eli Lilly lowered the price of its starting dose to $349 a month and added two higher doses for $499 a month, though it hasn\u2019t made all doses of Zepbound available through the direct-pay program.\n\n\u201cWe have more than 100,000 people using the service today, and I expect it to expand dramatically from here,\u201d Dave Ricks, Eli Lilly\u2019s CEO, said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. \u201cBut that\u2019s not actually our goal. Our goal is actually to have coverage under the regular system. This is a workaround that we\u2019re providing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the company\u2019s profit margins on the vials, which have to be drawn by a syringe, are \u201cnot quite as good\u201d as those that come from its auto-injector pens, given costs associated with running a pharmacy such as shipping and pharmacists to fill prescriptions.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s stock price had risen about 4 percent in trading as of early afternoon Wednesday. Shares of Hims & Hers, a telehealth provider that last year began offering compounded semaglutide, have tumbled about 40 percent since the FDA said the shortage was over and told compounders to stop making copies of weight-loss drugs by May. Compounding pharmacies have sued the agency over its determination.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been under political pressure over the cost of its Wegovy and Ozempic. Melissa Barber, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University who led a study finding semaglutide could be profitably made for less than $5 a month, said Novo Nordisk is \u201ctrying to capture a number of people at their respective price points.\u201d Compared with what consumers in Germany and the Netherlands pay, she said, \u201cit\u2019s still a substantial markup.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September, the Senate Health Committee grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen over why Wegovy and Ozempic cost hundreds of dollars less per month in countries such as France, Canada and Germany. \u201cStop ripping us off,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), the committee chairman at the time, said at the hearing.\n\nJ\u00f8rgensen said at the Senate hearing the company didn\u2019t control the price that patients pay and blamed the complexity of the American health-care system. Studies like the one led by Barber, he said, don\u2019t take into account the expensive work of research and development, or building the manufacturing facilities necessary to churn out the drugs.",

The company\u2019s failure to meet the weight-loss target with CagriSema caused a huge setback. Intense rivalry in the obesity sector also threatens its market share. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market remain a woe.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Novo Nordisk beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Its diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\n\n\nIt has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments to ramp up production. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. Novo Nordisk is also pursuing other indications like liver fibrosis and MASH for semaglutide.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+19.2% vs. +6.6%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In fourth-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement.\n\n\n\nResults benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. Coca-Cola's all-weather strategy, combining marketing, innovation, and revenue growth management, supports its vision of a total beverage company and is expected to drive revenue growth in 2025.\n\n\n\nIt has provided an optimistic view for 2025. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Wells Fargo have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past six months (+42.2% vs. +25%). The company\u2019s efforts to strengthen risk management and compliance infrastructure continue to be the mainstay of its operational strategy, as seen by the resolution of ten regulatory consent orders since 2019.\n\n\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s progress on efficiency initiatives, such as branch and footprint reduction, will support expense reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to support its financials.\n\n\n\nYet, its loan growth is expected to be limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators\u2019 demands regarding operational risk management. This, along with lower origination, is expected to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term. Yet, its decent liquidity position will keep the capital distribution move sustainable in the long term.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)\n\n\n\nStar Group\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+26.6% vs. -44.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $451.79 million have seen first-quarter net income surged $19.9 million year over year to $32.9 million, driven by a $24.3 million favorable derivative movement, offsetting revenue declines and higher taxes.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA rose $2.8 million to $51.9 million, supported by acquisitions and margin expansion. Home heating oil and propane volumes grew 2.8% to 82.4 million gallons due to colder weather and acquisitions. Service and installation revenues rose 11.4% year over year to $88.6 million, enhancing stability.\n\n\n\nHowever, revenues fell 7.6% to $488.1 million as lower selling prices offset volume gains. The base business volume declined 4.7%, signaling organic weakness. Customer attrition hit 4.3%, with lower gross gains. Operating expenses rose 5.3% due to acquisitions, pressuring margins. Regulatory risks, pricing pressure and competition are challenging, while management remains cautious about distributions.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Star Group here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Moody's Corp.

The inquiry aims to determine whether the companies are using multiple device patents and proprietary designs to stifle competition and block alternative suppliers, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe commission is engaging with the local subsidiaries of both drugmakers as part of its initial probe, with further investigation expected to delve into the companies\u2019 business strategies. The focus is on whether the two companies\u2019 practices limit the entry of more affordable options into the South African market, per Bloomberg.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker, expressed its willingness to cooperate with authorities. In an emailed statement, the company affirmed that it adheres to all relevant laws and \u201cstrongly supports a competitive market.\u201d Novo Nordisk decided not to bid for South Africa\u2019s 2024 public tender for human insulin pens, instead opting to phase out the easier-to-use pens and offer an older vial-based insulin product, which requires patients to administer the drug via syringe. The company stated that the decision followed \u201cthorough discussion\u201d with the South African Department of Health and ensured sufficient insulin access through this method.\n\nRelated: FTC Seeks Delay in PBM Case Over Alleged Insulin Price Gouging\n\nDiabetes remains a significant health issue in South Africa, ranking as the leading underlying cause of death among women and straining public healthcare facilities. The discontinuation of insulin pens sparked protests last year, with hundreds marching to Novo Nordisk\u2019s Johannesburg headquarters to demand greater access to human insulin and lower prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanofi, which also opted out of the government\u2019s tender to supply insulin pens, left the government to procure a limited number of insulin analogue pens at a higher price, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Insulin analogue pens, which offer adjustable absorption rates, are generally more expensive than human insulin. MSF criticized the lack of bulk supply agreements, which could have provided broader access to the medication.\n\nThe Competition Commission\u2019s investigation will assess whether the drugmakers\u2019 actions contributed to inflated prices and restricted access to life-saving medication in a country already grappling with a high diabetes burden.\n\nSource: Bloomberg",

Levi, Esq. via email at [email protected] or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their \"REDEFINE 1\" trial, \"a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.\" The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo's targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo's stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on a late-hours market selloff. Cramer shared that he was \"tired of it [the selloff]. I'm tired because it just seems totally artificial. I mean someone comes in and blitzes the market in the last twenty minutes.\" He believes \"There's no reason to do that other than you wanna take it down. I don't know why, I've seen this periodically in my career. These are, what I regard as being, deliberate. Not manipulation, because that's too strong.\"\n\nThe selloffs are \"a deliberate attempt to send the market down because the market can't handle the level of selling,\" he added. He added that since \"buybacks stop at three thirty. So if you really want to get a good price you wouldn't just come there and jam it.\" Cramer posited that the selloff was done by \"someone who wants the market down. . . .You know, David, this is no sin to point it out. There are a lot of people, let's say someone wanted the market up. You know, they come in at the end of the quarter and take it up. Somebody wanted the market down. It made no sense to come in. This is the third day that they blitzed the close.\"\n\nWhen asked whether we'll ever find out who was behind the selloff, the CNBC TV show host stated: \"Well no, and you never will know.\" Cramer's co-host David Faber also wondered about the role of algorithmic trading in the markets. Cramer believes that such traders \"think they're going to make money. They're not doing it.\"\n\nThe conversation then shifted to the Magnificent 7 stocks which have been underperforming lately. According to Cramer:\n\n\"Yeah but Morgan Stanley's saying they're underweight in these big caps. But then again if you were actual weight in these big caps, you'd have thirty percent NASDAQ, you know and it would be mostly Mag 7. So to be underweight may not be as important. But this is what people are talking about.\"\n\nAnother topic that he frequently discusses on his show is Elon Musk and DOGE. On this front, while some judges might have granted government employees reprieve, Cramer believes that it can be short-lived. He shared:",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Novo Nordisk belongs, has gained 7.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Novo Nordisk is expected to post earnings of $0.96 per share, indicating a change of +15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.1%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.66 indicates a change of +21.3% from what Novo Nordisk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Novo Nordisk is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Novo Nordisk, the consensus sales estimate of $11.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.4%. The $49.41 billion and $57.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.4% and +15.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNovo Nordisk reported revenues of $12.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.9%. EPS of $0.91 for the same period compares with $0.71 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +9.64%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Novo Nordisk surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNovo Nordisk is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Novo Nordisk. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

Their motivational stories are a testament to the millions of adults that have been prescribed Ozempic\u00ae. Ozempic\u00ae is an injectable prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death) in adults with type 2 diabetes and known heart disease, and to reduce the risk of worsening kidney disease, kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease), and death due to cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\n\nNovo Nordisk Launches National \u201cMy Ozempic\u00ae Era\u201d Campaign Celebrating Stories of Inspirational Ozempic\u00ae Patients Novo Nordisk Launches National \u201cMy Ozempic\u00ae Era\u201d Campaign Celebrating Stories of Inspirational Ozempic\u00ae Patients\n\nExperience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/novo-nordisk/9318651-en-novo-nordisk-launches-national-my-ozempic-era-campaign\n\nAs part of the campaign, Novo Nordisk is working with award-winning musician, Michael Trotter Jr. of country duo, The War and Treaty, alongside his wife and musical partner Tanya, critically acclaimed chef, Franklin Becker, and entrepreneur and salon owner, Maria. Through this powerful campaign, each of them shares their type 2 diabetes journeys and how they hold themselves accountable when it comes to their health. Through their inspiring voices, the group reveals the struggles they faced with type 2 diabetes while pursuing their unique passions and provides intimate views of what life looks like in their \"Ozempic\u00ae Eras.\"\n\n\"As a child, I saw my father and several of my relatives struggle with type 2 diabetes,\" recalled Michael. \"When I was first diagnosed, I knew I had to handle my symptoms with a different mindset and get them under control, especially as Tanya and I embarked on our journey of making music together. Since starting Ozempic\u00ae, in addition to eating healthier and incorporating exercise into my routine, I've been able to lower my A1C and get back to the right rhythm for me, both in my work and my personal life. I am thankful for my Ozempic\u00ae Era.\"\n\nMichael, Franklin, and Maria are three of the more than 38 million adults in the U.S. who live with diabetes, specifically type 2, which 90-95% of people with diabetes have.1 The condition can affect overall health and well-being in more ways than one. Those who live with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and are more likely to experience a major cardiovascular event in their lifetime, such as stroke, heart attack, or death.2-3\n\n\"Navigating a type 2 diabetes diagnosis can be overwhelming, and even those who have lived with it for years can feel discouraged to keep up with their treatment plan,\" said Tivonnia (T.J.) Harvey, Head of U.S. Diabetes Therapeutic Area at Novo Nordisk. \"By spotlighting the real experiences of people like Michael, Franklin, and Maria, one goal of the 'My Ozempic\u00ae Era' campaign is to inspire the current generation of those with type 2 diabetes to seek a treatment option that lowers A1C levels, along with a healthy diet and regular exercise, to succeed in their next 'era' of diabetes management.\"\n\nTo learn more about the \"My Ozempic\u00ae Era\" campaign, type 2 diabetes, and Ozempic\u00ae, visit MyOzempicEra.com.\n\nMichael Trotter, Franklin Becker, and Maria are paid spokespeople for Novo Nordisk and are taking Ozempic\u00ae for type 2 diabetes.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nAbbVie is joining the industry\u2019s rush to develop new obesity medicines, announcing Monday a deal with Denmark-based Gubra to license a drug that could compete with experimental therapies being developed by Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Zealand Pharma.\n\nPer deal terms, AbbVie will pay Gubra $350 million up front and offer up to $1.9 billion in additional payments tied to the achievement of development and sales milestones. AbbVie will assume responsibility for development and commercialization.\n\nGubra is developing a type of drug called an amylin analog that regulates appetite and blood sugar levels. If successful, these drugs could be used as alternatives to or in combination with marketed drugs like Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to increase weight loss or reduce side effects.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly and Novo have a significant lead on the obesity field, as they market the only two blockbuster drugs proven in testing to result in double-digit percentage weight loss. But those GLP-1 drugs have drawbacks, including side effects like nausea and vomiting in many people who take the once-weekly shots. They also have high discontinuation rates due to those side effects as well as their costs.\n\nThose shortcomings, along with the draw of a market forecast to exceed $100 billion annually by the 2030s, have energized obesity drug research and dealmaking. Even companies like AbbVie and Amgen that don\u2019t have a long track record in metabolic drugs are getting involved.\n\nAbbVie found an attractive deal with Gubra, which is developing an agent it calls GUB014295 or GUBamy. The experimental drug has completed a Phase 1 dosing trial in men considered lean or overweight by body-mass index. Trial volunteers who received the highest dose lost an average of 3% of their body weight over six weeks.\n\nAn additional dosing trial is underway, with results from various parts of that study due to be available throughout 2025.\n\nAt this stage of development, Gubra\u2019s candidate is around a year and a half behind Zealand, which has an amylin-targeting drug in a Phase 2 trial due to read out in 2026, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNovo, meanwhile, already has Phase 3 data on its amylin drug cagrilintide, which was assessed in a trial alone and as part of a combination with Wegovy called CagriSema. Lilly has an amylin drug in Phase 2, and AstraZeneca and Metsera are developing similar agents.\n\nWhile the Gubra trial results so far suggest the drug is active, Agrawal added that it\u2019s \u201chard to know whether it\u2019s differentiated in any way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gubra developed its drug to be more stable than other amylin-targeting drugs, Agrawal wrote. Those drugs commonly undergo a chemical reaction called \u201cfibrillation\u201d that can reduce potency, raise the risk of side effects and affect quality.",

The company\u2019s shares were trading at $85.30 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $90.65 on Feb 28.\n\nA pharmaceutical sales rep holding a medicine pack, highlighting the drug candidate products.\n\nNVO engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products internationally. The Diabetes and Obesity care segment focuses on diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, and other emerging therapy areas. The Rare Disease segment offers products in the areas of rare blood disorders, rare endocrine disorders, and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe second largest biopharma company has been losing market share in the GLP-1 category drugs that cater to blood sugar control and obesity management. NVO\u2019s Wegovy & Ozempi have a market share of 45% compared to 60% a year and a half back. The higher efficacy of Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound is the reason why NVO has been losing market share. Both companies are in the race to develop generation 3 drugs and this will decide the dominance of these companies in the near future.\n\nAnother setback has been the lower efficacy of its Gen 3 drug, CagriSema. The efficacy at 20.4% was below the expected 25% target. However, this is still better than Eli Lilly\u2019s Wegovy which has an efficacy of 14.7%, giving NVO a competitive advantage over its peers. NVO is also set to re-run the trial over the next 1-2 years and attributes the lower impact of its previous trial on flexible dosage.\n\nNVO currently trades at ~29x its trailing 12-month earnings. This is a highly discounted level compared to its peer Eli Lilly which is available at ~79x its trailing EPS. The worst-case scenario would imply flat sales for 2026-2030 with zero sales for CagriSema and a DCF value of $70/share or 20% lower than its current price. However, the drug offers better efficacy and high single-digit growth in sales appears a more reasonable estimate providing a $110 price per share or 20% upside. A more optimistic scenario would generate double-digit growth in sales or a fair price of $160 which is 80% higher than its current price.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "Big Pharma Is Still Alive\n\nThe last few years have seen the healthcare sector change radically thanks to biotech innovation. The most visible part was mRNA vaccines, but the arrival of gene therapies, cheap genome sequencing, or stem cell therapies are all there to usher in a new era of medical marvels (you can follow the links for deeper coverage of these topics).\n\nMost of these innovations have been done by smaller companies, and R&D efforts by the biggest pharmaceutical companies have often been not very successful .\n\nNevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is still dominated by a few giant corporations. Such blue-chip multi-billion dollar companies are not only the historically dominant players but might as well stay on top for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is that? How is it that even radical innovation might not threaten incumbent companies?\n\nThe Big Pharma Business Model\n\nTo understand how \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can stay on top, we can look at the example of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe innovation itself was very much invented by BioNTech, which took an actually quite old scientific concept and turned it into an entire technology platform.\n\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it was the perfect time for such a \u201cprogrammable\u201d vaccine to shine. And it did. But BioNTech did not commercialize it themselves. They partnered with Pfizer to handle approval, production, and commercialization quickly. After all, rival Moderna and countless other companies were pushing for their own COVID-19 vaccine, so time was of the essence.\n\nSimply put, Pfizer brought to BioNTech needed resources in manufacturing, funding, distribution, sales network, clinical trials, handling of regulators, etc\u2026\n\nInnovation vs Acquisitions\n\nAnother way for Big Pharma to stay relevant is simply to buy out successful biotech companies.\n\nBiotechnology is a field littered with failed projects and companies. So when one turns out successful, both founder and investors might want to cash out after 10-15 years of patience, hard work, and a bit of luck.\n\nAnd who could be more qualified than Big Pharma firms, able also to take the innovative drugs and bring them forth to their network of tens of thousands of doctors at once?\n\nThey also have the needed financial firepower. For example, with $512B of market capitalization, Johnson & Johnson, the largest pharmaceutical company in 2021 by revenues , registered a net income of almost $18B and a free cash flow of $17B.\n\nMany biotech firms, astonishingly from a scientific and innovation point of view, often trade below a billion dollars. So, if you look at the yearly free cash flow of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, this is a lot of dry powder for acquisitions.\n\nTop 5 Blue Chip Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nTo qualify as a \u201cblue chip,\u201d we consider only the top 20 companies according to their 2021 revenues .\n\nThe term \u201ctop\u201d is rather subjective, as is here a mix of existing drug portfolio, historical performance, R&D pipeline, and financial position. We will highlight some of the central parts of the business and incoming important innovations instead of going deep into the entire therapeutics portfolio or the company's financial results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $ 1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences.\n\nOncology.\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe company has grown sales by 6% yearly in the last 20 years, with a 13.2% return to shareholders in the last 10 years. The stock is also one of the rare \u201cdividend aristocrats,\u201d having rising dividends every year for 60 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, Johnson & Johnson is a very safe bet on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on long-term holdings and the stock price compounding while also giving a moderate but stable and growing dividend.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nThe Danish company is highly focused on diabetes & metabolic diseases like obesity, together making 88% of the company's revenues.\n\nThe focus on obesity is rather recent, with significant growth in this segment in 2022\n\nThe company is also working on an expanding rare disease portfolio and chronic diseases like kidney or liver pathologies.\n\nThe company is well-placed to benefit from the worldwide rise of chronic metabolic diseases. This should provide very safe revenue streams and continuous growth in the short term.\n\nA key vulnerability for Novo Nordisk in the long term is the possibility of permanently curing diabetes through stem cells, gene editing, or another new therapeutic method. This is something we have discussed previously when covering Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics. This is more likely to happen soon for type-1 diabetes, with type-2, the most common, much more likely to be still treated by reducing symptoms for a longer period of time.\n\nSo Novo Nordisk provides a safe place for conservative investors, but they will want to monitor tightly the development of the diabetes market and the arrival of potential competitors. The entry of Novo Nordisk into new segments like chronic diseases and obesity might be the right option to sustain the company in the long run.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon .\n\nSo far, some of the consequently lost revenues have been compensated by the pandemic-boosted sales of the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nThe company is mostly active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nThe new start product of Merck is Keytruda, a cancer drug (monoclonal antibody), with sales growing 16%-27% over the last 3 years. It is already approved for multiple cancers and has 13 new applications under review in phase 3 of clinical trials.\n\nThe company's revenues and earnings have grown significantly in the last 3 years, especially in 2022.\n\nThis financial success should persist until 2028, when Keytruda loses its patent protection. So, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company can reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nBut Pfizer is not just mRNA vaccines, with a total of 10 products with more than $1B of sales per year.\n\nThe company is targeting new product launches: 4 in 2023 and up to 12 by 2024.\n\nIts' management is keen to insist that the growth story is not Covid-dependent, with plans to bring non-Covid sales from the current average of $50B to $84B by 2030.\n\nThey also insist that the windfall profits from the pandemic will \u201callow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation\u201d\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybean, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nBayer's valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of RounUp to cause cancer.\n\nSince then, the company's valuation has fallen to less than what it paid for acquiring Monsanto. This has been a distraction from its solid performance in the seeds, other pesticides, and healthcare segments.",

They are also vital to us whenever our bodies suffer from injuries, diseases, or other medical issues.\n\nIt is also a sector driven by innovation and precious IPs, where thriving for new and improved products is a matter of not just growth but survival.\n\nIn this article, we wanted to give an overview of the sector with a wide array of profiles, including:\n\nBlue chip companies are large dominant players that are not going anywhere.\n\nSpecialized manufacturers of medical devices.\n\nInnovative startups developing revolutionary technologies.\n\nBest 10 Healthcare Stocks\n\n(Companies are ordered by market capitalization at the time of writing of this article)\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nNovo Nordisk is a leader in diabetes therapies, representing 79% of its current revenues.\n\nIt is also expanding quickly into the growing segment of obesity treatment with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable weight-loss medicine.\n\nWhile still just 9% of Novo Nordisk's total revenues, the obesity segment has grown astonishingly at 84% year-to-year.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times.\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes. So, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed this market in more detail in our article \u201cTop Companies In Obesity Treatments.\u201d\n\nStryker Corporation SYK -0.05% )\n\nStryker is a leader in medical devices, present in virtually every well-equipped hospital or clinic on Earth, treating up to 130 million patients annually.\n\nThe largest segments are traumatology, endoscopy, and instruments, but overall, the company lines of business are very diversified. Each segment includes many niche products for specific types of surgery or pathology, all under the Stryker brand umbrella and sharing the same commercial infrastructure.\n\nStryker is growing steadily, thanks to a mix of innovation, supported by a $1.45B R&D budget and serial acquisition of smaller medical device manufacturers.\n\nWith a strong presence in endoscopy, surgery, and orthopedics, Stryker is likely to benefit from the trend of the population aging.\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG -4.13% )\n\nIntuitive is the company that made the idea of robotic surgery a quickly expanding trend in hospitals all over the world.\n\nIts 1,200 Da Vinci robots have performed a total of 12 million surgeries to date, of which 1.8 million in 2022. The installed base grew by 12% year-to-year, and the procedures grew by 26% year-to-year.\n\nThe company is now developing more robots for specific medical needs, like Ion, a bronchoscopy platform for minimally invasive lung biopsy. It is also seeking approval for its existing robots to be allowed for more surgery types and in more countries.\n\nThe base of experienced users and the reputation of the company among surgeons form a strong investing moat. Investors will want to properly assess the value of that moat, as Intuitive's stock has been both growing quickly and staying at very high valuation multiples.\n\n(we covered the robotic surgery market in more detail in our article \u201cTop 5 Robotic Surgery Stocks.\u201d\n\nBayer is equal part an agriculture company and part a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies.\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business.

ARMP +4.23% )\n\nArmata is working on replacing chemical antibiotics with \u201cliving antibiotics\u201d called bacteriophages. They are viruses that exclusively target bacteria and could evolve in tandem with the bacteria, removing the risk of them developing a resistance like antibiotic therapies.\n\nThe majority owns the company and is financially supported by biotech royalty company Innoviva.\n\nArmata is currently focused on developing treatments for antibiotics-resistant pulmonary infections, with phase 2 of two different clinical trials expected to end in 2024.\n\nArmata addresses a segment of healthcare, antibiotic resistance that has long been neglected but is of growing concern for the medical profession. Antibiotic resistance is killing no less than 1.27 million people yearly worldwide. So investors in this company will rely on Innoviva's backing and the growing demand for treatment against so-called \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about Innoviva and Armata in our articles \u201cInnoviva: The New Model Of Royalty Biotech Companies\u201d and \u201cCreating Living Antibiotics: BiomX vs Armata.\u201d\n\n10x Genomics, Inc. TXG -8.94% )\n\nThe company was founded in 2012. Among its founders is Serge Saxonov, the director of R&D of the personalized genome testing company 23andMe.\n\nThis company is working on creating an entirely new field of science called \u201cSpatial Biology.\u201d\n\nInstead of looking at the \u201cmix\u201d of molecules in a sample, spatial biology can determine where in a tissue or a single cell a molecule of interest, like a specific sequence of RNA, is located, either in 2D or 3D.\n\nThis will tell researchers how cells interact with each other, how defense mechanisms activate, how a cell reacts to contact with a virus, and so much more.\n\nYou can read in more detail the unique advantages of spatial biology in this FAQ by Nanostring.\n\nThe company is still at an early stage, even with thousands of machines already running in research institutes, spending a lot on R&D.\n\nOverall, 10x Genomics is likely to become really profitable only once spatial genomics gets commonly used in most research labs instead of being the most advanced technology available, as it is today. Another step of growth can be expected in the future when spatial genomics starts to be used for medical diagnostics.\n\nYou can read more about 10x Genomics and its closest competitor, Nanostring (NSTG), in our article \u201cSpatial Biology: Nanostring vs 10x Genomics\u201d.",

The new therapies are growing very quickly, having more than doubled revenues between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBMS also has more than 50 therapies in the early stage of clinical trials, of which half are in oncology.\n\nWith half of the 2020-2025 revenues expected to come from the new product portfolio, BMS has already achieved remarkable innovations and should strongly increase its operating margins.\n\nThe success is the commercialized new product portfolio is very encouraging, and BMS might be on the verge of a decade of explosive growth driven by its new product portfolio and its strong performance in all of its 4 core segments.\n\nInvestors will want to pay close attention to phase 3 of clinical trials and the continuing new product sales growth.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nNovo Nordisk's innovation has traditionally been razor-focused on diabetes, the core segment for the company. This is still true, with 10 clinical trials ongoing in the field .\n\nHowever, the major innovation of Novo Nordisk is in the obesity market, with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable medicine for weight loss initially used for diabetes.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times. The drug is proving so popular that a TikTok-induced mania even increased the shortage .\n\nThe company is also working on growth hormones and acquiring the connected medical device BIOCORP .\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes.\n\nSo, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed This market in more detail in our article \u201c Top Companies In Obesity Treatments .\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon . The company is currently most active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nAt its core, Merck is a technology company that goes beyond just pharmaceuticals. For example, it has a semiconductor offer (equally useful for many biotech equipment like DNA readers). It also controls Sigma Aldrich, a leading supplier of laboratory and testing materials and consumable s , which is part of the broader life science offering , which relies on 59 manufacturing sites and proposes 300,000 products.\n\nThe company has an ambitious R&D roadmap , with 1 new pharmaceutical launch every 1.5 years. This includes the potential of a new therapeutic method for cancer, relying on targeted DNA disruption.\n\nMerck combines steady cash flow from its industrial capacities (semiconductors and life sciences) with the potential of new blockbuster drugs in cancer and neurology.\n\nWith Merck's flagship drug, Keytruda, losing its patent protection in 2028, these innovations will be needed to keep the company's income growing.\n\nSo, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company has been able to reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nPfizer sees the pandemic windfall profits as leverage to expand with new products and to \u201c allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation . \u201d\n\nAmong these opportunities for the next 2 years are 4 vaccines, of which 3 are mRNA, one treatment for growth hormone deficiency, and two for inflammatory diseases. It also covers 7 new indications for existing drugs and 4 business development deals.\n\nIn the longer term, a lot more potential launches could also work in a large variety of applications. This includes a potential competitor on obesity to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, new vaccines, hemophilia therapies, and cancer treatments.\n\nPfizer is a company that has demonstrated with the pandemic its ability to cash in on innovation and taken a strong lead in the vaccine sector. Combined with its previously well-established lines of business in oncology and inflammatory disease, this should reassure investors of Pfizer's ability to keep bringing new therapies to the market.\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybeans, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nFar from a distraction, the agricultural segment of the company shares many R&D capacities and human resources with the pharmaceutical segment.\n\nHowever, Bayer's stock valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of the pesticide RoundUp to cause cancer.\n\nSo investors will want to assess if the pharmaceutical segment is at a deep discount due to these legal issues or if the risk is too high despite Bayer's other IPs and R&D pipeline quality.\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN +0.04% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoetin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010, among other protein and biological-based therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3 , with a strong predominance of inflammation and oncology for these most advanced clinical trials.\n\nAnother innovation is AMG 133, an obesity treatment that is hoped to be more powerful than the existing therapies. AMG 133\u2019s unique advantage would also be a long half-life, with a dosage every 4 weeks instead of the required weekly treatment of Wegovy .\n\nBecause it is only entering phase 2 of clinical trials and because the company focuses on a wide array of therapies, AMG 133 is less central to the investment thesis for Amgen. Still, a potential 5-20 billion dollar blockbuster drug could seriously boost the company's bottom line. So, with Wegovy showing the market is larger than expected, this is something investors in Amgen will want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe company also has a biosimilar department (the equivalent of generic drugs for biotech treatments), with 5 approved drugs and 3 drugs in the R&D pipeline .\n\nAmgen has historically been one of the most innovative pharmaceutical companies ever made, almost single-handedly creating the biotech sector. Its impressive R&D pipeline shows Amgen is determined to keep that reputation intact, including by venturing into new segments like the obesity market.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD -0.56% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology .\n\nAn emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases. Still, HIV represents by far the bulk of Gilead's current income.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer. Its R&D pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe R&D programs are overwhelmingly dominated by infectious diseases and oncology clinical trials, deepening Gilead's specialization, especially with 13 HIV-related clinical trials.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nThe company behind the Covid mRNA vaccine sold by Pfizer is now using the money made during the pandemic to expand its offer widely.\n\nIt is now developing mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. This makes it a leading company in the field of mRNA vaccines, with only its competitor Moderna ( MRNA ) developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech. You can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies .\u201d\n\nBioNTech is also working on various other therapeutic methods, including cell and gene therapies, antibodies, and chemical drugs.\n\nAs the great winner of true transformation innovation with the arrival of mRNA during the pandemic, BioNTech has a spotless image with investors, even if the current stock price cooled down from the pandemic highs.\n\nThe company's future will depend on expanding mRNA to replace many older vaccines and on mRNA capacity to be used for other applications, of which cancer is the most promising financially.\n\nThe other big winner of the pandemic and the mRNA vaccine technology, Moderna, is doubling down on the vaccine application of mRNA. It has no less than 32 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines, covering 14 pathogens like the RSV, Zika, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus .\n\nDespite the focus on vaccine application, Moderna also has some research programs regarding cancer application, cardiac regeneration, and rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis in partnership with the leader in this sector, Vertex.\n\nThis R&D frenzy is fueled by the revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a tripling of R&D spending in 2023 compared to 2020.\n\nModerna is also looking to use its available cash, $16.4B in Q1 2023, to acquire licenses from smaller biotech or directly acquire these companies. The focus seems to be on technology platforms, which include synthetic genome company OriCiro , metagenomics and AI gene discovery Metagenomi , and macrophage therapies Carisma Therapeutics .\n\nModerna is, for now, a mRNA company with strong prospects in infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases. In the long run, its collaboration with startups working on new biotech technologies could yield out-sized results, similar to how mRNA used to be just a theoretical concept for decades.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, March 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Call (800) 995-1212 now to see if our Wegovy lawyers may be able to help your family.\n\nThe weight loss drug Wegovy \u00ae has been linked to severe health complications, including stomach paralysis. If you experienced serious side effects, filing a Wegovy lawsuit may allow you to seek compensation for your injuries.\n\nSemaglutide in Wegovy Linked to Severe Risks\n\nWegovy is an injectable weight loss medication that contains semaglutide. By slowing the digestion process, users may feel fuller longer. If gastric emptying slows too much, however, serious health problems like stomach paralysis may occur.\n\nSemaglutide drugs are more likely to be associated with gastroparesis (stomach paralysis) and other gastrointestinal issues compared to other weight loss drug options, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOver 209 Wegovy users have reported developing gastrointestinal disorders \u2014 with 42 requiring hospitalization \u2014 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMany patients feel as if they weren\u2019t properly warned about these gastrointestinal risks when they took Wegovy, leading families nationwide to file lawsuits against Novo Nordick.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, we have more than 45 years of experience fighting for justice on behalf of our clients and holding negligent companies accountable for the harm they\u2019ve caused.\n\nCall (800) 995-1212 now to see if we may be able to help you pursue compensation from a Wegovy lawsuit.\n\nWegovy Side Effects\n\nPatients can only make informed decisions about their health when they\u2019re properly informed of the potential risks linked to their medications.

            "content": "When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stepped into the White House on Friday, he aimed to secure a critical mineral agreement and reaffirm US support against Russia. Instead, the meeting spiraled into chaos, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance delivering a scathing rebuke.\n\nThe fallout was immediate\u2014no deal was signed, no joint statement was issued, and Zelenskyy\u2019s delegation was abruptly dismissed. As global leaders reacted with shock, Trump doubled down, branding Zelenskyy \"disrespectful\" and questioning his commitment to peace.\n\nA fiery Oval Office clash\n\nThe high-stakes discussion quickly turned hostile:\n\nVance accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful, sparking a tense back-and-forth.\n\nTrump raised his voice, warning Zelenskyy, \"You\u2019re gambling with World War III.\"\n\nZelenskyy defended Ukraine\u2019s position, emphasizing Putin\u2019s history of broken ceasefires.\n\nTrump dismissed him outright, saying, \"You\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards.\"\n\nVance challenged Zelenskyy\u2019s gratitude, asking, \u201cHave you said \u2018thank you\u2019 once?\u201d\n\nAs tensions escalated, Trump abruptly ended the meeting, scrapping the scheduled joint press conference and ordering Zelenskyy\u2019s delegation to leave.\n\nTrump\u2019s post-meeting attack\n\nAfter the chaotic exchange, Trump took to Truth Social, declaring that Zelenskyy \u201cis not ready for peace\u201d and disrespected the US. He asserted that Ukraine must \"stop fighting\" and negotiate with Russia, implying that continued US support was not guaranteed.\n\nZelenskyy responds, world leaders react\n\nZelenskyy, after leaving the White House, posted a measured response on X, thanking the American people, Congress, and the presidency for their support.\n\nAn important visit to the United States.

In a post addressing the finance minister, Chadha wrote, \"Honourable FM Sitharaman, One request\u2014increase tenure of LTCG for equities to 2 years & make tax nil. Let STCG tax remain as it is.\"\n\nHe argued that the move would significantly benefit India in the long run by attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI) and risk capital for infrastructure and public sector enterprises, ultimately leading to job creation. \"We will gain immensely in long term in form of\u2014FDI, risk capital to fund our capex, more value for PSUs n ultimately jobs,\" he noted.\n\nHonourable FM @nsitharaman\n\n\n\nOne request-\n\n\n\n-increase tenure of LTCG for equities to 2 years & make tax nil\n\n\n\nLet STCG tax remain as it is.\n\n\n\nWe will gain immensely in long term in form of -\n\n\n\nFDI, risk capital to fund our capex, more value for PSUs n ultimately jobs.\n\n\n\nIn short run\u2026 \u2014 Gurmeet Chadha (@connectgurmeet) March 1, 2025\n\nChadha suggested that in the short term, the government could compensate for revenue loss by increasing the Securities Transaction Tax (STT). \"In short run higher STT will make up for revenue also,\" he added.\n\nHis remarks come amid growing criticism of India's capital gains tax policy. At the Business Standard Manthan Summit 2025, Helios Capital CIO Samir Arora called capital gains tax the \"biggest mistake\" of the government, particularly for foreign investors. He pointed out that FIIs have been aggressively selling Indian equities for five months, dumping stocks worth over \u20b91 trillion in the last couple of months alone.\n\nArora also noted that India collected about $10-11 billion in capital gains tax in FY23 but argued that waiving it could improve market sentiment and foreign investment. \"India should waive the capital gains tax to respect the markets and foreign investors,\" he said.\n\nConcerns over taxation and foreign investor sentiment have coincided with a sharp downturn in Indian markets. On Friday, the Sensex plunged 1,414 points (1.9%) to 73,198, while the Nifty fell 420 points (1.86%) to 22,124. The sell-off wiped out nearly \u20b99 lakh crore in market value, bringing the total market capitalization of BSE-listed firms down to \u20b9384.22 lakh crore.\n\n",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors who claim they were misled about the future of its experimental obesity treatment, CagriSema.\n\nHagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm's attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: [email protected]\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey under the title Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, alleges that the company and its key executives committed securities violations during the Phase 3 trial of CagriSema, known as REDEFINE-1.\n\nInvestors who acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022, and December 19, 2024, allege that the firm painted an overly optimistic picture of CagriSema's potential for achieving significant weight loss of at least 25%. According to the plaintiffs, Novo Nordisk relied on questionable data while glossing over issues with dosage tolerability.\n\nCentral to the lawsuit is the claim that the company's \"optimistic forecasts\" about CagriSema's effectiveness were unfounded. The suit also contends that the study's \"flexible protocol,\" which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, compromised the trial's ability to assess weight loss at the tested dosage accurately. This, the plaintiffs suggest, implies either unexpected tolerability issues that led patients to reduce their doses or a rushed patient selection process that included those not targeting the 25% weight loss goal.\n\nThe complaint points to Novo Nordisk's December 20, 2024, announcement of REDEFINE-1's preliminary results. The disclosure indicated that the trial used a flexible dosing protocol and revealed that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of CagriSema patients were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the comparator drugs.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Novo Nordisk's stock price plunged nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue that this drop highlights the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating investors' claims.\n\n\"We are thoroughly investigating these allegations to determine whether Novo Nordisk intentionally misrepresented trial details and masked significant issues with the drug's tolerability,\" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm's investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you'd like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Magnet will be entitled to certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with the total potentially exceeding $1.25 billion in value.\n\nIn exchange for its investment, Lilly will gain access to Magnet\u2019s proprietary TrueGlue discovery technology. According to Magnet\u2019s website, its platform makes use of \u201cstate-of-the-art screening technologies,\u201d alongside an extensive exclusive library, to systematically discover potential small-molecule drug candidates that can bridge a disease target and another protein.\n\nIn turn, these small molecules, which the biotech calls \u201cTrueGlues,\u201d can enable precise targeting and open up access to targets that have historically been difficult to reach, using the secondary protein connected by the TrueGlue as a path to targeting the disease-causing protein.\n\nThe partners will target oncology indications, according to Magnet\u2019s press release, \u201cspanning multiple diseases with unmet medical need.\u201d\n\nAlso under Friday\u2019s agreement, Magnet will be eligible for tiered royalties on global net sales of any product that results from the partnership.\n\nLilly is the latest Big Pharma to enter the molecular glue market. Last month, AbbVie bet up to $1.64 billion on the technology in a partnership with Neomorph targeting immunology and oncology indications. The California-based biotech is a popular partner in the space\u2014it also bagged a potential $1.46 billion contract with Novo Nordisk in February 2024, followed by a deal with Biogen for up to $1.45 billion in October 2024.\n\nAlso in October 2024, Novartis joined its fellow industry heavy hitters with a $150 million upfront payment to Monte Rosa Therapeutics, gaining access to the Boston biotech\u2019s molecular glue degraders targeting the VAV1 protein, a key player in T- and B-cell signaling. The partnership, which includes up to $2.1 billion in milestones, will focus on immune indications.\n\nPfizer and Takeda are likewise investing heavily in molecular glues, pumping up to $2.55 billion and $1.2 billion into their respective partnerships with Proxygen and Degron Therapeutics.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 28): This article has been updated from its original version to correct that the licensing deal between Eli Lilly and Magnet Biomedicine is worth $1.2 billion-plus, as opposed to $1.6 billion-plus.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk's phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \"REDEFINE-1.\" Defendants' statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants' statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk's expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema.\n\nHagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC. For more information, call Reed Kathrein at 844-916-0895 or email NVO@hbsslaw.com.\n\nAbout Hagens Berman\n\nHagens Berman is a global plaintiffs\u2019 rights complex litigation firm focusing on corporate accountability.

            "content": "After quite a crushing bull stampede in 2024, the stock price of weight loss drug star Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) has come down considerably. But I think that not only will the Wegovy maker recover, it'll zoom much higher in the coming years. Read on to find out why.\n\nWidened waistlines\n\nIf you could flag only one type of medication that's perfectly targeted to the huge U.S. market, it would be weight loss drugs.\n\nObesity is an American problem that's not getting better; according to research published in The Lancet medical journal and cited by U.S. News and World Report, the obesity rate here more than doubled in percentage terms from 1990 to 2022. In the former year, slightly over 21% of U.S. adults were obese. Thirty-two years later, that figure was nearly 44%.\n\nAnd that's just in the U.S. -- obesity affected more than 1 billion people worldwide in 2022. So it's no surprise to learn that analysts are expecting sales of weight loss drugs to balloon. In 2024, this tally exceeded $30 billion worldwide for the first time.\n\nAnd that's peanuts. In May of last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley adjusted its forecast for 2030 sales from $77 billion to at least $105 billion, and perhaps as much as $144 billion. At the very least, that's a potentially more than threefold increase in the space of barely over half a decade.\n\nStaying in the game\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (with its Zepbound) are the two reigning kings on the U.S. market these days. There will be more contenders; Viking Therapeutics, in particular, is in the later stages of developing a treatment that's performed well in trials.\n\nBut especially in big jurisdictions like the U.S. and the European Union, it takes time to get a medicine approved. Meanwhile, Wegovy has become the go-to drug for obesity treatment, and incumbency has power in the pharmaceutical world. Even if Novo Nordisk loses considerable share to a giant like Eli Lilly and/or an upstart, it should still have a significant piece of a rapidly enlarging pie.",

The Prize, awarded by the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, includes a DKK 2 million award. Of this, DKK 300,000 is a personal award, while DKK 1.7 million goes to support further research. Four researchers will also receive the New Investigator Award for their promising obesity research.\n\nThe EASO\u2013Novo Nordisk Foundation Obesity Prize for Excellence is awarded annually for outstanding research or technological contributions that can improve our understanding of obesity and its causes, complications, prevention and management. In 2025 the Prize goes to Professor Kirsi Pietil\u00e4inen, Professor of Clinical Metabolism at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\u201cIt is with great pleasure that we award Professor Pietil\u00e4inen this prestigious prize. Her groundbreaking research in identical twins with differences in BMI has significantly contributed to how we understand the metabolic effects and complications of acquired obesity,\u201d says Arne Astrup, Professor, MD, DMSc and Senior Vice President, Obesity and Nutritional Sciences at the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\n\u201cFor example, Professor Pietil\u00e4inen\u2019s innovative studies in identical twins have shown that when the mitochondria \u2013 the tiny energy-producing structures in our cells \u2013 do not function properly, especially in fat tissue, it can cause complications in obesity. We should also highlight Professor Pietil\u00e4inen\u2019s ability to encourage teamwork and talent, since she is not only a trailblazer but a great mentor and team leader.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Obesity Prize for Excellence, the EASO and the Novo Nordisk Foundation have also awarded four New Investigator Awards, each including a research grant of DKK 300,000.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Kirsi Pietil\u00e4inen, the Obesity Prize for Excellence recipient, and to the four New Investigator Award winners announced today,\u201d says EASO President, Professor Volkan Yumuk. \u201cWe are delighted to continue our partnership with the Novo Nordisk Foundation in supporting these research grants, which focus on groundbreaking advancements in obesity. We eagerly anticipate the recipients\u2019 presentations, and I look forward to participating in their official recognition sessions during the upcoming 32nd European Congress on Obesity in Malaga.\u201d\n\nObesity research: a lens for the study of life\n\nWith over 25 years of experience in obesity research and medicine and nearly 250 publications under her belt, Professor Kirsi Pietil\u00e4inen has made groundbreaking advancements in both the scientific understanding and clinical management of the disease of obesity. Additionally, she is a well-known public advocate for reducing stigma, translating compassionate obesity care into clinical practice and promoting medical training on obesity at the national and international levels.\n\n\u201cObesity is the most fascinating lens through which to study life \u2013 it spans everything from the micro level of cellular metabolism to the macro level of behaviour and society,\u201d says Professor Pietil\u00e4inen. \u201cObesity research has been full of surprising discoveries, such as when we found mitochondria playing a key role in adipose \u2013 body fat \u2013 tissue. Moving forward, we aim to dive deeper into the metabolic atlas of adipose tissue, exploring how obesity and different intervention methods reshape its function and interactions across the body. I am especially fascinated by how some interventions can simultaneously curb excessive appetite and boost a slowed metabolism \u2013 offering powerful mechanisms to support our patients.\u201d\n\nProfessor Pietil\u00e4inen\u2019s work earned her research group a place within the prestigious designation of Center of Excellence in research on Mitochondria, Metabolism and Disease (FinMIT) by the Research Council of Finland, the highest recognition for research in the country. Her recent findings on mitochondrial activation following weight-loss surgery have spurred ongoing international research to develop drugs that mimic the effect as a mechanism to increase energy combustion and cause weight loss.\n\nIn addition to her extensive, much-cited research on the metabolic effects of obesity and various weight-loss strategies, her work at the Healthy Weight Hub has offered valuable insights into digital coaching, patient-reported outcomes and long-term weight loss. She also uses unique Finnish registries to study the economic burden of obesity, including healthcare costs, treatment cost\u2013effectiveness and societal impacts.\n\nFour researchers receive New Investigator Awards\n\nBasic Science \u2013 Roksana Pirzgalska is a postdoctoral researcher at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal. She found that sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue drives leptin-induced lipolysis and identified the first functional neuroimmune component in adipose tissue: the sympathetic neuron-associated macrophages. The EASO\u2013Novo Nordisk Foundation award grant will help her to investigate the role of gut neuroepithelial circuits in intestinal immune responses and nutrient absorption, aiming to use neuronal cues to improve metabolic parameters and nutrient absorption in patients with metabolic diseases.\n\nChildhood Obesity \u2013 Veera Houttu, a Senior Researcher and a Clinical Nutritionist at the Nutrition and Food Research Center at the University of Turku, Finland, has a strong track record in research on nutrition and metabolic diseases and on translating clinical results to metabolic mechanisms. She studies psychological, behavioural and physiological mediated effects in early-life obesity and associated comorbidities through eating behaviour, dietary intake, sensory perceptions and physiological responses and how to translate these mechanisms into prevention and treatment.\n\nClinical Research \u2013 Rima Chakaroun, a clinician-scientist and internal medicine specialist in endocrinology at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany and the Wallenberg Laboratory, Gothenburg, Sweden, investigates a wide range of endocrine and metabolic disorders with a primary focus on obesity, microbiome, nutrition and sex-specific obesity trajectories. She contributes to multidisciplinary obesity programmes that provide comprehensive treatment plans, helps to coordinate a weight-management initiative and works closely with a dedicated team to support patients in making sustainable lifestyle changes. Her work also involves expanding research and integrating microbiome and nutrition-based interventions to improve patient outcomes.\n\nPublic Health \u2013 Maria Kafyra is a dietitian/nutritionist and postdoctoral researcher who has worked and studied in Greece, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Her work focuses on identifying obesity-related determinants of health and developing personalised interventions that address individual genetic differences in metabolism and treatment responses, aligning with the growing need for personalised healthcare strategies. She is currently working on the impact of excess weight on securing employment and the ability to conceive among Greek men and women aged 25\u201340 years with overweight or obesity.\n\nThe Prize and the Awards will be officially presented at the 32nd European Congress on Obesity (#ECO2025), 11\u201314 May 2025 in Malaga, Spain, where attendees will have an opportunity to hear an award lecture from the Obesity Prize for Excellence recipient and presentations from the New Investigator Award winners. Registration is available: https://eco2025.org.\n\nFor additional information regarding the criteria and application process for the Obesity Prize for Excellence and New Investigator Awards, please visit https://easo.org/about-easo/easo-nnf-prize-and-awards.\n\nFact box\n\nObesity: a growing epidemic\n\nObesity is a chronic and complex condition that impacts health and can lead to a wide range of diseases, including increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. Obesity is responsible for an estimated 5 million deaths worldwide each year.\n\nCurrently more than 1 billion adults are living with obesity, corresponding to one in eight people in the world \u2013 a figure that has more than doubled since 1990. It is estimated 1.9 billion people will live with obesity in 2035.\n\nThe prevalence of obesity is also rising among children: 2% of children aged 5\u201319 years were living with obesity in 1990, with this figure quadrupling to 8%, or 160 million, by 2022.\n\nAbout EASO\n\nEASO represents the European Obesity Community. The leading voice of obesity science, medicine and community in Europe, EASO represents scientists, obesity specialists, physicians, health care practitioners, and public health practitioners. Established in 1986, EASO is a federation of professional membership associations across 36 countries.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nDrug compounders aren\u2019t ready to give up their ability to produce off-brand versions of Novo Nordisk\u2019s weight-loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic without a fight.\n\nAn industry group sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the health regulator\u2019s Feb. 21 decision to remove semaglutide \u2013 the active ingredient in the two wildly popular GLP-1 medications \u2013 from its shortage list. The FDA also told compounding pharmacies they need to stop producing unbranded versions within the next 60 to 90 days.\n\nFiled Feb. 24 in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) claims that the FDA is \u201cdismissing evidence that the shortage persists\u201d and acted in a way that was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.\n\n\u201cThe FDA acted to benefit special interests, raise drug prices, and deprive much of the public access to a needed medicine,\u201d the 22-page complaint says.\n\n\u201cFDA provided no notice of the Delisting Action before it took legal effect. Market participants did not know before that moment that compounding activities they were currently undertaking in reliance on the listing would become unlawful,\u201d it says. \u201cFDA provided no opportunity for public comment on whether to delist semaglutide.\n\n\u201cBy foregoing the public notice-and-comment process, FDA deprived regulated parties and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on the proposed delisting of semaglutide and to provide probative information concerning the drug\u2019s availability. At the same time, FDA deprived itself of valuable information that would have been made available to it had the agency solicited public comment.\u201d\n\nCompounding demand\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to vacate the FDA\u2019s action of removing semaglutide from the shortage list. OFA also wants the FDA to be enjoined from taking action against drug compounders who lawfully produce semaglutude under circumstances when the drug has limited availability.\n\nA media representative for the FDA told NJBIZ the agency does not comment on litigation.\n\nUnder U.S. regulations, compounding pharmacies can make and sell large quantities of brand-name medicines only if they are in short supply. The FDA declared a shortage of semaglutide in 2022. After, pharmacies, telehealth companies and other health care providers have been able to manufacture copycat versions of Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1s therapies.\n\nInterest in compounded treatments has skyrocketed because consumers consider them a cheaper, and easier to access, alternative to the branded drugs. As a result, compounders are thriving from their ability to help meet demand.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it has invested $6.5 billion over the past year domestically to increase manufacturing capacity of Wegovy and Ozempic. The Danish drugmaker has its U.S. headquarters in Plainsboro. According to the pharma giant, facilities operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week to get the medicines to wholesalers.\n\n\u201cNovo Nordisk is deeply concerned about the proliferation of unapproved compounded \u2018semaglutide\u2019 and the risks they pose to patients. No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for these types of knockoff drugs that carry significant risks for health and wellbeing,\u201d a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk told NJBIZ.\n\n\u201cThis complaint is another transparent attempt by compounders to extend the time during which they claim they can sell unapproved knock-off \u2018semaglutide\u2019 products. We will be seeking to intervene in the case to oppose the relief sought by compounders,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nThis marks the second time OFA has pursued legal action against the FDA over compounded drugs. In October 2024, the group sued the agency over the removal of tirzepatide from the shortage list. Tirzepatide is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly\u2019s weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes medication Mounjaro.\n\nThe case is pending.\n\n\u2018Likely to be some sticker shock\u2019\n\nHowever, not all drug compounders seek to challenge the FDA over last week\u2019s decision.\n\nScott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding (APC), issued a statement saying, \u201cCompounding pharmacists have long known that this shortage had a shelf life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor three years \u2013 that\u2019s how long this wonder drug has been in shortage \u2013 they\u2019ve been compounding copies of semaglutide injection for patients at a time when Novo Nordisk could not meet the extraordinary demand. They\u2019ve been serving patients who\u2019d otherwise have no access to this medication. But they\u2019ve also known that eventually the shortage would be resolved, and they\u2019ve been prepping patients for months to expect that eventuality,\u201d he said.\n\nBrunner went on to say, \u201cI do question whether in resolving the shortage FDA has taken into account demand for the compounded drug \u2013 the number of patients who\u2019ll need to be transitioned from compounded version to FDA-approved version. That\u2019s likely hundreds of thousands of patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we can do now is watch what happens as patients hear this news and their providers and pharmacists work to get them a new prescription for the FDA-approved drug. There\u2019s likely to be some sticker shock for many, and whether they\u2019ll be able to continue to afford the therapy remains to be seen,\u201d he stated.\n\nA compounded version can cost significantly less than the brand name. Prices typically range between $199 and $399 per month depending on the provider, Reuters noted.\n\nBrunner also thanked the FDA for giving compounders an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to wind down production. He said it will help pharmacists and providers transition patients to the FDA-approved drug if it\u2019s available.\n\n\u201cThat period \u2013 60 days for traditional pharmacies, 90 days for outsourcing facilities \u2013 can help avoid an interruption of therapy for many patients,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to the agency for hearing us and granting that.\u201d\n\n\u2018No one should have to compromise their health\u2019\n\nAccording to the FDA, state-licensed pharmacies and physicians known as 503A compounders must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, designated as 503B\u2019s, have until May 22 to do the same.\n\nWhile the FDA confirmed Novo Nordisk\u2019s \u201cstated product availability and manufacturing capacity\u201d of the drugs meets or exceeds current and projected demand, the agency warned that \u201climited localized supply disruptions\u201d could occur as the products ship from factories to distributors to pharmacies.\n\nIn a statement, Novo Nordisk Executive Vice President of U.S. Operations and Global Business Development Dave Moore said, \u201cWe are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand. No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatient safety remains our top priority and, in line with our purpose to improve lives and health, we continue to partner, educate, and advocate for expanded, affordable access to our medicines for those who need and rely on them,\u201d he said.\n\nNovo Nordisk also noted that the company continues to \u201cinvest in new ways to help patients easily fill\u201d their Wegovy prescriptions \u2013 including a recently launched AI-powered app.\n\n\u201cFind My Meds is designed to help both new and existing patients locate available doses of Wegovy at nearby retail pharmacies. This is a valuable tool in instances when individuals may not be able to immediately fill their prescription for the dose they need at their preferred pharmacy, which is important for continuity of care and better health outcomes,\u201d the company said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated at 1:23 p.m. ET Feb. 26, 2025, to include a statement from Novo Nordisk.",

            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the shortage of Wegovy\u00ae (semaglutide) and Ozempic\u00ae (semaglutide) has been resolved.\n\nSemaglutide injection products have been in short supply since 2022 due to increased demand. During this time, compounded semaglutide became increasingly popular as an alternative option.\n\nIn May 2023, concerns about compounded semaglutide prompted an FDA response following reports of adverse events. The Agency clarified that a drug that is listed in short supply may be compounded if certain requirements are met; however the safety, efficacy or quality of the product could not be substantiated as it had not been put through a formal review.\n\n\u201c No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.\n\nNovo Nordisk responded to the use of compounded semaglutide by taking legal action against certain medical spas, weight loss/wellness clinics, and compounding pharmacies for unlawfully marketing and selling products claiming to contain semaglutide. The Company stated that the safety and effectiveness of compounded semaglutide products could not be validated as they did not contain the same active ingredients contained in the FDA-approved products.\n\nIn July 2024, the FDA issued another safety communication regarding compounded injectable semaglutide after receiving reports of dosing errors. According to the alert, patients were measuring and administering incorrect doses and health care providers were miscalculating doses. These errors resulted in various adverse events, with some leading to hospitalization.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,\u201d said Dave Moore, Executive Vice President, Novo Nordisk US. In a press release, Moore noted that the Company is \u201cmeeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FDA, to avoid disruption to patient treatment, state-licensed pharmacies and physician compounders will have until April 22, 2025 to stop compounding, distributing or dispensing non-FDA approved compounded semaglutide injection products; outsourcing facilities have until May 22, 2025. The FDA stated that it will take action if products violate safety or quality standards.\n\nOzempic is indicated as as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with T2D and established CV disease, and to reduce the sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, end-stage kidney disease, and CV death in adults with T2D and chronic kidney disease.\n\nWegovy is indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events in adults with established CV disease and either obesity or overweight; and to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity and in adults with overweight in the presence of at least 1 weight-related comorbid condition.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MPR",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe Stock Market Under Trump Admin\n\nWhile stocks initially fell based on worries regarding Trump tariffs on America\u2019s major trading partners, major indexes recovered from their initial losses as the President delayed tariffs on Mexico. He agreed to a 30-day pause on tariffs on Mexico and Canada in return for the two countries bolstering border enforcement to halt fentanyl smuggling and money laundering.\n\nReuters reported that Trump raising tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a flat 25% pushed up share prices of US steelmakers. The chaos around tariffs doesn\u2019t end here. According to CNN, the President is looking to pursue more tariffs. Trump has been keen on reciprocal tariffs and wants agencies to investigate plans for new reciprocal tariffs that would increase America\u2019s revenue. He reiterated this keenness saying:\n\n\u201cThey charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same\u201d\n\nThese tariffs are expected to hit developing countries, especially India, Brazil, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian and African countries, considering the large gap in tariff rates charged on US goods brought into these nations relative to what the United States charges them.\n\nOn February 14, the New York Times reported that global stock markets are holding up after Trump revealed his plan for reciprocal tariffs against all trading partners. While some countries such as Vietnam, India, and Taiwan have said that they would import specific US goods more, French winemakers are ramping up shipments to the country before levies. The threat of tariffs continues to result in uncertainty, regarding how they could be inflationary and potentially spook investors.\n\nSucharita Kodali, Retail Analyst at Forrester Research, appeared on CNBC to talk about the potential impact of tariffs on companies. In her opinion, all US companies would face some kind of challenges, with higher prices for both consumers as well as these firms. Based on her analysis, this is going to result in 20 basis points to a 150 basis points negative impact on the US GDP. Meanwhile, RBC\u2019s Tom Narayan previously told CNBC that auto stocks will be the hardest hit by Trump\u2019s Canada and Mexico tariffs, which are being deemed really inflationary and disruptive for the US auto consumer.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a stock screener to find stocks which had the highest average upside potential (at least 25%), as of February 24.

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nIn a Tuesday address to parliament, he added that the government plans to raise defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, noting \"the biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nMatt Dorset, equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said BAE Systems was likely the biggest beneficiary of the news with 26% of its sales originating in the U.K. He also named Qinetiq, Babcock and Chemring as names to watch.\n\nIn other corporate news, Novo Nordisk gained 3%. On Monday, American telehealth firm Hims & Hers said in its earnings call that it may stop selling compounded semaglutide \u2014 an alternative to weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nMedical devices manufacturer Smith & Nephew, meanwhile, gained 6% after the company reported a 4.7% year-on-year increase in revenue for 2024. It cited its \"transformative 12-point plan\" as driving the performance and said revenue growth for 2025 was expected to be around 5%.\n\nGermany's DAX index initially continued its upward trend on Tuesday following the result of the German federal election, though slipped in late deals to close 0.13% lower.\n\nThe conservative Christian Democratic Union and the allied Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) secured the largest share of votes in the election on Sunday, with the alliance's candidate Friedrich Merz set to take over from Olaf Scholz as chancellor of Europe's largest economy.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods \"will go forward,\" when a 30-day reprieve on the levies expires next week. The president also doubled down on his plans to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on America's trading partners.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets traded lower overnight after Wall Street fell Monday, as Trump tariffs stoked a risk-off mood.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 was trading in the red for a fourth day, taking a leg lower after the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey came in much weaker than economists' estimates.\n\nStoxx 600 ends the day slightly higher\n\nEuropean stock markets closed mixed on Tuesday, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX down 0.49% and 0.13% respectively, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.11%.\n\nThis year's momentum for the regional Stoxx 600 index has cooled over the last week, with the index provisionally closing just 0.13% higher after a 0.08% loss on Monday.\n\n\u2014 Jenni Reid\n\nUK defense spending increase will require 'sacrifices elsewhere': IFS\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to increase defense spending to 2.5% from 2.3% of GDP by 2027 will require tax hikes or spending cuts beyond the already-announced reduction in foreign aid, Ben Zaranko, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said in a note Tuesday.\n\n\"If the U.K. needs to spend more on defense on a structural and permanent basis, that is not something that can be sustainably borrowed for ... If defense spending needs to go higher than 2.5% of GDP, cuts to aid won't be enough,\" Zaranko said.\n\nZaranko also noted that it was currently unclear how the government produced its figure of a \u00a313 billion ($16.5 billion) annual increase in defense spending, when an extra 0.2% of GDP would total around \u00a36 billion, which would be covered by the cut to the aid budget.\n\nThe U.K.'s Labour government announced sweeping tax increases in October as it seeks to meet new fiscal rules ensuring day-to-day government spending is covered by income.\n\n\u2014 Jenni Reid\n\nS&P 500 opens flat Tuesday\n\nThe S&P 500 began Tuesday's trading session near the flatline.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 183 points, or 0.4%.

Other European defense firms that supply to the UK also rose following the announcement. Leonardo, the Italian-owned defense supplier, was up nearly 3%.\n\nSaab, a Swedish-owned company providing defense and security technology in Britain, was also up nearly 3%. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce added an almost 2% gain.\n\n\u2014 Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nPotential Trump tariffs 'definitely not good news,' Bundesbank chief says\n\nDeutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel on Tuesday told CNBC that potential tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on European countries would not be good news.\n\nNagel said he was concerned about how the U.S. government's policy may impact Europe and specifically Germany, noting that there would ultimately be \"losers on both sides of the pond.\"\n\n\"This is definitely not good news,\" he said. \"On a daily basis I have the impression it's a very erratic development,\" Nagel added.\n\nHe pointed out potential spill over effects tariffs could have on inflation developments as well as monetary policy decision making, saying that this is why he backed a meeting by meeting approach.\n\nMany economists regard tariffs as inflationary. Duties have not yet been imposed on imports from Europe to the U.S., but U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that they are on the horizon. Germany could be one of the countries most exposed to tariffs if they are implemented as exports are a key pillar for its economy.\n\n\u2014 Sophie Kiderlin\n\nUK pledges to spend \u00a313.4 billion more on defense every year from 2027\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that the country will spend \u00a313.4 billion ($17 million) more on defense every year from now until 2027, in an effort to boost national security.\n\nStarmer said he plans to raise defense spending to 2.5% of the U.K.'s GDP by 2027, noting that the changes will see the government \"begin the biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe prime minister also set out a plan to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP in the next parliament.

However, the company noted that tighter monetary policy \u2014 the Bank of Russia has held its key interest rate at 21% since October \u2014 led to a deceleration in its lending growth as the year progressed.\n\nVTB's 2024 result marked a continued financial recovery for the lender, topping the record profit it reported a year earlier. In 2022, VTB reported a 667.5 billion ruble loss after the lender was hit by international sanctions imposed in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nGerman export expectations improve but remain in negative territory, Ifo Institute says\n\nIn a report out Tuesday, Munich's Ifo Institute said that German businesses became slightly less pessimistic about foreign sales prospects in February, with the thinktank's Export Expectations indicator a rise to -5 points from -7.1 points a month earlier.\n\nDespite the slight uptick, Ifo noted that the figure has been in negative territory for almost two years, with \"only a few sectors\" \u2014 including furniture manufacturers, beverage makers and the autos sector \u2014 projecting international sales will pick up.\n\nGerman machinery manufacturers and the country's chemicals sector were expecting a slight decline in international sales, Ifo's data showed.\n\nThe data was derived from survey responses from around 2,100 firms.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nRyanair CEO predicts summer fare rise of up to 6%\n\nJohn Macdougall | Afp | Getty Images\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O'Leary on Tuesday said that the budget airline expects fares to be 4% to 6% higher this summer than in the same season of 2024, in comments cited by news agency Reuters.\n\nDublin-listed shares of the company were trading flat at 10:14 a.m. London time.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nSmith & Nephew\u2019s shares jump 8% after posting 5% jump in revenue\n\nSmith & Nephew shares jumped 8% at the open after the British medical technology company reported its full-year results.\n\nAnnual revenue rose to $5.8 billion in 2024, a 4.7% rise from the $5.5 billion reported in 2023, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Meanwhile, trading profit increased 8.2% to just over $1 billion in 2024, up from $970 million in 2023.\n\nThe company noted an improvement in demand for its U.S. hip implant and knee implant products which helped offset a decline in China. It's expecting underlying revenue growth of around 5% in 2025, compared to growth of 4.8% in 2024.\n\n\"We have been driving a three-year turnaround, we're two years into that turnaround, and we've been very pleased with the results.

            "content": "For decades, scientists believed that infections were determined solely by viruses and bacteria. But Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s groundbreaking research has revealed a more complex reality: genes play a fundamental role in determining who gets seriously ill and who stays healthy. Because of his pioneering discoveries, he is being honoured and awarded with the 2025 Novo Nordisk Prize.\n\nJean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s research, spanning more than three decades, has shown that rare or not-so-rare genetic mutations can make some individuals especially vulnerable to infections that others shrug off. \u201cWhy would a child be hospitalised for viral pneumonia, tuberculosis or any other severe infection when most children infected with the very same microbe do well? That is what I call the infection enigma,\u201d he explains.\n\nHis pioneering work has uncovered more than 70 genes that, when mutated, impair the body\u2019s ability to fight off specific infections. This research has not only deepened understanding of human immunity but also led to new possibilities for patient care \u2013 helping clinicians better predict, diagnose and treat infectious diseases based on individual genetic profiles.\n\nRecognising a landmark scientific contribution\n\nMads Krogsgaard Thomsen, CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, emphasises the significance of Jean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s contributions: \u201cHis work exemplifies the power of integrating clinical observation with genetic research. By uncovering the genetic basis of susceptibility to infections, Professor Casanova has opened new avenues for personalised medicine, offering hope for more effective treatments and preventive strategies.\u201d\n\nProfessor J\u00f8rgen Fr\u00f8ki\u00e6r, Chair of the Novo Nordisk Prize Committee, adds: \u201cJean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s research has transformed understanding of infectious diseases by revealing the critical role of genetic factors. His discoveries have provided new insight into why some individuals are more vulnerable to infections, paving the way for novel approaches in immunology and public health.\u201d\n\nFor Jean-Laurent Casanova, the recognition is a surprise but also validates a career dedicated to reshaping how we understand infections. \u201cWhen I got the call, I had no idea I had even been nominated,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is by far the most important award I have received in my career, and I am incredibly honoured.\u201d\n\nIt is not just about the virus\n\nJean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s journey began in Paris, where he simultaneously studied medicine and biology, tailoring his own MD and PhD programme long before such dual-degree tracks existed in France. His decision to specialise in paediatrics and immunology shaped the focus of his research.\n\n\u201cAs a young paediatrician, I saw children die from infections in intensive care units,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat made me realise that infection was the biggest problem in paediatrics. I wanted to understand why some children got severely ill while others did not.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 30 years, he took on the infection enigma as his life\u2019s work, starting his laboratory in Paris before later expanding to New York. Over the years, his team has demonstrated that genetic errors in immunity explain why certain individuals have severe infectious diseases \u2013 insight that has proved vital in times of global health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJean-Laurent Casanova\u2019s discoveries have changed how we understand and treat infections. One of his biggest breakthroughs came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when his team found that some people had \u201cbad\u201d antibodies \u2013 called autoantibodies \u2013 that attacked their own immune system instead of the virus. These autoantibodies block type I interferons, which are crucial for fighting infections. His research showed that these faulty antibodies were responsible for about 15% of severe COVID-19 cases and 20% of deaths.\n\n\u201cThis was clear proof that a person\u2019s genes and immune system play a big role in how sick they get from infections,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt is not just about the virus \u2013 it is also about how your body responds to it.\u201d\n\nConvincing the scientific community was not easy\n\nThese harmful autoantibodies are not just a COVID-19 problem. Casanova\u2019s team found them in other severe viral infections, such as influenza and West Nile virus, in which they explain nearly 40% of the worst cases. \u201cIf you have these autoantibodies, you have to be extra careful about infections and insect bites that spread viruses,\u201d Casanova warns. \u201cTesting older adults for these antibodies could also help to save lives in countries that can afford it.\u201d\n\nCasanova\u2019s team first found that rare genetic mutations prevented some people from producing type I interferons. Later, they discovered that autoantibodies could do the same thing \u2013 blocking immune defences and increasing the risk of severe infection. This breakthrough helped to explain why some people get critically ill whereas others recover quickly.\n\n\u201cThese individuals can be identified through genetic testing or by screening for autoantibodies in their blood. Once diagnosed, some patients may benefit from treatments such as interferon therapy to replace the missing immune signal or therapies to remove the harmful autoantibodies, helping to restore their body\u2019s ability to fight infections.\u201d\n\nFor a long time, scientists mainly focused on germs \u2013 bacteria and viruses \u2013 as the reason people got sick. But Casanova\u2019s discoveries challenged this thinking, showing that individual differences in the immune system also matter. Changing this perspective took time, since many researchers were initially sceptical.\n\n\u201cFor more than a century, we have been taught to focus almost entirely on microbes,\u201d Casanova says. \u201cBut genetics has always played a role \u2013 this was proven for plants over 100 years ago and for humans before World War II. We just did not fully appreciate it.\u201d\n\nA future shaped by genetic insight\n\nAs the field of infectious disease research continues to evolve, Casanova\u2019s discoveries offer a clear path forward. The ability to identify genetic vulnerability before illness strikes makes the potential for personalised interventions \u2013 such as tailored vaccination programmes and lifestyle adjustments \u2013 greater than ever.\n\nCasanova\u2019s work is not just focused on understanding infections \u2013 it focuses on rewriting the medical playbook for how to prevent and treat them. \u201cBy studying rare patients with rare genetic vulnerabilities, we uncovered something that affects millions,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nWith the 2025 Novo Nordisk Prize, his contributions take centre stage, marking a milestone in the pursuit of a more personalised and effective approach to infectious disease medicine.\n\nThe 2025 Novo Nordisk Prize will be awarded at a ceremony in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, on April 25. In addition, a Prize Lecture by Jean-Laurent Casanova will take place at the Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark in the Niels K. Jerne Auditorium, Building 13 on April 24.\n\nAbout Jean-Laurent Casanova\n\n1987 MD, University of Paris Descartes, France\n\n1992 PhD in Immunology, University of Paris Pierre and Marie Curie, France\n\n1999 Professor of Paediatrics, Necker Medical School, Paris, France\n\n1999 Co-founder, Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Institut Imagine, Inserm, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, Paris, France\n\n2008 Professor, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA\n\n2014 Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, USA\n\n2015 Foreign Member, United States National Academy of Sciences\n\n2015 Foreign Member, United States National Academy of Medicine\n\nAbout the Novo Nordisk Prize\n\nThe Novo Nordisk Prize recognises active scientists who have provided outstanding international contributions to advance medical science to benefit people\u2019s lives.

Duties have not yet been imposed on imports from Europe to the U.S., but U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that they are on the horizon. Germany could be one of the countries most exposed to tariffs if they are implemented as exports are a key pillar for its economy.\n\n\u2014 Sophie Kiderlin\n\nUK pledges to spend \u00a313.4 billion more on defense every year from 2027\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that the country will spend \u00a313.4 billion ($17 million) more on defense every year from now until 2027, in an effort to boost national security.\n\nStarmer said he plans to raise defense spending to 2.5% of the U.K.'s GDP by 2027, noting that the changes will see the government \"begin the biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe prime minister also set out a plan to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP in the next parliament.

The president also doubled down on his plans to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on America's trading partners.\n\nAsia-Pacific markets traded lower overnight after Wall Street fell Monday, as Trump tariffs stoked a risk-off mood.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 was trading in the red for a fourth day, taking a leg lower after the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey came in much weaker than economists' estimates.\n\nStoxx 600 ends the day slightly higher\n\nEuropean stock markets closed mixed on Tuesday, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX down 0.49% and 0.13% respectively, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.11%.\n\nThis year's momentum for the regional Stoxx 600 index has cooled over the last week, with the index provisionally closing just 0.13% higher after a 0.08% loss on Monday.\n\n\u2014 Jenni Reid\n\nUK defense spending increase will require 'sacrifices elsewhere': IFS\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to increase defense spending to 2.5% from 2.3% of GDP by 2027 will require tax hikes or spending cuts beyond the already-announced reduction in foreign aid, Ben Zaranko, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said in a note Tuesday.\n\n\"If the U.K. needs to spend more on defense on a structural and permanent basis, that is not something that can be sustainably borrowed for ... If defense spending needs to go higher than 2.5% of GDP, cuts to aid won't be enough,\" Zaranko said.\n\nZaranko also noted that it was currently unclear how the government produced its figure of a \u00a313 billion ($16.5 billion) annual increase in defense spending, when an extra 0.2% of GDP would total around \u00a36 billion, which would be covered by the cut to the aid budget.\n\nThe U.K.'s Labour government announced sweeping tax increases in October as it seeks to meet new fiscal rules ensuring day-to-day government spending is covered by income.\n\n\u2014 Jenni Reid\n\nS&P 500 opens flat Tuesday\n\nThe S&P 500 began Tuesday's trading session near the flatline.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 183 points, or 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%.\n\n\u2014 Hakyung Kim\n\nDefense stocks rise after UK announces increased defense spending\n\nBritish defense stocks are up on the Stoxx 600 index after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced an increase in defense spending.\n\nBritish defense giant BAE Systems was up 4% on Tuesday at 2 p.m. London time. Other European defense firms that supply to the UK also rose following the announcement. Leonardo, the Italian-owned defense supplier, was up nearly 3%.\n\nSaab, a Swedish-owned company providing defense and security technology in Britain, was also up nearly 3%. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce added an almost 2% gain.\n\n\u2014 Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nPotential Trump tariffs 'definitely not good news,' Bundesbank chief says\n\nDeutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel on Tuesday told CNBC that potential tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on European countries would not be good news.\n\nNagel said he was concerned about how the U.S. government's policy may impact Europe and specifically Germany, noting that there would ultimately be \"losers on both sides of the pond.\"\n\n\"This is definitely not good news,\" he said. \"On a daily basis I have the impression it's a very erratic development,\" Nagel added.\n\nHe pointed out potential spill over effects tariffs could have on inflation developments as well as monetary policy decision making, saying that this is why he backed a meeting by meeting approach.\n\nMany economists regard tariffs as inflationary. Duties have not yet been imposed on imports from Europe to the U.S., but U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that they are on the horizon. Germany could be one of the countries most exposed to tariffs if they are implemented as exports are a key pillar for its economy.\n\n\u2014 Sophie Kiderlin\n\nUK pledges to spend \u00a313.4 billion more on defense every year from 2027\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Tuesday that the country will spend \u00a313.4 billion ($17 million) more on defense every year from now until 2027, in an effort to boost national security.\n\nStarmer said he plans to raise defense spending to 2.5% of the U.K.'s GDP by 2027, noting that the changes will see the government \"begin the biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe prime minister also set out a plan to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP in the next parliament. The country faces \"enemies that are sophisticated in cyber-attacks, sabotage, even assassination,\" he said during an address in parliament.\n\nThe government will be putting in place a new \"defense reform and efficiency plan\" jointly led by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Defense Secretary John Healey.\n\n\"The nature of warfare has changed significantly, that is clear from the battlefield in Ukraine, so we must modernize and reform our capabilities as we invest,\" Starmer said.\n\n\"This investment means that the U.K. will strengthen its position as a leader in NATO and in collective defense of our continent and we should welcome that role. It is good for our national security. It is also good for the ambition of this government to restore growth to our economy and we should be optimistic on what it can deliver on those terms,\" he added.\n\n\u2014 Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nGermany\u2019s election could further boost Europe\u2019s defense sector, analysts say\n\nPetras Malukas | Afp | Getty Images\n\nGermany headed to the polls on Sunday for the country's federal election, paving the way for a new coalition government that some market watchers expect could further strengthen Europe's flourishing defense sector.\n\nPreliminary results on Monday showed the allied Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) parties achieved the biggest majority, winning a combined 28.6% of votes. The far-right AfD won 20.8% of the votes, the data showed, while incumbent Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in third with just 16.4%.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nRussia\u2019s VTB Bank announces record full-year profits\n\nAlexander Nemenov | Afp | Getty Images\n\nVTB Bank, Russia's second-biggest lender, reported a 27.6% year-on-year rise in annual net profit on Tuesday, with the figure for 2024 coming in at 551.4 billion rubles ($6.4 billion).\n\nChief Financial Officer Dmitry Pianov said in a news release that it marked a record result for the bank, with profitability bolstered by a growing loan portfolio and a record expansion in retail customers. However, the company noted that tighter monetary policy \u2014 the Bank of Russia has held its key interest rate at 21% since October \u2014 led to a deceleration in its lending growth as the year progressed.\n\nVTB's 2024 result marked a continued financial recovery for the lender, topping the record profit it reported a year earlier. In 2022, VTB reported a 667.5 billion ruble loss after the lender was hit by international sanctions imposed in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nGerman export expectations improve but remain in negative territory, Ifo Institute says\n\nIn a report out Tuesday, Munich's Ifo Institute said that German businesses became slightly less pessimistic about foreign sales prospects in February, with the thinktank's Export Expectations indicator a rise to -5 points from -7.1 points a month earlier.\n\nDespite the slight uptick, Ifo noted that the figure has been in negative territory for almost two years, with \"only a few sectors\" \u2014 including furniture manufacturers, beverage makers and the autos sector \u2014 projecting international sales will pick up.\n\nGerman machinery manufacturers and the country's chemicals sector were expecting a slight decline in international sales, Ifo's data showed.\n\nThe data was derived from survey responses from around 2,100 firms.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nRyanair CEO predicts summer fare rise of up to 6%\n\nJohn Macdougall | Afp | Getty Images\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O'Leary on Tuesday said that the budget airline expects fares to be 4% to 6% higher this summer than in the same season of 2024, in comments cited by news agency Reuters.\n\nDublin-listed shares of the company were trading flat at 10:14 a.m. London time.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nSmith & Nephew\u2019s shares jump 8% after posting 5% jump in revenue\n\nSmith & Nephew shares jumped 8% at the open after the British medical technology company reported its full-year results.\n\nAnnual revenue rose to $5.8 billion in 2024, a 4.7% rise from the $5.5 billion reported in 2023, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Meanwhile, trading profit increased 8.2% to just over $1 billion in 2024, up from $970 million in 2023.\n\nThe company noted an improvement in demand for its U.S. hip implant and knee implant products which helped offset a decline in China. It's expecting underlying revenue growth of around 5% in 2025, compared to growth of 4.8% in 2024.\n\n\"We have been driving a three-year turnaround, we're two years into that turnaround, and we've been very pleased with the results. So far, Q4 was strong with a strong finish to the year and we delivered above five percent growth, which is higher than our historical average of about two to three percent growth,\" Smith & Nephew CEO Deepak Nath told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're looking forward to in 2025, the accumulated benefits, and all the operational improvements we made in 2024 to deliver exceptional returns financially,\" Nath added.\n\n\u2014 Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\nWatch: Heidelberg Materials CEO discusses full-year results\n\nFresenius Medical Care 'tariff taskforce' set to deal with Trump uncertainty, CEO says\n\nGerman healthcare company Fresenius Medical Care said Tuesday that it has installed its first-ever \"tariff taskforce\" to manage uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed import charges.\n\nCEO Helen Giza told CNBC that her business was somewhat insulated from possible trade levies, with some U.S.-based manufacturing. However, she noted that charges on EU imports could hit items such as its dialysis machines and consumable products.\n\n\"Clearly we're looking at what happens to the tariffs in Europe and what also happens to tariffs [on] medical equipment,\" she said.\n\n\"The escalation and speed of this with the executive orders is something we assembled pretty quickly,\" Giza added. She noted that the taskforce had an expanded remit to the company's regular trade team and was trying to understand the implications of levies and \"what the potential scenarios could be.\"\n\n\u2014 Karen Gilchrist\n\nGerman economy shrank 0.2% in final quarter of 2024\n\nGermany's economy contracted 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of 2024, the country's Federal Statistical Office said on Tuesday, confirming a preliminary reading out at the end of January.\n\nThe fourth-quarter performance followed quarterly growth of 0.1% over the July-September stretch.\n\nOfficials cited significant export declines and an ongoing slump in manufacturing output among the headwinds facing the German economy at the end of last year.\n\n\u2014 Chloe Taylor\n\nUnilever CEO Schumacher to step down\n\nBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nUnilever CEO Hein Schumacher is stepping down after less than two years in the job, the company said Tuesday, with current CFO Fernando Fernandez set to take his place leading the company.\n\nSchumacher \u2014 who took the reins in July 2023 and was tasked with leading the overhaul of the consumer goods giant \u2014 will stand down as CEO and board director in March and will leave the company on May 31. His departure is taking place by mutual agreement, the consumer goods firm said.\n\nFernandez' new role will take effect March 1.\n\nUnilever said there was no change to its 2025 outlook or the company's medium-term guidance following this announcement.\n\n\"On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever's strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024,\" Unilever Chairman Ian Meakins said in a statement.\n\n\"While the Board is pleased with Unilever's performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results. Having worked with Fernando closely over the last 14months, the Board is very confident in his ability to lead a high performing management team, realize the benefits of the GAP [Growth Action Plan] with urgency, and deliver the shareholder value that the company's potential demands,\" Meakins added.\n\nSrinivas Phatak, Unilever's current deputy CFO and group controller, will take over as interim CFO. An internal and external search now being initiated to permanently fill the role, the company added.\n\n\u2014 Karen Gilchrist\n\nMarkets relieved by German election result, but key industries remain mired in uncertainty\n\nFrankfurt's DAX index gained 0.6% Monday, outpacing a flat U.K. FTSE 100 and 0.78% loss for France's CAC 40, while the euro nudged higher against the U.S. dollar and British pound and German borrowing costs were little-changed.\n\nGermany's election delivered a victory for the conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU). That has set up CDU-CSU candidate Friedrich Merz \u2014 a center-right, pro-business politician who serves on the boards of EY Germany and the Deutsche B\u00f6rse \u2014 as near-certain to take over as the next chancellor.\n\nSome uncertainty remains however, with a period of coalition talks ahead and a future in which support of smaller parties will be needed to enact promised policies including reform of Germany's contentious \"debt brake\" rule.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\u2014 Jenni Reid\n\nEuropean markets: Here are the opening calls\n\nEuropean markets are expected to open in mixed territory Tuesday.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 index is expected to open unchanged at 8,637, Germany's DAX down 29 points at 22,381, France's CAC 2 points lower at 8,084 and Italy's FTSE MIB 27 points higher at 38,542, according to data from IG.\n\nEarnings come from Fresenius Medical Care, Smith & Nephew, Heidelberg materials and Alcon.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Cheap Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other pharmaceutical stocks.\n\nThe Evolving Landscape of Healthcare and Biopharma Innovation\n\nAlmost no other industry goes as far as the phrase \u201cdefensive\u201d as the healthcare sector, which encompasses a wide range of companies that provide patient care, research and development of new medicines, and design, manufacture, and sell diagnostic instruments and tests. Patient care has evolved due to advancements in therapeutic techniques, drugs, and medical technology. Pharmaceutical companies in particular have received much attention as the demand for speedy results has increased. Grand View Research predicted that the value of pharmaceutical manufacturing worldwide was $516.48 billion in 2022. The sector is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.63% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nThe biopharma industry now has the most extensive and varied clinical pipeline to date, due to decades of groundbreaking research. In 2012, there were 3,200 distinct medications under development; by 2022, that number had nearly doubled to 6,100. The average cost of producing a single treatment is over $1 billion, while just 14% of medications in clinical trials reach FDA clearance, according to MIT research. This could be a game-changer for AI. For instance, generative AI helps identify illness patterns in large data sets to determine the optimal medicine combinations while enabling researchers to investigate far more possible compounds than they could with conventional techniques. Additionally, according to PwC, AI-driven analytics and automation could cut operational costs by more than 30% and process timeframes by 60\u201370%.\n\nIn a similar vein, the market has grown significantly due to consumer interest in weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. According to a recent study in the scientific journal Addiction, GLP-1 medications may reduce the prevalence of alcohol and opioid addiction by as much as 50%. Additionally, these medications are being evaluated for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other disorders that are frequently associated with obesity. The development of GLP-1s is becoming crucial for pharmaceutical businesses that want to be leaders in fields like cardiovascular and renal health. Competition with the leading companies in the anti-obesity business, which is expected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, is no longer the main emphasis.\n\nThe possibility for additional participants to enter the field is growing along with the possible applications of GLP-1s. For example, the Swiss business Roche entered the weight-loss drug sweepstakes in 2023 when it paid up to $3.1 billion to acquire California-based Carmot Therapeutics. The corporation wants to \u201cfast-track\u201d its anti-obesity medicines to regain faith in its pipeline and take a share of the weight-loss market.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities in the Pharmaceutical and Biotech IPO Market\n\nThe pharmaceutical sector may appear to be flourishing at first glance. However, it has its own set of difficulties, just like every other industry. Compared to 2021, funding for biotech and pharmaceuticals fell by a sharp 48.6% last year. In 2022, the IPO market also saw a significant decline, with profits falling as a result of market volatility and instability. Many general investors were apprehensive of the spike in drug-developer initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2020 and 2021, which garnered about $46.5 billion, more than the total from the preceding eight years combined.\n\nFuture initial public offerings (IPOs) are being closely watched due to the high-risk, high-reward nature of the biotech sector as well as macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that impact larger markets. However, as of September 3, 2024, drug developers had raised $2 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) this year, a 24% increase over the same period in 2023. However, according to BNN Bloomberg, over two-thirds of these funds were raised in the first two months as a result of a spike in new listings. However, pharma companies\u2019 portion of U.S. IPO profits has decreased from 17% in February to 6.5%, with less than $800 million raised in the next six months.\n\nTim Hunt, CEO of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), emphasized increased funding in cell and gene therapies in 2024 in his opening remarks at the October 7 conference. According to him, thirteen of the fifteen biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world by market capitalization now have an \u201cactive presence\u201d in this area. Major pharmaceutical corporations are increasingly turning to cell and gene therapies to fill possible revenue shortages as many product patents are about to expire. Despite this optimism, there has been a reduction in related patent filings, and the number of cell and gene therapy deals in the pharmaceutical industry fell by 38% in Q2 2024 compared to the same time in 2023. Nevertheless, the sector is appealing and should not be disregarded by possible investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best cheap pharmaceutical stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur methodology involved selecting stocks with a market capitalization exceeding $3 billion, a P/E ratio below 40, and a price target upside of more than 10%. We then ranked these stocks based on their upside potential, as of February 17.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 81.93%\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is recognized as a global healthcare company specializing in diabetes care. The two business segments that comprise its operations are biopharmaceuticals and diabetes and obesity care. GLP-1, insulin, and other products related to proteins are covered in the latter section. In the GLP-1 weight reduction industry, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly are the two main pharmaceutical companies that compete.\n\nThe company is developing a new oral weight reduction tablet that, if approved, may revolutionize the market, even though both companies have authorized weight loss medications that dominate the market with billions of dollars in revenue. In the upcoming months, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) intends to submit a regulatory approval application for its oral weight reduction medication in the United States, according to CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen. If the business gets approved, it might be able to start selling the medication as early as next year, which is also when Eli Lilly intends to introduce its medication for weight reduction.\n\nAside from any excitement for this oral medication for weight loss, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is operating on solid foundations. The corporation had a successful fiscal year in 2024, as its sales increased by 25% to $40.6 billion. In August, it paid out an interim dividend of DKK 3.50, increasing its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40. For the 29th year in a row, NVO has increased its dividend. At constant currency rates, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) anticipates a free cash flow of approximately DKK 75 to 85 billion and revenue growth of 16\u201324% in 2025.\n\nOverall NVO ranks 1st on our list of the cheap pharmaceutical stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The FDA just dropped some big news: the long-standing drug shortage of semaglutide, the key ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, is officially over.\n\nAfter nearly two years of supply issues that left pharmacies struggling to keep up with demand, Novo Nordisk, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, says they\u2019ve got enough supply to meet everyone\u2019s needs in the U.S.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for a prescription or bouncing between pharmacies hoping to snag a refill, this is the update you\u2019ve been waiting for. But there\u2019s a catch, especially if you\u2019ve been using compounded versions of these meds.\n\nNo More Compounded Semaglutide After May 2025\n\nDuring the shortage, compounding pharmacies stepped in, creating their own versions of semaglutide. But now that the supply is stable, the FDA says it\u2019s time to phase those out. By April 22, 2025, regular compounding pharmacies must stop producing semaglutide, and larger outsourcing facilities have until May 22, 2025 to follow suit.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve been relying on compounded versions, it\u2019s time to check in with your doctor and get a prescription for the brand-name drugs. The good news? You should have an easier time getting your hands on Ozempic or Wegovy without the months-long wait.\n\nWhat This Means for Your Wallet\n\nThe return of Ozempic and Wegovy also comes with a financial shake-up. Compounded versions were often cheaper, making them more accessible for people without insurance coverage. With those options going away, some users might face higher out-of-pocket costs, especially if their insurance doesn\u2019t cover weight-loss medications like Wegovy.\n\nStill, with the official versions back in stock, you can at least count on consistent dosage and quality, something that wasn\u2019t always guaranteed with compounded versions.\n\nWhat About Side Effects and Demand?\n\nSemaglutide\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t just about weight loss, it\u2019s also a game-changer for people with type 2 diabetes. But its success in helping people shed pounds has fueled massive demand, sometimes leading to shortages and leaving diabetes patients scrambling. With supply issues now resolved, both groups should see better availability.\n\nThat said, demand is still sky-high, so don\u2019t be surprised if some pharmacies take a little time to catch up. The FDA warns that local supply hiccups might still happen as products move through distribution channels.\n\nInvestors Are Paying Attention Too\n\nThe FDA\u2019s announcement hasn\u2019t just impacted patients, it\u2019s shaking up the stock market, too. Shares of Hims & Hers Health Inc., which offered compounded versions of semaglutide, dropped sharply after the news. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock is climbing, with investors confident that the company will dominate the market now that supply is back on track.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting to start Ozempic or Wegovy, or struggling to find a pharmacy with stock due to the semaglutide drug shortage, you should see things improve soon according to the FDA. Just remember that compounded versions are being phased out, so if you\u2019ve been using those, now\u2019s the time to switch to the real deal.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still having trouble finding it locally, hang tight, supply chains are still catching up, but the FDA says relief is finally here.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk's phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \"REDEFINE-1.\" Defendants' statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants' statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk's expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk's REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \"flexible protocol\" which gave patients the ability \"to modify their dosing throughout the trial.\" When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

            "content": "Market Overview\n\nThe markets were closed on Monday in observance of President's Day. During the first half of the week, the S&P 500 reached a new record high of 6,147. This was driven by a strong resistance to selling interest and a tendency to buy during market weaknesses. However, by the end of the week, a consolidation trade emerged due to profit-taking activities. Concerns over valuations and a slowdown in momentum among top-performing stocks contributed to this trend, sparking discussions about a potential near-term market top. This sentiment reduced buying interest.\n\nEconomic Indicators and Growth Concerns\n\nThe preliminary February S&P Global US Services PMI fell below 50, indicating contraction.\n\nThe University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report for February decreased to 64.7.\n\nExisting home sales saw a 4.9% month-over-month decline in January.\n\nThese economic indicators, coupled with disappointing fiscal Q1 and full-year guidance from Walmart (WMT), contributed to increased selling interest later in the week.\n\nMarket Performance\n\nMega cap and small cap stocks experienced the most significant declines, while the broader market fared relatively better. The market-cap weighted S&P 500 fell by 1.7% from the previous Friday, while the equal-weighted S&P 500 saw a 0.7% decline. The Russell 2000 dropped by 3.7%, and the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) recorded a 2.7% decline.\n\nSector Performance\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector dropped by 4.3%.\n\nThe communication services sector decreased by 3.7%.\n\nDefensive sectors such as utilities (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.9%), and health care (+1.1%) were among the week's top performers.\n\nTariffs and Market Sentiment\n\nMarket participants considered tariff discussions, viewing them as bargaining tools rather than permanent measures. President Trump announced a 25% auto tariff starting April 2 and mentioned potential tariffs for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nWeekly Index Performance\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: -2.5% for the week / +2.1% YTD\n\nS&P 500: -1.7% for the week / +2.2% YTD\n\nNasdaq Composite: -2.5% for the week / +1.1% YTD\n\nS&P Midcap 400: -3.0% for the week / -0.6% YTD\n\nRussell 2000: -3.7% for the week / -1.6% YTD\n\nTuesday's Market Activity\n\nTuesday was mostly uneventful until the final minutes of trading. The S&P 500 reached a new record high of 6,129 due to a late surge in buying interest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also closed slightly higher. The positive bias beneath the index surface acted as an upside catalyst, encouraging more buying towards the end of the day.\n\nTuesday's Economic Data\n\nFebruary Empire State Manufacturing Index: 5.7 (consensus -2.0), previous -12.6\n\nFebruary NAHB Housing Market Index: 42 (consensus 47), previous 47\n\nWednesday's Market Activity\n\nWednesday's session mirrored Tuesday's, with indices trading around prior closing levels before the S&P 500 hit another record high. Profit-taking activities were present, but resilience to selling interest turned into an upside catalyst by the session's end. Mega cap and semiconductor stocks played a key role in the index gains.\n\nWednesday's Economic Data\n\nJanuary housing starts: -9.8% month-over-month to 1.366 million (consensus 1.400 million), previous 1.515 million\n\nBuilding permits: +0.1% to 1.483 million (consensus 1.450 million), previous 1.482 million\n\nWeekly MBA Mortgage Index: -6.6%, Purchase Index: -5.9%, Refinance Index: -7.3%\n\nThursday's Market Activity\n\nThursday saw a negative bias following Wednesday's S&P 500 record high, with indices opening sharply lower due to consolidation and profit-taking. However, a steady recovery in the afternoon indicated a continued inclination to buy on weakness. Walmart (WMT) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 consumer staples sector, influenced by disappointing fiscal guidance.\n\nThursday's Economic Data\n\nWeekly Initial Claims: 219K (consensus 217K), previous revised to 214K\n\nWeekly Continuing Claims: 1.869 million, previous revised to 1.845 million\n\nFebruary Philadelphia Fed Index: 18.1 (consensus 20.5), previous 44.3\n\nJanuary Leading Indicators: -0.3% (consensus 0.0%), previous revised to 0.1%\n\nFriday's Market Activity\n\nFriday witnessed sharp declines in a broad-based retreat on high-volume options expiration day. Major indices closed near their lowest levels, with the S&P 500 ending just above its 50-day moving average at 6,010, down 1.7%. Concerns about growth and valuations fueled consolidation and profit-taking. UnitedHealth (UNH, Financial) shares fell following a Wall Street Journal report on a DOJ civil fraud investigation into its Medicare Advantage billing practices.\n\nGuru Stock Picks\n\nPrivate Capital has made the following transactions:\n\nReduce in AIOT by 0.69%\n\nRon Baron has made the following transactions:\n\nReduce in PRI by 3.3%\n\nAdd in RRR by 6.9%\n\nToday's News\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH, Financial) shares fell significantly following news of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the company's billing practices for Medicare Advantage. The probe, which includes the Office of Inspector General, scrutinizes potential fraudulent diagnoses that could lead to increased payments. Despite the company's denial of the allegations, the stock experienced its largest intraday drop since March 2020, although analysts from Oppenheimer and Mizuho suggest the financial impact may be minimal.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) announced that the shortage of its popular diabetes and weight loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, has ended. This update negatively impacted Hims & Hers Health (HIMS, Financial), which had been producing compounded versions of these medications during the shortage. With the supply constraints resolved, Hims & Hers will no longer be able to manufacture these compounded drugs, affecting its market position.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH, Financial) made headlines with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Lu, a move seen as strategically sound to enhance growth and scale in the energy drink market. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Celsius' position among female consumers, a demographic that has been increasingly consuming energy drinks.\n\nTrucking stocks, including Old Dominion (ODFL, Financial) and Saia (SAIA, Financial), faced pressure as J.P. Morgan warned of potential market share loss if Amazon (AMZN) enters the less-than-truckload sector as a competitor. TFI International's CEO highlighted ongoing challenges in the freight industry, predicting a tough environment for the first half of 2025.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX, Financial) shares surged on renewed takeover speculation, with Pfizer (PFE) rumored to be interested. This follows previous reports of Eli Lilly's (LLY) potential interest in acquiring the obesity drug maker, which has seen its market cap rise to $3.5 billion.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) saw a modest gain amid speculation of takeover interest from companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) or Unilever (UL). The company is currently involved in a proxy battle with activist investor Starboard Value, which has pushed for changes to enhance the stock's performance.\n\nAMD (AMD) is reportedly in talks to sell server chip manufacturing plants in Asia, potentially valued at $4 billion. The sale would include plants acquired through its purchase of ZT Systems, aiming to boost its data center AI systems capabilities.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) announced a recall of over 17,000 vehicles due to a headlight issue affecting visibility. The recall covers specific models that may have been built with improperly configured parts, and the company will replace the headlight control modules at no charge.\n\nGuruFocus Stock Analysis",

            "content": "Where could be the top place to invest this spring? Europe \u2013 according to the latest edition of the hugely influential Bank of America fund manager survey.\n\nMore than a third of the respondents \u2013 the professionals who together take care of $482billion worth of global savings \u2013 say European shares are undervalued against their global peers.\n\nIf your portfolio is concentrated in US tech stocks, then a taste of Europe may be what you need.\n\nThis can be found among the Granolas, a group of 11 European multinationals, selected by US bank Goldman Sachs, which is made up of GSK (also known as GlaxoSmithKline), Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L'Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.\n\nYes, the name actually spells out 'Grannnllass'.\n\nTwo are British \u2013 AstraZeneca and GSK. But all are global leaders in sectors like luxury, pharmaceuticals, beauty and software, and deserving of a place in your portfolio.\n\nSunnier outlook?: For the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks\n\nThis may not seem an ideal moment to bet on Europe: the world order is shifting, and the continent is being rocked by the pace of change. But there are signs of revival and resolve to deliver long-overdue reform.\n\nGermany goes to the polls tomorrow, as gloom over its economy gathers. But there are hopes the election could produce a conservative-led coalition which would cut corporate taxes and bolster growth.\n\nMarcel Stotzel, manager of the Fidelity European fund, says some of the enthusiasm for Europe arises from the view that there is a widening disconnect between the prices of some US stocks and their fundamental value.\n\nBut there are other reasons. Stotzel explains: 'There has been a deep sigh of relief over the introduction of tariffs by President Trump. It seems as if they are going to affect Canada, China and Mexico more than the EU.'\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek, a cheap Chinese artificial intelligence system, may have rocked the share prices of the US tech titans who have spent billions on the more expensive ChatGPT.\n\nBut Stotzel argues that DeepSeek is good news for European firms because they must deploy AI and may now do so for far less.\n\nThe heightened geopolitical tensions with the US over Ukraine are one of the forces compelling investors to look at Europe.\n\nStotzel says European companies, such as the French industrial group LeGrand, are set to play major role in rebuilding Ukraine. This is why analysts think its shares could jump from \u20ac110.30 to as much as \u20ac126.\n\nMeanwhile, European defence and aerospace stocks have soared this week in response to US calls for EU states to increase their military spending.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has promised that such expenditure would be exempted from the normal limits on states' budgets. Among the beneficiaries of her announcement have been shares in firms usually overlooked by UK investors such as Italian defence aerospace group Leonardo.\n\nThere have also been gains of 14 per cent to 25 per cent among the German giants such as Thyssenkrupp, the engineering and steel manufacturer. The price of Rheinmetall, a specialist in ammunition, drones and tanks, has soared by 30 per cent.\n\nAnalysts still rate Rheinmetall a 'buy', although the increase since the start of the year could tempt some investors to take profits.\n\nIf you are contemplating exploring Europe, this is why investors fell out of love with this region \u2013 and why it may be worth your attention now.\n\nWhy did Europe lose its bite?\n\nFor the past two years, European markets have been overshadowed by the stellar feats of the 'Magnificent Seven' US tech stocks \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nThe gains made from these shares have reinforced the adage that 'the US innovates, the EU regulates'. The belief that a bureaucratic Europe was being badly left behind in an era of American exceptionalism was amplified by the Donald Trump's victory last November.\n\nThis sparked an exodus of investors in the final quarter. Europe's main stock market index, the Stoxx 600, ticked up by just 6 per cent in 2024, against 23 per cent for the US S&P 500 index .\n\nBut there are moves, driven by Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), and other officials to introduce reforms and relax the stranglehold of bureaucracy.\n\nHow big should your appetite be?\n\nThe members of the Granola gang are global players. They do not depend on their domestic economies, but they do get a boost from lower interest rates.\n\nThe ECB has cut interest rates five times since last June and could order three more reductions, if inflation eases.\n\nOne of the best ways to back the Granolas is through a fund or trust such as BlackRock Greater Europe, Fidelity European or Henderson European.\n\nBut Ben Yearsley of Fairview Investing says that there are currently some bargains among the Granolas.\n\nASML, a Dutch business, is the world's number one maker of the equipment required for the manufacture of microchips. Its shares have fallen 14 per cent over the past six months to \u20ac709.90, driven by the alarm over DeepSeek.\n\nThe view that DeepSeek could expand, rather than contract sales of ASML's kit explains why analysts rate the shares a 'buy'. The average target price is \u20ac842, although one analyst is forecasting a price of \u20ac1,057.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical behemoth, is the maker of the anti-obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk shares are more than 300 per cent higher than ten years ago at 630 Danish krone, nearly \u00a364. In common with other analysts, the broker UBS rates shares a 'buy', with a target price of 750 krone.\n\nFundsmith and Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas are among the funds that hold LVMH, the Tiffany and Moet Hennessy luxury goods conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, one of the world's richest men. Arnault, a member of Trump's billionaire mates gang, is considering 'bulking up' LVMH's production in America to exploit its 'dynamic market'.\n\nThere are predictions that the new era of more overt glamour ushered in by the Trump administration will be good for sales of LVMH's bags, scents and watches. The shares stand at \u20ac702.40 \u2013 and are worth holding, according to analysts.\n\nAre there other opportunities?\n\nIF you are looking for a thrill-packed European adventure, take a peek at the group also named for a breakfast cereal \u2013 Cheerios. They are: Coface, H Lundbeck, Evonik, Eramet, Repsol, Indra Sistemas, OTP Bank and SAF-Holland.\n\nThese lesser-known businesses operate in the fields of automobile parts, chemicals, insurance and oil and gas, but such smaller firms are difficult to research.\n\nIf you want a stake in the bounty that could flow from the lessening of regulation in Europe and the new confidence that its markets can compete with the US, the European Smaller Companies represents a route. Its managers have a special mission to find bargains.",

That has forced Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly to invest heavily to expand their manufacturing footprints for their respective weight loss and diabetes drugs \u2014 and it may be paying off.\n\nThe FDA determined that Novo Nordisk's supply and manufacturing capacity for semaglutide injections can now meet the current and projected demand in the U.S. Still, the agency noted that patients and prescribers may still see \"intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions\" as products move through the supply chain to pharmacies.\n\n\"We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved,\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations and global business development, said in a statement.\n\nHe added that \"no one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.\"\n\nThe FDA's announcement comes just months after the agency declared the shortage of tirzepatide \u2014 the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro \u2014 was over.\n\nThe FDA's decision on Friday could better position Novo Nordisk to compete with Eli Lilly in the booming weight loss drug market, which some analysts say could be worth more than $150 billion annually after 2030.",

Ozempic and Wegovy.\"\n\nNovo's good news day\n\nTwo of Novo's biggest money-makers, injectable GLP-1 weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, have been on the FDA's official drug shortage list since March and August 2022, respectively. As a result, drug compounding companies like Hims & Hers have till now been allowed to compound drugs similar to Novo's, albeit not officially FDA-approved, and sell them into the weight loss market. They've essentially been free-riding on Novo's coattails and taking sales that would otherwise go to Novo (or Lilly).\n\nThat ends today.\n\nBased on data provided by Novo Nordisk (and others), the FDA has determined that Novo is now producing sufficient quantities of GLP-1 drugs to satisfy the market: \"Supply is currently meeting or exceeding demand,\" says the FDA, and \"Novo Nordisk has developed ... finished product inventory ... such that supply will meet or exceed projected demand\" for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat this means for Novo Nordisk and Hims & Hers Health\n\nThis is good news for Novo for two reasons. First, it implies greater sales going forward because the company has more product to sell. Second, it implies a worsening business environment for its competitor Hims & Hers. The FDA says it \"does not intend to take action against compounders\" for at least 60 to 90 days. But after that, things could get increasingly difficult for Hims & Hers.\n\nMost importantly for investors, this implies that at a 26.4 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Novo Nordisk stock may be a bargain. Wall Street analysts are already forecasting 16.6% long-term earnings growth rates for the stock (plus a 1.9% dividend). If sales rise in response to the FDA declaratory order, that growth rate could be even faster.",

Could the high cost of hugely popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy be coming down in the near future? Cheddar\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday said the shortage of Novo Nordisk's weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic is resolved, a move that could limit the availability of cheaper compounded versions of the wildly popular medications.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it confirmed Novo Nordisk's \"stated product availability and manufacturing capacity\" of these prescription drugs meets or exceeds current and projected demand. The agency warned consumers and doctors might still experience \"limited localized supply disruptions\" as the products are shipped from drug factories to distributors to pharmacies.\n\nThe Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it has invested $6.5 billion this year in the United States to bolster drug production facilities that are operating 24/7, shipping Wegovy and Ozempic to wholesalers.\n\nPharmaceutical giants that market lucrative weight-loss drugs have battled with firms that sell less expensive versions made by compounding pharmacies.\n\nThe FDA allows compounding pharmacies to sell copies of drugs when the medications are in short supply. But compounding pharmacies face stiffer restrictions when a drug shortage is resolved.\n\nCompanies that market compounded drugs \u2212 combining, mixing or altering drug ingredients \u2212 have prospered amid shortages of the class of weight-loss medications, called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists.\n\nHims & Hers, which launched a Super Bowl ad touting its weight loss product offerings, markets a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged 17% in mid-morning trading after the FDA's announcement.\n\nThe FDA said it won't take enforcement action against pharmacies or doctors that make compounded semaglutide due to the shortage before April 22. Facilities that compound, distribute or dispense semaglutide injections won't face enforcement action before May 22.\n\nIn December, the FDA declared that Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes medication tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, was no longer in short supply. That meant pharmacies had to discontinue \"compounding, distributing or dispensing\" tirzepatide as of Feb 18. Suppliers that produce batches of the drug and sell to others have until March 19 to cease distribution.\n\nCompounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy and source ingredients are usually obtained from factories registered with the FDA.

Compounded drugs use the same active ingredients but are made by pharmacies or manufacturers other than the companies that make FDA-approved versions of the medicines. This enabled thousands, or even millions, of people to access costly GLP-1 medicines at a lower price point.\n\nThe end of the shortage would effectively bar the sale of compounded versions of the drugs, but the FDA said that they do not plan to take any action against compounding pharmacies for 60 to 90 days.\n\n\u201cPatients and prescribers may still see intermittent and limited localized supply disruptions as the products move through the supply chain from the manufacturer and distributors to local pharmacies,\u201d the FDA said on Friday.\n\nThe FDA announced a similar policy for pharmacies making tirzepatide compounds when that shortage was resolved in December. In August, drug manufacturer Eli Lilly began sending cease-and-desist letters to telehealth companies, wellness centers and medical spas selling compounded versions of Zepbound and Mounjaro, according to Reuters. The company has also filed lawsuits against sellers falsely claiming to sell FDA-approved versions of the drug.\n\nOn Friday, drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk warned in a news release that the \u201cFDA\u2019s decision means that making or selling a knockoff compounded drug that is essentially a copy of Ozempic or Wegovy is illegal.\u201d\n\nThe company has already filed more than 100 lawsuits related to \u201ccopycat\u201d semaglutide products, most under claims of false advertising or deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\n\u201cNo one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,\u201d company president Moore said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe FDA has issued safety warnings about some compounded versions of semaglutide. The agency said that it received reports of adverse events in people who used compounded semaglutide and that patients \u201cshould not use a compounded drug if an approved drug is available.\u201d\n\nBut the Outsourcing Facilities Association, a trade group representing companies that make certain compounded medications, has sued the FDA over its removal of tirzepatide from the shortage list claiming that it happened \u201cwithout notice, without soliciting input from affected parties and the public, and without meaningful rationale.\u201d\n\nOlympia Pharmaceuticals says that they provide compounded GLP-1 medications \u2013 the vast majority of which are semaglutide \u2013 to tens of thousands of patients each week, and there hasn\u2019t been sufficient reassurance for prescribers to feel confident that supply is strong enough to meet demand.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern would be that patient continuity of care. If we were to no longer be able to dispense this to patients, that Novo Nordisk and these brand name suppliers are able to pick up that demand where we left off,\u201d said Josh Fritzler, chief financial officer with Olympia.\n\nWhile the \u201cnational GLP-1 supply begins to stabilize,\u201d the FDA notes that some other products \u2013 including dulaglutide injections sold under the brand name Trulicity and some liraglutide injections \u2013 remain in shortage.\n\nCNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other best global stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe United States has long been a magnet for global businesses seeking to tap into its robust economy and dynamic financial markets. Several key economic policies and initiatives have been instrumental in encouraging these enterprises to remain active participants in US stock markets. The US offers the world\u2019s largest consumer market, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $25 trillion and a population of 335 million. Household spending accounts for nearly a third of global consumption, making it an attractive destination for businesses aiming to expand their market reach. The regulatory environment is conducive to starting and operating a business, ensuring that companies, regardless of origin, compete on an even playing field. This transparency and predictability in the legal system bolster investor confidence and encourage sustained engagement in US stock markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nTo further promote foreign direct investment (FDI), the US Department of Commerce launched the SelectUSA program. Since its inception, SelectUSA has facilitated more than $250 billion in investments, leading to the creation or retention of over 230,000 jobs. By providing actionable information and serving as a liaison between investors and economic development organizations, SelectUSA plays a pivotal role in attracting and retaining global businesses in the US market. The US has also implemented tax reforms aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment. The country continues to invest in infrastructure and technological innovation, providing businesses with the necessary tools and resources to thrive.\n\nAccess to cutting-edge technology, a skilled workforce, and a culture of innovation fosters an environment where companies can grow and remain competitive. Despite these advantages, global businesses must navigate challenges such as economic and political uncertainties. Recent reports indicate a shift in investment preferences, with some investors reconsidering their concentrated investments in US markets due to factors like stretched valuations and geopolitical tensions. For instance, a significant reduction in US stock holdings has been observed, with nearly 90% of investors viewing US equities as overvalued, per a recent Reuters report. This trend underscores the importance of continuous policy evaluation to maintain the attractiveness of US stock markets.",

            "content": "Hotdogs and motorways: The ripples created by Denmark's Ozempic and Wegovy boom\n\n20 February 2025 Share Save Adrienne Murray Share Save\n\nAdrienne Murray\n\nAmerican demand for weight-loss drugs is supercharging Denmark\u2019s economy and transforming a small Danish community into an unlikely boomtown.\n\nLook back only two years ago and the name of Danish firm Novo Nordisk would hardly ring a bell. But now, soaring sales of two blockbuster drugs, the anti-obesity and diabetes treatments Wegovy and Ozempic, have turned this pharmaceutical giant into one of Europe's most valuable companies.\n\nThe drugmaker revealed in early February 2025 that its pre-tax profits jumped 22% to $17.8bn (DKK127.2bn/\u00a314.2bn).\n\nIt has also given Denmark's economy a huge boost, making it one of the region's fastest-growing. From new job creation to lower mortgage rates, the ripple effects of skyrocketing drug demand have been felt across the country, and not least in the tiny port town of Kalundborg, a community of fewer than 17,000 residents, where one of the biggest investments in Danish history is now underway.\n\nWe are the centre of where the medicine starts \u2013 Martin Damm\n\nStepping off the train on the outskirts of Kalundborg, an hour northwest of Copenhagen, passengers are greeted by birdsong and construction noise. It's an unlikely spot for what is now the epicentre of a global weight-loss revolution.\n\nAcross a railway bridge stand the grey, boxy buildings of Novo Nordisk's sprawling industrial site. This is where half of the world's insulin is made. It's also where semaglutide is produced, the game-changing active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\n\"We are the centre of where the medicine starts, the core substance,\" Kalundborg's mayor Martin Damm told me, as we toured the plant's perimeter, a vast site covering 1.6 million sq m, equivalent to the size of 224 football pitches.\n\n\"Now you're coming into crane land,\" announces Damm. I quickly counted about 20 of them towering over new concrete structures and temporary cabins.\n\nAn eye watering $8.6bn (DKK60bn) will be spent here over the next few years, which will see 1,250 new jobs added to the plant's 4,400-strong workforce. It's also brought 3,000 construction workers to the area. \"We have a rule of thumb, when you have one job inside the industry, that will generate three jobs outside,\" stated Damm.\n\nGetty Images Novo Nordisk has been expanding its already vast production complex in Kalundborg (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nTwo-thirds of Denmark's GDP growth came from just four boroughs. All share one thing in common: they're where Novo Nordisk premises are located. Among them Kalundborg saw a staggering 27% growth rate in 2022, according to the most recent data available. \"We were number one,\" says Damm, adding that unemployment in the area, once high a decade ago, is now among the region's lowest.\n\nNovo Nordisk's swelling corporate tax bill has lifted the municipality's finances, which has splashed out on a public swimming area, and plans for a new culture house and library. More than 1,250 homes will be built, and ground has been broken for a new motorway to Copenhagen.\n\nYet despite this income, local primary schools lag behind on subjects like maths, and the area has a higher rate of overweight children, prompting some criticism.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, locals in Kalundborg were measured about seeing the benefits just yet. \"Businesses opening and closing, that's the same,\" says Lonny Frederiksen, who runs a hair salon in the town. \"But young people have more opportunities today.\"\n\nMany workers commute rather than living in Kalundborg, adds customer Gitte Pedersen, while lamenting the heavy traffic. \"Sometimes I have to wait [because of the] queues and I don't like that.\" But she's optimistic about the town's future, \"It will bring a lot of jobs. In a few years we'll see the difference.\"\n\nInsatiable Demand\n\nFor a century Novo Nordisk's business was built on making insulin, but the discovery of semaglutide's weight-loss effect, marked a turning point. \"It is really transforming into a new firm,\" says Kurt Jacobsen, a professor at Copenhagen Business School, who's authored a book on the company.\n\nWegovy and Ozempic belong to a class of drugs called GLP-1s, that help control blood sugar and suppress appetite. Ozempic got US approval in 2017, followed in 2021 by Wegovy, which is now available in thirteen countries, including China.\n\nMore than half of Novo Nordisk's sales were in the United States, where tens of thousands of new Wegovy users have signed up weekly for prescriptions. There it costs more than $1,000 (\u00a3746, \u20ac958) a month, compared to only $92 (\u00a373/\u20ac88) in Germany, and many insurers refuse to cover it.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing last year, Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly asked Novo Nordisk's chief executive officer Lars Frugaard J\u00f8rgensen why Americans pay more, demanding the company \"Stop ripping us off!\" In response, the firm blamed the complexities and \"middlemen\" of the American healthcare system.\n\nGetty Images Demand for the weight-loss drug semaglutide has soared globally (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nA big impact on a small economy\n\nFor a company with its headquarters in a small nation with less than six million people, Novo Nordisk's rise has had an outsized impact. \"There are other companies that also play a big role in the economy, Maersk especially, but nothing on this scale,\" says Las Olsen, chief economist at Danske Bank. \"This is the largest ever.\"\n\nIn 2023 Denmark ranked among Europe's fastest-growing economies, as GDP expanded by 2.5%, and half of that was driven by the pharmaceutical sector. After a big boost from drug exports, the government now anticipates that growth in 2024 was 3.0% and will be 2.9% this year. It's also the country's largest taxpayer, and accounted for a fifth of all new jobs, while many Danes and pension funds hold shares.\n\n\"In a way Denmark is like the rest Europe, but a little stronger. Then with Novo Nordisk on top, we're a lot stronger,' says Olsen.\n\nDriving through the building area, you just get surprised how massive it is for a small town \u2013 Shaun Gamble\n\nDollars flooding into Denmark from overseas sales have put pressure on the krone. The knock-on effect is lower borrowing costs. \"We have slightly lower interest rates than the euro area, which is a very direct result of all this money inflow,\" explains Olsen.\n\nMore like this:\n\nConversely, in recent months, the firm's previously sky-high stock price has been hammered, after trial results for two new anti-obesity treatments disappointed investors. It prompted a sell-off so huge that Denmark's currency briefly weakened. However, successful early trial data for another new weekly jab saw shares swing up again in January.\n\nAnd there are concerns that Novo Nordisk is outgrowingDenmark and could make the economy more vulnerable. Comparisons have been drawn with Finland, where the economy slumped in 2007, as mobile giant Nokia failed to compete with new smartphones. But most experts here aren't too worried about a similar outcome.\n\n\"Most would agree that there is a low probability,\" says Carl-Johan Dalgaard, chair of Denmark's Economic Council. \"Of course, the probability is not zero. If you have an economy that harbours industrial superstars most would find it a big plus.\"\n\nHowever when a few large firms dominate a country's economy \u2013 and that's increasingly the picture in Denmark \u2013 there can be other drawbacks, suggests Dalgaard. \"There's a worry that with economic influence, you might also eventually see political influence emerging, which could have policy consequences.\"\n\nAdrienne Murray The presence of the Novo Nordisk manufacturing plant in Kalundborg has given local businesses a boost (Credit: Adrienne Murray)\n\nBut there are new risks on the horizon. Amid tensions over the control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has threatened potential tariffs on Danish goods, and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen recently summoned leaders of the country's biggest companies for a meeting. \"It has been hinted at from the US side that there may unfortunately be a situation where we work less together than we do today,\" says Frederiksen.\n\nAmong those present was Novo Nordisk's J\u00f8rgensen, and following the company's earnings announcement on 5 February 2025, he told reporters the business was well-prepared, but \"not immune\".\n\n\"Tariffs are always a bad idea,\" says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. However he reckons, \"Of all the countries in the EU, nobody would be more resilient to US tariffs than arguably Denmark. A company as sophisticated as Novo Nordisk (which also has production outside Denmark) would be able to insulate themselves.\"\n\n'In five years, it'll be totally different here'\n\nBesides Novo Nordisk, a string of large international businesses have emerged from Denmark including shipping giant Maersk, brewer Carlsberg and toymaker Lego. Many are partly owned by charitable foundations. The model gives longer-term stability and prevents firms being easily broken up, says Mette Feifer, vice president of the Danish Chamber of Commerce. \"If Novo Nordisk were not owned by a foundation, I don't think it would be Danish at this moment. It would have been sold 10 or 20 years back.\"\n\nThe company's philanthropic foundation is now the world's richest, and in 2023 it showered $1.3bn (\u00a31bn/DKK9.1bn) in grants on hundreds of projects, in Denmark and beyond.\n\nBack in Kalundborg a new educational campus has sprung up training the next generation of life sciences workers. Among several institutions, Helix Lab is financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and gives Masters students access to research labs and placements with local biotech firms.\n\nAdrienne Murray The Helix Lab is helping to train the next generation of scientists in Kalundborg (Credit: Adrienne Murray)\n\n\"You have the industry right across the street, and you can collaborate more closely with them,\" says Maria Riquelme Jimenez, a chemical engineering student from Mexico, who hopes to eventually find work with Novo Nordisk.\n\n\"It really gives them an advantage for future jobs,\" adds Anette Birck, director of Helix Lab. It's also helping to attract talent and providing opportunities for Kalundborg's youth, she says.\n\nOverlooking the town's smart waterfront sits Costa Kalundborg Kaffe, owned by New Zealander Shaun Gamble. \"Driving through the building area, you just get surprised how massive it is for a small town,\" he says. His coffee shop has seen a pick-up in customers and he's noticed more international students moving to the area, as well as local businesses opening up. \"There has been a change. It's still in its infancy, but I can feel it,\" he said. \"In five years, it'll be totally different here \u2013 in a good way.\"\n\n--",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \u201cflexible\u201d nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \u201c2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\u201d the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo\u2019s revelation. The price of Novo\u2019s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo\u2019s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk\u2019s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Novo purchased the drug in question, ocedurenone, from Singapore-headquartered KBP in October 2023. At the time, Novo\u2019s Head of Development Martin Holst Lange touted the drug\u2019s \u201cbest-in-class potential.\u201d\n\nOcedurenone was ultimately tossed out of Novo\u2019s pipeline in November 2024 after failing a Phase III trial in chronic kidney disease. The failure cost Novo about $800 million in impairment charges .\n\nNow, Novo has appealed to the Singaporean court to freeze the assets of KBP\u2019s founder and chairman, Huang Zhenhua, as a wider lawsuit is prepared back in New York. According to a judgment dated February 14, a judge in Singapore has ruled that Novo has an arguable case. Novo is seeking $830 million in damages, which roughly amounts to what it has already paid out through the terms of the deal.\n\nDespite promising to disclose all relevant materials to support ocedurenone, \u201cKBP knowingly failed to disclose material information,\u201d the judge ruled. That included Phase II data showing that ocedurenone was not effective, plus quality and compliance issues at a test site that produced false positive results.\n\nNovo specifically called out Huang, who executed the purchase agreement on the biotech\u2019s behalf. \u201cDr. Huang arguably knew and participated in these misrepresentations,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe was the founder, executive chairman and a 40% shareholder of KBP. There is a good arguable case that when Dr. Huang executed the [asset purchase agreement] he did so conscious of the unfavourable data.\u201d\n\nThe judge granted Novo\u2019s request to freeze Huang\u2019s assets.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) released its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report on Feb. 5. The Denmark-based company performed pretty well, leading to a post-earnings jump in its stock price.\n\nThough Novo Nordisk's financial performance was strong, it's worth pointing out several other things management mentioned during its earnings conference call with analysts. Here are two important insights from that call that should excite investors about Novo Nordisk's future.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe runaway leader in the GLP-1 market\n\nNovo Nordisk's work in the GLP-1 space has been instrumental to its success in recent years. The company's famous medicines, diabetes treatment Ozempic and anti-obesity medicine Wegovy, have been on fire.\n\nHowever, some investors are worried that Novo Nordisk will lose significant market share to its longtime rival, Eli Lilly, in the GLP-1 market. Eli Lilly developed its own GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which target diabetes and obesity, respectively. In one head-to-head study, Zepbound even proved superior to Wegovy in helping patients shed excess weight.\n\nDespite the challenge from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk remains the runaway leader in this fast-growing space. As Novo Nordisk's CFO, Karsten Munk Knudsen, said during the earnings call:\n\nWe are serving almost two-thirds of the global GLP-1 market and then competition [is] sitting on the remaining one-third. Specifically for the last year, just to have hard data, we have expanded patient reach ... more in absolute numbers, more than any other competitor in this market.\n\nNovo Nordisk's continued dominance in this field is why its financial results remain impressive. In 2024, the company's revenue grew by 25% year over year to 290.4 billion Danish kroner ($40.4 billion). Ozempic's sales came in at 120.3 billion DKK ($16.8 billion), 26% higher than in 2023. Wegovy's revenue jumped by 86% year over year to 58.2 billion DKK ($8.1 billion).\n\nIt's no wonder Novo Nordisk's shares jumped following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report.\n\nKey clinical milestones on the way\n\nEven though Novo Nordisk is still leading the GLP-1 market, competition will become stronger in this space in the coming years. Many drugmakers are looking to dip their toes into this therapeutic area, as are many smaller biotech companies. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its GLP-1 products; in 2024, Ozempic and Wegovy made up 61.5% of Novo Nordisk's total sales.\n\nBut the company also has a GLP-1 pipeline that's just as strong as that of any of its peers, if not stronger. Says Novo Nordisk's Martin Holst Lange, executive VP and head of clinical development:\n\nWe expect the first phase 3 results from CagriSema [in type 2 diabetes], as well as phase 2 results for both subcutaneous ... amycretin and [a] once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 co-agonist. Moving to obesity and the first half of '25, we are now expecting to submit ... semaglutide (25 milligrams) for people with obesity to the U.S. regulatory authorities in the first quarter.\n\nSo, Novo Nordisk has several investigational GLP-1 products across diabetes and obesity that will produce clinical trial results this year. Some of them have already produced promising data in other studies. CagriSema delivered a mean weight loss of 22.7% in a 68-week phase 3 study; even though that was short of the 25% mean weight loss that management was targeting, it beat Wegovy in the trial. A subcutaneous version of amycretin also performed well in a phase 1b/2a study.\n\nNovo Nordisk seems to have a GLP-1 medicine development engine that grants it an edge against almost any other pharmaceutical company. It's a pioneer in this field and can lean on many successes -- and failures -- to continue pumping out promising products in this area. So, despite mounting competition, the Denmark-based drugmaker should remain a leader in GLP-1 drugs.\n\nWhy Novo Nordisk is a strong buy\n\nNovo Nordisk has been looking to diversify its lineup in recent years, and is developing medicines in other fields. The company recently reported positive phase 3 results for Mim8 in patients with hemophilia. It has products across several other fields: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and more.\n\nIts rich pipeline, a lineup that's still driving solid top-line growth, and long track record of innovation make Novo Nordisk a stock worth buying and holding onto for a while.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema.\n\nHagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) released its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report on Feb. 5. The Denmark-based company performed pretty well, leading to a post-earnings jump in its stock price.\n\nThough Novo Nordisk's financial performance was strong, it's worth pointing out several other things management mentioned during its earnings conference call with analysts. Here are two important insights from that call that should excite investors about Novo Nordisk's future.\n\nThe runaway leader in the GLP-1 market\n\nNovo Nordisk's work in the GLP-1 space has been instrumental to its success in recent years. The company's famous medicines, diabetes treatment Ozempic and anti-obesity medicine Wegovy, have been on fire.\n\nHowever, some investors are worried that Novo Nordisk will lose significant market share to its longtime rival, Eli Lilly, in the GLP-1 market. Eli Lilly developed its own GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which target diabetes and obesity, respectively. In one head-to-head study, Zepbound even proved superior to Wegovy in helping patients shed excess weight.\n\nDespite the challenge from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk remains the runaway leader in this fast-growing space. As Novo Nordisk's CFO, Karsten Munk Knudsen, said during the earnings call:\n\nWe are serving almost two-thirds of the global GLP-1 market and then competition [is] sitting on the remaining one-third. Specifically for the last year, just to have hard data, we have expanded patient reach ... more in absolute numbers, more than any other competitor in this market.\n\nNovo Nordisk's continued dominance in this field is why its financial results remain impressive. In 2024, the company's revenue grew by 25% year over year to 290.4 billion Danish kroner ($40.4 billion). Ozempic's sales came in at 120.3 billion DKK ($16.8 billion), 26% higher than in 2023. Wegovy's revenue jumped by 86% year over year to 58.2 billion DKK ($8.1 billion).\n\nIt's no wonder Novo Nordisk's shares jumped following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report.\n\nKey clinical milestones on the way\n\nEven though Novo Nordisk is still leading the GLP-1 market, competition will become stronger in this space in the coming years. Many drugmakers are looking to dip their toes into this therapeutic area, as are many smaller biotech companies. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its GLP-1 products; in 2024, Ozempic and Wegovy made up 61.5% of Novo Nordisk's total sales.\n\nBut the company also has a GLP-1 pipeline that's just as strong as that of any of its peers, if not stronger. Says Novo Nordisk's Martin Holst Lange, executive VP and head of clinical development:\n\nWe expect the first phase 3 results from CagriSema [in type 2 diabetes], as well as phase 2 results for both subcutaneous ... amycretin and [a] once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 co-agonist. Moving to obesity and the first half of '25, we are now expecting to submit ... semaglutide (25 milligrams) for people with obesity to the U.S. regulatory authorities in the first quarter.\n\nSo, Novo Nordisk has several investigational GLP-1 products across diabetes and obesity that will produce clinical trial results this year. Some of them have already produced promising data in other studies. CagriSema delivered a mean weight loss of 22.7% in a 68-week phase 3 study; even though that was short of the 25% mean weight loss that management was targeting, it beat Wegovy in the trial. A subcutaneous version of amycretin also performed well in a phase 1b/2a study.\n\nNovo Nordisk seems to have a GLP-1 medicine development engine that grants it an edge against almost any other pharmaceutical company. It's a pioneer in this field and can lean on many successes -- and failures -- to continue pumping out promising products in this area. So, despite mounting competition, the Denmark-based drugmaker should remain a leader in GLP-1 drugs.\n\nWhy Novo Nordisk is a strong buy\n\nNovo Nordisk has been looking to diversify its lineup in recent years, and is developing medicines in other fields. The company recently reported positive phase 3 results for Mim8 in patients with hemophilia. It has products across several other fields: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and more.\n\nIts rich pipeline, a lineup that's still driving solid top-line growth, and long track record of innovation make Novo Nordisk a stock worth buying and holding onto for a while.",

            "content": "Finally, some good news for Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) shareholders!\n\nTwice in the past two months, the Danish manufacturer of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and diabetes treatment has reported clinical trial results for refinements of its original Ozempic and Wegovy drugs. Twice in the past two months, investors have been disappointed by the numbers -- 22.7% average weight loss over 68 weeks for CagriSema, and 20.7% weight loss for a 72-week regimen of semaglutide 7.2 milligram (mg).\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nOn Friday, however, Novo Nordisk announced top-line results in yet another trial. While the results don't initially sound as good as those in the trials cited above, however, the speed at which they were achieved has investors cheering, and Novo Nordisk stock is up 7.7% through 10:50 a.m. Friday morning.\n\nWhat Novo Nordisk announced\n\nNovo Nordisk describes its latest work as \"a phase 1b/2a clinical trial with amycretin, a unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist intended for once weekly subcutaneous administration.\" (Which is to say, you take a shot once a week.)\n\nStudied over 36 weeks, in doses from 1.25 mg to 20 mg, patients taking amycretin experienced only \"mild to moderate\" gastrointestinal side effects, says Novo, and in exchange enjoyed a 9.7% average reduction in body weight.\n\nThat's a pretty big change in a pretty short time, roughly half as much time as the semaglutide 7.2 mg study for half as much weight loss, and Novo Nordisk says it is \"very encouraged\" by this outcome. Based on the results, Novo says it is \"planning further clinical development of amycretin.\"\n\nIs Novo Nordisk stock a buy?\n\nAdmittedly, we're talking about an early-stage trial here, basically halfway along the trek from phase 1 to phase 3. Still, the results seem to be encouraging investors. And there's another thing they might find encouraging: At 27.4 times earnings today, Novo Nordisk stock costs barely one-third the P/E ratio of Novo's closest competitor in GLP-1 weight loss drugs, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). If you're looking for a cheap weight-loss stock, Novo Nordisk stock is it.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "EY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nWe recently published a list of the 10 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO ) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA survey by Deloitte showed that drug pricing and access are the top concerns among executives in 2025. The survey also showed that the primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. Due to this trend, executives anticipate an increase in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nWe discussed the future of the healthcare industry in the US in a recently published article on the 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 drug stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJim Cramer on Novo Nordisk (NVO): \u2018Be Careful\u2019 Amid Trump Impact\n\nAn elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a global healthcare company specializing in diabetes care. It develops, discovers, manufactures, and markets pharmaceutical products. Its operations are divided into two business segments: biopharmaceuticals and diabetes and obesity care. The latter segment covers GLP-1, insulin, and other protein-related products. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is one of the two major pharmaceutical companies competing in the GLP-1 weight loss market, with the other being Eli Lilly.\n\nWhile both companies have approved weight loss medicines leading the market with billions in revenue, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is working on a new oral weight loss pill that may transform the market if approved. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen said that the company plans to file for regulatory approval for its oral weight loss drug in the United States in the coming months. If the company gains approval, it may be able to launch the drug as early as next year, which is when Eli Lilly also plans the release of its weight loss drug.\n\nApart from potential optimism surrounding this oral weight loss drug, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is functioning on strong fundamentals. Fiscal 2024 was a strong year for the company, with sales climbing 25% to $40.6 billion. It also raised its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40, which includes an interim dividend of DKK 3.50 distributed in August. This is the 29th consecutive year of dividend growth at NVO. In 2025, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) expects a free cash flow of around DKK 75 to 85 billion and sales growth of 16-24% at constant exchange rates.\n\nOverall, NVO ranks 10th on our list of best drug stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The two companies have approved weight loss drugs that are generating billions in revenue, and there's still much more growth on the horizon. Over the past 12 months, however, it's been Eli Lilly that has been the far better buy, rising more than 17%, while Novo Nordisk's stock has fallen by over 30%.\n\nBut investors shouldn't read too much into this performance as Novo Nordisk just posted a solid quarter, and there's plenty of reason to remain bullish on the healthcare stock this year. Here's why the stock may be a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales and profits soared in Q4\n\nLast week, Novo Nordisk released its year-end results, including how it performed over the last three months of 2024. Net sales for the quarter totaled 85.7 billion Danish kroner ($12 billion) and rose by 30% year over year. Its quarterly profit of 28.2 billion Danish kroner ($3.9 billion) increased by a slightly lower rate of 29%, but it came in comfortably higher than the 26.1 billion Danish kroner ($3.7 billion) that analysts were expecting.\n\nAll in all, it was a solid quarter for the business, with the company's GLP-1 weight loss treatment, Wegovy, more than doubling its sales during the period. The company is expecting a more modest growth rate moving forward, however, with sales expected to rise between 16% and 24% this year. It projects its operating profit to rise between 19% and 27%. Both growth rates are at constant exchange rates.\n\nThe results, unfortunately, weren't enough to lift shares of Novo Nordisk much higher, as investors likely weren't thrilled with the slowing growth projections. However, as the company builds out manufacturing capacity to ensure it can meet demand for its products, its growth rate may accelerate in the future.\n\nAnd there's one thing investors should watch out for later this year, which could light a fire under the healthcare stock and finally get it going.\n\nOral weight loss pill could soon obtain approval\n\nWegovy is a weekly injectable weight loss treatment, which may not be ideal for all patients. The company has, however, been working on a weight loss pill, which could be a game-changer for the market. Whichever healthcare business has the more effective pill could be the one that rakes in the most sales in the GLP-1 market.\n\nNovo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen says that the company plans to file for regulatory approval for its oral weight loss drug in the U.S. in the next few months, and if all goes well, it may be able to launch as early as next year. Eli Lilly also says its oral pill may be available next year.\n\nWhen Novo Nordisk files for approval for the drug, that could generate excitement around the stock, potentially resulting in a big, overdue rally.\n\nNovo Nordisk is an underrated stock to buy right now\n\nAlthough Novo Nordisk's stock has been struggling of late, this is still an exceptionally strong business to invest in. It's growing at a solid rate, and its profit margin is also high. The stock's valuation is attractive as it trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (based on analyst estimates) of just 23. That's much cheaper than rival Eli Lilly, which trades at more than 38 times its expected future profits.\n\nWhile both stocks are good buys for the long haul, Novo Nordisk may have more upside this year, given its significantly lower valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo's REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \"flexible protocol\" which gave patients the ability \"to modify their dosing throughout the trial.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \"flexible\" nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \"2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\" the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo's revelation. The price of Novo's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo's stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.\n\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.\n\nTo learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn, on X, or on Facebook.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk A/S is a global healthcare company specializing in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical products to treat diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

            "content": "In the GLP-1 weight loss market, it's largely been a two-horse race between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%). The two companies have approved weight loss drugs that are generating billions in revenue, and there's still much more growth on the horizon. Over the past 12 months, however, it's been Eli Lilly that has been the far better buy, rising more than 17%, while Novo Nordisk's stock has fallen by over 30%.\n\nBut investors shouldn't read too much into this performance as Novo Nordisk just posted a solid quarter, and there's plenty of reason to remain bullish on the healthcare stock this year. Here's why the stock may be a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales and profits soared in Q4\n\nLast week, Novo Nordisk released its year-end results, including how it performed over the last three months of 2024. Net sales for the quarter totaled 85.7 billion Danish kroner ($12 billion) and rose by 30% year over year. Its quarterly profit of 28.2 billion Danish kroner ($3.9 billion) increased by a slightly lower rate of 29%, but it came in comfortably higher than the 26.1 billion Danish kroner ($3.7 billion) that analysts were expecting.\n\nAll in all, it was a solid quarter for the business, with the company's GLP-1 weight loss treatment, Wegovy, more than doubling its sales during the period. The company is expecting a more modest growth rate moving forward, however, with sales expected to rise between 16% and 24% this year. It projects its operating profit to rise between 19% and 27%. Both growth rates are at constant exchange rates.\n\nThe results, unfortunately, weren't enough to lift shares of Novo Nordisk much higher, as investors likely weren't thrilled with the slowing growth projections. However, as the company builds out manufacturing capacity to ensure it can meet demand for its products, its growth rate may accelerate in the future.\n\nAnd there's one thing investors should watch out for later this year, which could light a fire under the healthcare stock and finally get it going.\n\nOral weight loss pill could soon obtain approval\n\nWegovy is a weekly injectable weight loss treatment, which may not be ideal for all patients. The company has, however, been working on a weight loss pill, which could be a game-changer for the market. Whichever healthcare business has the more effective pill could be the one that rakes in the most sales in the GLP-1 market.\n\nNovo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen says that the company plans to file for regulatory approval for its oral weight loss drug in the U.S. in the next few months, and if all goes well, it may be able to launch as early as next year. Eli Lilly also says its oral pill may be available next year.\n\nWhen Novo Nordisk files for approval for the drug, that could generate excitement around the stock, potentially resulting in a big, overdue rally.\n\nNovo Nordisk is an underrated stock to buy right now\n\nAlthough Novo Nordisk's stock has been struggling of late, this is still an exceptionally strong business to invest in. It's growing at a solid rate, and its profit margin is also high. The stock's valuation is attractive as it trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (based on analyst estimates) of just 23. That's much cheaper than rival Eli Lilly, which trades at more than 38 times its expected future profits.\n\nWhile both stocks are good buys for the long haul, Novo Nordisk may have more upside this year, given its significantly lower valuation.",

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Novo Nordisk shares have tumbled more than 9%, following an ad during the Super Bowl from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+2.69% ), which promoted its off-brand Ozempic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe controversial ad took a surprisingly political tone \u2014 with Donald Glover\u2019s \u201cThis Is America\u201d as its soundtrack \u2014 criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWelcome to weight loss in America \u2014 a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,\u201d said a narrator in the commercial. \u201cThere are medications that work \u2014 but they are priced for profits, not patients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad briefly featured the company\u2019s GLP-1 injections. The weekly treatment contains compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. In May, Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide injections for just $199 a month \u2014 hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic\u2019s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy\u2019s $1,349 price tag.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. However, due to their high retail price, U.S. patent protections, and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a medication is in shortage, which Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy has been for years, the FDA allows pharmacies to make compounded or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s executive vice president of U.S. operations, David Moore, told investors on a call last week that the compounded market is having an impact on the company\u2019s demand, and that impact is \u201cgrowing faster\u201d than anticipated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk reported, this month, that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%.\n\nBoth Novo Nordisk, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.90% ), have been ramping up production of their GLP-1 medications to remove them from the FDA\u2019s drug shortage list, a goal Eli Lilly achieved late last year. The pharmaceutical giants have also filed petitions with the FDA to have their medications added to a list of drugs deemed too complex to compound safely. Novo Nordisk even took out a newspaper ad this week warning of the risks of taking copycat drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t Novo Nordisk\u2019s only recent setback. In December, the company\u2019s experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema \u2014 touted as a potential successor to Ozempic \u2014 fell short of expectations. The drug failed to hit the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by analysts and the company, with patients in a phase 3 trial shedding an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The disappointment sent Novo\u2019s stock plunging 20% in a single day.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares are now down more than 34% over the past year, and it has lost its crown as Europe\u2019s most valuable company to luxury conglamorate LVMH (MC+1.44% ) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Hims & Hers has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 500% in the past year.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other foreign dividend stocks.\n\nDividends have historically been a key driver of investor returns, contributing 85% of the broader market's total return since 1960. In Q3 2024, global dividends hit a record $431.1 billion, despite a drop in special one-off dividends. Underlying dividend growth remains strong at 6.4% for 2024.\n\nSome markets saw major milestones. According to a Janus Henderson report, China, India, and Singapore hit record-high dividends, while the US got a boost from Big Tech firms, which started paying dividends for the first time. In fact, 96% of US companies either increased their payouts or kept them steady. Financials and tech were the biggest growth drivers, while mining and transport lagged behind.\n\nIndia stood out in a big way, and its dividends surged 27.4% to a record $16.2 billion in Q3. Nearly every company posted double-digit increases, and a whopping 97% of Indian companies in the Janus Henderson index have raised or maintained dividends over the last two years, well above the global average. Japan and Canada also continued their upward trend in the third quarter, with a 6.1% and 6.5% increase in dividends, respectively. On the other hand, Europe\u2019s dividend growth slowed a bit to 3.9%, and the UK saw a 7% drop in dividends, mainly because a few commodity giants slashed payouts to manage debt and weak profits.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region was a mixed bag. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia saw dividend declines in Q3, while Singapore and South Korea posted steady gains. Meanwhile, Brazil\u2019s dividends plunged 42% in Q3, but since Brazilian companies have irregular payout patterns, the drop is not as dramatic as it seems. Elsewhere in emerging markets, Saudi Arabia and Thailand were among the strongest performers in the third quarter. Despite some regional setbacks, the overall outlook for dividends remains positive, with financials and tech leading the charge globally.\n\nFor years, international stocks have taken a backseat to the dominance of major US tech companies, but that trend could be shifting. A combination of global factors is making foreign equities more attractive to investors, with the main reason being the recent decline of the US dollar against the euro and other major currencies since last October. Given this, we will take at some of the best foreign dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out foreign dividend stocks. Next, we manually searched for the average upside potential of each stock and selected 13 stocks with the highest values. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of February 12. We have also mentioned the dividend yields and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:\n\nhttps://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=128985&wire=3\n\nNVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\n\nCASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their \u201cREDEFINE 1\u201d trial, \u201ca 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.\u201d The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo\u2019s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo\u2019s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\n\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical powerhouse behind the blockbuster Ozempic, has been riding a wave of success. Ozempic, a treatment for type 2 diabetes that has also gained widespread attention for its weight loss benefits, has helped fuel Novo Nordisk\u2019s recent stock performance. But what\u2019s in store for Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price over the next few years? Whether you're an investor or considering jumping in, let\u2019s dive into the forecast for 2025, 2026 and 2030.\n\nCurrent Overview of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) Stock\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) has seen significant growth over the past year, with its stock price at $78.83. With a market cap of nearly $354.59 billion, the company has been riding high on the success of its diabetes and obesity treatments, primarily Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs have generated massive demand, catapulting Novo Nordisk to new heights in the pharmaceutical world. Ozempic, in particular, has become a blockbuster, earning widespread recognition not just for its diabetes treatment but also for its ability to help patients lose weight \u2013 a dual benefit that has made it a market leader.\n\nThe sentiment around Novo Nordisk remains bearish, with 33% of trading days in the last month showing gains, there are concerns about whether the stock may be undervalued in the short term. Technical indicators suggest that the stock is trading 2.09% below forecasted levels, leading some analysts to caution investors that a pullback could be on the horizon.\n\nDespite these concerns, Novo Nordisk\u2019s position as a leader in the diabetes and obesity markets, coupled with its continued focus on innovation, makes it a formidable player in the long term. Short-term volatility remains a risk, particularly as the stock has dropped by 34.60% over the past year, potentially signaling a price correction.\n\nMethodology for Stock Price Prediction\n\nTo predict the future stock price of Novo Nordisk, we use a combination of technical analysis, fundamental analysis and expert opinions. Technical analysis looks at historical stock movements and trading patterns, helping to forecast future trends. Fundamental analysis examines the company\u2019s financial health \u2013 revenue, earnings, P/E ratio and growth potential \u2013 while expert opinions give additional insight based on market sentiment, company news and industry trends. Combining these three approaches can offer a balanced outlook on Novo Nordisk's stock performance in the coming years.\n\nOzempic Stock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, analysts predict that Novo Nordisk stock could experience volatility. According to current forecasts, the stock is expected to trade between $76.71 and $109.20, representing a 38.53% increase from its current value. While the company continues to grow, some experts believe the stock is trading at a premium and a correction is due.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s P/E ratio is currently higher, driven by investor enthusiasm around Ozempic and its growing market share. A slight dip in price could be healthy, allowing the stock to stabilize before continuing its long-term growth trajectory. The current sentiment remains bullish, but short-term volatility is expected.\n\nOzempic Stock Price Prediction for 2027\n\nBy 2026, Novo Nordisk's outlook continues to brighten. The stock is projected to climb to $120.46, marking a 52.81% increase from its current price. This growth is expected to be driven by continued demand for Ozempic and Wegovy and new innovations in diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk\u2019s strategic focus on expanding its product portfolio in other therapeutic areas, such as cardiovascular diseases, will likely contribute to this growth.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Novo Nordisk\u2019s EBITDA is expected to grow steadily, with analysts forecasting stronger revenues as the company continues to dominate its core markets. If these predictions hold, the P/E ratio will likely remain high, reflecting investor confidence in the company\u2019s ability to generate long-term profits.\n\nOzempic Stock Price Prediction for 2030\n\nFast-forward to 2030 and Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock could be soaring. The stock is projected to hit $295.20, representing a 274.48% increase from today\u2019s price. This long-term prediction assumes that Novo Nordisk will continue to innovate in the diabetes and obesity space while also expanding into new therapeutic areas. Ozempic and Wegovy are expected to remain key drivers of revenue, but the company\u2019s ability to diversify its product line will be critical for maintaining this growth.\n\nBy 2030, Novo Nordisk\u2019s P/E ratio is expected to stabilize, reflecting a more mature growth phase as the company cements its dominance in key markets. Revenues could exceed expectations if the company successfully expands its reach in emerging markets and develops next-generation therapies.\n\nAgree with these predictions?

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now.\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.\n\nBut the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.\n\n\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Alcohol\u2019s cancer risk should be clearly labeled on drinks, Surgeon General says\n\nThe drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThere are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what\u2019s already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.\n\nFor the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.\n\nFirst, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.\n\nThen, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.\n\nFor nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.\n\nDuring the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.\n\nEveryone in the study was overweight. It\u2019s unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.\n\nSmokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.\n\nThe study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "content": "Initiative marks first investment of global health partnership between the Gates Foundation, Novo Nordisk Foundation, and Wellcome to address global health challenges that disproportionately impact people living in low- and middle-income countries\n\nSEATTLE, COPENHAGEN, LONDON (February 12, 2025) \u2013 The Gates Foundation, Novo Nordisk Foundation, and Wellcome today announced the launch of the Gram-Negative Antibiotic Discovery Innovator (Gr-ADI), a $50 million investment that will focus on combatting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by a specific range of bacteria that are among the leading contributors to AMR-associated deaths. The Gr-ADI will function as a consortium where multiple funders, research institutions, and industry partners share data and work collectively to drive innovation in the discovery of urgently needed new drugs.\n\nThe Gr-ADI is the first investment of the $300 million launched global health research and development partnership by these three philanthropic organisations last year. The broader partnership will support science and innovation to advance solutions to health challenges that disproportionately impact people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including climate and sustainability; infectious diseases; and the interplay between nutrition, immunity, infectious diseases, cardiometabolic and other noncommunicable diseases and developmental outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe AMR crisis continues to grow. We urgently need effective solutions to prevent a future of few to no treatments for drug-resistant infections,\u201d said Alexander Pym, director of infectious disease at Wellcome. \u201cAccelerating the discovery of new types of antibiotics and finding new ways to kill bacteria is key to tackling this global threat and protecting those in regions with the highest burden, such as Africa and Asia. Our best chance is to collaborate on innovative new approaches to antibiotic development.\u201d\n\nAMR is a serious global health threat that is directly responsible for an estimated 1.14 million deaths a year, contributes to an additional 4.71 million deaths annually, and results in significant economic costs. Despite this growing problem, the world faces an antibiotic pipeline marked by a shortage of new drugs and limited access to those that exist.\n\n\u201cPatients in Nigeria, where I live and work, and in other settings across Africa, Asia, South America, and the Caribbean that have resistant infections, do not have access to effective treatments and are also not well placed to benefit from antimicrobial resistance innovations in the pipeline,\u201d said Iruka N. Okeke, professor of pharmaceutical microbiology at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. \u201cMoreover, Africa has the highest infectious disease burden, and resistant organisms spread rapidly across the continent, predominantly affecting the most vulnerable. This is why efforts like the Gr-ADI to innovate solutions to combat AMR caused by bacteria that disproportionately impact countries in Africa and other LMICs are so important.\u201d\n\nBacterial AMR occurs when bacteria no longer respond to the antibiotics developed to combat them. This undermines the foundation of modern medicine by turning common infections and everyday procedures into potentially life-threatening situations.\n\n\u201cBacterial AMR is such a significant global health issue that we must speed up innovation and try new ways of working together,\u201d said Marianne Holm, vice president, infectious diseases at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. \u201cThrough the Gr-ADI program, grant recipients will not only focus on their individual projects but will also become integral members of a consortium dedicated to data sharing, with a focus on specific Gram-negative bacteria. For many researchers involved in this program, it will be a new way of working, but we believe that it can make a big difference as we search for new discoveries.\u201d\n\nProjects funded through the Gr-ADI will be selected by the partners through a request for proposals (RFP) that leverages the Gates Foundation\u2019s Grand Challenges platform, an initiative that has fostered innovation to solve key global health and development problems for more than 20 years.\n\nThe focus of this RFP will be on the discovery of antibiotics with broad spectrum activity against Enterobacteriaceae, the Gram-negative family of bacteria that includes Klebsiella spp., which is the pathogen that should be used in proposed projects. Enterobacteriaceae are included on the World Health Organization\u2019s list of critical priority pathogens and are among the leading contributors to global AMR-associated deaths, disproportionately impacting people living in low- and middle-income countries where the drivers of AMR are exacerbated by poverty and inequality.\n\n\u201cNew drugs are critical to preventing needless deaths from the superbugs created by AMR,\u201d said Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Gates Foundation. \u201cAn unconventional model of drug discovery and development\u2014driven by innovative approaches and cross-organisation collaboration\u2014 could be the key to unlocking the pipeline of antibiotics that can be used to target drug-resistant pathogens. We\u2019ve seen this work incredibly well in other areas, like tuberculosis (TB) drug development, and I have confidence that this is the right approach for combatting bacterial AMR.\u201d\n\nThe call for proposals will close on March 25, 2025. Researchers, particularly from countries where AMR poses a serious threat, are encouraged to submit a proposal for the Gram-Negative Antibiotic Discovery Innovator here.\n\nAbout the Novo Nordisk Foundation\n\nEstablished in Denmark in 1924, the Novo Nordisk Foundation is an enterprise foundation with philanthropic objectives. The vision of the Foundation is to improve people\u2019s health and the sustainability of society and the planet. The Foundation\u2019s mission is to progress research and innovation in the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic and infectious diseases as well as to advance knowledge and solutions to support a green transformation of society.\n\nAbout Wellcome\n\nWellcome supports science to solve the urgent health challenges facing everyone. We support discovery research into life, health and wellbeing, and we\u2019re taking on three worldwide health challenges: mental health, infectious disease and climate and health.\n\nAbout the Gates Foundation\n\nGuided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, we work with partners to create impactful solutions so that people can take charge of their futures and achieve their full potential. In the United States, we aim to ensure that everyone\u2014especially those with the fewest resources\u2014has access to the opportunities needed to succeed in school and life. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Mark Suzman, under the direction of Bill Gates and our governing board.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV).

Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.\n\nTELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT)\n\nClass Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025\n\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company\u2019s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International\u2019s declining profitability was tied to the Company\u2019s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International\u2019s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company\u2019s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\n\nFor more information on the TELUS International class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TIXT\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nClass Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025\n\nThe Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk\u2019s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1,\u201d while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk\u2019s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the \u201cflexible protocol\u201d limited the study\u2019s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nFor more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nClass Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025\n\nThe complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\n\nFor more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU\n\nModivCare, Inc.

As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled \"ModivCare Provides Financial Update.\" Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, \"primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships.\" On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.\n\nFor more information on the ModivCare class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MODV\n\nAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:\n\nBragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and certain of the Company\u2019s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as.\n\nInvestors have until March 25, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713.\n\nWhy was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nNovo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nNovo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1\u2019s trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its anticipated results\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \u201cflexible\u201d nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to \u201cmodify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

            "content": "Two healthcare stocks in the white-hot weight-loss segment tanked on Monday as one of their rivals zoomed higher. The decliners were Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%), famously the company behind Wegovy, and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 3.90%), which is far along in its development of an advanced GLP-1-based obesity treatment. The gainer was Hims & Hers Healthcare (HIMS 5.07%).\n\nOn the day, the latter company's share price rose by over 5%, while Novo Nordisk's slid by almost 3%, and Viking took a more than 7% tumble.\n\nA very highly visible TV ad\n\nThe largest TV advertising platform in the world is American football's Super Bowl, and Hims & Hers was one of the adventurous companies parting with millions of dollars to place an ad during the event. Cleverly targeting the high-demand, weight-loss drug segment, the company dramatically pushed its obesity offerings in a cutting-edge, one-minute spot.\n\nIt's important to note here that Hims & Hers is largely a telehealth company that effectively serves only as a retailer of weight-loss drugs -- it has neither developed them nor brought them to market. It is currently utilizing a legal loophole that allows it to sell compounded semaglutide, the molecule behind Wegovy.\n\nBy contrast, Novo Nordisk is both the developer and seller of Wegovy, while Viking Therapeutics's VK2735 has posted impressive results in testing and is now in the later stages of development. Wegovy is a market leader and the current go-to drug, and VK2735 has an excellent chance at success given its performance in clinical trials.\n\nSo this is basically Hims & Hers aggressively positioning itself as the face of obesity drugs. Even if only a sliver of the Super Bowl audience accepts this, millions of people are sure to identify the company as the source of cutting-edge, weight-loss medications. On Monday, this gave Hims & Hers investors confidence and worried those who've put money in peer obesity drug stocks.\n\nThe market over-reacted\n\nHims & Hers deserves kudos for being so bold in its marketing approach. I'm not convinced any positive effect will be long-lasting for the company, though. It's more than possible the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will shut down the company's compounded weight-loss drug business; such are the perils of legal loopholes.\n\nBy the same token, I wouldn't sell either Novo Nordisk or Viking simply because of a rival's ad no matter how highly visible and effective it might be. Those companies are walking the walk with obesity drugs and, as such, both stand a much greater chance of benefiting from their continued popularity.",

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Novo Nordisk (NVO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNovo Nordisk currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 73.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVO\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVO\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Novo Nordisk here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Novo Nordisk, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

If doctors who read the papers describing clinical-trial results are rushing to get a new drug, that is an indication that it\u2019s really promising.\n\nHis colleagues\u2019 use of Wegovy and Zepbound reminds him of the use of statins, drugs that lower cholesterol, in their early days. Cardiologists, who were most familiar with the consequences of high cholesterol levels, were among the first to take the drugs in large numbers.\n\nMany newly thin cardiologists and diabetes specialists, like so many of their patients, had risk factors for heart disease.

Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, et al., No. 25-cv-00713.\n\nWhy was Novo Nordisk Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nNovo Nordisk is a healthcare company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. During the relevant period, Novo Nordisk was conducting its highly anticipated Phase 3 study, REDEFINE-1, for CagriSema, an investigational drug developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nNovo Nordisk discussed REDEFINE-1's trial protocol and anticipated results, stating that, after a dose escalation period, participants receiving CagriSema were to receive a once-weekly maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide for the remainder of the trial period. In truth, REDEFINE-1 employed a flexible dosing design that left it to patient discretion to choose both their maintenance dose and any decision to lower the dosing during the trial. This undisclosed trial design introduced a heightened risk that jeopardized the Company's ability to achieve its anticipated results\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk announced that CagriSema had missed its expected average weight loss target at the conclusion of the REDEFINE-1 trial. The Company attributed its diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \"flexible\" nature of the protocol whereby patients were able to \"modify their dosing throughout the trial.\" This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients taking the contemplated maintenance dose at the end of the trial. On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock declined roughly 18% during the course of the trading day, from a closing price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024 to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024.\n\nClick here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/novo-nordisk-as.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk A/S is a global healthcare company specializing in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical products to treat diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 10 High Growth Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Strategies of Fisher:\n\nCompared with many other firms, Fisher Investments' most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm\u2019s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market.\n\nFisher\u2019s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity.\n\nDiversified Portfolio and Sector Emphasis:\n\nThe firm\u2019s holdings express Fisher\u2019s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher\u2019s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%).\n\nIn 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion. The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher's long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher's portfolio.",

            "content": "Drug industry groups target Hims & Hers Super Bowl ad touting weight loss drug\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Super Bowl commercials aren't cheap. Here's what brands pay. Brands like Dunkin', Uber Eats and Coors Light are willing to pay millions of dollars for Super Bowl commercials\n\nDrug industry allies are calling out a Super Bowl ad touting its weight loss medications from telehealth company Hims & Hers, claiming the spot doesn't adequately disclose safety risks of these drugs.\n\nThe ad criticizes the $160 billion weight loss industry and shows a person selecting the company's weight-loss offerings via smart phone. Although the ad does not identify the medication, Hims & Hers offers compounded versions of the weight-loss drug semaglutide, which was developed by Novo Nordisk and is typically sold under the names Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nThe Partnership for Safe Medicines, a group consisting of more than 40 community and pharmacy groups, asked the Food and Drug Administration to \"take action\" and \"protect Americans from misleading marketing in health products.\" The group also requested Fox, which will broadcast Sunday's game, to withdraw the \"deeply troubling advertisement\" before it airs Sunday.\n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing drug manufacturers, said the ad violates a federal rule that requires drug ads not to be false or misleading. The ad has been posted on YouTube in advance of Sunday's title game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSee the ads and vote: Rate the ads on Ad Meter\n\nFriday, Sens. Dick Durbin, D- Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said in a letter to the FDA the ad risks misleading patients because it omits information about the drugs safety and side effects.\n\nHims & Hers, which markets weight loss and other medications, said the company isn't a drug manufacturer and doesn't need to adhere to the same advertising standards. The San Francisco-based company connects customers to licensed health providers who perform an online evaluation and prescribe medications if appropriate. The company said it follows advertising requirements for telehealth platforms.\n\nIn a statement, Hims & Hers said the drug industry is attempting to cancel an ad that \"directly calls out how they are part of a system that fails to prioritize the health of Americans. The system is broken, and this is just another example of how they don\u2019t want Americans to know they have options.\"\n\nWhy are groups concerned about the ad?\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to the FDA, the Partnership for Safe Medicines said the 1-minute ad is \"misleading in its entirety\" because it doesn't disclose compounded drugs are not FDA approved and can be riskier for patients. The organization also challenged language that the drug was \"formulated in the USA.\" Hims & Hers markets \"knockoff versions of semaglutide \u2013 a drug that was formulated by Novo Nordisk following decades of research and billions in investment,\" the letter said.\n\nNeither the FDA nor Fox responded to the group's letters as of Thursday afternoon, according to Shabbir Imber Safdar, the group's executive director.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, PhRMA said the ad doesn't cite potential risks and side effects from compounded GLP-1 drugs. The ad shows images of drug while describing the products as \"life changing weight-loss medications\" and \"doctor-trusted,\" PhRMA said.\n\nA worldwide audience is expected to tune into Sunday's matchup, a rematch of the tightly contested 2023 Super Bowl. Last year's game between the Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers drew more than 123 million viewers with more than 202 million watching at least a portion of the game.\n\nDrug companies at odds with compounding pharmacies\n\nAmid the Super Bowl ad dispute is a larger battle playing out between drug companies that market lucrative weight-loss drugs and firms that sell less expensive versions made by compounding pharmacies.\n\nThe FDA allows compounding pharmacies to sell copies of drugs when the medications are in short supply. But compounding pharmacies face stiffer restrictions when a drug shortage is resolved.\n\nHims & Hers markets compounded versions of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, a medication that remains in shortage, the FDA said. Novo Nordisk sells the drug under the brand names Wegovy to treat obesity and heart disease and Ozempic to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn December, the FDA declared that Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes medication tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, was no longer in short supply. That means pharmacies have until Feb. 18 to discontinue \"compounding, distributing or dispensing\" tirzepatide. Suppliers that produce batches of the drug and sell to others have until March 19 to cease distribution.\n\nCompounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy and source ingredients are usually obtained from factories registered with the FDA. However, the federal agency doesn't verify the safety or effectiveness of compounding pharmacies.",

Image credit: Shutterstock / JHVEPhoto\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s haemophilia A therapy Mim8 stopped bleeding completely in 74.3% of children in a Phase III trial.\n\nThe FRONTIER3 trial (NCT05306418) achieved its co-primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant and superior reduction of treated bleeding episodes with both once-weekly and once-monthly Mim8 versus no prophylaxis treatment and prior coagulation factor prophylaxis treatment in 70 children aged one to 11 years. The drug has also been evaluated in adults and adolescents.\n\nFollowing the positive data, Novo Nordisk expects to make its Mim8 regulatory submission in 2025.\n\nHaemophilia A is a rare blood disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII (FVIII), a clotting protein, meaning a patient\u2019s blood struggles to clot.\n\nMim8 is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that activates coagulation factor IX and factor X, in paediatric patients aged between one and 11 years, in two parts. In the first part, patients received once-weekly doses of Mim8 administered under the skin for 26 weeks. In part two, patients could continue with once-weekly dosing or move to once-monthly dosing for the remaining 26 weeks. Patients were able to stay on inhibitors during the FRONTIER3 study.\n\nDuring part one, the mean average annualised bleeding rate (ABR) for treated bleeds was 0.53 while the median was 0. In total, 74.3% of patients suffered no treated bleeds while all children with haemophilia A with inhibitors reported zero treated bleeds.\n\nAfter completing the initial 26 weeks of the study, 45% of participants chose to move to once-monthly Mim8, and the rest remained on the once-weekly dose. Parents and guardians of patients in the trial stated that they saw an improvement in the child\u2019s quality of life (QoL), with 73% saying they \u2018very strongly\u2019 preferred Mim8 to prior treatment.\n\nLudovic Helfgott, executive vice president for rare disease at Novo Nordisk said: \u201cMim8 is designed with the aim to offer treatment flexibility based on individual lifestyles, so it is encouraging to see that patients and caregivers in these analyses prefer Mim8 over their previous treatment.\n\n\u201cAt Novo Nordisk, our commitment to the rare bleeding disorders community compels us to reduce limitations in the lives of children with haemophilia and their families.\u201d\n\nIn May 2024, the Danish pharma-giant announced data from the FRONTIER2 trial, a pivotal Phase IIIa study (NCT05053139), which showed that 86% of patients treated weekly, as well as 95% of those treated monthly, experienced no treated bleeds. This was in contrast to 0% of those without prophylaxis. The FRONTIER 2 trial evaluated Mim8 in adolescents and adults.\n\nFRONTIER1 (NCT04204408) was a Phase I/II trial, which evaluated the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Mim8.\n\nNovo Nordisk not the only company in the game\n\nThe current standard of care (SOC) for paediatric haemophilia A patients is Factor VIII replacement, as well as Roche\u2019s Hemlibra (emicizumab), which is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that restores the hemostatic process by bridging IXa and factor X. GlobalData predicts sales of Hemlibra to reach $5.53bn in 2030 while Novo Nordisk\u2019s therapy is set to reach $926m in the same year.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nAnother big name in the game is Sanofi announced data from a Phase III trial of its haemophilia A drug ALTUVIIIO (efanesoctocog alfa) in paediatric patients in March 2023. Sanofi\u2019s trial (NCT04759131) reported a median ABR of 0 and a mean ABR of 0.61. The therapy is approved for adults and children in the US and Europe. GlobalData predicts sales of Sanofi\u2019s therapy to reach \u00a33.1bn in 2030.",

            "content": "Individualized treatment could boost weight loss with Novo Nordisk\u2019s up-and-coming treatment CagriSema, which disappointed investors late last year after failing to meet the company\u2019s own bar of 25% weight reduction.\n\nNovo has recently released two readouts from its closely watched weight loss pipeline. The first was for CagriSema, which combines the active ingredient of Wegovy and Ozempic, semaglutide, with cagrilintide. The second, and more successful readout, was for amycretin , which showed 22% weight loss in results posted in January.\n\nDuring a fourth quarter earnings call Wednesday, Novo Executive Vice President of Development Martin Holst Lange revisited the CagriSema readout, aiming to boost sentiment toward the Phase III asset, which is further along in the clinic than amycretin, the latter having just wrapped Phase Ib/IIa testing.\n\nLange himself had set expectations high for CargiSema, saying on a third quarter earnings call last year that the investigational drug could achieve weight loss of 25%. When the December 2024 readout came back showing only 22.8% after 68 weeks, Novo lost $72 billion in market cap. Analysts at the time called this an unforced error.\n\nLange presented a posthoc analysis of the Phase III REDEFINE 1 trial to investors, who were eager to hear any tidbit of data from the company\u2019s weight loss pipeline. Novo now believes that treatment regimens should be tailored to each patient, and there may need to be a re-calibration of the dose at some point.\n\n\u201cThe REDFINE 1 data indicate that a patient-centric and individualized treatment regimen, which takes the initial dose escalation, dose re-escalation and trial duration into account, could potentially enhance efficacy of CagriSema while maintaining a favorable safety profile,\u201d Lange said.\n\nThe trial data were split up after the fact into a few subgroups. The first included 57% of the total population on the highest dose of 2.4 mg. This group had 12.7% mean weight loss at 20 weeks and 22.2% at 68 weeks. These participants did not see their weight loss plateau, as has been a concern with existing GLP-1s. This group also had fewer gastrointestinal side effects, which Lange said suggests they could keep going and experience steeper weight loss at the high dose.\n\nThe second group, with 29% of the participants, received the lowest doses, on average just 1.1 mg. This cohort experienced 15.9% mean weight loss at 20 weeks and just cleared Novo\u2019s high bar at 25.1% by 68 weeks. These participants were approaching a normal BMI at the end of treatment, according to Lange. This group could titrate up and see further weight loss, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile it may appear counterintuitive that lower doses of CagriSema leads to more substantial weight loss, this pattern is consistent with the observations from the STEP and STEP UP trials with semaglutide\u2014however, it appears to be more pronounced with the potent biology of CagriSema,\u201d he explained.\n\nAnalysts continued to be confused about the inverse dose response on the earnings call, with some asking why this wasn\u2019t more pronounced in earlier trials. CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen pointed to the potency of the product. \u201cThese differences will be amplified,\u201d he said.\n\nHe brushed off concerns about how physicians will respond to the nuanced dosing requirements in the marketplace, because providers already examine patient characteristics carefully before prescribing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps less confusing for physicians than we believe, because they\u2019re actually used to patients responding quite differently on treatment and that goes for obesity,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen said. \u201cI think it\u2019s up for the rest of us to acknowledge that this is a new sign we get in large scale clinical development, but it\u2019s really linked to the potency of the product.\u201d\n\nCagriSema is moving into a Phase III trial called REDEFINE 11, where Novo will examine a longer duration, dose escalation and dose re-escalation.\n\nNovo will also put CagriSema head-to-head against Eli Lilly\u2019s rival GLP-1 tirzepatide, which is approved for weight loss as Zepbound, in a trial called REDEFINE 4. The trial will read out in the second half of this year. Lange said the main goal will be non-inferiority to show that CagriSema is at least as good as Lilly\u2019s option. The R&D executive is confident based on existing data that Novo will meet or exceed that bar.\n\nBut this time around, Lange resisted the call to set a bar for success. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to speculate, but we will see the data when we see them.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "The Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Government of Denmark have now agreed how the Foundation will implement its DKK 10 billion contribution in support of the green transition within the framework of the Green Tripartite agreement.\n\nThe Novo Nordisk Foundation will allocate DKK 10 billion (\u20ac1.34 billion) over the next 10 years to support specific projects and initiatives that can especially contribute to land conversion that supports nature and biodiversity to benefit people throughout Denmark based on the agreement in principle with the Government of Denmark announced in June 2024.\n\nA framework has now been confirmed for how the DKK 10 billion to contribute to the green transition is expected to be implemented within the agreement. The Foundation\u2019s funds are expected to be used for projects in which public and private actors collaborate and for projects the Foundation supports alone or in collaboration with other foundations and private actors. The framework has been formulated in collaboration with the Government of Denmark and is available in Danish here.\n\n\u201cThe Novo Nordisk Foundation allocating DKK 10 billion is crucial for initiatives that support the green transition. We have a massive societal task to accomplish, and the Foundation\u2019s support will make a huge difference to Denmark\u2019s landscape and how we experience nature in the future. The Foundation will allocate money to create large coherent natural areas and for afforestation so that we will experience an even greener Denmark. The Foundation also plans to allocate money for research projects to achieve even better solutions related to biodiversity, developing agricultural crops and sustainable agriculture,\u201d says Jeppe Bruus, Minister for the Green Tripartite.\n\nThe DKK 10 billion from the Foundation is not being pooled with the DKK 43 billion set aside by the Government of Denmark and will be allocated to specific projects the Foundation chooses. The Government of Denmark and the Foundation will regularly coordinate to ensure that these projects support the joint visions.\n\n\u201cThe Green Tripartite agreement is an ambitious vision for a new map of Denmark with more nature and more modern and sustainable agriculture that will affect many people in Denmark. The initiative is fully aligned with the Foundation\u2019s goal of promoting knowledge and solutions that support the green transition of society, and we are proud to be able to contribute to this important joint endeavour,\u201d says Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nGrants over the next 10 years\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s grants for projects that support the goals of the Green Tripartite agreement will be awarded over the next 10 years under the following three categories:\n\nLand conversion\n\nResearch and innovation\n\nCommunity engagement\n\n\u201cWe think that the Foundation\u2019s funds can be optimally used under these three categories and that they can complement the initiatives that have been agreed politically. Many diverse initiatives are needed both nationally and locally to carry out this important and complex task,\u201d says Lars Hansen, Project Director for the Green Tripartite at the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nLand conversion\n\nThe Foundation plans to use about 75% of the allocated funds, corresponding to about DKK 7.5 billion, for projects focusing on land conversion, mostly to accelerate the creation of large coherent natural areas and afforestation.\n\nThe grants will mainly support projects carried out by established operators and foundations that already have the necessary skills and experience. The Foundation will therefore not purchase and convert land with its funds.\n\n\u201cDeveloping major land conversion projects typically takes several years if they are to be well embedded locally, and projects and initiatives are already underway among competent actors who have worked within this field for many years. We will focus on two things: strengthening ongoing land conversion projects and contributing to identifying new projects that could, for example, emerge from local green tripartite agreements,\u201d elaborates Lars Hansen.\n\nResearch and innovation\n\nThe other main category to which the Foundation has allocated funds is promoting research and innovation. The grants for these types of projects will focus on developing and implementing knowledge and technology to be used to support the visions of the Green Tripartite agreement.\n\nThe Foundation already awards grants for research and innovation in this category and in related areas. The projects that will be supported within the framework of the Green Tripartite agreement should be effective as soon as possible and within the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to accelerate and further develop research and innovation in areas such as plant-based food production, biodiversity and climate and environmental effects. We will focus on applied research, including testing new and existing technologies. The goal of the financial support for this category is that new technologies and methods will be able to be tested and integrated more rapidly on agricultural fields,\u201d explains Lars Hansen.\n\nThe Foundation plans to allocate about 15% of the total funds, corresponding to about DKK 1.5 billion, for research and innovation projects.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nImplementing the Green Tripartite agreement is a complex task that will require collaboration from many partners such as the municipalities, civil society organisations and landowners. The Foundation has therefore set aside funds to support community engagement and democratic participation in connection with the changes that will take place in Denmark\u2019s communities over the coming decades.\n\n\u201cA prerequisite for good local embeddedness is involving the relevant partners. By allocating funds to support community engagement, we want to help to ensure that the appropriate competencies and knowledge at the local level can carry out the ambitious restructuring we will be carrying out,\u201d says Lars Hansen.\n\nThe Foundation plans to allocate about 5% of the total funds, corresponding to about DKK 500 million, to support community engagement relating to Green Tripartite initiatives.\n\nThe Foundation has preliminarily allocated the remaining 5% of the total funds as a contingency to be awarded depending on how the initiatives within the three categories develop. Likewise, the overall allocation of funds between the three categories could change over time.\n\nFurther information\n\nThe grants for projects within the framework of the Green Tripartite agreement will be managed and awarded according to the Foundation\u2019s standard grant procedures. The grants are expected to be awarded based on open calls for applications and on dialogue with applicants.\n\nMore information about applying for grants, the latest information on the opportunities to apply and an overview of the grants that have been awarded is available here.",

Image credit: Shutterstock/ Kittyfly.\n\nNovo Nordisk is planning a new Phase III trial for CagriSema, the company\u2019s next-generation obesity drug touted as a potential successor to Wegovy (semaglutide), as the company aims to quell uncertainty over the therapy\u2019s efficacy ceiling.\n\nThe Danish drugmaker plans to conduct the trial, called REDEFINE 11, with a longer duration and focus on dose escalation and reescalation. Announcing the trial in a Q4 earnings call for 2024 to investors, Novo\u2019s executive vice president of development Martin Holst Lange said the study is slated to begin in the first half 2025, with the company expecting to submit the CagriSema package to regulatory authorities in the first half of 2026.\n\nCagriSema combines the GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide, used in blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, with dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist cagrilintide.\n\nThis roadmap comes six weeks after Novo released data from the Phase III REDEFINE 1 trial (NCT05669755) that fell short of the company\u2019s expectations. Despite hitting its primary endpoints, patients on CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 22.7% compared to a reduction of 16.1% with semaglutide or 11.8% with cagrilintide after 68 weeks. Novo had set a 25% weight loss reduction as a goal for the experimental drug.\n\n\u201cWhile the 25% weight loss was not observed in REDEFINE 1, we are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema, which stands out as one of the most substantial weight reductions observed in a clinical Phase IIIa trial,\u201d Lange said in the earnings call.\n\nNovo said that the trial\u2019s flexible design \u2013 meaning that patients could scale their dosing based on side effects \u2013 meant that the weight loss seen after 68 weeks might not have been the ceiling of the drug\u2019s potential. In the high-dose subgroup by the end of the follow-up, weight loss had not started to plateau. \u201cThis suggests that additional weight loss could be achieved with a trial of longer duration,\u201d Lange explained.\n\nAdditionally, the company said data from the lower dose sub-group indicates that \u201chigher doses through increased focus on dose escalation, dose reescalation, as well as longer treatment duration\u201d could lead to higher weight loss.\n\nIn the meantime, eyes will be on the ongoing REDEFINE 2 trial \u2013 expected to read out in Q1 this year. A 68-week Phase III study like REDEFINE 1, REDEFINE 2 is evaluating CagriSema in type 2 diabetes patients who are also either obese or overweight.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said the company \u201cremains confident in [CagriSema\u2019s] potent biology and looks forward to further exploring its potential and to making it available to patients.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot riding on CagriSema as Novo Nordisk aims to quell the erosion of its GLP-1RA market share by Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro (tirzepatide). Mounjaro has demonstrated higher weight loss in head-to-head trials and is expected to outsell Wegovy by nearly $15bn by 2030.\n\nNovo reported total sales of $42bn for 2024, up 26% over 2023. Sales of Wegovy soared 86% higher than 2023, reaching sales of $8.4bn. Shares in the Copenhagen-listed company rose 6% at market open following the Q4 results.

A : The US market for anti-obesity medicines grew by 160% last year, and Wegovy prescriptions doubled from 100,000 to over 200,000. Early in the year, prescription trends are affected by changes in benefit plans and patient co-pays. We are focusing on driving new prescriptions and have increased the supply of starter doses to meet demand. - David Moore, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development\n\nThe company completed the acquisition of Catalent sites, enhancing its global fill and finish footprint, which will support future market supply expansion.\n\nNovo Nordisk AS ( NYSE:NVO ) maintained its leadership in the GLP-1 market, serving nearly two-thirds of all patients on GLP-1 treatments.\n\nThe company expanded its patient reach, now serving over 45 million patients with diabetes and obesity treatments.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: How do you think the profile of CagriSema will stack up versus competitors, and what are your thoughts on REDEFINE 4? A: In REDEFINE 4, CagriSema will be compared to semaglutide. We expect to establish non-inferiority and potentially superiority based on REDEFINE 1 results, but it's too early to speculate on the outcomes. - Martin Lange, Executive Vice President, Development\n\nQ: Can you explain the discrepancy in weight loss profiles in REDEFINE 1 and what this means for REDEFINE 2? A: We observed two distinct groups in REDEFINE 1: those who titrated to the full dose and early responders who lost weight faster. The latter group showed potential for more weight loss with longer treatment. This individual response pattern will inform future trials, including REDEFINE 11. - Martin Lange, Executive Vice President, Development\n\nQ: How do you see the positioning of amycretin versus CagriSema, and what is the timing for the Phase 3 program for amycretin? A: With the size of the obesity market, having a broad portfolio is key. Amycretin offers scalability and flexibility with both injectable and oral formulations. We are planning further clinical development based on promising Phase 1/2 data. - Camilla Sylvest, Executive Vice President, Commercial Strategy and Corporate Affairs\n\nQ: How do you plan to manage the situation with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for semaglutide in the US? A: Semaglutide products are selected for the second round of CMS negotiations. The process will conclude in November, with the maximum fair price effective from January 2027. We oppose government price setting and are monitoring the situation closely. - David Moore, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Here is Morningstar\u2019s take on Novo Nordisk\u2019s results and the outlook for the stock.\n\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Novo Nordisk\n\nWhat We Thought of Novo Nordisk Q4 Earnings\n\nNovo Nordisk grew its top line and operating profit by 25% in 2024, as insulin rebate adjustments drove performance ahead of consensus. Sales of GLP-1 products were in-line with consensus. Guidance for 2025 is 16%-24% constant-currency sales growth plus a 3% currency tailwind.\n\nWhy it matters: Novo\u2019s guidance for 2025 reflects several trends that investors are interested in, such as GLP-1 demand, competitive positioning versus Eli Lilly, and headwinds from supply issues or pricing pressure. We think guidance reflects stronger supply and demand in 2025 than our prior expectations.\n\nWe now think the GLP-1 market could grow 42% in 2025, from 54 billion USD to 77 billion USD, with Novo Nordisk seeing 30% GLP-1 growth. We still see a more than 200 billion USD GLP-1 market by 2031.\n\nLilly\u2019s Zepbound proved more effective than Wegovy in a recent head-to-head study, and we expect Lilly to gain 5 percentage points of GLP-1 share in 2025, trimming Novo\u2019s lead.\n\nThe bottom line: We\u2019re raising our fair value estimate to 640 DKK/89 USD per share/ADR from 600 DKK/86 USD to incorporate a stronger near-term outlook for Novo, and we remain confident in the firm\u2019s innovation supporting its wide moat.\n\nWe\u2019ve raised our 2025 sales growth forecast from 14.5% to 20.9%, within Novo\u2019s guidance and factoring in the currency tailwind.\n\nWith cagrisema\u2019s obesity filing pushed to the first quarter of 2026 due to supply issues, we now expect cagrisema to launch in 2027.\n\nNovo Nordisk Stock Price\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nComing up: While we\u2019re less bullish on upcoming semaglutide\u2019s potential in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (data later this year) as the launch would likely come after Medicare negotiation begins in 2027, we\u2019re focused on additional phase 3 data for cagrisema, particularly head-to-head against Zepbound.\n\nFollowing amycretin\u2019s very strong midstage data, we\u2019re awaiting more information on its clinical path before adding this to our model.\n\nIf shortages persist, compounders are likely to continue to take share of patients in the US, and Novo commented that this competition has been more meaningful than it has expected. With a continuing official shortage of semaglutide in the US, we think Novo will face some (perhaps more limited) supply constraints in 2025, but guidance builds in the ability to grow volumes by more than 30%. Novo is filing oral semaglutide in the US in the first half and it could launch in obesity (25 mg dose) in 2026, but we note that Novo has opted not to file the higher 50 mg dose and has also delayed cagrisema\u2019s filing, both likely due to supply constraints.\n\nDiving deeper into cagrisema\u2019s phase 3 data in the Redefine-1 study, management provided more detail on the efficacy and tolerability profile of the combination treatment which we think could provide rationale for more personalized treatment regimens in obesity. While physicians are already aware of differences in responses between patients, we expect there to be more official guidance on titrating patients based on their initial response with a potential cagrisema approval, in order to maximize both efficacy and tolerability. However, with cagrisema\u2019s launch likely in 2027, we think this gives Lilly time to become more entrenched with Zepbound, and cagrisema is likely to stabilize market share rather than reverse previous declines.\n\nNovo Nordisk Stock vs. Morningstar Fair Value Estimate\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.

For people with Type 2 diabetes, CKD can be a significant burden and can cause additional sickness, including increased risk of cardiovascular problems and death.\n\n\"Type 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of chronic kidney disease, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular outcomes,\" said Richard E. Pratley, medical director at the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute Orlando, Fla., and co-chair of the FLOW Trial. \"A large portion of patients I treat experience serious kidney complications and comorbidities, with some even requiring dialysis. Today's decision by the FDA offers hope for the millions of adults living with both conditions and provides an additional treatment option, representing a significant advancement for my patients.\"\n\n[Read more: SoWell debuts supplement system for GLP-1 users]\n\nThe FDA initially approved Ozempic in 2017 to improve blood sugar (glucose), along with diet and exercise, in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In 2020, Ozempic was granted an additional indication to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke or death in adults with Type 2 diabetes with known heart disease.",

            "content": "For Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the present and future are about weight-loss drugs.\n\nThe two companies dominate the market for GLP-1 drugs, which are prescribed for diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy have collectively raked in more than $40 billion in sales.\n\n\u201cThe story continues to be about market expansion for obesity,\u201d David Moore, president of Novo Nordisk \u2019 s US business, told analysts on Wednesday morning.\n\nNovo Nordisk \u2019 s drugs entered the market earlier than Eli Lilly \u2019 s. Appetite for Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes, appears to have moderated, while Wegovy demand is still growing. They currently have the larger market share, but Eli Lilly \u2019 s newer drugs might have more room to grow.\n\nSales of Mounjaro, which is also prescribed for diabetes, doubled between 2023 and 2024, and sales of Zepbound increased by 2,684% during the same period. \u201c We believe both products are still very early in their launch cycle,\u201d Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks told analysts on Thursday.\n\nThe types of ailments that GLP-1s can be prescribed for are also growing, with Zepbound recently getting approval from the FDA to treat sleep apnea. Some early studies have also shown that it may be able to treat alcoholism.\n\nOral GLP-1 drugs, which would entice consumers not keen on jabbing themselves each week, are the next frontier. Novo Nordisk already has a once-daily pill on the market, Rybelsus.\n\nBut being able to keep up with demand for drugs currently on the market might be their biggest challenge. The boom in popularity of GLP-1 drugs has led to manufacturing bottlenecks, which has made way for compounding pharmacies to eat at their market share.\n\nThe FDA declared a shortage of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, in December 2022, and didn \u2019 t take it off the shortage list until December 2024. During that period, Eli Lilly reported spending more than $10 billion in capital expenditures, much of which went to expanding manufacturing.\n\n\u201c From a manufacturing standpoint, I really wouldn \u2019 t want to be anyone other than Lilly or Novo at this point,\u201d Mizuho Healthcare equity strategist Jared Holz told Yahoo Finance. \u201c When you consider how much they \u2019 ve invested behind capex and the supply chain logistics, it \u2019 s been overwhelming.\u201d\n\nSemaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk \u2019 s Ozempic and Wegovy, remains on the FDA \u2019 s shortage list. This allows compound versions of the drug to be sold by online pharmacies like Hims & Hers.\n\nThe company said it expects supply improvements in 2025. \u201c We are focused on doing that as fast as possible as we believe this will help our further actions to curtail compounding in the future, \u201d Novo Nordisk \u2019 s Moore told analysts. \u200b\n\nOutsourcing Facilities Association, a trade organization representing compounding pharmacies like Hims & Hers, has previously sued the FDA to try to keep tirzepatide on the shortage list. They may soon have a more sympathetic leader at the helm of that agency: President Trump nominated Marty Makary, who is currently chief medical officer of compounding pharmacy Sesame, to lead the FDA.",

But since their peak in June last year, shares have fallen some 40%.\n\nInvestors were worried ahead of the results about potentially slowing demand for obesity drugs in the United States. U.S. rival Eli Lilly last month forecast fourth-quarter sales of weight-loss drug Zepbound below Wall Street estimates, leading the stock to fall 8% though the shares have since recovered.\n\n\"We see an intact strong demand for obesity treatments in the U.S. and elsewhere,\" Novo's CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists on a call.\n\nLilly shares were up nearly 2% in pre-market U.S. trade on Wednesday, with the company scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday.\n\nLukas Leu, fund manager at healthcare-focused Bellevue Asset Management in Switzerland, which holds Novo shares, told Reuters the mid-point of Novo's 2025 sales growth outlook was reassuring, though the range was very wide.\n\nNovo Nordisk was the first-mover in an obesity drug market that some analysts forecast could be worth about $150 billion by the early 2030s, but is now facing fierce competition from Lilly.\n\nNovo lost out to Lilly in the fourth quarter in terms of total weekly prescriptions written for Wegovy compared to Lilly's Zepbound in the United States, the biggest market.\n\nFuture drug pipeline\n\nNovo is looking for new drug candidates to secure future growth. Its patent for the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic expires by 2032 in the United States.\n\nNovo unveiled disappointing results for one of these drug candidates, CagriSema, in a late-stage trial in December, sending its shares down as much as 27% on the day in one of the biggest one-day wipeouts for a European company.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nNovo Nordisk is planning a new Phase 3 trial of its next-generation obesity drug CagriSema that will test different doses and longer duration of treatment, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement comes six weeks after the Denmark-based company released data from another Phase 3 trial that underperformed executives\u2019 expectations on weight loss. Other studies are ongoing, including one with results due this quarter, and Novo plans in early 2026 to ask for regulatory approval of CagriSema.\n\nNovo, which pioneered the use of GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy for weight loss, is in a tight competition with Eli Lilly. The rivalry sharpened when Lilly\u2019s drug Zepbound showed it helped people lose more weight than Wegovy in a head-to-head trial, a finding that put greater scrutiny on Novo\u2019s pipeline.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNovo had suggested they would conduct further trials when the Phase 3 study Redefine-1 read out in December. On Wednesday, alongside earnings for the fourth quarter, executives gave further detail on their research plans based on data analyses they\u2019ve conducted since then.\n\nTrial volunteers receiving the highest dose of CagriSema at the end of Redefine-1 lost less body weight, about 22%, than people who got lower doses. In the new trial, dubbed Redefine-11, the high dose will tested for longer than the 68 weeks Redefine-1 ran.\n\nSome participants on lower doses in Redefine-1, meanwhile, had reduced them because of gastrointestinal side effects. Novo wants to test whether re-escalating their doses in Redefine-11 can drive further benefit than the 25% body weight loss this group experienced.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal described Novo\u2019s additional results as \u201chead-scratcher data\u201d because the weight loss and side effect profile don\u2019t match up to what is typically seen as dose levels increase. That could have been because of how fast Novo researchers escalated dosing in the Phase 3 trial, Agrawal wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cA lot of fine-tuning still needs to be done on dosing,\u201d he wrote, adding that people in the low-dose group hit a plateau at around 52 weeks while those in the higher-dose group didn\u2019t appear to have at the trial\u2019s end at week 68.\n\nNovo reported total sales of 290 billion kroner, or about $42 billion, for 2024, a 26% increase over 2023. Sales of Wegovy reached 58 billion kroner, or $8.4 billion, an 86% increase.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to reflect follow-up analysis from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal.",

In 1923, Nordisk Insulinlabororium began commercializing insulin. In 1925, former Nordisk employees established their own company: Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Both spent the next several decades competing in the diabetes field, until they merged in 1989 to form Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nIt was hardly a surprise to see so many votes for Novo Nordisk. At industry trade shows and events, everyone is talking about this company and its semaglutide products: Ozempic and Wegovy. Some analysts have predicted that Wegovy could become one of the best selling drugs ever because of the huge demand for weight management solutions. With Novo Nordisk struggling to manufacture high enough product quantities, its parent company, Novo Holdings, launched an unexpected acquisition of CDMO Catalent for $16.5 billion in 2024. Three of Catalent\u2019s fill-finish sites were then sold to Novo Nordisk.\n\nNovo Nodisk is also investing in capacity for other drug areas. In mid-December, it announced an investment of 8.5 billion Danish kroner (approximately $1.18 billion) to create a brand new modular production facility in Odense, Denmark, that will span over 40,000 m2. However, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Recently, the company announced results from a phase III trial of CagriSema (a fixed dose combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide). Trial participants lost around 22.7 percent of their body weight, but share prices in Novo Nordisk dropped \u2013 because many in the market had been expecting a weight loss benchmark of 25 percent.\n\nHonorable mention: Pfizer\n\nFor the full list of winners, click here.",

Sign up for NBC LA's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe drug maker posted a 107% year-on-year increase in Wegovy sales to 19.87 billion Danish kroner ($2.76 billion) in the three months to the end of December, slightly missing the 20.02 billion Danish kroner forecast by analysts.\n\nNovo Nordisk closed up 4.5% Wednesday. Shares of obesity drug rival Eli Lilly, meanwhile, rose 1.4%.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Wednesday, CEO and President Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen said that the company now expects to be able to bring a weight loss pill to the U.S. market before Eli Lilly. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's current weight loss treatments are administered via injection, but oral formats are considered the next frontier in expanding patient accessibility.\n\n\"We actually think we can compete in the U.S. market with tablet-based treatment before Lilly can launch,\" J\u00f8rgensen told CNBC's Silvia Amaro.\n\nJ\u00f8rgensen said that Novo Nordisk would submit its oral treatment for U.S. regulatory approval \"within a couple of months\" with a view to launching next year. Lilly is currently developing an oral obesity pill, Orforglipron, which it said last month could receive regularly approval by early 2026.\n\n\"We have a really broad portfolio of different, say, biologies \u2014 also both injectable and tablet-based \u2014 and that really caters for a strong position in catering for many different patient needs from both an efficacy point of view and a convenience point of view,\" J\u00f8rgensen added.\n\nOverall sales at the company \u2014 which also produces diabetes and rare disease treatments \u2014 increased 30% in the fourth quarter and 26% on the year at constant exchange rates. That growth was driven primarily by demand from the North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.\n\nNovo Nordisk forecast slower sales growth for 2025 of between 16% to 24% at constant exchange rates, below the 18% to 26% forecast for 2024. This forecast, the company said, reflected \"intensifying competition and continued pricing pressure within Diabetes and Obesity care\" market.\n\nHowever, J\u00f8rgensen said the lower forecast reflected \"continued, steady growth\" against a higher baseline.\n\n\"If you do the math, actually what we are adding in terms of volume new patients in 2025 is the same as what we add[ed] in 2024,\" he said. \"As the base gets bigger and bigger, the relative growth becomes smaller. So it's really about continued serving of patient living with diabetes [and] obesity, both in the U.S.\"\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the wide range in guidance indicated that Novo Nordisk's current market share could be slowing, while adding that there nevertheless remains \"a long way to run\" for obesity drugs given their broad perceived health benefits.\n\n\"A further acceleration will depend on more expanded use cases being approved by health regulators,\" she added.\n\nNovo Nordisk has ridden a wave of rising global demand for GLP-1 agonist obesity treatments. GLP-1s, which form the basis of Novo's Wegovy and rival Eli Lilly's Zepbound, work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, which suppresses appetite.\n\nInvestors have now been eagerly awaiting updates on the company's other obesity drug candidates, including its hotly anticipated experimental CagriSema treatment. Late-stage CagriSema trial results disappointed markets in December after demonstrating average weight reduction of 22.7%, below the 25% Novo had previously forecast.\n\nThe trial results dealt a blow to expectations that CagriSema would emerge as Novo's next-generation obesity drug, combining semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Wegovy \u2014 with amylin analog Cagrilintide, a nascent form of weight loss treatment.\n\nHowever, positive early-stage results for its once weekly Amycretin obesity drug, which similarly employs the amylin pancreas hormone, led the stock higher last month.\n\nNovo Nordisk said Wednesday that it would conduct a further study of CagriSema in 2025 with a view to filing for regulatory approval in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJ\u00f8rgensen also dismissed concerns around the tolerability of CagriSema, saying that the data suggests the treatment is \"very safe and also well tolerated.\"\n\n\"We will be doing one more trial to further seek out the full potential of CagriSema, because we believe there's more to be delivered by extending treatment period a bit,\" he noted.",

That is why the \u2018Infectious Diseases Catalyst Grants\u2019 focus on kickstarting exceptional research projects that can help us counter the growth of dangerous infectious diseases. In 2024, DKK 24 million was awarded to five exciting projects, and this February, the Catalyst Grants call for applications will open again for a second round.\n\nIn a time of increasing environmental instability, infectious diseases are a growing global threat with complex causes and no clear-cut solutions. In response, the Novo Nordisk Foundation launched the Catalyst Grants in 2024 to spur innovation and quickly test new ideas within three core themes: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), invasive pathogenic fungi and harnessing innate immunity against airborne viral infections. Now, the first five projects are ready for launch.\n\nA creeping danger\n\n\u201cThe world is in desperate need for new and creative approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance,\u201d says Poul Nielsen, Professor at the University of Southern Denmark, who is one of the recipients of a Catalyst Grant. AMR happens when microorganisms such as bacteria evolve to evade the antibiotics we have invented to counter infections. No new classes of antibiotics have been developed for treatment since 1987, and if nothing is done, AMR is expected to surpass all other causes of mortality by 2050.\n\nPoul Nielsen\u2019s project aims to re-design an overlooked class of antibiotics, namely the pleuromutilins. \u201cBy rationally designing new and innovative pleuromutilin derivatives, we hope to be able to specifically overcome a known resistance mechanism in bacteria,\u201d says Poul Nielsen.\n\nWith another AMR-directed Catalyst Grant project, Lone Br\u00f8ndsted, professor at the University of Copenhagen, wants to provide a biology-driven strategy using so-called \u201cbacteriophages\u201d to identify a broader selection of bacterial targets for antimicrobial design. \u201cPhages are viruses that only infect and kill bacteria,\u201d says Lone Br\u00f8ndsted. \u201cThey offer a unique opportunity to discover novel targets as their proteins interact with diverse bacterial targets, causing the bacteria\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nDeadly spores\n\nAccounting for an estimated 2.5 million deaths a year, infectious diseases caused by dangerous, invasive pathogenic fungi are arguably even more neglected than AMR. Patients with weakened immune systems (such as people with chronic conditions like HIV or diabetes or undergoing cancer or transplant treatments) are especially vulnerable to invasive fungal infections. But we do not know nearly enough about these dangerous fungi and have a very limited amount of anti-fungal treatments in our arsenal.\n\nIn his Catalyst Grant project, Professor Daan van Aalten from Aarhus University wants to understand the proteins in one of the most invasive pathogenic fungi, namely Aspergillus fumigatus. \u201cThis work can ultimately lead to the identification of opportunities for the discovery of novel anti-fungal drugs,\u201d says Daan van Aalten. In another project, Professor Daniel W\u00fcstner from the University of Southern Denmark, wants to use novel imaging techniques combined with chemical and genetic screening to dissect the mechanisms underlying the resistance of the fungal Candida family to the group of antifungal drugs called polyenes. \u201cIn addition to radically changing our perception of the mechanisms by which polyenes interfere with cellular functions, we can potentially find new ways to target the otherwise treatment-resistant fungi,\u201d says Daniel W\u00fcstner.\n\nLessons from the pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the ongoing threat of respiratory pathogens and how our innate immune response is crucial for our defences. A promising strategy is to boost our innate immune system, and in his Catalyst Grant project, Rune Hartmann from Aarhus University aims to understand why, and how, some immune cells respond better than others to Interferon \u03bb, an important signalling protein released by virally infected cells.\n\n\u201cThe knowledge generated by this research could lead to a more effective, broadly active treatment against viral infections, useful for curbing future pandemics or treating novel emerging viruses,\u201d says Rune Hartmann.\n\nThe 2024 call for Infectious Diseases Catalyst Grants was a first for the Novo Nordisk Foundation, but a new call for 2025 will be opening at the end of February, focusing on the same three themes. Importantly, to qualify for funding research projects should be use-inspired, with a direct focus on how the findings from each study can be applied to enable better solutions. Furthermore, while projects are required to be led by a main applicant from a research institution in Denmark, projects that include international co-applicants are also welcome.\n\nCatalyst grants awarded in 2024:\n\n\u00b7 Daan van Aalten, Aarhus University; DKK 5,999,458 for the project: \u201cTargeting the linchpins of Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall synthesis\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Daniel W\u00fcstner, University of Southern Denmark; DKK 5,972,368 for the project: \u201cDissection of sphingolipid-ergosterol interactions to combat polyene resistance in infectious Candida\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Lone Br\u00f8ndsted, University of Copenhagen; DKK 2,992,374 for the project: \u201cTARGETs for sustainable antimicrobial design\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Poul Nielsen, University of Southern Denmark; DKK 2,999,909 for the project: \u201cChemical optimization of pleuromutilin for broad antibacterial activity and decreased resistance\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Rune Hartmann, Aarhus University; DKK 5,996,364 for the project: \u201cInterferon \u03bb driven antiviral resistance in lung macrophages \u2013 a new therapeutic option?\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 15 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the upcoming market and corporate activity to look forward to this week, which will be dominated by earnings reports from various companies and an important inflation report from the Labor Department.\n\nCramer noted that Friday marked the heavy market focus on the prospect of the White House imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. As expected, the tariffs were announced, 25% from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, and the market, which had already been struggling, dropped further.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks\n\nCramer noted that the Dow plunged by 337 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Nasdaq declined by 0.28%. Adding fuel to the fire, President Trump later commented that he was \"not concerned about the market's reaction.\" Cramer, reflecting on this, wished he could share that same sense of ease. He added:\n\n\u201cFinally, on Friday, we get the Labor Department's non-farm payroll and right now the Fed is concerned that the economy might be running too hot. If we get robust job growth with higher wages, then I doubt we'll see any rate hikes in the first half of the year.\u201d\n\nHe then posed the question: if investors are hoping for a rising stock market, what would they want to see? Cramer explained that a job report that\u2019s just \"so-so\" would be ideal, strong enough to keep rate cuts on the table, but not so strong as to hinder quarterly earnings.\n\n\u201cBottom line: When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands because there's just too much data for any individual to process even for an AI-powered individual. By the way, oh, let's just throw in this DeepSeek stuff, which has made tech too maddening to buy or sell and too, let's say boring. So if in doubt, do nothing.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 31. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "Kenya is witnessing a rapid and alarming rise in cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), significantly straining its under-resourced healthcare workforce. Launched a year ago, PEP in Kenya strengthens medical training to help health professionals better manage CMDs.\n\nCMDs, a subset of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that include conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, are the leading cause of death globally, with their prevalence expected to continue rising.\n\nCompounding the problem, Kenya, like the rest of Africa, is also facing a critical shortage of healthcare workers.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, in partnership with the Ministry of Health in Kenya and six African-based institutions, launched the Partnership for Education of Health Professionals (PEP) in Kenya in January 2024. This initiative aims to address the growing disease burden by strengthening the education of health professionals in CMDs.\n\n\n\nDr George Kimathi from Amref Health Africa says PEP is an important initiative, because it helps bridge some of the workforce gaps that exist in Kenya.\n\n\u201cBy increasing the capacity of training institutions, PEP addresses the predicted shortage of about six million healthcare workers [across the continent] by 2030, which is crucial for achieving universal coverage. It ensures that faculty and learners acquire the necessary competencies to deliver quality care, aligning their skills with the health needs of the population. Additionally, PEP includes a vital research component, ensuring that training is relevant to population needs.\u201d\n\nPEP focuses on the medical training colleges and educational institutions that educate current and future nurses and clinical officers. One such institution is the Kijabe College of Health Sciences, which has been training health professionals for over three decades.\n\nThe College\u2019s Principal, Dr Peris Kariuki, emphasises the importance of enhancing the curriculum to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cEnsuring our graduates are market-ready and well-equipped with the knowledge and skills to manage patients with cardiometabolic diseases will lead to better patient outcomes,\u201d she said.\n\nNursing student Robinson Muturi\u2019s decision to study at the college was partly motivated by a desire to learn more about chronic diseases prevalent in the local community.\n\n\u201cSome of my relatives suffer from CMDs, such as diabetes and hypertension. I wanted to learn [more about] these conditions, so that I can be able to help them back at home and try to prevent the conditions from being more rampant all around the villages and also in the people in the community,\u201d he explained.\n\nA collaborative approach to strengthening education of health professionals\n\nIn the first year of PEP in Kenya, all partners collaborated to develop and roll-out tools to assess training needs across medical training colleges in Kenya for six health cadres. The assessment has holistically focused on the quality of the CMD education, the capacity for delivering online and blended learning and for conducting high quality research.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there is not a big emphasis on CMDs even in the curriculum, so one of the things that PEP is actually focused on doing is ensuring we have a pre-service curriculum such that that produces fit-for-purpose healthcare providers. These professionals will be ready to diagnose and manage CMDs, and they will also be knowledgeable about the risk factors. This way, they can advise community members on how to prevent or delay the onset of these conditions,\u201d said Dr Catherine Karekezi, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance Kenya.\n\n\u201cBy taking the time to fully understand the current gaps in CMD education, the first year of PEP has laid the foundation to strengthen the capacity of education institutions to provide competency based CMD education and clinical training,\u201d says Dorothy Owegi, a Kenya-based Senior Program Manager at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. She continues:\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to year two, PEP in Kenya will update CMD education by developing and piloting short courses for nurses, clinical officers, and community health assistants using online and blended learning. This programme\u2019s success could lead to future integration into the national curriculum and scalability to universities in Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dr Catherine Karekezi from the NCD Alliance Kenya, \u201cOnce PEP is in the next phase, which will be starting this year, ultimately, I believe we\u2019ll end up with a curriculum which will enable us to have fit-for-purpose medical professionals who will be working in the communities and will be able to diagnose and manage and also to prevent cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n\u201cAnd because they will be working at much lower-level facilities, this treatment and care will become more accessible to the community, hopefully at an affordable cost. This will enhance equitable access to the prevention, treatment, and care of cardiometabolic diseases,\u201d she said.\n\nDr George Kimathi envisions that the long-term impact of PEP in Kenya will be transformative.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we build the capacity of training institutions, which we are doing through PEP, and those training institutions are able to equip learners with the necessary competencies and skills to address cardiometabolic diseases, we then expect that the services those learners provide when they get employed, in terms of prevention and management of cardiometabolic diseases, will lead to improved health outcomes. This means reduced morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic diseases, which is significant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long-term goal we see from CMDs. Additionally, because PEP is a long-term partnership, it means that these institutions will have the capacity to continue training more professionals for years to come, resulting in longer-term benefits and impact for populations in the region,\u201d said Dr George Kimathi.",

            "content": "By Maggie Fick and Robin Respaut\n\nLONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk is under pressure from investors for more information about its next-generation obesity drug candidate CagriSema amid a lack of clarity over trial results that hammered its shares in December.\n\nNovo believes CagriSema could be more powerful than its blockbuster weight-loss injection Wegovy, but investors are worried whether it will be good enough to retake the lead from rival Eli Lilly in the competitive obesity drug market.\n\nIn interviews with Reuters, five patients who participated in the trial that reported in December - or are part of a separate late-stage study - said the weekly injection helped them shed pounds quickly, but that they encountered what they characterised as significant side-effects including nausea, constipation and fatigue.\n\nIn its December read-out, Novo said the most common adverse events in the trial were gastrointestinal and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with CagriSema's broader class of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs.\n\nNovo declined to comment for this story as it is in the regulatory quiet period ahead of quarterly results on Wednesday.\n\nWhile anecdotal, the interviews with the five patients shed some light on the experiences of those taking CagriSema and could hint at answers to questions sparked by the data about potential side-effects and the dosing regimen.\n\nWeaker than expected data from the trial was a blow to Novo's ambitions to find a more powerful competitor to Lilly's Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro.\n\nCagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy that mimics gut hormone GLP-1, with a separate molecule called cagrilintide that mimics pancreatic hormone amylin.\n\nOne participant in the trial that reported in December said she repeatedly fainted during her first six months on CagriSema. Over the 68-week trial, she lost 29% of her body weight.\n\n\"I guess it's quite normal to feel awful when you lose 30 to 40 kilograms in the span of six months,\" said Jane, who asked to be identified by her middle name to protect her anonymity.\n\nAfter reaching the highest dose, she stopped losing weight as rapidly. \"I got used to it (the medicine). I felt better,\" she said.\n\nIn December, Novo said people who adhered to the CagriSema treatment plan achieved overall weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, with 40.4% losing 25% or more.\n\nThat was lower than the 25% across-the-board weight loss it expected. The disappointment wiped as much as $125 billion off Novo's value on the day.\n\nSponsored Bank Accounts\n\nNovo also said only 57.3% of patients reached the highest dose of the medicine, but didn't explain why. Was it because patients suffered side-effects or because they lost weight on lower doses? Both could explain why they didn't progress to the highest dose.\n\nSome investors and analysts were also surprised the trial used a \"flexible\" protocol, permitting patients to change their dose strength instead of adhering to a schedule.\n\nThey said this could be a factor in the low take-up of the highest dose. Novo has said it will start a new trial by June.\n\nIN THE DARK\n\nIn interviews with Reuters, more than a dozen investors and analysts called for more clarity about factors they say are weighing on Novo's shares. They hope to get more information at Wednesday's quarterly results.\n\nBut Novo may be limited in what it can say as it prepares to release full data and trial protocol at a scientific conference later this year, expected to be the American Diabetes Association meeting in June.\n\nLukas Leu, fund manager at healthcare-focused Bellevue Asset Management in Switzerland, which holds Novo shares, said he was disappointed Novo did not disclose the flexible dosing earlier or explain its reasons for doing so.\n\nNovo's prior major semaglutide trials permitted participants to stay on lower doses if they experienced \"unacceptable side-effects\".\n\nIn the STEP trial, which studied semaglutide for weight loss, 89.6% of patients completing the trial were receiving the highest dose.\n\n\"With CagriSema, people are assuming the worst \u2013 on efficacy the drug is not better than Lilly's tirzepatide, on tolerability that it is worse, and that it is harder to manufacture,\" said Barclays analyst Emily Field, referring to the active ingredient in Lilly's Zepbound/Mounjaro.\n\n\"We don't necessarily agree with all those viewpoints, but given lack of additional commentary from the company, I understand why people are taking such a negative approach.\"\n\n'LIFE CHANGING'\n\nReuters interviewed two people who participated in the CagriSema trial that reported in December, called REDEFINE-1, and three in an ongoing Phase III trial, called REDEFINE-4, which is testing CagriSema against Zepbound/Mounjaro.\n\nREDEFINE-1 patients did not know until after the trial ended which drug they received. REDEFINE-4 patients know which drug they are getting.\n\nMichelle Rivera, who lives in Dallas, Texas, said she struggled to eat after she began taking CagriSema in the REDEFINE-4 trial.\n\n\"Literally nothing was appetising,\" said Rivera, who has lost about 22% of her weight.\n\nRivera has taken CagriSema for a year and has six months left on the trial. Her appetite slowly returned after about six months on the drug. But she still eats much smaller portions, prioritising protein, water and fibre to fight constipation.\n\nHer trial investigators were receptive to participants not increasing their dose if side-effects bothered them, she said. She kept to the recommended schedule and reached the maximum dose after about six months.\n\nAnother participant in the ongoing trial, Leigh, who asked to be identified by her middle name, said nausea, fatigue and brain fog she experiences in the 24 hours after her weekly CagriSema injection are so bad that she sometimes can't leave bed.\n\nShe has, however, kept to the recommended dosing protocol in the hope of losing more weight. After a year on CagriSema, she has lost about 18% of her weight. The medicine is \"life changing\", she said.\n\nBut when she finishes the trial this summer, she wants to explore whether a maintenance dose of a GLP-1 medicine would help her sustain weight loss without such intense side-effects.\n\n\"What I'm dealing with now, it's not sustainable,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Maggie Fick in London and Robin Respaut in San Francisco.

            "content": "In keeping with his election promise, President Donald Trump over the weekend announced steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Starting Tuesday, Feb. 4, imports from Canada and Mexico will be subjected to a 25% tariff, while China will be hit with a 10% tariff.\n\nAccording to a press release from the White House, the tariffs are meant to target the \u201cextraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs\u201d from these countries, saying these constitute a \u201cnational emergency\u201d for the U.S., though he did not provide further detail.\n\nThe levies against China in particular could cause problems for biopharma, particularly as the industry is \u201cincreasingly looking to China to find promising new drug candidates,\u201d according to Seeking Alpha analyst Edmund Ingham. This trend is evidenced by a recent flurry of licensing deals with Chinese biotechs, with 10 such transactions last year alone\u2014more than each of the previous four years.\n\nExperts previously told BioSpace that they expected the biopharma industry to be largely protected from such tariffs, though some, including Gilead CFO Andrew Dickinson, said caution is warranted in discussions with Chinese biotechs.\n\nIngham added that China has also become a major supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients. \u201cTariffs may lead to more \u2018re-shoring\u2019\u2014building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which is a change that will affect every Big Pharma,\u201d he explained in the Seeking Alpha report.\n\nAssociation for Accessible Medicines CEO John Murphy pointed to the impact the tariffs could have on existing drug shortages.\n\n\u201cThe global supply chain for generic and biosimilar medicines is critically important for U.S. patients. From the base ingredients to the finished products, U.S. medicines rely on a global supply chain that is already stressed and in need of strengthening,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTariffs on products from Canada, Mexico, and China could increase already problematic drug shortages.\u201d\n\nThe Healthcare Distribution Alliance emphasized the same concern, even calling for Trump to consider excluding pharma products from the tariffs.\n\nOf the largest pharma manufacturers, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca could be especially hamstrung by Trump\u2019s tariff because they work closely with Chinese firms, Ingham noted. J&J, for instance, is partnered with Legend Biotech, with which it co-developed and co-commercializes the CAR T therapy Carvykti and which has an office in Nanjing, China. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca in December 2023 acquired the Chinese cell therapy specialist Gracell Biotechnologies for $1 billion upfront.\n\nThe tariffs could also affect European pharma companies, Seeking Alpha analyst Stephen Ayers added, noting that firms such as Novo Nordisk and Roche \u201ccould face significant impacts\u201d because they \u201cmanufacture drugs overseas,\u201d and Trump\u2019s new duties could affect profitability.\n\n\u201cTariffs on imports would increase the total cost of goods sold and reduce margins,\u201d Ayers explained in the report, cautioning that these companies could potentially try to absorb these extra costs by passing them off to consumers\u2014in turn raising drug and healthcare costs. \u201cWhile this may happen to some extent, increasing the product\u2019s cost is likely to result in lower demand,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast, ONeil Trader, another analyst at Seeking Alpha, was a bit more tempered in his take, noting in the report that while some Europe-based companies could be disproportionately affected by the tariffs, \u201cI do not expect to see a meaningful impact of higher tariffs on any Big Pharma company.\u201d These established players, he argued, have \u201cgeographically diversified supply chains\u201d that they can activate and adapt to mitigate impacts of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an expansion of the number of manufacturing facilities in the United States in recent years, and I expect these trends to accelerate\u201d in light of the tariffs, Trader said.\n\nClarification (Feb. 4): This story has been updated to clarify that Legend Biotech has an office in Nanjing, China, but is headquartered in Somerset, NJ.

            "content": "Drugmakers have poured small fortunes into the development of weight loss medicines in the past few years in attempts to lead this lucrative and fast-growing market. However, Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%), a pioneer in the field, remains one of the leaders. That likely won't change anytime soon, since the Denmark-based pharmaceutical giant has an excellent pipeline.\n\nIn fact, Novo Nordisk recently reported positive results for one of its anti-obesity candidates that puts its current best-selling drug in this area, Wegovy, to shame. Let's look deeper into these results and what they could mean for investors.\n\nEarly, encouraging data\n\nNovo Nordisk's weight loss candidate in question is called amycretin. The company is developing an oral and a subcutaneous version of this medicine. Amycretin is a GLP-1 agonist, but it also mimics the action of another hormone, amylin, that regulates blood sugar and satiety. Dual agonists are proving to be especially promising candidates, and many pharmaceutical companies have created some versions.\n\nNovo Nordisk recently reported data from a phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the subcutaneous formulation of amycretin. The study enrolled 125 overweight or obese patients, with some receiving different doses of the drug, and others getting a placebo. Patients taking the highest dose of amycretin experienced a mean weight loss of 22% after 36 weeks. By contrast, those taking a placebo experienced weight gain of up to 2.3%.\n\nAmycretin's safety profile, according to Novo Nordisk, was consistent with that of medicines of the same type, with the majority of adverse reactions being mild to moderate.\n\nComparing how different medicines performed across separate clinical has severe limitations, but it can be informative. And based on the data so far, amycretin looks even more impressive than Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, the two top-selling weight loss drugs. In a 72-week study, Zepbound's mean weight loss was 20.2%, while Wegovy's was 13.7%. Amycretin did better in half the time.\n\nMultiple reasons to invest\n\nNovo Nordisk faces at least two issues in the anti-obesity space.\n\nFirst, while this market is growing fast, it isn't expanding as quickly as many anticipated. Novo Nordisk's eternal rival, Eli Lilly, recently decreased its full-year 2024 guidance again for this reason. According to Eli Lilly's management, this market grew by 45% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, slower than they had hoped.\n\nSecond, the medicine everyone thought would take over the industry, Novo Nordisk's CagriSema, did not perform as well as expected in a phase 3 study. CagriSema could still be a commercial success, though, and amycretin's recent results highlight the fact that Novo Nordisk's weight loss pipeline is deep.\n\nAnd regarding the slower-than-expected sales in the industry, Novo Nordisk's work goes beyond diabetes and obesity, which are currently its core areas. The drugmaker has been looking to diversify its lineup for years. For one, semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, is being investigated in other areas with high unmet needs. Perhaps the best example here is Alzheimer's disease, a worsening problem considering the world's aging population, but one where there are few approved medicines.\n\nFurther, Novo Nordisk has other pipeline candidates across many therapeutic areas. So, while it should remain a leader in diabetes and obesity, Novo Nordisk will also succeed in decreasing its exposure to those markets in the next five years.\n\nIn the meantime, the company continues to record excellent financial results, growing its revenue at percentages well above industry averages over the past two years. Top-line growth in the high-single-digit or low-double-digit percentages is considered strong for a drugmaker that size.\n\nLastly, the pharmaceutical giant has a solid dividend program, making it a good target for income-seeking investors. In short, Novo Nordisk is a solid long-term pick.",

            "content": "Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game. This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO.\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO+1.51% ) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE+0.12% ) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to cost \u2014 a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads\u2019 big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate \u2014 a measurement of new cases of a disease over time.\n\n\u201cThe Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,\u201d said Grover. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuper Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN+1.20% ) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should\u2019ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999\u20132019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses.\n\nFor drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. \u201cThe Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,\u201d said Grover. \u201cPeople are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year\u2019s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast.\n\nPfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company\u2019s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. \u2014 \u2014 like the actual second when it aired,\u201d Grover explained. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.\u201d\n\nPfizer Big Game Commercial 2024 \u2013 Here\u2019s to Science\n\nFor this year\u2019s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+2.69% ) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments \u2014 including an off-brand version of Wegovy.\n\nNovartis (NVS+0.05% ) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,\u201d said Grover.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1.\u201d Defendants\u2019 statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S , No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk as well as certain of Novo Nordisk's top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk's Amycretin Drug Shows Promising Weight Loss Results Clinical trials reveal amycretin can lead to significant weight loss, boosting investor confidence after stock struggles.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S has recently received significant investor attention thanks to the encouraging trial results of its new weight-loss shot, amycretin. This newly developed medication demonstrated the potential for impressive weight reduction, boasting figures as high as 22% during early clinical trials. The positive news came at a timely juncture for Novo Nordisk, whose shares have struggled considerably over the past six months.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Novo Nordisk announced the results of its phase Ib/IIa trials concerning amycretin, highlighting its efficacy across various doses over extended periods. Participants who received the injectable version of amycretin lost between 9.7% and 22% of their total body weight, demonstrating significant results when compared to placebo groups, which experienced slight weight gain. For example, those on the 20 mg dose lost 22% of their weight over 35 weeks, compared to just 1.9% to 2.3% weight gain among participants on placebo. These results were delivered during the 60th annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) held last September, raising hopes for amycretin's future within weight management and diabetes treatment markets.\n\nMartin Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, expressed enthusiasm about the trial findings, saying, \"The results seen in the trial support the weight-lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, which we have previously seen with the oral formulation.\" This is particularly significant as amycretin is being touted as offering results comparable to other successful glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) products like Wegovy and Ozempic, which aimed at the obesity and diabetes sector.\n\nThe momentum from the trial results stands in stark relief to the challenges Novo Nordisk has faced recently, particularly concerning its other weight-loss drug, CagriSema. Following disappointing results from CagriSema, the company's market value plummeted, losing approximately $93 billion at one point. Analysts expressed concern over the competitiveness of Novo Nordisk's product lineup against rival Eli Lilly & Co., which has seen success with its Zepbound offering. CagriSema's underwhelming performance not only led to price cuts on Wegovy but also raised questions about the drugmaker's long-term strategy and market presence.\n\nDespite these setbacks, many analysts are cultivating cautious optimism surrounding amycretin. Investors noted the importance of this new drug's performance as they anticipate annual earnings information set to be delivered on February 5. Analysts like Emily Field from Barclays Plc have remarked, \"This feels like maybe the pain trade with Novo is finally turning a corner,\" indicating shifting sentiments around the company's stock.\n\nThe dynamics surrounding amycretin do not go unnoticed by healthcare professionals evaluating its potential benefits. HaVy Ngo-Hamilton, Pharmd.D, and clinical consultant at BuzzRx remarked, \"I do not have any specific concerns about amycretin and believe this medication holds significant promise as it mimics the actions of two natural hormones...\" Her sentiments echo the general excitement from early-stage data, reinforcing the notion of amycretin as more than just another weight-loss method but rather as part of the modern biopharmaceutical's evolution to address obesity effectively.\n\nNotably, the exploration of amycretin raised the perspective of how such medications operate within the body. Experts argue its mechanism may affect the gut-brain axis, impacting hunger-regulating peptides like GLP-1, explaining its efficacy. This could be pivotal as obesity treatment enters new territories beyond current offerings.\n\nWhile these findings are promising, the path to widespread availability for amycretin will be paved with several necessary steps. Larger clinical trials are anticipated to evaluate its efficacy, safety, and side effects thoroughly. Post-trial, regulatory bodies such as the FDA will review the compiled data, considering the risk-benefit ratio alongside potential side effects before granting approval. If amycretin gains the necessary approvals, Novo Nordisk will need to ramp up production capacity and establish distribution channels for effective delivery to healthcare providers and patients.\n\nInvestors are undoubtedly watching closely as Novo Nordisk attempts to shift its fortunes. With analysts projecting potential stock recovery within the year, there are glimmers of hope for the Danish pharmaceutical giant to reclaim its place as a leader within the weight-loss and diabetes markets long dominated by perceived competitors like Eli Lilly. The developments of amycretin may mark not just another drug's entry but serve as a significant inflection point for Novo Nordisk.",

            "content": "Big Pharma Is Still Alive\n\nThe last few years have seen the healthcare sector change radically thanks to biotech innovation. The most visible part was mRNA vaccines, but the arrival of gene therapies, cheap genome sequencing, or stem cell therapies are all there to usher in a new era of medical marvels (you can follow the links for deeper coverage of these topics).\n\nMost of these innovations have been done by smaller companies, and R&D efforts by the biggest pharmaceutical companies have often been not very successful .\n\nNevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is still dominated by a few giant corporations. Such blue-chip multi-billion dollar companies are not only the historically dominant players but might as well stay on top for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is that? How is it that even radical innovation might not threaten incumbent companies?\n\nThe Big Pharma Business Model\n\nTo understand how \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can stay on top, we can look at the example of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe innovation itself was very much invented by BioNTech, which took an actually quite old scientific concept and turned it into an entire technology platform.\n\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it was the perfect time for such a \u201cprogrammable\u201d vaccine to shine. And it did. But BioNTech did not commercialize it themselves. They partnered with Pfizer to handle approval, production, and commercialization quickly. After all, rival Moderna and countless other companies were pushing for their own COVID-19 vaccine, so time was of the essence.\n\nSimply put, Pfizer brought to BioNTech needed resources in manufacturing, funding, distribution, sales network, clinical trials, handling of regulators, etc\u2026\n\nInnovation vs Acquisitions\n\nAnother way for Big Pharma to stay relevant is simply to buy out successful biotech companies.\n\nBiotechnology is a field littered with failed projects and companies. So when one turns out successful, both founder and investors might want to cash out after 10-15 years of patience, hard work, and a bit of luck.\n\nAnd who could be more qualified than Big Pharma firms, able also to take the innovative drugs and bring them forth to their network of tens of thousands of doctors at once?\n\nThey also have the needed financial firepower. For example, with $512B of market capitalization, Johnson & Johnson, the largest pharmaceutical company in 2021 by revenues , registered a net income of almost $18B and a free cash flow of $17B.\n\nMany biotech firms, astonishingly from a scientific and innovation point of view, often trade below a billion dollars. So, if you look at the yearly free cash flow of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, this is a lot of dry powder for acquisitions.\n\nTop 5 Blue Chip Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nTo qualify as a \u201cblue chip,\u201d we consider only the top 20 companies according to their 2021 revenues .\n\nThe term \u201ctop\u201d is rather subjective, as is here a mix of existing drug portfolio, historical performance, R&D pipeline, and financial position. We will highlight some of the central parts of the business and incoming important innovations instead of going deep into the entire therapeutics portfolio or the company's financial results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $ 1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences.\n\nOncology.\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe company has grown sales by 6% yearly in the last 20 years, with a 13.2% return to shareholders in the last 10 years. The stock is also one of the rare \u201cdividend aristocrats,\u201d having rising dividends every year for 60 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, Johnson & Johnson is a very safe bet on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on long-term holdings and the stock price compounding while also giving a moderate but stable and growing dividend.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nThe Danish company is highly focused on diabetes & metabolic diseases like obesity, together making 88% of the company's revenues.\n\nThe focus on obesity is rather recent, with significant growth in this segment in 2022\n\nThe company is also working on an expanding rare disease portfolio and chronic diseases like kidney or liver pathologies.\n\nThe company is well-placed to benefit from the worldwide rise of chronic metabolic diseases. This should provide very safe revenue streams and continuous growth in the short term.\n\nA key vulnerability for Novo Nordisk in the long term is the possibility of permanently curing diabetes through stem cells, gene editing, or another new therapeutic method. This is something we have discussed previously when covering Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics. This is more likely to happen soon for type-1 diabetes, with type-2, the most common, much more likely to be still treated by reducing symptoms for a longer period of time.\n\nSo Novo Nordisk provides a safe place for conservative investors, but they will want to monitor tightly the development of the diabetes market and the arrival of potential competitors. The entry of Novo Nordisk into new segments like chronic diseases and obesity might be the right option to sustain the company in the long run.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon .\n\nSo far, some of the consequently lost revenues have been compensated by the pandemic-boosted sales of the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nThe company is mostly active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nThe new start product of Merck is Keytruda, a cancer drug (monoclonal antibody), with sales growing 16%-27% over the last 3 years. It is already approved for multiple cancers and has 13 new applications under review in phase 3 of clinical trials.\n\nThe company's revenues and earnings have grown significantly in the last 3 years, especially in 2022.\n\nThis financial success should persist until 2028, when Keytruda loses its patent protection. So, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company can reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nBut Pfizer is not just mRNA vaccines, with a total of 10 products with more than $1B of sales per year.\n\nThe company is targeting new product launches: 4 in 2023 and up to 12 by 2024.\n\nIts' management is keen to insist that the growth story is not Covid-dependent, with plans to bring non-Covid sales from the current average of $50B to $84B by 2030.\n\nThey also insist that the windfall profits from the pandemic will \u201callow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation\u201d\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybean, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nBayer's valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of RounUp to cause cancer.\n\nSince then, the company's valuation has fallen to less than what it paid for acquiring Monsanto. This has been a distraction from its solid performance in the seeds, other pesticides, and healthcare segments.",

The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.\n\nAs detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo's REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \"flexible protocol\" which gave patients the ability \"to modify their dosing throughout the trial.\"\n\nOn December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed \"flexible\" nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with \"2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,\" the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study.\n\nInvestors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo's revelation. The price of Novo's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo's stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.\n\nThe court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

TXG -8.94% )\n\nThe company was founded in 2012. Among its founders is Serge Saxonov, the director of R&D of the personalized genome testing company 23andMe.\n\nThis company is working on creating an entirely new field of science called \u201cSpatial Biology.\u201d\n\nInstead of looking at the \u201cmix\u201d of molecules in a sample, spatial biology can determine where in a tissue or a single cell a molecule of interest, like a specific sequence of RNA, is located, either in 2D or 3D.\n\nThis will tell researchers how cells interact with each other, how defense mechanisms activate, how a cell reacts to contact with a virus, and so much more.\n\nYou can read in more detail the unique advantages of spatial biology in this FAQ by Nanostring.\n\nThe company is still at an early stage, even with thousands of machines already running in research institutes, spending a lot on R&D.\n\nOverall, 10x Genomics is likely to become really profitable only once spatial genomics gets commonly used in most research labs instead of being the most advanced technology available, as it is today. Another step of growth can be expected in the future when spatial genomics starts to be used for medical diagnostics.\n\nYou can read more about 10x Genomics and its closest competitor, Nanostring (NSTG), in our article \u201cSpatial Biology: Nanostring vs 10x Genomics\u201d.",

            "content": "FDA Approves Ozempic For Chronic Kidney Disease Novo Nordisk's semaglutide designated the first GLP-1 treatment for managing kidney disease risks.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved Novo Nordisk's Ozempic (semaglutide), heralding it as the first glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) treatment indicated for chronic kidney disease (CKD). This significant milestone, announced on January 28, 2025, adds another feather to the cap of the already well-regarded diabetes medication, which was initially launched for type 2 diabetes management back in 2017.\n\nOzempic's FDA approval now includes the reduction of both kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality risks among patients suffering from diabetes with CKD, underscoring the drug's versatility beyond its primary designation. Based on data from the large, randomized FLOW trial, it was shown to decrease the risk of death from CKD and major cardiovascular events by 24% compared to placebo, utilizing evidence from over 3,500 adult participants over a median follow-up of 41 months.\n\nAnna Windle, PhD, Senior Vice President for Clinical Development, Medical and Regulatory Affairs at Novo Nordisk, commented, \"This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.\u201d Windle's statement reflects the potential impact of semaglutide, not only on improving diabetes management but also on renal outcomes for patients.\n\nThe FLOW trial revealed notable findings, indicating semaglutide's role as more than just a glucose regulator. It exhibited efficacy against kidney disease progression, encapsulated by the primary composite endpoint's description: persistent reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50% or more, the development of end-stage kidney disease, and the overarching risk of cardiovascular mortality rates.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman reinforced the significance of the recent approval, stating, \"Such an approval adds to the mounting body of evidence showing GLP-1 agents' utility in indications beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity.\" This sentiment highlights the growing recognition among health professionals of GLP-1 receptor agonists as pivotal treatments capable of addressing complex health challenges intertwined with diabetes.\n\nThe rationale behind this latest approval is rooted deeply in the high prevalence of CKD among the diabetic population. Recent studies indicate approximately 40% of individuals with type 2 diabetes are affected by varying degrees of chronic kidney impairment. Given the total estimated population of 37 million adults with CKD within the U.S., the approval of Ozempic introduces potentially life-saving treatment options for millions.\n\nOzempic's new role extends its previous indications, where it was also approved to mitigate risks of serious cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke among diabetic individuals. Now, alongside its benefits for diabetes management, it is set to address the dual challenge presented by CKD, presenting comprehensive management strategies for physicians and patients alike.\n\nAfter the approval, Novo Nordisk expressed ambitions to explore the possibilities of semaglutide and other GLP-1 treatments\u2019 roles beyond diabetes and CKD, with investigation efforts extending to areas like Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This exploratory action sets up Novo for future innovations, possibly reshaping treatment paradigms.\n\nThe recent approval is expected to reinforce Novo Nordisk's position within the diabetes and renal disease treatment space, directly challenging competitors, including Eli Lilly, which also has products within the GLP-1 class. Analysts anticipate enhancements to Novo's market presence, especially as healthcare providers look for effective treatments managing comorbid conditions associated with chronic diabetes.\n\nWith this milestone achieved, patients diagnosed with CKD and benefiting from Ozempic now have enhanced treatment potential, embodying progress within the healthcare system aimed at improving the quality of life among millions burdened with diabetes and its complications.\n\nOverall, the FDA's approval of Ozempic for chronic kidney disease signals advancements not only for Novo Nordisk but also for patients grappling with multifaceted challenges related to diabetes and CKD. It opens doors for discussions surrounding integrated treatment approaches and sets the stage for continued exploration of GLP-1 therapies as society searches for comprehensive solutions to manage increasingly prevalent health issues.",

J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

With a $2.47 million gift from Novo Nordisk, Inc., and the generous assistance of local, state and national partners, LHSA is applying its holistic health model in Selma, Camden, Demopolis and other underserved communities.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to work together with leaders in Selma, Demopolis, Camden and other Black Belt communities to realize our vision for a healthier Alabama,\u201d said LHSA Chief Executive Officer Mona Fouad, M.D., whose extensive experience addressing health disparities in the region dates to Selma Mayor James Perkins Jr.\u2019s first term in the early 2000s. \u201cBy expanding access to nutritious food and health screenings, fostering exercise and civic pride in revitalized public spaces, and empowering rising leaders in these towns, we intend to lay the foundation for enduring, positive change.\u201d\n\nLHSA has been operating in 11 Birmingham communities since 2019 and has developed a playbook of evidence-based strategies to improve health outcomes, such as reducing chronic disease rates and improving access to healthy food. These strategies have been implemented in all 11 communities, and LHSA is seeing early positive results. In all these efforts, corporate partnership is vital, and LHSA\u2019s goal could not be accomplished without a broad coalition of supporters and partners, like Novo Nordisk.\n\n\u201cUAB is excited to celebrate this milestone as we extend the successful LHSA model from Birmingham neighborhoods to a statewide presence, starting in Selma and ultimately reaching other Black Belt communities,\u201d said UAB President Ray L. Watts. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to Novo Nordisk for making this progress possible, and to our many other corporate and community partners as we work together to improve health and revitalize neighborhoods throughout Alabama.\u201d\n\nLHSA works holistically to make good health simple and accessible for all Alabamians:\n\n\n\n\u25cf Helping people take control of their health by offering free, comprehensive health screenings\n\n\n\n\u25cf Encouraging physical activity and neighborhood pride by revitalizing and beautifying public spaces\n\n\n\n\u25cf Increasing access to affordable, nutritious groceries through the Mobile Market and pop-up farmers\u2019 markets\n\n\n\n\u25cf Promoting healthy choices through educational outreach and community health coaches, who provide active navigation to reduce barriers to receiving appropriate health care\n\n\n\n\u25cf Sustaining progress by investing in neighborhood stakeholders who will advocate for their communities\n\nA region in recovery\n\nAccording to Apurva Patel, director of Corporate Sustainability and Social Impact with Novo Nordisk, a shared emphasis on the social determinants of health \u2014 e.g. physical activity, access to equitable health care, availability of nutritious food and housing \u2014 made LHSA a natural partner.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is really about the prevention of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd we needed to go where the need was: States in the South, like Alabama and Mississippi, had high rates of obesity and diabetes, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. We aren\u2019t looking to invest the resources in communities that may have better access to care. It\u2019s those marginalized communities that are often left behind.\u201d\n\nDallas County faces deep challenges, including poverty, high crime, limited transportation and lack of access to health care. Recovery from a COVID-19 mortality rate 50 percent above Alabama\u2019s average was made worse by a devastating EF2 tornado that struck Selma on Jan. 12, 2023.\n\nLHSA is taking a collaborative approach in Selma, working with local leaders to address pressing needs like new, wind-resistant roofs in tornado-damaged Ward 8. LHSA partnered with Craig Scott and Councilor Michael Johnson to connect homeowners with the Strengthen Alabama Homes program, securing $400,000 in grants for 40 roof replacements. These upgrades protect against storms, reduce insurance costs and restore community hope.\n\nLHSA is partnering with architecture and construction firms to rejuvenate East Selma\u2019s community pond and park, enhancing public spaces to support health and neighborhood pride.\n\nHealthy living\n\nLHSA is revitalizing Ward 8\u2019s community pond by addressing erosion, adding walkways, planting shade trees, repairing sidewalks and restoring the pond for fishing. These efforts aim to boost community pride, offer safe spaces for children and promote healthy lifestyles.\n\nAt Selma\u2019s Sophia P. Kingston Elementary, LHSA partnered with HEAL United to introduce health-focused education. HEAL provides free lesson plans, tools and training to teachers, resulting in a 75 percent improvement in students\u2019 cardiovascular and behavior scores within six months.\n\nPhysical education teacher Tevin Rudolph shared how the program inspired students to embrace healthy habits.\n\n\u201cKids were amazed to learn they can stay strong at 50 and 60 if they start now,\u201d Rudolph said.\n\nWhile LHSA\u2019s expansion into the Black Belt is just beginning, local leaders, partners and UAB staff are optimistic about its potential to create lasting change in Dallas County.\n\n\u201cPart of what we\u2019re proving with UAB is that private companies, states and municipal governments can take on some of this investment in health outcomes, because it ultimately becomes cheaper than paying for the disease or paying for it down the road,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI think the learnings from Selma are starting to lay a seed that can truly transform public health in some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. And that would be an awesome legacy for UAB, and hopefully Novo, to have some influence on.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Live HealthSmart Alabama\u2019s efforts across the state, visit its official website.",

Revenue of $158.9bn also beat expectations of $157.29bn.\n\nRevenue for this part of the business came in at $27.5bn in the third quarter , which was in line with Wall Street expectations, but was still up 19% year-on-year.\n\nA key focus in Amazon's ( AMZN ) upcoming results will be how its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is performing.\n\nShares in Amazon ( AMZN ) are up nearly 46% over the past year, with the stock hitting a record high closing price of $238.15 (\u00a3191.84) on Tuesday.\n\nHere's more on what to look for:\n\nFellow pharma giant AstraZeneca is also set to release full-year results, with investors waiting to see if it will meet upgraded guidance.\n\nIn the pharmaceuticals sector, Novo Nordisk is due to report, coming off the back of some positive developments for its weight-loss drugs.\n\nInvestors will be looking at Disney's latest earnings to see if the company can continue to deliver growth in profits from its streaming business.\n\nData analytics software firm Palantir will kick off the week's key earnings releases on Monday, with investors focused on how its AI platform is contributing to the business.\n\nMarket focus will remain on earnings from major tech companies, in the wake of the sell-off in artificial intelligence-related stocks on the back of Chinese firm DeepSeek's release of a cost-effective AI model, which sparked concerns around the level of spending by US giants.\n\nInvestors will continue to keep a close eye on US president Donald Trump's trade tariff plans, as well as what is on the wider policy agenda for his third week back in office.\n\nEarnings season is now well under way, with a number of major companies due to release results in the coming week.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Investors will also be tuned in for updates on AWS\u2019s AI initiatives and the eye-popping investment Amazon (AMZN) plans to spend in the space,\" he added.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter earnings on Monday 3 February\n\nShares in Palantir (PLTR) were among those tech names that fell in the sector's broader sell-off on concerns about AI spending in the US, given its developments in the space.\n\nThe stock quickly recovered and is back to trading near all-time highs, with shares up 375% over the past year alone.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) rallied on the back of its third quarter earnings, which were released a day before the US election in November. The stock continued to surged following the election, becoming one of the stocks considered to be part of the \"Trump trade\", as investors bet on increased defence spending under Trump, which is a key part of Palantir's business.\n\nIn the third quarter, Palantir (PLTR) posted revenue of $725.5m, which topped estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 also beat expectations.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe company also raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $2.805bn and $2.809bn, as well as upping its adjusted income from operations estimate to between $1.054bn and $1.058bn.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Palantir (PLTR) guided to revenue of between $767m and $771m. The company said it expected adjusted income from operations to come in between $298m and $302m.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said: \"Palantir has become a standout in the AI revolution, capturing attention with its innovative data-driven products and a CEO who knows how to tell a compelling story.\n\n\"While its growth potential is exciting, the key question is whether it can deliver earnings fast enough to justify its steep valuation \u2013 around 150 times next year\u2019s expected earnings,\" he said. \"This sets high stakes for next week\u2019s fourth quarter results, where nothing shy of perfect execution will be tolerated.\"\n\nBritzman added that a \"spotlight will be on Palantir's (PLTR) AI platform, with investors eager to see how it\u2019s driving enterprise adoption and converting pilot programs into full-scale deals\".\n\nDisney (DIS) \u2014 Releases first quarter earnings on Wednesday 5 February\n\nShares in Disney (DIS) slumped in the first half of last year but had rebounded by the end of 2024, with the stock jumping on the back its fourth quarter earnings in November.\n\nDisney (DIS) posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, besting estimates of $1.10, while revenue of $22.57bn also came in ahead expectations of $22.47bn.\n\nThe company's direct-to-consumer streaming business was a highlight in the results, as operating income of $321m marked a turnaround from the $387m Disney (DIS) reporting in the prior-year period.\n\nKey film releases also provided a boost for the media copmany, with it highlighting that Pixar's Inside Out 2 and Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine \"broke numerous box office records and helped drive $316m in operating income at content sales/licensing and other\" in the fourth quarter.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nDisney (DIS) also offered strong earnings growth guidance for the next couple of years, adding to investor optimism.\n\nThe media and entertainment giant said it expected adjusted earnings per share growth in the high-single digits in the 2025 fiscal year and was targeting $3bn in stock repurchases.\n\nFor the entertainment direct-to-consumer business, Disney (DIS) said it expected to report an operating income increase of approximately $875m compared with 2024, though it did anticipate a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the first quarter versus Q4.\n\nFor the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years, Disney (DIS) expected double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said: \"Disney's (DIS) performance in recent years has been a far cry from the fairytale management investors were hoping for. But after years of hard work and investment, things may just be about to turn.

(4568.T) for approval in the European Union.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN.L) CEO Pascal Soriot said in the company's third quarter results that revenue and earnings growth reflected increased demand for its medicines across the oncology, biopharmaceuticals and rare disease areas.\n\nThe company posted 18% growth in total revenue in the third quarter, at $13.6bn, while reported earnings per share of $0.92 was up 20% for that period.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\nOn the back of these figures, AstraZeneca (AZN.L) raised its 2024 fiscal year guidance for revenue and core earnings per share to expectations of high-teens percentage growth.\n\nAJ Bell's (AJB.L) investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth said: \"AstraZeneca\u2019s shares stumbled in the second half of 2024 as markets (and the pharmaceuticals industry) digested the possibility that Donald Trump would return to the White House and try to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services.\n\n\"However, the share price bottomed on 7 November, two days after Trump\u2019s election victory, and quickly got a boost from the third-quarter results for 2024, when AstraZeneca (AZN.L) raised guidance for last year yet again.\"\n\nGiven that guidance upgrade, they said that the company was expected to report total revenue of $51.3bn for 2024, while core earnings per share was anticipated to come in at $8.27.\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 3 February\n\nMizuho Financial (8411.T)\n\nHoya (7741.T)\n\nMurata (6981.T)\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI)\n\nTyson Foods (TSN)\n\nClorox (CLX)\n\nRambus (RMBS)\n\nTuesday 4 February\n\nCrest Nicholson (CRST.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nStaffline (STAF.L)\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial (8306.T)\n\nNintendo (7974.T)\n\nUBS (UBSG.SW)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nIntesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI)\n\nDassault Systems (DSY.PA)\n\nInfineon Technologies (IFX.DE)\n\nColoplast (COLO-B.CO)\n\nPublicis (PUB.PA)\n\nMerck (MRK)\n\nPepsiCo (PEP)\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nKKR (KKR)\n\nPfizer (PFE)\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nPayPal (PYPL)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\nFerrari (RACE)\n\nSimon Property (SPG)\n\nCummins (CMI)\n\nMarathon Petroleum (MPC)\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder (EL)\n\nWednesday 5 February\n\nPressure Technologies (PRES.L)\n\nDCC (DCC.L)\n\nToyota Motor (7203.T)\n\nKDDI (9433.T)\n\nTotalEnergies (TTE.PA)\n\nBanco Santander (SAN.MC)\n\nEquinor (EQNR.OL)\n\nCredit Agricole (ACA.PA)\n\nAssa-Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.ST)\n\nARM (ARM)\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR)\n\nEmerson Electric (EMR)\n\nMetlife (MET)\n\nJohnson Controls (JCI)\n\nFord (F)\n\nYum!

Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk as well as certain of Novo Nordisk's top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at [email protected].\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\n\nThe Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk's projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk's phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \"REDEFINE-1,\" while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk's repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the \"flexible protocol\" limited the study's ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nThe Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that \"[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial\" and that \"[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.\" On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "Demand for weight-loss drugs is steadily increasing with over 2 million Americans taking semaglutide, a type of medication made by Novo Nordisk, in 2021, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nIn fact, Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, all semglutide medications that can induce weight loss, brought in about $21.1 billion for the company in 2023.\n\nBut as more people take these medications, some are starting to notice side effects and unexpected changes to their bodies, such as Ozempic face and another phenomenon known as Ozempic butt.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRELATED: 18 celebrities who\u2019ve opened up about taking Ozempic or weight-loss drugs\n\nWhile changes to the appearance of the buttocks when taking a weight-loss drug can be surprising, experts tell TODAY.com that it\u2019s something that can occur with any dramatic weight loss and may be avoidable.\n\nHere's what to know about \"Ozempic butt.\"\n\nWhat is Ozempic butt?\n\n\"Ozempic butt\" refers to the wrinkly, loose and sagging skin that some users of weight-loss drugs have noticed on their backsides after using the medications for an extended period and losing substantial weight. Ozempic butt is not an official medical diagnosis.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause the weight loss can be so rapid\u201d on weight-loss drugs, users may see sagging skin around their rear ends, Dr. F. Clarissa Yang, dermatologist-in-chief at Tufts Medical Center and a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. \u201cHowever, you can see this with any rapid weight loss,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe medication that inspired the term, Ozempic, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Type 2 diabetes. Its active ingredient is semaglutide, which releases a synthetic version of a hormone that the body creates when eating, reducing appetite. Ozempic's sister drug, Wegovy, also contains semaglutide and is FDA-approved to treat obesity.\n\nAsked about reports of Ozempic butt, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson tells TODAY.com: \"At Novo Nordisk, patient safety is a top priority. We work closely with the (FDA) to continuously monitor the safety profile of our medicines. We do not have clinical data evaluating the effect of Wegovy or Ozempic on sagging skin on the buttocks. We recommend that any patients experiencing side effects while taking Wegovy or Ozempic contact their health care provider.\u201d\n\nIn addition to rapid weight loss, Ozempic butt can also happen to people who experience massive weight loss, usually at least 100 pounds or more than 40% of one\u2019s excess body weight, Dr. John Burns, a board-certified plastic surgeon and the president at Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute, tells TODAY.com.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resulting flabby skin can occur in any area of the body where fat had been stored, including the stomach, thighs and arms \u2014 \u201cbut two of the most common areas of complaint are the face and butt,\u201d he says. In both areas, \u201cthe amount of excess skin generally tracks with the amount of lost weight, meaning the more weight that is lost, the more excess skin that is usually left behind,\u201d Burns adds.\n\nWhat causes Ozempic butt?\n\nBoth rapid and and massive weight loss, usually due to a weight-loss medication (not just Ozempic), can cause Ozempic butt.\n\nExcess skin associated with weight loss sags or appears wrinkly primarily because it loses elasticity and collagen as it expands, so the skin can\u2019t retract as well once the weight is lost.\n\n\u201cThink of a balloon that\u2019s losing air,\u201d Dr. Samuel Lin, an associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and a Boston-based plastic surgeon, tells TODAY.com. \u201cAs the balloon deflates, you notice wrinkles and extra material where the air once filled.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOzempic butt is especially likely in older people since the proteins collagen and elastin, which promotes elasticity, diminish as we age.\n\n\u201cThe younger you are, the more elastic your skin is and the more likely it is to bounce back like a rubber band,\u201d Dr. Debra Jaliman, a dermatologist and an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. \u201cThe older you are, the more likely your skin is going to sag.\u201d\n\nHow Ozempic affects skin and muscles\n\nLosing a lot of weight quickly, which can happen on a weight-loss drug like Ozempic, can impact both muscle and skin.\n\nMuscle loss\n\n\u201cWhen you lose weight, you can lose muscle and bone, in addition to fat,\u201d says Yang.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome patients may see even more muscle loss on weight-loss drugs because they \u201cdecrease appetite, which in turn decreases a person\u2019s food and nutrient intake tremendously,\" Dr. Iman Saleh, director of obesity medicine at the bariatrics department of Northwell Health South Shore University Hospital, tells TODAY.com.\n\n\u201cPatients on Ozempic or Wegovy lose both fat and muscle while on these medications,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe combined loss of fat and muscle can contribute to a flatter and more poorly shaped butt, \u201cand if you lose a significant amount of muscle and fat from the buttocks, the sagging skin can appear even more pronounced,\u201d Dr. Dustin Portela, dermatologist and founder of Treasure Valley Dermatology in Boise, Idaho, tells TODAY.com.\n\nA spokesperson for Novo Nordisk previously told NBC News that even though semaglutide can reduce a person's muscle mass, the medication improves a person's ratio of lean body mass (everything in the body but fat) to total body mass.\n\nExcess skin\n\nWeight gain damages the proteins elastin and collagen, which help the skin stay firm and stretchy. So, often times when the weight is lost, the skin isn't able to retract as well as it did before the weight gain.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while our skin does have what are called \u201cviscoelastic properties,\u201d which allow it to recoil to a certain extent after being stretched, \u201cwith significant weight loss, there inevitably is more excess skin than can retract,\u201d says Burns.\n\nHow to avoid Ozempic butt\n\nThough it\u2019s not always possible to completely avoid Ozempic butt or other adverse outcomes related to significant weight loss, it is possible to minimize the effects.\n\n\u201cIt is always best to lose weight slowly, so you may want to have your doctor monitor the dose of the medication and lower the dose if you\u2019re losing weight too fast,\u201d offers Jaliman.\n\nPortela agrees that losing weight at a rate of two to four pounds a week \u201ccan make it easier for the skin to adjust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's also important not to neglect exercise.\n\n\u201cFocus on strength training the large muscles of your legs, hips and buttocks,\u201d Portela advises. \u201cStrengthening these muscles helps to increase the muscle volume to compensate for the fat loss in these areas and will also help your body process sugar more efficiently and improve your metabolic health.\u201d\n\nYang says it\u2019s also crucial to maintain a nutritionally dense diet. \u201cBe mindful of protein intake along with micronutrients, such as vitamin C, zinc, copper, magnesium and iron,\u201d she advises, as they can help improve the appearance of skin.\n\nRELATED: Foods to avoid if you are taking Ozempic or Wegovy for weight loss\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also recommends getting enough selenium, omega-3s, calcium, potassium, biotin, magnesium, vitamins K, E, D, and the B vitamins \u201cto maintain muscle strength and mass and to minimize loss of volume.\u201d\n\nHow to treat Ozempic butt\n\nIf you\u2019re already experiencing Ozempic butt, there are techniques and treatment options available.\n\nBurns says these include:\n\nRebuilding lost muscle through exercise\n\nWorking to tighten your skin with proper diet and hydrating skin care\n\nTalking with your doctor about safe medical devices and procedures that tighten skin\n\nMany of Burns' patients also turn to volume-replacement cosmetic products to treat Ozempic butt. \u201cFor smaller volume deficits, fillers can be used to fill in these discrete areas and provide more volume to the butt and fill out loose skin,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn larger areas of lost volume, some patients turn to plastic surgery, where excess fat can be removed from one\u2019s stomach or thighs and be injected into the butt to restore volume and shape. \u201cFor safety reasons, the fat is only injected into the fatty layer of the butt and not the muscle,\" he explains.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

Investors have until March 25, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\nClick here to participate in the action.\n\nThe Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk\u2019s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1,\u201d while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk\u2019s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the \u201cflexible protocol\u201d limited the study\u2019s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk on Monday asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to accelerate its ongoing legal complaint against the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s drug price negotiation program.\n\nThe motion comes a month ahead of the Feb. 28 deadline for pharma companies to confirm their participation in the second cycle of the negotiations. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released its list of the 15 drugs set to undergo negotiations next. Three Novo drugs made the list: Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, all of which carry the active ingredient semaglutide.\n\nAccording to CMS, there are more than 2 million Medicare Part D enrollees taking these drugs, which together accumulated almost $14.5 billion in gross Part D spending from November 2023 to October 2024.\n\nNovo first sued the government to block the IRA pricing program in September 2023, which resulted in a legal defeat in August 2024. In its request on Monday, Novo blasted CMS for its announcement of the second cycle, saying that the agency \u201cagain defied the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s plain text by announcing that it intends to impose a new round of price controls on more products than the statute authorizes.\u201d The pharma also took issue with how CMS aggregated its three products and considered them as a single entry in the list of nominated drugs for the second round of negotiations.\n\n\u201cCMS\u2019s continued defiance of the statute\u2019s requirements adds urgency to the important issues raised in this appeal,\u201d Novo\u2019s motion read, asking the court to \u201cexpedite oral argument and decision in this matter.\u201d\n\nWhile Novo\u2019s current case is focused specifically on the number of products that CMS may subject to the second round of its negotiations, several pharma companies have lodged legal complaints against the federal agency seeking to block the drug pricing program.\n\nThe industry\u2019s success has been limited, however. In October 2024, a New Jersey judge dismissed Novartis\u2019 lawsuit against the CMS program, maintaining that participation in the program is voluntary of drugmakers, and that in leveraging its purchasing power to secure better deals, the federal government is not in violation of the constitution.\n\nSeveral other companies have likewise failed to secure the backing of the courts, including Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\n\n\n",

Image credit: Shutterstock / KK Stock.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic (semaglutide) to reduce certain risks associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nThe Danish drugmaker\u2019s popular weight loss medication is now indicated to reduce the risk of kidney failure and disease progression, as well as death due to cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with CKD will be eligible for the approval.\n\nThe new indication makes Ozempic the first glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) available for people with T2D and CKD. Novo Nordisk said its drug is the \u201cmost broadly indicated\u201d GLP-1RA in its class.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs senior vice president Anna Windle said: \u201cThis approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated.\u201d\n\nOzempic gained a similar label expansion last month when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a new indication for the risk of events related to CKD.\n\nCKD affects around 37 million adults in the US and is expected to rise in line with diabetes prevalence. The disease is common in patients with diabetes, as high blood sugar can damage blood vessels in the kidneys and nephrons. Around 40% of diabetes patients will develop CKD, leading to additional symptoms such as cardiovascular problems.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval was based on results from the Phase IIIb FLOW study (NCT03819153) evaluating Ozempic in adults with T2D and CKD. The therapy helped reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, end-stage kidney disease, and death due to cardiovascular disease by 24% compared to a placebo.\n\nAcross the 3,533 patients who enrolled in the trial, kidney function declined more slowly and the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack dropped by 18%. The drug also cut the risk of cardiovascular-related deaths by 29% and the risk of death from any cause by 20%.\n\nAs per its FDA label, Ozempic is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and established heart disease.\n\nNovo Nordisk is eyeing up further indications for its blockbuster drug such as a potential treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and Alzheimer\u2019s. The company has reported positive results showing Ozempic\u2019s ability to reduce liver and fat scarring in MASH patients, as well as the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nOzempic generated $13.9bn in global sales for Novo Nordisk in 2023. The drug is forecast to reach $23.9bn in sales by 2030, according to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.",

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017.

Defendants\u2019 statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk\u2019s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk\u2019s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a \u201cflexible protocol\u201d which gave patients the ability \u201cto modify their dosing throughout the trial.\u201d When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com.\n\nCASE ALLEGATIONS: Novo Nordisk, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.\n\nThe Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk\u2019s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named \u201cREDEFINE-1,\u201d while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo Nordisk\u2019s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the \u201cflexible protocol\u201d limited the study\u2019s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.\n\nThe Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit further alleges that on December 20, 2024, defendants published headline results from their REDEFINE-1 CagriSema obesity trial, disclosing that \u201c[t]he REDEFINE 1 trial was based on a flexible protocol, allowing patients to modify their dosing throughout the trial\u201d and that \u201c[a]fter 68 weeks, 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose compared to 82.5% with cagrilintide 2.4 mg and 70.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg.\u201d On this news, the price of Novo Nordisk stock fell nearly 18%, according to the complaint.\n\nTHE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit.\n\nABOUT ROBBINS GELLER: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP is one of the world\u2019s leading law firms representing investors in securities fraud cases.

            "content": "When you see the term \u201cthrow-over,\u201d you may be tempted to think of a children\u2019s game. But, in Elliott wave nomenclature, a \u201cthrow-over\u201d occurs when a fifth wave breaks its channel. This price move can precede a major reversal. Our January Global Market Perspective provides a case in point:\n\nWhat kind of catastrophic development could cause a company to lose a third of its value in a few hours? It turns out that Nordisk\u2019s latest drug offering, CagriSema, underwent clinical trials, and patients lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight, slightly below the expected percentage loss of 25%.\n\nDid a 2.3% shortfall in weight loss actually create a \u20ac90 billion market meltdown? The answer, in our view, is both yes and no. Yes, because investors herd in the face of uncertainty, and when a stock is overextended, even a tiny sliver of bad news can send prices reeling. No, because stock market patterns arise from unconscious decisions that depend far less on what the company is doing and far more on what fellow investors are doing. The wave model doesn\u2019t always get things right, but we never wait around looking for the news that perpetually arrives after the fact.\n\nIn fact, the Global Market Perspective profiled Novo Nordisk more than a year ago. The October 2023 GMP published the lefthand chart below, indicating that Minor wave 5 of Intermediate wave (5) was ending. We called the stock a \u201ccritically stretched rubber band\u201d:\n\nAs the updated chart on the right shows, wave 5 of (5) peaked above the top channel boundary in a pattern that R.N. Elliott called a \u201cthrow-over.\u201d Throw-overs precede directional change and typically see prices return back below the channel boundary. True to form, shares completed the round trip by October 2024, fully two months before the 30% wipeout on December 20, 2024.\n\nWe certainly don\u2019t know the inner workings of Novo Nordisk\u2019s drug pipeline, but \u2026 any forthcoming company news is largely written into the waves already.\n\nAnd news about other well-known companies is also written into the waves already.

The FDA's decision means Ozempic can now be used to reduce the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure, and death from cardiovascular disease in patients with both chronic kidney disease and diabetes.\n\nThe decision could transform how doctors treat patients with chronic kidney disease, which involves a gradual loss of kidney function and is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. Around 37 million American adults are living with chronic kidney disease, according to Novo Nordisk.\n\nDiabetes is a key risk factor for kidney disease. Roughly 40% of Type 2 diabetes patients have the condition, which can cause additional sickness such as increased risk of cardiovascular problems and death, Novo Nordisk said.\n\n\"All chronic kidney disease is progressive. It's a year-on-year, relentless decline in renal function,\" Stephen Gough, Novo Nordisk's global chief medical officer, said in an interview, referring to the kidney's ability to filter waste from the blood.\n\nHe noted that when the condition progresses to the point of kidney failure \u2014 also known as end-stage kidney disease \u2014 patients require long-term dialysis treatments to remove waste from the blood, or a kidney transplant. Both are burdensome, and death among patients with end-stage kidney disease is \"very high,\" particularly from cardiovascular disease, according to Gough.\n\nThe approval also demonstrates that a blockbuster class of diabetes and weight loss drugs called GLP-1s have significant health benefits beyond regulating blood sugar and suppressing appetite.\n\nOzempic reduced the risk of severe kidney outcomes \u2014 including kidney failure, reduction in kidney function, or death from kidney or heart causes \u2014 by 24% in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease compared with a placebo, according to results of a late-stage trial that the approval was based on.\n\nIn patients who took Ozempic, kidney function declined more slowly, the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack dropped 18% and the risk of death from any cause fell 20% compared with the placebo. Ozempic also cut the risk of cardiovascular-related deaths by 29%.\n\n\"We know that, unfortunately, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease just go hand in hand,\" Gough said.\n\nHe added that the major treatments patients typically receive when they have the earliest signs of chronic kidney disease aim to reduce cardiovascular risk factors by paying attention to blood pressure.\n\nThe rate of serious adverse side effects was 49.6% in patients who took Ozempic, lower than the 53.8% seen in the group that received a placebo. There was a slightly higher rate of discontinuations among Ozempic patients due to gastrointestinal side effects commonly seen with GLP-1s, such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nEU regulators approved Ozempic for the same use in December.\n\nNovo Nordisk ended the phase three trial in October, a year earlier than expected, in response to positive results. At the time, the Danish company's announcement caused shares of kidney dialysis companies to plummet about 20% in a single day.\n\nThe trial, called FLOW, started in 2019 and followed roughly 3,500 patients with diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.\n\n\"From my point of view as a doctor, you don't get [diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease] in isolation,\" Gough said. \"These illnesses, unfortunately, co-segregate. They cluster within the same individuals. So if you have a medicine that can target each of these co-morbidities in one injection, then you're addressing what really matters to the patient.\"\n\nThe approval comes after the Biden administration selected three of Novo Nordisk's drugs with the active ingredient semaglutide for the second cycle of Medicare drug price negotiations. That includes Ozempic, its weight loss counterpart Wegovy and another diabetes treatment called Rybelsus.\n\nThe FDA's decision also comes as Novo Nordisk faces increased competition from Eli Lilly and tries to win expanded insurance coverage for Wegovy.\n\nLast year, Wegovy won approval in the U.S. for use in slashing the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Novo Nordisk is also studying Wegovy as a potential treatment for fatty liver disease.",

The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm\u2019s attorneys.\n\nClass Period: Nov. 2, 2022 \u2013 Dec. 19, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo\n\nContact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug\u2019s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1.\n\nThe plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a \u201cfalse impression\u201d of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit contends that the company\u2019s \u201crepeated optimistic claims\u201d about CagriSema\u2019s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial\u2019s \u201cflexible protocol,\u201d which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study\u2019s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss.\n\nThe complaint highlights the company\u2019s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors.\n\nShareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial\u2019s design and potential tolerability issues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Novo Nordisk case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Novo Nordisk should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

The FDA approved a new indication for semaglutide to treat adults with type 2 diabetes plus CKD based on results from the FLOW trial. As Healio previously reported, adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD receiving semaglutide had a 24% lower risk for kidney disease events, a 20% reduced risk for all-cause mortality and an 18% lower risk for CVD compared with those receiving placebo in the FLOW trial. Prior to the approval of the drug\u2019s new indication, Matthew Weir, MD, professor and chief of the division of nephrology at University of Maryland School of Medicine, said he felt the FLOW trial findings made semaglutide \u201cchoice No. 1\u201d for glucose control and reducing risk for cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThe FDA has approved a new indication for semaglutide 1 mg to reduce the risk for worsening kidney disease, kidney failure and CV death among adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD.\n\nRichard E. Pratley\n\n\u201cType 2 diabetes can be challenging enough to manage without the added risk of CKD, and I have seen in my own practice that patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD need extra support from medications that may have a profound clinical impact by lowering the risk of major kidney and CV outcomes,\" Richard E. Pratley, MD, medical director at the AdventHealth Diabetes Institute in Orlando, co-chair of the FLOW Trial and a Healio | Endocrine Today co-editor, said in a press release. \"A large portion of patients I treat experience serious kidney complications and comorbidities, with some even requiring dialysis. Today's decision by the FDA offers hope for the millions of adults living with both conditions and provides an additional treatment option, representing a significant advancement for my patients.\"\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval of a new indication is a \u201cwelcomed addition\u201d to the therapies available to treat CKD, according to Kevin M. Pantalone, DO, ECNU, FACE, professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, director of diabetes initiatives and staff endocrinologist in the department of endocrinology at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nKevin M. Pantalone\n\n\u201cThis new CKD indication for Ozempic is very important, as individuals with CKD are five times more likely to die from CV causes than to develop end-stage kidney disease,\u201d Pantalone told Healio. \u201cThis new indication will not only allow us to reduce the risk of progression of CKD, or development of end-stage kidney disease in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes, but will also aid in addressing the elevated CV risk that exists in that population.\u201d\n\nThe new indication is the most recent one approved for Ozempic. As Healio previously reported, the FDA approved a new indication for Ozempic in January 2020 to lower the risk for major adverse CV events in adults with type 2 diabetes and known CVD.\n\n\"This approval for Ozempic allows us to more broadly address conditions within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, which affects millions of adults and could have serious consequences if left untreated,\" Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development, medical and regulatory affairs at Novo Nordisk, said in a press release. \"With this new indication, Ozempic stands out uniquely as the most broadly indicated GLP-1 receptor agonist in its class. We are proud to continue advancing innovations that will have a meaningful impact for this patient population, underscoring Novo Nordisk's commitment to cardiometabolic care.\"\n\nFor more information:\n\nKevin M.

PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says his office has settled with the last of the three largest insulin manufacturers following its 2018 lawsuit over unaffordable prices that led several diabetics to ration their medications with fatal consequences.\n\nEllison says the agreement requires Denmark-based manufacturer Novo Nordisk to cap monthly out-of-pocket payments for insulin at $35 a month for the next five years, even for people without health insurance.\n\n\"The people who discovered insulin over 100 years ago sold their patents for $1 because they understood that it would save lives,\" Ellison said. \"One of them famously said, 'Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world.'\"\n\nEllison says Minnesotans living with diabetes were paying about $6,000 a year on average for insulin, but that cost is now dropping to about $600 annually.\n\nThe announcement comes nearly a year after his office's settlement with Eli Lilly, which eventually slashed prices on its most prescribed insulin products by 70%, as well as capping out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month for those with commercial insurance policies.\n\nEllison's office also reached a similar settlement with manufacturer Sanofi in July.\n\n\"And whether you're using Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk products, your insulin costs will be $35 a month, period,\" he said.\n\nThe agreement reached with Novo Nordisk covers popular brands like Flasp, Novolin, NovoLog and Tresib, with three vials or two packs of pins allowed each month.\n\nThe attorney general's website provides complete information on the brands available and how to buy them at the discounted price.\n\n\"Insulin is not an optional medication \u2014 it is our life support\"\n\nEllison was joined at Monday morning's press conference by Nicole Smith-Holt, mother of 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 from diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nSmith had aged out of coverage under his mother's insurance, leading him to ration his insulin \u2014 which cost $1,300 per month.\n\nSmith's death led his mother to champion the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act, signed into law by Gov. Tim Walz in 2020. It caps out-of-pocket costs for diabetics in Minnesota at $35 per month.\n\n\"There is a long list of people who have died from complications or from rationing, and Minnesota has stood boldly against Big Pharma and said it's unacceptable,\" Smith-Holt said at Monday's press conference.\n\nAdvocate Quinn Nystrom, who lives with Type 1 diabetes and is on the American Diabetes Association of Minnesota's board of directors, also spoke Monday in the aftermath of the settlement.\n\n\"Insulin is not an optional medication \u2014 it is our life support,\" Nystrom said. \"We live in the wealthiest, most developed country in the world and we're the only country who is facing this issue, where we have let pharmaceutical companies dictate how much my life costs.\"\n\nShe says January is a difficult month for many diabetics due to the restart of deductible payments, but this final settlement ends the need for diabetics to make unthinkable decisions when it comes to their health and finances.\n\n\"Instead of saying, 'You owe us $2,600, pay up or you gotta go home and ration,' now they can say, 'We just need $35,'\" she said.\n\nNystrom also called on people to spread the news of affordable insulin on social media and beyond.\n\n\"How does a regular, just working-class person afford to stay alive? We're talking about in the United States of America. That's crazy. OK, that's crazy,\" she said. \"And so I'm blessed because I happen to be born in the state of Minnesota.\"\n\nIn 2022, former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, capping out-of-pocket insulin costs to seniors on Medicare at $35 a month.\n\nWCCO-TV has reached out to Novo Nordisk for comment on the settlement.",

While the pharmaceutical company denies any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the terms to demonstrate its commitment to improving insulin accessibility. The settlement establishes a critical structure for affordable insulin, offering a significant relief for insulin-dependent Minnesotans.\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nMinnesota initiated this lawsuit in 2018 under the state\u2019s former Attorney General, Lori Swanson. The lawsuit contended that high insulin prices imposed undue burdens on insulin-dependent individuals. The settlement agreement is consistent with similar resolutions reached by Eli Lilly and Sanofi, two other major insulin manufacturers. Notably, the settlement requires Novo Nordisk to make insulin affordable at a price point ensuring more equitable access \u2014 $35 per month \u2014 irrespective of the patient\u2019s insurance status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis price cap is expected to make a significant impact, given the high cost of insulin and the financial strain it imposes on individuals relying on it for daily survival. By limiting the price to $35, insulin will become more attainable for many Minnesotans, particularly those in low-income groups. Additionally, the agreement outlines provisions for free insulin supplies to qualifying low-income residents, further emphasizing the settlement\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s compliance with the settlement reflects broader industry changes. The notable shift in pricing strategy aligns with a growing trend among pharmaceutical companies towards more transparent and affordable medication pricing. This trend has evolved in response to increasing public and governmental pressure for pharmaceutical transparency and fairness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this progressive settlement, Novo Nordisk maintains its stance of denying any misconduct or exploitation in its initial pricing strategies. The decision to settle indicates a strategic move to focus on forward-looking initiatives and social responsibility rather than engaging in prolonged legal disputes. The company\u2019s U.S. operations are based out of New Jersey, enhancing the significance of its involvement in the Newark court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThe measure provides a model that other states may observe closely, potentially influencing further settlements or policy adjustments that target inflated medication prices. Such settlements reinforce ongoing dialogues about healthcare affordability and the role of pharmaceutical companies in ensuring access to essential medications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuartz Intelligence Newsroom uses generative artificial intelligence to report on business trends.

            "content": "A next-generation Novo Nordisk obesity drug designed to hit two targets has preliminary clinical data showing 22% weight loss, results that suggest the once-weekly injection could have an edge over the company\u2019s main metabolic medicines rival, Eli Lilly.\n\nThe drug, amycretin, is a peptide designed to bind to and activate both the GLP-1 and amylin receptors. Novo Nordisk is developing the molecule for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, testing both injectable and oral formulations. The results announced Friday are from a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating amycretin administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection in 125 patients with overweight or obesity. The proof-of-concept portion of the trial assessed escalating doses for up to 36 weeks.\n\nThe 22% weight loss reported in the study was for the highest dose: 20 mg weekly for 36 weeks. The results reported by Novo Nordisk also show that participants who received a placebo experienced weight gain, which is unusual for an obesity study. Regarding amycretin\u2019s safety, the company said the drug\u2019s profile was consistent with other therapies that mimic gut hormones. Gastrointestinal complications are common with these therapies, and Novo Nordisk said most such events in the trial were mild to moderate. The company offered no additional detail.\n\nNovo Nordisk is taking multiple shots on the goal of developing a next-generation obesity drug. CagriSema, for example, combines semaglutide, the main pharmaceutical ingredient in the company\u2019s approved obesity med Wegovy, with another engineered peptide called cagrilintide. Novo Nordisk last month reported this once-weekly injection achieved statistically significant weight loss in a Phase 3 study, but those results were below investor expectations. Based on the encouraging early results from the amycretin study, Novo Nordisk said it is planning further clinical development of this drug candidate in adults with overweight or obesity.\n\nComparing drugs across clinical trials has limitations, but acknowledging those caveats, analysts see the preliminary amycretin data as supporting Novo Nordisk\u2019s competitive position versus Eli Lilly\u2019s next-gen obesity medications. In a note sent to investors, William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said the highest amycretin dose tested appears to slightly outperform retatrutide, an experimental Lilly drug designed to hit three targets. But Hsieh also flagged the average weight increase observed from participants who received a placebo, which could have improved the average weight loss magnitude for amycretin by 4.5% to 5.0%. Furthermore, the company did not say how many patients discontinued the study drug in the clinical trial. The results were based on those who adhered to treatment, which Hsieh said has the potential to inflate the treatment effect in the real-world setting.\n\nThe lack of detailed safety data was a sticking point for Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. Though initial results for oral amycretin reported last March showed strong weight loss results at 12 weeks, the presentation of more detailed data at the European Society of Diabetes meeting last September showed high rates of nausea and vomiting \u2014 higher than Lilly\u2019s Zepbound in its pivotal study.\n\n\u201cWe thus await detailed results from [Novo Nordisk\u2019s] injectable amycretin trial at a medical conference this year to better assess the drug\u2019s full profile,\u201d Risinger said.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research.

            "content": "The pharmaceutical watchdog has reprimanded Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk for failing to correctly disclose dozens of payments to the UK health sector as it sought to boost sales of its slimming drugs.\n\nThe Danish drug giant \u2013 Europe\u2019s most valuable listed company \u2013 systematically misreported, under-reported or did not disclose funding given over seven years to pharmacy firms, obesity charities, training providers, professional bodies and patient groups.\n\nEven after admitting to errors and conducting an internal review, it failed to accurately report its spending. The company has now been formally reprimanded by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), which said it had brought the industry into disrepute.\n\nFinding 48 breaches of the industry code, it said serious compliance failings \u2013 committed while Novo Nordisk was already the subject of an audit after previous breaches \u2013 \u201craised questions about the culture of the company and demonstrated poor governance and a lack of care\u201d.\n\nIt said that \u201cby failing to publicly disclose payments, inaccurately reporting and misreporting payments to healthcare organisations and patient organisations over an extended period of time\u201d, it \u201chad brought discredit upon, and reduced confidence in, the pharmaceutical industry\u201d.\n\nThe company was not referred for further sanctions because it has already been punished for similar breaches and is subject to an ongoing audit, the PMCPA panel said.\n\nThe undisclosed payments came to light after an investigation by academics in the UK and Sweden who cross-referenced transparency disclosures by Novo Nordisk with financial statements and other records from UK healthcare organisations.\n\nThe firm had previously admitted failing to correctly disclose payments, telling the PMCPA in 2023 that it had omitted more than 500 transactions worth \u00a37.8m to more than 150 organisations between 2020 and 2022.\n\nIt was subsequently found to be in breach of industry code by the PMCPA which said in July that there had been \u201cfundamental governance failures\u201d.\n\nBut the investigation by researchers at Bath and Lund universities, which overlapped with the PMCPA probe, found that even after conducting an internal review and claiming to rectify the issue, Novo Nordisk failed to accurately record further payments totalling \u00a3635,000 to 30 organisations.\n\nThey submitted a 130-page complaint to the PMCPA which said in a ruling on Friday that Novo Nordisk repeatedly broke industry code over the payments, from 2015 to 2022.\n\nThese included \u00a3183,000 in undeclared funding to a weight-loss-coaching company that partners with pharmacies and the NHS and sponsorship of webinars provided by a medical training provider and grants to charities and a royal college. A \u00a3338,435 payment to a global obesity organisation was also incorrectly disclosed.\n\nDr Emily Rickard, who led the research at Bath, said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that so many errors were not picked up in Novo Nordisk\u2019s own review. This was \u201cespecially troubling\u201d, given that they coincided with the UK launch of \u201cblockbuster weight-loss drugs like Wegovy\u201d. \u201cThis happened while the company was under audit \u2013 when compliance should have been a priority,\u201d Rickard said. \u201cIt raises serious questions about transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\nDr Piotr Ozieranski, a colleague of Rickard\u2019s at Bath, said: \u201cWhen a company as large as Novo Nordisk doesn\u2019t disclose payments, it\u2019s not just damaging to their reputation \u2013 it undermines trust in the entire healthcare system.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said it had voluntarily flagged most of the missed disclosures itself, and the others had now been accurately disclosed, adding that it was \u201ccommitted to adhering to\u201d industry code and maintaining the highest ethicalstandards.\n\nThe ruling against Novo Nordisk follows a series of investigations into tactics used by the Wegovy maker to promote its drugs.The Observer previously revealed how Novo Nordisk paid experts who went on to promote its drugs in media appearances without always making their financial interests clear. It has also funded the rollout of NHS weight loss services and provided hundreds of thousands of pounds\u2019 worth of sponsorship to pharmacies including Boots and Lloyds.\n\nThe researchers said the latest findings showed the need for a \u201ctotal overhaul\u201d of systems for monitoring pharmaceutical spending in Britain.\n\nThere is no legal requirement for companies to disclose payments to the healthcare sector, but many subscribe to an industry code that requires them to report through a voluntary scheme called Disclosure UK.\n\nAlleged breaches are assessed by the PMCPA, which can impose sanctions, including a public reprimand or requiring the company to publish a corrective statement. It can also report the company to the ABPI board, which may suspend or expel the firm from the association.\n\nCritics say this is not enough. They are calling for a government run, centralised database for payment reporting, accessible to the public, with rigorous enforcement and penalties for non-compliance. \u201cTransparency in the UK\u2019s pharmaceutical industry is transparency in name only. A total overhaul is urgently needed,\u201d Ozieranski said.\n\nThe Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which represents drug firms, declined to comment, but Dr Amit Aggarwal, director of medical affairs, said the case was evidence the self-regulatory system was \u201cholding companies to account\u201d.\n\nThe Department of Health said: \u201cWe are considering options to increase transparency and will set out next steps soon.\u201d",

The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk witnessed a significant uptick in its share price during European trading on Friday following the announcement of promising early-stage trial results for its innovative obesity treatment, Amycretin.\n\nThe Danish pharmaceutical giant reported that patients administered with Amycretin experienced an average weight loss of 22% over a 36-week period, a stark contrast to the 2% weight gain observed in the placebo group. This development marks a pivotal moment for Novo Nordisk, especially in light of recent setbacks with its CagriSema drug.\n\nThe announcement of Amycretin\u2019s efficacy has been a catalyst for renewed investor confidence. Shares of Novo Nordisk surged by as much as 14% in Copenhagen, marking the largest intra-day gain since August 8, 2023. This rebound comes after the stock had nearly halved, declining by 46%, since its peak of approximately 1,000 Danish krone in June 2024.\n\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the subcutaneous phase 1b/2a results for Amycretin in people living with overweight or obesity,\u201d Martin Lange, Executive Vice President for Development at Novo Nordisk, stated. He further emphasized the drug\u2019s potential, noting, \u201cThe results seen in the trial support the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist, amycretin, that we have previously seen with the oral formulation.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst James Quigley provided deeper insights into Amycretin\u2019s promising results. He suggested that the positive data could alleviate previous concerns stemming from the disappointing outcomes of CagriSema trials last month. Quigley highlighted the potential for Amycretin to deliver even greater weight loss in future studies, especially within populations with higher baseline BMIs.\n\n\u201cOverall, we see the headline weight loss result as potentially best in class,\u201d Quigley commented, maintaining a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Novo Nordisk with a 12-month price target of DKK 875 (approximately $124). He outlined key risks, including clinical uncertainties, manufacturing scalability, competitive pressures, and potential pricing challenges.\n\nSimilarly, Emily Field, an analyst at Barclays, echoed the positive sentiment. \u201cThis news finally breaks the tide of negative sentiment for Novo,\u201d Field remarked, adding that the data was \u201con par with the best\u201d results achieved at this stage for weight loss drugs.\n\nBloomberg highlighted Amycretin\u2019s unique approach to weight loss, noting that it combines two mechanisms within a single molecule. \u201cAmycretin mimics both GLP-1 \u2014 the ingredient that powers Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 and another gut hormone called amylin,\u201d Bloomberg reported. This dual-action strategy positions Amycretin as a potentially superior alternative in the competitive landscape of obesity treatments.\n\nThe positive developments surrounding Amycretin come as Novo Nordisk seeks to recover from the setbacks experienced with CagriSema, another weight loss drug that failed to meet analyst expectations last month.\n\nQuigley indicated that there might be an acceleration into Phase 3 trials, contingent on the trial\u2019s design and dosing protocols. This potential acceleration could further enhance Novo Nordisk\u2019s obesity franchise value, extending its market leadership beyond the current patent lifecycle.\n\nIn addition to the subcutaneous injection form, Novo Nordisk is also developing Amycretin as an oral pill. Early-stage studies have shown that the pill formulation enabled obese participants to lose an average of 13.1% of their weight after 12 weeks of treatment. These dual formulations\u2014injectable and oral\u2014could provide versatile treatment options, catering to different patient preferences and improving overall adherence.\n\nThe company plans to decide on further studies for Amycretin following the data from the subcutaneous version, as stated in their September announcement.\n\nInformation for this story was found via Reuters, ZeroHedge, and the sources and companies mentioned.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk has been one of the chief beneficiaries of the boom in GLP-1 drugs, which have shown great promise in fighting obesity. Competition in the space is fierce, but shares got a much-needed boost on Friday after the Danish pharmaceutical giant released promising trial results for a next-generation drug that the company hopes will build on the success of flagship weight-loss treatments Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nLike those injections, the new drug targets gut hormone GLP-1 but additionally mimics amylin, a hormone released by the pancreas that suppresses hunger. Novo\u2019s U.S.-listed shares jumped over 10% in premarket trading Friday and remained up over 7% midmorning after the company said people who received the new treatment reduced their weight, on average, by 22%, over 36 weeks, compared with a weight gain of 2% for those who received a placebo. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, the company added, with the vast majority being mild to moderate in severity.\n\nBoth Wegovy, Novo\u2019s main obesity offering, and diabetes treatment Ozempic have soared in popularity and been touted as \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d for their startling efficacy in helping patients lose weight, along with other potential health benefits. That drove Novo\u2019s U.S.-listed shares to a record high of $148.15 this past June, up more than double from where they sat at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe stock has declined roughly 40% since, however, and currently trades just short of the $90 mark. One reason is pressure from American drugmaker Eli Lilly, which makes competing products Zepbound and Mounjaro (alternatives to Wegovy and Ozempic, respectively).\n\nNovo\u2019s stock fell slightly in early December after a trial sponsored by Lilly found that patients who took Zepbound lost 20.2% of their body weight, on average, compared with just a 13.7% reduction for those taking Wegovy.\n\nAn analyst at a Danish bank said that Novo\u2019s Friday trial results for the amylin treatment, however, could help restore investor faith in the company\u2019s drug pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early and not many patients, but it can give some hope that you have a product that can take over from Wegovy and that can compete to a great extent,\u201d Jyske Bank\u2019s Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told Reuters.\n\nThat does not mean investors should necessarily anticipate blockbuster returns in the year ahead. CFRA Research analyst Wan Nurhayati recently reduced his price target on the stock from $122 to $90 after the U.S. government said Ozempic and Wegovy would be among the 15 drugs targeted for a second round of Medicare price negotiations in 2027.",

Captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713 (D.N.J.), the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit charges Novo Nordisk and certain of Novo Nordisk\u2019s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Novo Nordisk class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\n\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-novo-nordisk-a-s-class-action-lawsuit-nvo.html\n\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class.

            "content": "With a deep commitment to innovation, the company has developed market-leading products that address two of the most critical global health crises of our time. Here's an in-depth look at Novo Nordisk's current position, growth potential, risks, and valuation.\n\nNovo nordisk Abnehmspritze\n\n1. Product Pipeline: Industry-Leading Innovations\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s portfolio revolves around groundbreaking treatments for diabetes and obesity, two conditions that are surging in prevalence globally.\n\nBlockbuster Drugs\n\nOzempic : A GLP-1 receptor agonist that has revolutionized type 2 diabetes treatment. Beyond its primary use, Ozempic has gained significant off-label traction for weight loss, driving record-breaking demand.\n\nWegovy : Specifically approved for obesity management, Wegovy has become a game-changer in helping patients achieve clinically significant weight loss. Its launch marked Novo Nordisk\u2019s commitment to addressing obesity as a chronic condition, not just a lifestyle issue.\n\nRybelsus: The first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, offering a convenient alternative to injectable treatments. This innovation expands accessibility and appeals to patients reluctant to use injectable therapies.\n\nUpcoming Innovations\n\nCagriSema : A next-generation drug combining semaglutide (GLP-1) with cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analog. Early clinical trials suggest it may achieve even greater weight loss than Wegovy, positioning it as the next flagship product.\n\nInsulin icodec: A once-weekly insulin under development that could significantly improve diabetes management by reducing the frequency of injections.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s pipeline reflects its dedication to developing both incremental improvements and transformative innovations in metabolic care.\n\n2. Market Opportunity: Tapping Into Global Health Crises\n\nDiabetes Epidemic\n\nThe International Diabetes Federation estimates that over 530 million adults globally have diabetes, with the number projected to reach 640 million by 2030 .\n\nAs one of the leading diabetes care companies, Novo Nordisk is well-positioned to capture this growing market. Its products cover all stages of the diabetes care continuum, from early interventions to advanced treatments for complications.\n\nObesity as a Growth Engine\n\nObesity affects over 1 billion people worldwide, yet it remains undertreated. Only a small fraction of patients receive medical intervention.\n\nGovernments and insurers are beginning to recognize the long-term cost savings of treating obesity proactively. This shift bodes well for drugs like Wegovy and future pipeline candidates such as CagriSema.\n\nGeographic Expansion\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk has a strong foothold in North America and Europe, emerging markets like Asia and Latin America offer untapped potential. Rising healthcare spending and growing awareness of chronic conditions in these regions create significant opportunities.\n\n3. Financial Performance: A Consistent Compounder\n\nNovo Nordisk has delivered strong financial results, cementing its reputation as a reliable performer in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nRevenue has grown consistently at a double-digit rate, driven primarily by the success of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy. In 2022, sales of obesity-related treatments alone surged by over 84% YoY, reflecting the growing demand for effective solutions.\n\nProfitability\n\nNovo Nordisk boasts an operating margin of over 40%, significantly higher than the industry average. This is a testament to its pricing power, operational efficiency, and high-margin product portfolio.\n\nCash Flow and Dividends\n\nThe company generates robust free cash flow, enabling it to fund R&D, expand manufacturing capacity, and reward shareholders.\n\nDividend Yield: Currently around 1.5%, Novo Nordisk\u2019s dividend policy reflects its commitment to steady payouts while reinvesting in growth.\n\nShare\n\n4. Competitive Landscape: Staying Ahead of the Pack\n\nKey Competitors\n\nEli Lilly : A major rival in the diabetes and obesity markets, Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro has shown exceptional results, creating stiff competition for Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nPfizer and Amgen: Both are developing weight-loss treatments, signaling intensified competition in the obesity space.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Advantages\n\nBrand Loyalty : Products like Ozempic and Wegovy have strong brand recognition and patient trust, making them hard to displace.\n\nManufacturing Scale : Novo Nordisk is expanding its production capacity to meet skyrocketing demand for its obesity treatments, a move that positions it well against supply-constrained competitors.\n\nFirst-Mover Advantage: Its early focus on obesity treatment gives it a strategic edge in a market that is still in its infancy.\n\n5. Valuation: Is Novo Nordisk Fairly Priced?\n\nCurrent Metrics\n\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio : ~38x, reflecting its premium positioning and high growth potential.\n\nForward P/E : Estimated at ~32x, indicating expectations of sustained earnings growth.\n\nPEG Ratio: 1.7, suggesting that growth justifies the valuation, though the stock isn\u2019t a bargain.\n\nPeer Comparison\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s valuation is comparable to Eli Lilly (~40x P/E), highlighting the premium investors are willing to pay for market leaders in the diabetes and obesity space.\n\nVerdict on Valuation\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk\u2019s valuation is high, it is supported by its dominant market position, robust growth trajectory, and industry-leading margins. For long-term investors, the stock offers compelling growth potential, even at current levels.\n\n6. Risks to Monitor\n\nDespite its strengths, Novo Nordisk faces risks that could impact its long-term performance:\n\nRegulatory Pressure: Pricing scrutiny, especially in the U.S., could affect margins. Supply Chain Constraints: Rising demand for Wegovy and Ozempic has already led to temporary shortages. Competition: Rivals like Eli Lilly are advancing their own GLP-1 drugs, potentially eroding market share.\n\n7. Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Compounder\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s focus on addressing two of the world\u2019s most pressing health challenges\u2014diabetes and obesity\u2014positions it as a vital player in the healthcare industry. Its innovative pipeline, strong financials, and ability to expand into underpenetrated markets make it a compelling choice for long-term investors.\n\nWhile the stock trades at a premium, its growth prospects and competitive moat justify the valuation. For those willing to hold through potential short-term volatility, Novo Nordisk offers a rare combination of stability and growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s Your View?\n\nDo you see Novo Nordisk maintaining its leadership, or will competitors like Eli Lilly catch up?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 2025.\n\nStocks have been performing well lately as they seem to have been influenced by the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the new administration. CNBC reported that stocks rose on January 22, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time high, as technology stocks rallied on AI optimism and President Trump\u2019s new term in office.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 22, stocks finished higher as all 3 of the major indexes ended the session in the green. The S&P 500 increased by 0.61% after reaching an intraday record of 6,100.81 before closing at 6,086.37. The Nasdaq Composite excelled and rose 1.28% to reach 20,009.34, underscoring the outperformance of tech stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 130.92 points, or 0.3%, to close at 44,156.73.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Best Sin Stocks to Invest in 2025.\n\nPresident Trump also recently announced a joint venture named \u201cStargate,\u201d involving OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, to invest at least $500 billion in AI infrastructure within the US. Stocks rose because of solid earnings reports and investors continued to pile into the AI space following this recent announcement by the new administration.\n\nKeith Lerner, Truist\u2019s co-chief investment officer, pointed out that a combination of a resilient economy, easing inflation, stabilizing of interest rates, and a strong start to the earnings season has created a favorable environment for the market. He noted that AI and technology continue to be key drivers of this bull market.\n\nAnother key factor playing a role in this market rally is the optimism around Trump\u2019s agenda. Investors are hoping that Trump will ease regulations and reduce corporate taxes, which could lead to an increase in profits.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 2025, we used the Finviz stock screener to look for stocks that analysts believe will gain more than 30% in the next 12 months. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 stocks. Finally, we ranked the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 2025 based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts as of January 22, 2025. Additionally, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nAverage Price Target Upside Potential According to Analysts: 82.19%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish multinational pharmaceutical company that ranks among the best stocks to buy and hold for 2025 according to analysts. With a focus on diabetes, obesity, rare diseases, and cardiovascular conditions, the company markets its products and services in around 170 countries.\n\nIn its Q3 2024 investor letter, PGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund noted that Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is one of the fastest-growing biopharma companies in the world with transformative new drugs in large and growing markets like diabetes and obesity. The fund also pointed out that the company\u2019s potential for growth from new products is not fully appreciated. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) has a strong research and development engine that has proved to be very productive and successful in the past. The company has several programs in diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease that are expected to yield results in the next 3-4 years. PGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund believes that the stock will continue to outperform and its performance is expected to be driven by the company\u2019s next-gen obesity and diabetes drug, CagriSema, and by improvements in supply through organic growth as well as inorganically through the Catalent acquisition.\n\nThe company is strategically focused on expanding its manufacturing capabilities through investments and acquisitions. In December 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) announced that it plans to invest DKK 8.5 billion to develop a new production facility in Odense, Denmark. Construction has begun and the new site is planned to be completed in 2027. Additionally, on December 18, 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) completed its acquisition of three manufacturing sites in connection with the agreement to acquire Catalent.\n\nOverall, NVO ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk A/S is a global healthcare company specializing in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical products to treat diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (CPH:NOVO B) has had a rough three months with its share price down 21%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Novo Nordisk is:\n\n79% = kr.95b \u00f7 kr.121b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every DKK1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn DKK0.79 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nNovo Nordisk's Earnings Growth And 79% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Novo Nordisk has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 13% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 20% net income growth seen by Novo Nordisk over the past five years.\n\nWe then compared Novo Nordisk's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is NOVO B worth today? The helps visualize whether NOVO B is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Novo Nordisk Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nNovo Nordisk has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 48% (or a retention ratio of 52%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\n\nMoreover, Novo Nordisk is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 48%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 83%.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Novo Nordisk's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk A/S is a global healthcare company specializing in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical products to treat diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock surged Friday after the obesity kingpin reported strong results for its next-generation weight-loss drug, amycretin.\n\nOver the course of 36 weeks, patients who took the highest dose of the weekly shot lost 22% of their body weight. That compares with a 2% weight gain for the placebo group.\n\nThe results line up favorably with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound, which at best has shown 22.5% weight loss over 72 weeks. They also appear to outperform Lilly's next-generation drug, retatrutide, William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said in a client note.\n\nNovo Nordisk stock jumped 8.5% to close at 87.97.\n\nShares of other weight-loss players diverged on Novo Nordisk's news. Lilly stock rose 2.5% to 785.41, while Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) shares yo-yoed and eventually closed down 1.3%, at 34.50. Amgen (AMGN), which is also working on a weight-loss shot, shed 1.8%, closing regular trades at 275.42.\n\nMoving On From Wegovy?\n\nAmycretin works differently from Novo Nordisk's blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy. Wegovy mimics the GLP-1 hormone to improve feelings of satiety and markers of blood sugar. Novo also sells the same active ingredient as a type 2 diabetes treatment called Ozempic.\n\nAmycretin, on the other hand, mimics both the GLP-1 hormone and a hormone called amylin. The latter plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels. It also slows how fast the stomach empties itself.\n\nThe highest dose Novo Nordisk tested was 20 milligrams. At 1.25 milligrams, patients lost 9.7% of their body weight over 20 weeks. Another group received a 5-milligram dose for 28 weeks and lost 16.2% of their body weight.\n\nLilly's Zepbound and Viking's experimental VK-2735 use another mechanism. They mimic GLP-1 and GIPR. GIPR, or the GIP receptor, increases energy expenditure and reduces food intake.\n\nHsieh says the results affect Viking Therapeutics in two opposing ways. On one hand, Viking is working on an amylin-based drug that could begin clinical testing this year. The results from Novo support the amylin approach, he said.\n\n\"However, we believe that amycretin has potential to emerge as a viable competitor to the GLP-1/GIP dual agonist approach,\" he said. \"As a result, we expect Viking shares to be volatile with a downward bias.\"\n\nFacing Off With Eli Lilly\n\nThe results could help bolster Novo Nordisk against Eli Lilly. In a head-to-head study, Zepbound patients lost an average 20.2% of their body weight over 72 weeks, while Wegovy recipients had a 13.7% reduction in body weight.\n\nMeanwhile, Lilly's next-generation weight-loss drug, retatrutide, is looking less bullish compared with amycretin. Retatrutide works by mimicking three hormones: GLP-1, GIPR and glucagon. The middle 5-milligram dose of amycretin looked similar to retatrutide, while the lowest dose looked similar to Zepbound, William Blair's Hsieh said.\n\nIn December, Novo's CagriSema \u2014 another drug targeting amylin and GLP-1 \u2014 disappointed in a Phase 3 study. Patients lost 22.7% of their body weight over 68 weeks. That topped the 16.1% weight loss for Wegovy recipients, but missed Novo's guidance for 25% weight loss.\n\n\"Novo could leverage amycretin as an alternative to Lilly's Zepbound or retatrutide, though the exact strategic positioning will likely be clarified with full data,\" Hsieh said.\n\nPill Space Heats Up\n\nNovo is also developing amycretin as a once-daily pill.\n\nIn March 2024, Novo Nordisk said patients who took a daily pill of amycretin lost 13.1% of their body weight, topping the placebo group by 11.9%. But that came alongside numerous side effects. Three-quarters of patients experienced nausea and 56% had vomiting, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a report.\n\nTo compare, just 31% and 12% of patients in Lilly's 72-week study of Zepbound experienced nausea and vomiting, respectively.\n\nStill, the race to develop a weight-loss pill is on and a slew of competitors have lined up. But most are betting on mimicking GLP-1 alone or GLP-1 and GIPR. Lilly, Viking, Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are all on the field.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

Twice in the past two months, investors have been disappointed by the numbers -- 22.7% average weight loss over 68 weeks for CagriSema, and 20.7% weight loss for a 72-week regimen of semaglutide 7.2 milligram (mg).\n\nOn Friday, however, Novo Nordisk announced top-line results in yet another trial. While the results don't initially sound as good as those in the trials cited above, however, the speed at which they were achieved has investors cheering, and Novo Nordisk stock is up 7.7% through 10:50 a.m. Friday morning.\n\nWhat Novo Nordisk announced\n\nNovo Nordisk describes its latest work as \"a phase 1b/2a clinical trial with amycretin, a unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist intended for once weekly subcutaneous administration.\" (Which is to say, you take a shot once a week.)\n\nStudied over 36 weeks, in doses from 1.25 mg to 20 mg, patients taking amycretin experienced only \"mild to moderate\" gastrointestinal side effects, says Novo, and in exchange enjoyed a 9.7% average reduction in body weight.\n\nThat's a pretty big change in a pretty short time, roughly half as much time as the semaglutide 7.2 mg study for half as much weight loss, and Novo Nordisk says it is \"very encouraged\" by this outcome. Based on the results, Novo says it is \"planning further clinical development of amycretin.\"\n\nIs Novo Nordisk stock a buy?\n\nAdmittedly, we're talking about an early-stage trial here, basically halfway along the trek from phase 1 to phase 3. Still, the results seem to be encouraging investors. And there's another thing they might find encouraging: At 27.4 times earnings today, Novo Nordisk stock costs barely one-third the P/E ratio of Novo's closest competitor in GLP-1 weight loss drugs, Eli Lilly (LLY 1.48%).

In the Phase III REDEFINE 1 trial, CagriSema cut body weight by 22.7% at 68 weeks\u2014an effect that Novo touted as encouraging at the time, but came below its previous projection of 25% weight-loss.\n\nNovo dipped up to 20% in that trial\u2019s aftermath, losing some $72 billion from its market cap.\n\nFriday\u2019s data come from 125 patients enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blinded Phase Ib/IIa trial. The study combined single-ascending dose, multiple-ascending dose and dose-response designs to assess the efficacy and safety of three different amycretin doses\u20141.25 mg, 5 mg and 20 mg\u2014over a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks.\n\nAt 20 weeks, patients on the 1.25-mg dose saw a 9.7% drop in body weight, versus 1.9% weight gain in placebo comparators at the same time point. Amycretin was uptitrated to 5 mg by 28 weeks, at which point patients lost 16.2% of their weight, whereas placebo counterparts gained 2.3%.\n\nBy 36 weeks, the amycretin dose had been bumped up to 20 mg, resulting in 22% weight-loss. Placebo counterparts at this time point saw a weight increase of 2.0%.\n\nNovo was trading around 12% higher on the Danish stock exchange Friday morning.\n\nMartin Lange, the company\u2019s executive vice president for development, said in a statement that the pharma is \u201cencouraged\u201d by these findings, which \u201csupport the weight lowering potential of this novel unimolecular GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist.\u201d\n\nIn an investor note, analysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote that Friday\u2019s amycretin readout will \u201c[reopen] the door in the eyes of investors with a next gen option beyond semaglutide.\u201d\n\nSubcutaneous amycretin \u201ccould start to shift the narrative around Novo shares with a next gen therapy in the company\u2019s pipeline that could be competitive with the likes of Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide and retatrutide,\u201d the analysts added.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts, in their own note, pointed out that Novo did not provide safety data in its press release, which \u201ccould have better contextualized amycretin\u2019s clinical profile for investors.\u201d Still, the results \u201cfurther validate the amylin-based approach\u201d in obesity, the analysts wrote.\n\nAmycretin is a long-acting agonist of both the GLP-1 and amylin receptors and works by controlling blood sugar levels and modulating appetite. Friday\u2019s data come from Novo\u2019s subcutaneous formulation of amycretin, but the pharma is also developing an oral version.\n\nAt the 2024 annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in September, Novo released Phase I data for oral amycretin, touting what it called a \u201cremarkable\u201d 13% weight-loss at 12 weeks\u2014and pointing to the lack of a plateau effect, suggesting potentially stronger effects with prolonged exposure.\n\nNovo plans to take amycretin into \u201cfurther clinical development\u201d in obesity and overweight, according to Friday\u2019s news release.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nAn experimental obesity drug from Novo Nordisk helped people lose an average of up to 22% of their body weight over 36 weeks in an early-stage trial, results that, if reproduced in further testing, could rival medicines Eli Lilly has on the market and in development.\n\nNovo said Friday it is planning \u201cfurther clinical development\u201d of the drug, called amycretin, but didn\u2019t specify the design of additional trials or when they might begin. Amycretin affects the same two targets as a Novo drug called cagrisema that recently missed expectations in a Phase 3 trial, but does so in a single molecule rather than a two-drug combination.\n\nNovo shares, which fell sharply on the cagrisema news, rose as much as 11% in before settling into an 8% gain midday Friday. But while multiple Wall Street analysts expressed enthusiasm, they also noted the lack of specific safety data and other caveats that render comparisons to other medicines difficult to make.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe obesity drug race is far from over, with a plethora of companies vying for a piece of what\u2019s expected to become a huge market in the years ahead. Analysts project that \u201cincretin\u201d drugs, like Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, could top more than $100 billion in yearly sales by 2030.\n\nZepbound and Wegovy have set the bar for the competition, stimulating weight loss of about 21% and 16% in testing, respectively, and showing they can lower the risk of certain obesity-related health complications. But clinicians are hoping the drugs that come next might be more potent or address their weaknesses, such as the loss of lean muscle along with fat and the frequency of side effects that can cause people to discontinue treatment.\n\nOne way drugmakers say they could boost weight loss is by simultaneously targeting multiple metabolic hormones with a single medicine. Zepbound, which targets the hormones GLP-1 and GIP, is one example.\n\nNovo is employing a different strategy with cagrisema and now amycretin, which both target GLP-1 and the hormone amylin. Novo reported Phase 1 data for an oral form of amycretin about a year ago. The new results involve a version of the drug delivered via an under-the-skin injection. They\u2019re from a Phase 2 trial testing several different once-weekly doses against a placebo.\n\nAccording to Novo, a 1.25 milligram weekly dose helped people lose an average of around 10% of their body weight at 20 weeks. Those who received a 5 milligram dose lost a mean of 16% after 28 weeks, while trial participants given the 20 milligram dose lost 22%, on average, at 36 weeks. Those measurements were calculated at different time points because of the study\u2019s protocol.\n\nWall Street analysts were impressed with the drug\u2019s effectiveness. David Risinger, of Leerink Partners, noted that the weight loss associated with amycretin was higher, at the same time point, than what was observed in testing of Lilly\u2019s drug.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal added that the data look \u201cvery good\u201d and, \u201cif trends continue\n\nin larger trials,\u201d could portend even more substantial weight loss.\n\nStill, there were \u201cthree important caveats\u201d from Novo\u2019s press release that could temper enthusiasm, wrote William Blair\u2019s Andy Hsieh. One is that placebo recipients gained weight, on average, in the trial, which is \u201crare\u201d in larger obesity studies. Another is Novo didn\u2019t provide safety results, only noting in its announcement that side effects were \u201cconsistent with incretin-based therapies\u201d and typically mild to moderate in nature.\n\nLastly, Novo only disclosed weight-loss data for the trial volunteers who stayed on treatment, \u201cwhich has the potential to inflate treatment effect in the real-world setting,\u201d Hsieh wrote.\n\nIn response to an e-mail query from BioPharma Dive, a company spokesperson declined to say how many study volunteers stopped therapy or when the company might reveal more detailed data about those participants.",

He has focused on personalising the treatment of patients and using artificial intelligence to make significant progress in clinical research with great results for patients.\n\n\u201dWe should provide the world\u2019s best possible treatment for patients.\u201d This is how Ismail G\u00f6genur describes how he started his journey, setting out to assemble a cross-disciplinary team to develop individualised strategies for treating people with cancer.\n\nAs one of Denmark\u2019s leading researchers in colorectal cancer and personalised cancer surgery, Ismail G\u00f6genur has combined artificial intelligence and a multidisciplinary approach in developing a prediction model as a tool to support decision-making on individual patient treatment. This has resulted in many fewer patients with complications and shorter hospitalisations.\n\nBased on his discoveries, extraordinary initiatives and influential contributions to research, including more than 520 scientific papers, Ismail G\u00f6genur is now receiving the 2025 Marie and August Krogh Prize. The Prize is DKK 1.5 million and is awarded by the Organization of Danish Medical Societies and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\n\u201dIsmail is a driving force in Denmark\u2019s healthcare system. He is slightly more than halfway through his career but has long since demonstrated that he is an outstanding professional in not just Region Zealand but throughout Denmark and internationally. His clever use of data and artificial intelligence keeps the most important objective in mind: optimising treatment for individual patients. This is why we are here, and integrating his initiatives with research and education across traditional boundaries produces optimal results,\u201d says Susanne Axelsen, Senior Medical Officer and Chair of the Organization of Danish Medical Societies.\n\nIn acknowledging this recognition, Ismail G\u00f6genur says: \u201cThis means so much to me. Researchers are constantly self-reflecting and striving for optimal results for patients. The fact that our initiatives are being noticed and recognised by the Organization of Danish Medical Societies, which is accustomed to reviewing excellent research, is a huge pat on the back for the whole team.\u201d\n\nPatients are the primary driving force\n\n51-year-old Ismail G\u00f6genur graduated in Medical Sciences from the University of Copenhagen in 1999 and became a specialist in surgery in 2012. Today he is a Professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine of the University of Copenhagen and Senior Consultant at the Department of Surgery of Zealand University Hospital in K\u00f8ge. There he founded the Center for Surgical Science, a research unit with about 50 full-time employees, an independent research laboratory and a data science unit.\n\n\u201cDoes daring to think differently and innovatively in treating patients enable us to react more rapidly and more effectively to their needs?\u201d asks Ismail G\u00f6genur. He is driven by both scientific fascination but also being indignant that he cannot do more for patients. Rather than simply accepting that not everyone does well, he chooses to act.\n\nHe has had a drive for action since childhood. His parents moved from Turkey to Denmark in 1969; both worked at a factory for many years and taught him the value of hard work. \u201cI have definitely adopted a fighter\u2019s mentality \u2013 we should not stand idly by.\u201d\n\nThere is currently much visionary discussion on artificial intelligence, but this should become more than just talk. Ismail G\u00f6genur\u2019s research field is crying out for implementation, and he thinks that more hands-on experience is required.\n\nThe multidisciplinary nerve\n\nIsmail G\u00f6genur focuses on the entire patient journey to integrate the insights contributed by many disciplines. \u201cWe must harness the synergy between the competencies we each have as surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, anaesthesiologists and oncologists,\u201d he says and emphasises that \u201cbeing able to collaborate is essential to be successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is almost touching to experience how much energy is released when we grasp that multidisciplinary spark,\u201d he says. He also explains that special things happen when you put clinicians and data scientists together to solve a joint problem, and that \u201cskilled clinicians improve the mathematics of artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nNew study will revolutionise the approach to treatment\n\nAlthough Ismail G\u00f6genur is a specialist in surgery, he is also involved in non-surgical treatment. He has been the principal investigator on major studies in Denmark aimed at promoting non-surgical treatment for people with colorectal cancer. This year he is embarking on a new study on colorectal cancer, which has just been awarded a grant by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The goal is to use immunotherapy as the sole treatment.\n\n\u201cThis will be a groundbreaking study because we are planning to avoid surgery,\u201d says Ismail G\u00f6genur, who will use artificial intelligence to select the patients who will not undergo surgery. Immunotherapy has proven to be so effective for a subgroup of patients that just one dose eliminates the cancer among almost half of them in 3\u20135 weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is really fascinating, because this converts cancer into pneumonia,\u201d he says.\n\nThe future and the team in focus\n\nIn addition to research, Ismail G\u00f6genur, who is married and a \u201cproud father of four daughters\u201d, also focuses on supporting the next generations of practitioners by teaching at Zealand University Hospital.\n\n\u201cI am proud to have contributed to developing a strong team of skilled people with a new approach to treating patients that can continue this work,\u201d says Ismail G\u00f6genur.\n\nIsmail G\u00f6genur will officially receive the Prize at the annual general meeting of the Organization of Danish Medical Societies today.\n\nAbout the Marie and August Krogh Prize\n\nThe Marie and August Krogh Prize was established in 1969 and is awarded annually to an outstanding health researcher in Denmark. The Organization of Danish Medical Societies and the Novo Nordisk Foundation award the Prize, which is accompanied by DKK 1.5 million (\u20ac200,000), comprising a personal award of DKK 250,000 and a research grant of DKK 1.25 million. The Board of the Organization acts as the Prize committee, and the Foundation provides the accompanying funds. Affiliated members of the Organization of Danish Medical Societies may nominate candidates for the Prize.\n\nAbout the Organization of Danish Medical Societies\n\nThe Organization of Danish Medical Societies is an umbrella organisation for Denmark\u2019s 127 medical societies and represents nearly 26,000 members. The objective of the Organization is to promote medical science in Denmark and to manage the overall interests of its constituent societies in relation to Denmark\u2019s health authorities and national health policies. The Organization also promotes an understanding of Danish medical science and medical research in the public sector. The Organization was founded in 1919 as the Danish Medical Society.",

            "content": "DURHAM, N.C., Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMMvention Therapeutix, Inc ., an early-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing human therapeutics, today announced a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S to co-develop oral therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) and other chronic conditions.\n\nThe partnership will leverage IMMvention\u2019s investigational small-molecule BACH1 inhibitors. BACH1 is thought to be a key regulator of cellular responses, oxidative stress, and inflammation in multiple disease states, making it a promising therapeutic target. Currently in preclinical development, IMMvention\u2019s orally dosed BACH1 inhibitors have the potential to increase fetal hemoglobin, which is believed to ameliorate SCD disease pathology.\n\nUnder the agreement, Novo Nordisk will gain an exclusive worldwide license to IMMvention\u2019s BACH1 program. The companies will work together closely to advance BACH1 inhibitors from the program to development candidate nomination. Upon or prior to nomination of a development candidate, Novo Nordisk will take over all further development, regulatory submissions, and commercialization worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Novo Nordisk. This collaboration represents a significant milestone for IMMvention and reinforces our vision to address unmet needs in sickle cell disease and beyond,\u201d said Anil Goyal, Ph.D., CEO and Co-founder of IMMvention. \u201cDespite the current treatments and recent gene therapies, we believe that there remains a pressing need for globally accessible, effective, and convenient oral therapies for people with SCD. With Novo Nordisk\u2019s expertise and commitment, we are poised to advance our novel BACH1 inhibitors and hope to bring meaningful treatment options to patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cBACH1 is believed to be a biologically relevant target in sickle cell disease, a potentially life-threatening condition,\u201d said Jaya Goyal, Corporate Vice President, Rare Disease Research, at Novo Nordisk. \u201cIMMvention has identified investigational BACH1 inhibitors and generated relevant preclinical data. We are excited to partner with IMMvention to advance this program and explore a promising therapeutic option for people living with sickle cell disease.\u201d\n\nSeparate from the systemic BACH1 inhibitors that are part of the collaboration, IMMvention has retained rights to develop certain brain penetrant BACH1 inhibitors. Brain penetrant BACH1 inhibitors have the potential to address diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and other diseases where dysregulation of BACH1 is thought to contribute to disease pathology.\n\nAbout sickle cell disease\n\nSickle cell disease is a debilitating, life-threatening group of rare, inherited red blood cell disorders caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene.1 This mutation causes red blood cells to become stiff and half-moon or 'sickle' shaped.1 Sickle cells are less effective at carrying oxygen, do not last as long as healthy cells, and risk getting stuck in blood vessels, leading to blockages known as vaso-occlusion.2,3-6 Sickle cell disease is characterized by acute and chronic pain, anemia, and fatigue alongside VOCs, which can require hospitalization and can lead to complications, including organ damage.1,5,6 Globally, there are almost 8 million people living with sickle cell disease.7\n\nAbout IMMvention Therapeutix, Inc.\n\nIMMvention is a venture funded company focused on discovering and developing human therapeutics based in Durham, NC. The company is funded by Osage University Partners , Hatteras Venture Partners , Delin Ventures and Alexandria Venture Investments , along with a small business research loan received from North Carolina Biotechnology Center . The company\u2019s mission is to develop oral globally accessible therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in hemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia), cardiometabolic, renal, and neuroinflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of multiple pathways. The company has discovered a series of small molecule BACH1 inhibitors/Nrf2 activators. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway achieves induction of fetal-hemoglobin, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory pathways to ameliorate the underlying pathophysiology of many diseases.

            "content": "The Novo Nordisk Foundation has awarded a grant of DKK 500 million to establish a national PhD academy focusing on talent development and researcher education across disciplines. The Academy will be located at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), and its activities are targeted at PhD students from across the university sector in Denmark.\n\nThe Faculty of Science at SDU has developed the Danish Advanced Research Academy (DARA) with the aim of strengthening researcher education by offering PhD students an excellent educational environment that combines groundbreaking research with international networks and broad academic coverage.\n\nThe Academy will educate young researchers across multiple disciplines, enabling them to develop the necessary skills to address future societal challenges. SDU will manage the grant for the Academy with the aim of ensuring that DARA becomes a national platform promoting research collaboration and talent development across research institutions in Denmark.\n\nFor several years, the Novo Nordisk Foundation has supported academies within specific disciplines, with a high proportion of the activities directed towards PhD students, including awarding scholarships. Currently the Novo Nordisk Foundation supports the Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy, the Danish Cardiovascular Academy, and the Danish Data Science Academy. However, when the grants to theses academies expire, the academic activities directed towards the PhD students will be incorporated into DARA, which will offer both fully-funded and partially-funded PhD scholarships.\n\n\u201cThe Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy, the Danish Cardiovascular Academy, and the Danish Data Science Academy have made a significant contribution to educating the next generation of experts within their respective fields. DARA will draw on the experiences from the three academies and work purposefully to promote the interdisciplinary education of future researchers,\u201d says Martin Ridderstr\u00e5le, Senior Vice President for Medical Science at the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nS\u00f8ren Nedergaard, COO at the Novo Nordisk Foundation, explains the motivation for establishing the new academy.\n\nWhat motivated the Novo Nordisk Foundation to support the establishment of DARA?\n\nWe are experiencing an increasing interest in creating opportunities for young research talents working across traditional disciplines. DARA will enable talented PhD students to define their own projects that span disciplines or otherwise do not fit predefined themes. Scholarships for original and interdisciplinary ideas driven by the PhD students themselves have been lacking, and we want DARA to offer these.\n\nWhat are the advantages of bringing the PhD students together in one national academy?\n\nA unified academy makes it easier to work across multiple disciplines. This means that talents can do a PhD that, for example, spans natural sciences and health sciences or across disciplines within health sciences.\n\nThere is also a very practical administrative advantage. We can simply make better use of the resources in a unified academy in terms of administrative support and support for the PhD students. This is a significant part of the reason for consolidating the academies we have supported thus far within three separate disciplines, and for adding even more disciplines.\n\nHow will the interdisciplinary element in DARA be most strongly expressed?\n\nDARA should ideally be an academy that attracts new, groundbreaking ideas that we had not thought of previously. We have experienced a great demand for non-specific funding for the education of talented PhD students within areas in which students can define their own project. We want to DARA to provide this opportunity.\n\nWhat will happen to the three academies that Novo Nordisk Foundation has supported so far?\n\nPhD activities under the auspices of the three existing academies will gradually be incorporated into DARA. In this way, PhD education within the topics of the existing academies will continue. Additionally, DARA will provide better opportunities to work across disciplines and provide new perspectives on a specific PhD education.\n\nHow will the experiences created with the current academies be used in the work with DARA?\n\nIt is largely the same universities collaborating in DARA as in the existing academies. Therefore, there will be a focus on continuing the experiences and competencies that have already been built up in the existing academies.\n\nWhy was SDU chosen to host DARA?\n\nSDU was chosen because its campus in Odense houses all the university\u2019s faculties and has a long tradition of research collaboration across scientific boundaries. The University has also had great success with the administration of the Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy, which is also nationwide.\n\nWhat are the options for other foundations and organisations that wish to co-finance DARA?\n\nThey are welcome to contact us! DARA is designed to incorporate funding from sources other than the Novo Nordisk Foundation. We would like to bring more partners on board and hope that the DARA model can be extended to additional disciplines. At the Novo Nordisk Foundation, we focus on natural sciences, technical sciences, and health sciences. If more partners join DARA, this would create new and different opportunities.",

            "content": "In a few short years, excitement about groundbreaking anti-obesity drugs made Novo Nordisk Europe\u2019s most highly valued company and Eli Lilly the biggest pharma group in the world. Just as quickly, investors are losing their appetite for the trade.\n\nAfter a disappointing trial of a new Novo Nordisk drug last month and lower-than-expected sales figures from Eli Lilly for two consecutive quarters, shares in both have come down from all-time highs.\n\nSome investors are also unconvinced that the market will be worth the $100bn plus by the end of the decade that analysts predict. The result for now is that Novo Nordisk is no longer the most valuable company in Europe, and anti-obesity specialists have entered bear market territory.\n\nSachin Jain from Bank of America points to the growth potential of the market as one of the main unknowns that worries investors. There\u2019s a \u201cbig debate\u201d, he said. \u201cIs [the market] $80bn across Novo and Lilly, or are we just having the wrong debate and the pie is a lot bigger? There\u2019s a huge range, no one knows what it could be.\u201d\n\nThe first of a new generation of GLP-1 drugs was approved for weight loss in the US in 2021, but lack of manufacturing capacity means demand outstripped supply from the start. This has made the size of the market and its growth potential much harder to judge.\n\nEven so, a plethora of biotechs have sprung up around the world to try to compete with the two big players. They hope to be able to design treatments that are easier to manufacture, more convenient to administer \u2014 the current options must be injected \u2014 and have fewer side effects, the most common ones being sickness and diarrhoea.\n\nPrivate investors have recently backed biotechs with exceptionally large funding rounds: Verdiva Bio and Kailera Therapeutics have raised more than $400mn each, while Metsera, which has filed for an IPO, secured $215mn in November. Big pharma companies are also rushing to buy anti-obesity drug candidates.\n\nBut the vast majority of these drugs are still many years from the market and although sales of existing drugs continue to grow, investors have become unnerved by the high valuations of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nEven after its shares fell 7 per cent in one day earlier this month, Eli Lilly is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 55. Novo Nordisk trades at a p/e of 27, despite a more than 21 per cent drop in its shares in one day late last year.\n\nOne healthcare investor who owns shares in Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly said both have been spending on big advertising campaigns in the US but have not had a corresponding sales growth spurt, making him worry about the potential of the market.\n\nHe added that external factors will also push down prices. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic, which respectively target weight loss and diabetes, were added to the Medicare negotiation list this month, making it likely the company will have to cut prices significantly in the US from 2027.\n\nThe weight-loss trade aside, healthcare shares have not kept up with a US market that is otherwise optimistic about the US economy.\n\nLinden Thomson, senior fund manager at Candriam, notes that weight-loss drugs have become the driver of healthcare investing. \u201cThe obesity opportunity is one that people can really understand and has been the main trade in the sector for quite a while. It is the AI equivalent of healthcare.\u201d\n\nAshley Oerth, associate global market strategist at Invesco, said the broader industry had been underperforming since the odds of Trump winning the US election swung in his favour in October.\n\nRobots transport packages and goods at Novo Nordisk\u2019s manufacturing facility in Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark \u00a9 Charlotte de la Fuente/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cI think a really important component is the Trump trade. We\u2019ve seen this expressed as a tilt towards more cyclical than defensive [shares], and healthcare is in the defensive bucket,\u201d she said.\n\nGareth Powell from fund manager Polar Capital, which owns shares in Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, said the sector had also been affected by worries about the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US health secretary. \u201cI think good news is not cheered significantly, and bad news is met with this huge sensitivity, and you\u2019re getting massive overreactions,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late December, Novo Nordisk announced that its much anticipated next-generation obesity drug CagriSema had missed its target for patients to lose 25 per cent of their body weight in a late-stage trial. The news wiped \u20ac90bn off the company\u2019s market capitalisation.\n\nThe results showed that patients on CagriSema could lose 23 per cent of their body weight on average. Unusually, participants had chosen their own dose. If more had taken the highest dose, the drug could well have hit the 25 per cent bar, according to several analysts and investors.\n\nCrucially, CagriSema had been seen as Novo Nordisk\u2019s opportunity to beat Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, which was approved in November 2023 and quickly won market share. Results published in December from a head-to-head trial run by Eli Lilly confirmed that Zepbound offered greater weight loss than Wegovy.\n\nPowell said if Novo Nordisk had run a more conventional trial, he believes it would have \u201csmashed 25 per cent\u201d. \u201cI think CagriSema is stronger and much more potent than Mounjaro,\u201d he said.\n\nEli Lilly still expects robust sales growth of up to 35% in 2025 but has conceded that the market is hard to predict \u00a9 Paulo Nunes dos Santos/Bloomberg\n\nInvestors will have to wait until later in the year for more data from the trial. This might explain why many patients did not increase their dose, with speculation in the market that this was because they were happy with the weight loss they had achieved or wary of experiencing more side effects. Novo Nordisk has also said it is planning a more conventionally designed trial.\n\nBut shareholders are not in a patient mood. Emily Field, an analyst at Barclays, said Novo Nordisk has a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d in relation to the CagriSema trial. \u201cThey made a gamble on this trial design \u2014 and lost,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made some unfortunate errors . . . and the market is being much more critical.\n\n\u201cI think people just come to the conclusion that [its] . . . advantage Lilly, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk declined to comment.\n\nShares in Eli Lilly rose on the CagriSema result but quickly gave up those gains. When it then missed its sales guidance last week, its shares fell 7 per cent in one day.\n\nSales of Mounjaro, the anti-diabetes version of Zepbound, were $3.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2024, missing a forecast for $4.4bn, while the figure for Zepbound was $1.9bn, below the average analyst estimate of $2.2bn.\n\nAt the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco this month, Eli Lilly chief executive David Ricks offered some explanations for the sales miss, including wholesalers trying to cut inventory.\n\nEli Lilly still expects robust sales growth of 28 per cent to 35 per cent in 2025 but has conceded that the market is hard to predict.\n\nThe healthcare investor concluded: \u201cThe easy money to be made has been made and now we\u2019re in this choppy dynamic. And then it doesn\u2019t help that suddenly Lilly can\u2019t guide properly. Nobody wants to own it right now.\u201d",

            "content": "The advent of GLP-1 treatments has been a game changer in the medical sector for weight loss and chronic obesity. The GLP-1 market is currently dominated by semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy) produced by Novo Nordisk A/S NYSE: NVO and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound) produced by Eli Lilly and Co. NYSE: LLY. The once-a-week injections are still in short supply despite costing over $1,000 a month. Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro sales surged over 114% YoY in its Q3 2024.\n\nHowever, health insurers are becoming more reluctant about coverage, and people with anxiety over needle injections are still staying away. Among all the new therapies in studies, a novel approach to weight loss utilizing ultrasound is being developed by Novo Nordisk and GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: GEHC.\n\nGet GEHC alerts: Sign Up\n\nPeripheral Focused-Ultrasound for Diabetes and Weight Loss\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies Today GEHC GE HealthCare Technologies $81.97 +0.52 (+0.64%) 52-Week Range $74.51 \u25bc $94.80 Dividend Yield 0.17% P/E Ratio 18.93 Price Target $98.75 Add to Watchlist\n\nTraditional ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of internal organs and soft tissues. GE HealthCare Technologies and Novo Nordisk are collaborating to develop a new technology called peripheral-focused ultrasound (PFUS).\n\nThis technology uses highly focused high-frequency ultrasound to regulate the body\u2019s metabolic functions. It\u2019s a non-invasive bioelectronic medicine that has the potential to help manage chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity. PFUS stimulates nerve pathways to improve glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes. PFUS sends sound waves to activate parts of the nervous system to modulate certain nerve responses.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Expertise in Metabolic Disease Joins Forces with GE HealthCare\n\nInitial research indicates promising results. A study showed that PFUS technology was successful in managing type 2 diabetes in mice by using ultrasound pulses to stimulate nerve pathways in the liver to help regulate glucose levels. The GE HealthCare collaboration with Novo Nordisk will build on the findings and utilize Novo Nordisk's expertise in metabolic disease treatment to fine-tune PFUS technology for human use.\n\nNovo Nordisk's vice president and Head of Development, Martin Holst Lange, commented, \u201cWe look forward to exploring the potential impact this technology could have on treating people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as significant unmet needs remain in these diseases in spite of recent advances in care. Although early, the possibilities of using ultrasound for therapeutic purposes are compelling, and we welcome our collaboration with GE HealthCare in this truly novel area.\"\n\nGE HealthCare Ultrasound Division President Roland Rott added, \u201cThis collaboration with Novo Nordisk opens a path to evolve ultrasound from a means of screening and diagnosis into therapy, as well. We are eager to validate and further develop this potentially groundbreaking science as we strive to offer patients alternative treatment options for chronic diseases.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Combination Amylin Analog and GLP-1 Agonist Combo\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S Today NVO Novo Nordisk A/S $77.22 +1.33 (+1.76%) 52-Week Range $73.80 \u25bc $148.15 Dividend Yield 2.03% P/E Ratio 23.47 Price Target $145.25 Add to Watchlist\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk is experiencing drama sales growth, with Ozempic and Wegovy reaching 69% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth, the company continues to grow its pipeline to cement its oligopoly status in the GLP-1 industry. Novo\u2019s CagriSema is a once-a-week injection that combines cagrilinitide, a novel amylin analog, with semaglutide.\n\nAmylin analogs slow down the rate at which food empties from the stomach into the intestines, thereby suppressing the release of glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. It makes you feel fuller longer after meals, which also helps reduce overall caloric intake.\n\nCagriSema demonstrated a significantly greater body weight loss in obese participants with type 2 diabetes. CagriSema users had a mean bodyweight reduction 3X more than just using Wegovy, 15.6% versus 5.1%, respectively. Against cagrilinitide alone, subjects lost 8.1% mean body weight. CagriSema essentially causes users to feel fuller longer to suppress appetite with the amylin analog while increasing insulin release and decreasing glucagon secretion with the GLP-1.\n\nCagriSema Phase 3 Results Were Solid, But Market Sells the News\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2024, Novo Nordisk produced phase 3 clinical trial REDEFINE results with CagriSema. After 68 weeks, patients treated with CagriSema had a 22.7% weight loss compared to 11.8% with just cagrilinitide 2.4 mg and 16.1% with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatments.\n\nAdditionally, 40.5% of patients who received CagriSema lost 25% or more after 68 weeks, versus 6% with cagrilinitide, 16.2% with semaglutide, and 0.9% with placebo. Results of the REDEFINE 2 Phase 3 study in patients with type 2 diabetes are expected in the first half of 2025. Shares of NVO sold off 17% in reaction, likely due to the 22.7% weight loss instead of more patients reaching the 25% weight loss mark.\n\nNovo Nordisk Is Losing the Battle With Eli Lilly Due to Shortages\n\nCapacity restraints have been a concern as its 69% YoY revenue growth for obesity treatment pales in comparison to rival Eli Lilly\u2019s 114% YoY revenue growth rate. Novo has to bolster its capacity to compete effectively. Novo\u2019s stock is down 26.24% in the past 12 months and 8.52% in 2025 alone. Its revenue growth trajectory has declined from 43.78% YoY growth in Q4 2023 to 23.68% in Q1 2024, to 23.79% in Q2 and 22.53% in Q3 2024. Its PE ratio at 25.5 is below its 3-year median of 39.84, indicating it may be nearing the value play area for investors patiently waiting for a pullback.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy have had supply shortages since April 2022. According to Novo Nordisk, more than 25,000 new people start taking Wegovy every week, further exacerbating the supply shortage. Supply constraints are expected to persist through 2025. This is the main driver of compounded semaglutide sales soaring from providers like Hims & Hers Health Inc.

Finland stands as an exception, with its market struggling since 2023, leading the Morningstar Finland Index to finish the same ten-year period with a 72.9% gain. Note that all data in this is article is shown in base currencies and that the movement of exchange rates can either benefit or hurt UK investors who hold foreign stocks.\n\nDenmark, Sweden and Norway Have Outperformed the European Market\n\nIKEA, Lego and Spotify Are Driving Global Investment Opportunities\n\nWhile many investors have benefited from exposure to US technology stocks in recent years, Nordic stocks have provided valuable diversification, as the four largest Nordic countries are home to several world-leading corporate giants.\n\nFor instance, The Economist highlights the region\u2019s impressive ability to foster some of the world\u2019s largest companies. It points to Swedish IKEA, the largest furniture maker globally, and Danish Lego, the world\u2019s top toymaker by revenue. Although Spotify, the world\u2019s largest streaming music company, was introduced to Wall Street with a Swiss flag at its 2018 IPO, it was actually founded in Sweden and remains headquartered in Stockholm. Another Swedish company, Klarna, a major player in the buy-now-pay-later sector, filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2023, planning to go public in 2025. Klarna\u2019s IPO would mark the largest Swedish company to list in the US since Spotify\u2019s debut in 2018.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Top Nordic Stocks Offer Long-Term Value\n\nPerhaps one of the best known, publicly-traded Nordic companies today is Danish drug maker Novo Nordisk NOVO B, known for its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Before its sharp market fall at the end of 2024, the market capitalization of Novo Nordisk exceeded the gross domestic product of Denmark. It remains the biggest stock in Europe with a market cap of DKK2.5 trillion ($353 billion), ahead of names like Lvmh Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton MC, SAP SAP and ASML ASML.\n\nWhile Wall Street has attracted some of the biggest Nordic IPOs in recent years, several world-leading companies may still be overlooked by US-centric investors. Below are seven Nordic stocks currently trading near or below their estimated fair value, all of which have earned a wide Morningstar Economic Moat Rating, indicating they are likely to maintain their competitive edge for at least the next 20 years. However, the best companies are not always the best stocks to buy. The price you pay to own a company is equally important. Stocks with a star rating of 4 or 5 represent a good buying opportunity, while investors may want to wait for a price pullback in stocks like Kongsberg Gruppen, Novo Nordisk, and Novozymes before making a purchase.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the wide-moat Nordic stocks. All data is as of Jan. 22, 2025.\n\nElekta\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: SEK 127.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n\n\u00b7 Discount to Fair Value: 49%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 3.7%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSweden-based Elekta develops, manufactures, and distributes treatment planning systems for neurosurgery and radiotherapy, including stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy. The company has an installed base of more than 7,000 linear accelerators, Gamma Knife and Unity platforms, as well as brachytherapy installations. The company\u2019s sales are evenly distributed across geographies, with North and South America accounting for 31%; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa accounting for 35%; and the Asia-Pacific contributing the remainder.\n\n\u201cThe market for radiotherapy equipment is characterized by very high barriers to entry owing to significant intellectual property and technological know-how and high switching costs that arise from significant training costs and disruption risk. What started a few decades ago as a rather fragmented field has now evolved into essentially a duopoly; with virtually no new entrants for more than a decade, the main two players (Varian was acquired by Healthineers) have built durable franchises and wide economic moats around their businesses.\n\nHealthineers is the largest RT manufacturer, with more than 50% market share globally and an even more dominant position in the U.S., controlling more than 70% of all installations. Elekta is the second-largest player, with roughly one third of the world\u2019s RT installations.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Alex Morozov, CFA\n\nKone\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: EUR 50.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Low\n\n\u00b7 Discount to Fair Value: 5%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 3.68%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nKone is a global top-four supplier of elevators and escalators. Kone began producing elevators in Finland in 1918 and today generates revenue in three ways: selling new elevators and escalators, modernizing old equipment, and servicing its installed base. Most of the company\u2019s profit comes from the last activity, where contracts are rolled over annually with built-in price increases. The bulk of Kone\u2019s business is in elevators, which are more numerous globally than escalators. Its business model is similar to its closest competitors Otis, Schindler, and TK Elevator.\n\n\u201cKone\u2019s high returns on invested capital result from the confluence of its durable competitive advantages \u2014 which include reputational intangible assets, customer switching costs, and its cost advantage in the provision of elevator servicing \u2014 and its capital-light business model.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Grant Slade, CFA\n\nColoplast\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: DKK 962.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n\n\u00b7 Discount to Fair Value: 15%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 2.69%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nColoplast is a leading global competitor in ostomy management and continence care. The firm designs, manufactures, and markets ostomy care systems, disposable containment devices, paste, powder, seals, and intermittent catheters for continence care. Coloplast also maintains a tertiary presence in the urology and woundcare markets, where it manufactures and markets penile implants, slings for incontinence and prolapse, and wound dressings. The company derives more than 60% of sales from Europe, 24% from other developed countries, and 17% from the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cHaving studied Coloplast for over a decade now, we think it can maintain its competitive advantages and generate economic profits over the 20-year period that characterizes a wide economic moat.Coloplast\u2019s moat primarily stems from its ostomy, continence care, and urology businesses, where it has been able to leverage intangible assets and, at times, switching costs. The firm has a long record of meaningful innovation in the first two areas. We like the moatiness of the ostomy and urology businesses. The 2 billion USD global ostomy market benefits from intangible assets and switching costs and is the kind of stable oligopoly we like to see.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Debbie S.

The company operates in four segments: aeronautics, dynamics, surveillance, and Kockums. Aeronautics involves the manufacturing and support of defense and commercial aerial systems. Dynamics produces combat weapons and defense training and management systems. Surveillance supplies security services, and creates traffic management technology and aviation parts. Kockums offers solutions for naval missions. Over three fourths of Saab\u2019s sales are from the defense sector. The company sells to multiple geographic regions, but over half of its sales come from Europe.\n\n\u201cAs Sweden\u2019s largest defense contractor, Saab is poised to benefit from the nation\u2019s commitment to spend approximately 300 billion SEK on defense between 2023 and 2025, with 60% of the budget in areas strongly aligned with Saab\u2019s portfolio. Additionally, Sweden recently joined NATO, which opens new avenues for Saab to enhance its role in the defense of the Nordic and Baltic Sea regions.\n\nIncreasing tensions globally, particularly between the West and China and Russia, are leading to greater defense spending in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Prompted by the Russia-Ukraine war, almost all European countries will increase their defense budgets to at least 2% of gross domestic product in the coming years. This presents long-term opportunities for Saab to leverage its geographical footprint and product range.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Loredana Muharremi, CFA\n\nKongsberg Gruppen\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: NOK 1230.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n\n\u00b7 Premium to Fair Value: 5%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 0.54%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nKongsberg Gruppen is an international technology company that supplies products and services to the defense, maritime, oil, gas, and aerospace industries. The company is divided into two business segments: the maritime segment and defense and aerospace systems. Maritime, which earns most of the firm\u2019s revenue, creates navigation, automation, monitoring, and positioning products for commercial ships and offshore industries. The defense and aerospace segment provides defense and space-related products and systems. Outside of the two main segments, the firm operates Kongsberg Digital, which produces digital solutions for oil, gas, wind, and merchant marine markets. Products are delivered globally, with North America accounting for about one third of total revenue.\n\n\u201cStable defense revenue offsets in part civil business revenue cyclicality. Moreover, Kongsberg has created a comprehensive portfolio of products and services, deliberately avoiding an overreliance on any single program. The company serves 39 countries, with 20% of the revenue generated in Norway, 28% in the rest of Europe, 26% in North America, and the remaining from the rest of the world.\n\nGiven the sector characteristics, we believe that the defense & aerospace division warrants a wide moat, while we view maritime, digital, and discovery as narrow-moat segments.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Loredana Muharremi, CFA\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: DKK 600.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: High\n\n\u00b7 Discount to Fair Value: 4%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 1.73%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nWith roughly one third of the global branded diabetes treatment market, Novo Nordisk is the leading provider of diabetes-care products in the world. Based in Denmark, the company manufactures and markets a variety of human and modern insulins, injectable diabetes treatments such as GLP-1 therapy, oral antidiabetic agents, and obesity treatments. Novo also has a biopharmaceutical segment, constituting roughly 10% of revenue, that specializes in protein therapies for hemophilia and other disorders.\n\n\u201cNovo Nordisk\u2019s strong intangible assets in diabetes and related cardiometabolic diseases like obesity give the firm a wide economic moat that will shield profitability for the long run. A focused research and development strategy allows the firm to repeatedly extend patent protection through innovation. Efficient manufacturing techniques and economies of scale have allowed Novo\u2019s insulin business to provide strong global profitability, qualities that it shares with the only two other global insulin players, Sanofi and Eli Lilly.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Karen Andersen, CFA\n\nNovonesis\n\n\u00b7 Fair Value Estimate: DKK 390.00\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n\n\u00b7 Premium to Fair Value: 5%\n\n\u00b7 Forward Dividend Yield: 2.0%\n\n\u00b7 Morningstar Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNovonesis was formed in 2024 through the merger of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen. Following the merger, the company became the world leader in industrial enzymes and microbial solutions, with a nearly 50% market share in both. The firm supplies a wide range of industry groups: household care, food and beverages, bioenergy, agriculture and feed, technical and pharmaceuticals. Its biological solutions create value for its customers by improving yield efficiency and performance, while saving energy and generating less waste. The company is headquartered in Denmark, employs around 10,000 people, and works across more than 30 research and development and application centers and 23 manufacturing sites.\n\n\u201cNovonesis has a dominant position across both the enzymes and cultures markets, with a market share of around 50% in each. Competition is relatively benign across both industries due to their largely duopolistic nature. IFF is the second largest player in these markets, with a market share of around 20% in each, followed by wide-moat DSM-Firmenich with a market share of around 5%-6%, largely confined to the food and beverage segments.\u201d\n\nAnalyst: Diana Radu, CFA\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

For now, at least, humans in the loop is required. I wonder why that always is a requirement because we don\u2019t have explainability of the human brain and we assume we always do things better, which is not the case.\u201d Thomas Senderovitz, senior vice president of data science, Novo Nordisk\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nThe introduction of any new technology can be disruptive. Think about the printing revolution and how scribes all but became obsolete soon after. Or typists before the personal laptop gained foothold. Or these eight jobs that have disappeared over the past 50 years. Humans were central to the loop in each of these until they weren\u2019t.\n\nOne life science executive posed a provocative question about that human centrality at an event organized by consulting firm BCG during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco last week.\n\nArtificial intelligence is coming for many more jobs big and small, but its threat/potential is all the more scary/exciting because it aims to replace not simply a physical skill that humans possess but rather the one capacity that has propelled us to the top of the food chain: our ability to think and make decisions.\n\nIn the field of medicine, the advent of AI therefore comes with soothing words from its developers \u2014 \u201cit augments not replaces,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s always a physician in the loop,\u201d \u201cthis will boost your efficiency,\u201d and permutations and combinations of the above sentiment.\n\nBut machine learning is advancing at a head-spinning pace, and the new word floating around at JPM sessions was \u201cagentic AI.\u201d Think chatbots but on steroids, having more agency and being able to act alone, without human intervention \u2014 a kind of AI that has the ability to mimic and thereby replace human judgment.\n\nAt the BCG event that sought to explore how digital health and AI are changing the healthcare industry, a Novo Nordisk executive \u2014Thomas Senderovitz, senior vice president of data science \u2014 talked about agentic AI in the context of the Danish company\u2019s efforts in building and automating a clinical trials infrastructure. Called FounDATA, it is a repository where all data from completed clinical trials are pooled and prepared for insights-generation by applying a variety of AI algorithms.\n\n\u201cWe have now 20 billion data points and we\u2019re going to get around 1500 RCT or randomized control trial data onto the platform,\u201d Senderovitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re adding images, multi omics [data], we\u2019re going to add real world data all the way up to the the claims and outcomes data and then upstream to research data. So we have .. one place for real time analytics, all agentic AI set up and and that we have done ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe system is set up on Microsoft\u2019s Azure Cloud and Novo is partnering \u2014 whether it be with academic institutions or other companies \u2014 to bring analytical applications to gain insights from that pool of data. The system is designed to be interoperable and Senderovitz explained the goal is to make the entire value chain \u201cautomated, AI-powered.\u201d And then he said something very interesting and thought provoking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little need and this sounds cynical and I\u2019m not really a very cynical person, but there really isn\u2019t a need for a lot of manual interface when you can have it done by AI, except in the loop. For now, at least, humans in the loop is required. I wonder why that always is a requirement because we don\u2019t have explainability of the human brain and we assume we always do things better, which is not the not the case.\u201d [bolded for emphasis]\n\nSo, where is the automation happening in Novo\u2019s clinical trial infrastructure repository?\n\n\u201cSo, I think we are going to see [automation] all the way from the scientific design of the protocol, the center of the protocol; the electronic data capture will disappear, [we] will pull data directly out for electronic health records. It will go directly into a flow,\u201d Senderovitz said. \u201cThe statistical analysis plan will be automated, the analytical code will be generated, the results will go automatically and they already do into starter reports.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Novo doesn\u2019t write starter reports manually anymore.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltimately that could also be, \u2018don\u2019t submit reports, submit your data and all your code\u2019 and then they can replicate,\u201d he speculated about the future. \u201cSo that process we are building and it will come sooner than we believe, including scientific manuscript writing.\u201d\n\nHe added that Novo has done GenAI manuscript writing, which he couldn\u2019t distinguish from humans though Novo hasn\u2019t submitted them yet.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the New England Journal of Medicine\u2019s AI Journal that would accept, as far as I know, Gen AI [articles], but it will come,\u201d Senderovitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just our resistance.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that to be able to do all this AI automation and insights-generation properly, Novo Nordisk has created a data ethics council internally, so that these issues aren\u2019t just \u201can ad-hoc discussion.\u201d Novo also has an data governance layer to oversee information transfer.\n\n\u201cSo every single AI which is deployed in the regulated area and/or versus patients in the real life, will have to go through that governance before [in order] to go out,\u201d he said before noting that there are a whole host of issues that are technical, ethical and related to legal compliance that need to be addressed in such a system.\n\nThe task is even greater \u2014 from a trust perspective \u2014 as there happen to be fewer and fewer humans in the loop in the future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new area by which I would call explainability science or decision science, because not all models will be able to explain. But we have to be able to completely track how we make decisions and how decisions are made. And the less we have humans in the loop, the more decisions aren\u2019t made by humans, the more we need to at least track and be able to have that transparency.\u201d\n\nBut Senderovitz also acknowledged a challenge given how AI technology is rapidly changing.\n\n\u201cYou know, a year ago, we didn\u2019t think about agentic AI or infrastructure. In half a year, agentic AI will already be a little bit outdated. It\u2019ll be something else, right? When you\u2019re in the regulated space that I sit in, at a certain point of time, we have to lock something and say, this is now what we do and validate that [in such a way that] regulators and and authorities can accept. But the technology keeps evolving. So how do we balance \u2014 and I don\u2019t have the answer yet \u2014 how do we balance that? On one hand, the technology evolves so fast. On the other hand, we need to make sure that it\u2019s trustworthy and that we feel safe enough to deploy.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Few drugs have generated as much excitement as Novo Nordisk's (NVO 1.66%) Ozempic and Wegovy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Ozempic in December 2017 for treating type 2 diabetes. The drug's ability to help people lose weight caused demand to skyrocket. In June 2021, Novo Nordisk won FDA approval for Ozempic's sibling, Wegovy, both of which share the same active ingredient (semaglutide), as a treatment for chronic weight management.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Ozempic and Wegovy are now two of the biggest blockbuster drugs on the market. The two drugs are Novo Nordisk's top growth drivers, and together comprise over 60% of its total revenue.\n\nHowever, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could soon throw a monkey wrench into Novo Nordisk's momentum. The agency announced last week that Ozempic and Wegovy, along with Novo's other semaglutide GLP-1 diabetes drug Rybelsus, are at the top of its list for 2027 Medicare drug price negotiations. Will Medicare end Novo Nordisk's obesity drug boom?\n\nBehind Medicare's latest move\n\nIt's not surprising that CMS chose Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus for Medicare drug price negotiations. Between November 2023 and October 2024, the Medicare Part D prescription drug program paid a whopping $14.4 billion on the three drugs.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 empowered Medicare to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to try to secure lower prices for specific high-cost drugs that don't have generic or biosimilar competition. CMS included 10 drugs on its 2026 list and added another 15 (Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus are counted as one drug) for 2027.\n\n2026 is the first year Medicare could select Novo Nordisk's semaglutide products for price negotiation. One of the criteria laid out in the IRA legislation was that drugs must have been approved by the FDA at least seven years earlier (or 11 years for biologics).\n\nCMS will conduct negotiations with drugmakers later this year. The agency will send its final offer on drug prices by Oct. 15, 2025. Drugmakers must accept or reject the final offer by Oct. 31, 2025. CMS will publish the agreed-upon drug prices by Nov. 30, 2025, with the new prices taking effect on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nHow the change could impact Novo Nordisk\n\nThe amount Medicare spent on Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus between November 2023 and October 2024 represents roughly 36% of Wall Street's consensus estimate for Novo Nordisk's total revenue in 2024. A significant price cut as a result of Medicare negotiations could hurt the company's growth prospects.\n\nInvestors reacted negatively to the Medicare news on Friday. Novo Nordisk's stock tumbled more than 5%. This sell-off wiped around $19.5 billion off the big drugmaker's market cap.\n\nJust how much Medicare price negotiations will negatively impact Novo Nordisk, though, depends on what the final negotiated prices for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus will be. In Medicare's negotiations for 2026, the new prices achieved an average of 22% savings.\n\nHow might Medicare price negotiations impact Novo Nordisk's battle in the marketplace with Eli Lilly? Lilly's type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity drug Zepbound aren't eligible for Medicare price negotiations yet. However, if Lilly doesn't lower its prices to be competitive with Novo Nordisk's negotiated prices, Novo could capture greater market share and partially offset the lower revenue from Medicare.\n\nWhy Novo Nordisk investors shouldn't worry\n\nMedicare drug price negotiations hold the potential to disrupt Novo Nordisk's momentum to some extent. I don't think investors should worry too much, though.\n\nNovo Nordisk's opportunity for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybselsus remains huge. The sales of these drugs will almost certainly grow, even if Medicare exacts steep price cuts. Novo also could have other diabetes and obesity drugs on the way, notably including late-stage candidate CagriSema.\n\nAlso, President Trump has promised to repeal the IRA -- primarily because he disagrees with its clean energy and climate components. If he succeeds in fulfilling this pledge, Medicare price negotiations could go away altogether.",

Its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs have been driving over 60% of Novo's sales. But here's the kicker: GLP-1 drugs aren't just about weight loss and diabetes anymore. A Nature Medicine study released Monday revealed that these treatments reduce Alzheimer's risk by 12%, adding to an already staggering list of benefits, including cardiovascular, kidney, and even sleep apnea treatments. Analysts suggest this new data could push governments and insurers to expand coverage for GLP-1 drugs, unlocking a much larger market.\n\nCompetition is tightening, with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) racing alongside Novo in the GLP-1 space. Novo's pipeline powerhouse, CagriSema, recently fell short of its weight-loss goals, but its established drugs continue to dominate. Analysts argue that as Novo and Lilly expand the use cases for GLP-1s, their competitive moats will grow even deeper. Meanwhile, Novo's aggressive DKK 19.4 billion share repurchase program signals confidence in weathering potential Medicare cuts. With a reputation for innovative breakthroughs and a fortified market position, Novo isn't backing down from the challenges ahead.\n\nThe future of GLP-1 drugs is looking bigger than anyone predicted. As governments consider broader adoption and competitors scramble to keep up, Novo Nordisk is well-positioned to lead this pharmaceutical revolution. Medicare price negotiations may tighten margins in the short term, but for long-term investors, the GLP-1 story is just getting started.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) CagriSema and Amgen\u2019s (AMGN) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it\u2019s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market.\n\nThese medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm \u2014 especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Zepbound.\n\nThe weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world\u2019s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population \u2014 31.5 million people \u2014 are expected to be using them by 2035.\n\nWith that much money at stake, it\u2019s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaster weight loss with fewer injections and side effects\n\nSeveral pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections \u2014 an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound.\n\nNovo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication.\n\nEli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks.\n\n\u201cRetatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),\u201d president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a \u201cconvenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.\u201d\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nZealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea \u2014 one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can\u2019t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight.\n\nAn effective weight-loss pill\n\nPharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It\u2019s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results.\n\nEli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill \u2014 orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial \u2014 its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks.\n\nPfizer (PFE): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects.\n\nViking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking\u2019s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk\u2019s amycretin.",

In the US alone, the number of patients starting GLP-1 treatments for nondiabetic purposes has increased by 700% since 2019, highlighting the popularity of these drugs beyond their original aim of treating Type 2 diabetes.\n\nYet the soaring enthusiasm for so-called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, first approved in 2005, overshadows an array of risks related to their off-label use. These include important environmental, social, and governance risks that investors must evaluate carefully since the environment is rapidly evolving. We talk about them below, but examples include:\n\nOff-label marketing risk\n\nSafety\n\nAffordability\n\nWe\u2019ll also show how to screen through the GLP-1 drug companies. When combining insights from Morningstar Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings and Morningstar Equity Research (depicted in Exhibit 1), we find that Pfizer PFE and Roche RHHBY stand out as potential top choices for investors among current and potential future market entrants.\n\nGLP-1 Drugs: Demand Surges in a Long-Established Market\n\nThe market for GLP-1 drugs is projected to exceed $200 billion in annual sales by 2031, according to Morningstar Equity Research. Current market leaders include Novo Nordisk NVO and Eli Lilly LLY with treatments such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound addressing both diabetes and obesity.\n\nStill, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are unlikely to have the obesity space to themselves for long. According to Morningstar Equity Research, several other players, including Pfizer, Roche, Amgen AMGN, AstraZeneca AZN, Zealand Pharma ZLDPF, Structure Therapeutics GPCR, and Altimmune ALT, are expected to join the GLP-1 space, with multiple drug launches expected between 2027 and 2032.\n\nAmong the key players set to enter the GLP-1 space, Pfizer has two products in phase 1 trials, whereas Roche has four products in the pipeline, with two products in phase 2 trials. Both companies could launch their first GLP-1 products as early as 2028, potentially making them strong competitors to current market leaders, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold: Issues and Risks Around GLP-1 Medications\n\nThe effectiveness of GLP-1 medications in promoting weight loss has led to a surge in off-label demand, particularly for cosmetic weight-loss purposes. This off-label use introduces several ESG-related issues, both for patients and the companies marketing these drugs. An ESG approach allows more in-depth research into risks that aren\u2019t captured by traditional financial analysis.\n\nOff-Label Marketing Risk\n\nManufacturers of GLP-1 medications may face regulatory scrutiny and legal risks if they promote their products for off-label use or disseminate inaccurate and misleading information. That raises substantial concerns for these companies and their investors. Such practices could trigger investigations into their promotional activities or legal action from consumers, sparking lengthy legal proceedings and operational disruptions. All these could pose significant financial burdens on the companies involved.\n\nSafety Concerns and Liability Issues for GLP-1 Drugs\n\nGLP-1 medications, like all other pharmaceuticals, carry safety challenges, including the risk of adverse side effects. Chronic use of any medication can increase the likelihood of adverse side effects due to prolonged exposure. While patients living with chronic life-threatening conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, may accept these risks, people using GLP-1 drugs for less life-threatening and severe purposes may be less forgiving if the side effects outweigh the perceived benefits.\n\nConsequently, people using GLP-1 medications for weight loss may litigate more readily over unanticipated or adverse side effects. This exposes manufacturers to potentially heightened liability risks, particularly in the US, where a litigious culture increases the risk and financial impact of legal challenges.\n\nAccess, Affordability, and Pricing Risks for GLP-1 Medications\n\nPerceived excessive and unjustified price increases, as well as regional cost disparities, have sparked public debate and criticism over companies\u2019 pricing strategies for their GLP-1 medications. That creates significant regulatory risks for companies. For instance, at the start of 2024, the US list prices of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) and Mounjaro (Eli Lilly) increased by 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, bringing their monthly cost to $979 and $1,069.\n\nThese price hikes are part of a broader conversation surrounding the cost disparities between the US and other regions. A congressional hearing in September 2024 raised concerns over the stark price differences between the US and the European Union for similar medications. For example, Ozempic is priced at approximately $1,000 per month in the US, versus around \u20ac89 in Germany.\n\nPricing is intensifying public debate and scrutiny surrounding these medications. That\u2019s likely to grow. Morningstar Equity Research predicts that Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy will be subject to Medicare price negotiations (as part of the Inflation Reduction Act) starting in 2027.\n\nHow to Screen GLP-1 Drug Manufacturers\n\nWhich current and future GLP-1 manufacturers may be best positioned to navigate these risks? One helpful tool is Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Rating, which offers valuable insights into companies\u2019 exposure to material ESG issues and evaluates their strategies to address such risks. By combining this information with Morningstar Equity Research\u2019s fair value estimate, which compares a company\u2019s current market price to its estimated intrinsic value, investors can identify opportunities that align with both financial and ESG objectives.\n\nAs for companies entering the GLP-1 space, investors should look at the material ESG issues of Product Governance, which assesses how companies ensure the safety and quality of their products as well as market their products according to their label, and Access to Basic Services, which focuses on how companies make their products accessible and affordable.\n\nNotes: Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics Inc., and Zealand Pharma A/S are assigned Morningstar Quantitative Moat Ratings, with all companies rated \u2605\u2605\u2605. For the ESG Risk Rating, Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, and Zealand Pharma A/S hold Morningstar Sustainalytics Core Ratings, with scores of 37.1, 26.5, and 26.7, respectively. Structure Therapeutics Inc. is not currently rated by Sustainalytics. Source: Morningstar Direct & Morningstar Sustainalytics, Ordered by star rating\n\nCombining insights from the ESG Risk Rating and Morningstar Equity Research, we find that Pfizer and Roche stand out as potential top choices among the companies either currently in the GLP-1 space or those poised to enter.\n\nBoth are rated 5 stars by Morningstar Equity Research and show strong management of key ESG issues, namely Product Governance and Access to Basic Services. These strengths position them well to navigate the complexities of the GLP-1 space while addressing associated ESG risks.\n\nMeanwhile, current market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly appear to present higher levels of unmanaged ESG risks. Novo Nordisk displays average management of Product Governance risks, and both companies showcase average management of Access to Basic Services. Further, both firms are trading at less attractive 3-star and 2-star valuation levels compared with Pfizer and Roche, given potential headwinds such as insurance difficulties, pricing pressures, and new competition.\n\nNevertheless, Pfizer\u2019s and Roche\u2019s success within the GLP-1 space will depend on many factors, including the outcomes of clinical trials, advancements in drug pipelines, demonstrated efficacy and safety of their candidates, and effective strategies for commercialization and market access.\n\nGLP-1 Drugmakers: Looking Into the Future\n\nAs the GLP-1 market matures, ESG risks could decline. Here\u2019s why. Beginning in 2027, GLP-1 prices could fall 10%-15% a year on average, mirroring trends observed in other drugs, according to Morningstar Equity Research These price declines reflect heightened competition and regulatory pressures. In turn, these stresses might address concerns about access and affordability. Similarly, enhanced safety profiles, such as potentially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, for the next generation of GLP-1 drugs could lessen patient liability risks.\n\nSuch developments will require investors to further navigate the current and future landscapes of ESG risks for GLP-1 medications.\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

It compared semaglutide 7.2mg with semaglutide 2.4mg and placebo, alongside lifestyle interventions.\n\nParticipants receiving semaglutide 7.2mg achieved a mean weight loss of 20.7% from a baseline of 113kg, under the treatment adherence scenario. This was significantly higher than the 17.5% reduction with semaglutide 2.4mg and the 2.4% reduction with placebo.\n\nThe trial also demonstrated that 33.2% of participants on semaglutide 7.2mg achieved a weight reduction of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% on semaglutide 2.4mg and none in the placebo group.\n\nWhen analysed under the treatment policy estimand approach, semaglutide 7.2mg led to an 18.7% weight loss, outperforming semaglutide 2.4mg (15.6%) and placebo (3.9%).\n\nThe STEP UP trial confirmed that semaglutide 7.2mg was well-tolerated, with gastrointestinal events being the most reported adverse effects. These were mostly mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.\n\nNovo Nordisk development executive vice president Martin Holst Lange said: \u201cWe are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4mg.\n\n\u201cResults from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy, including cardiovascular risk reduction as seen in SELECT\u201d.\n\nNovo Nordisk said that it is continuing its research with the STEP UP T2D trial, which is evaluating semaglutide 7.2mg in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Results from this study are expected in the coming months.\n\nSemaglutide 2.4mg, marketed as Wegovy, is already approved in the European Union (EU) and the US for managing obesity and weight-related comorbidities in adults and paediatric patients.\n\nIn the EU, Wegovy is indicated for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30kg/m\u00b2 or greater, or 27kg/m\u00b2 or greater with comorbid conditions. In the US, it is also approved for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn the UK, UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved a new indication for semaglutide, authorising its use to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk A/S is a global healthcare company specializing in the research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical products to treat diabetes, obesity, and other chronic diseases. The company was founded in 1923 in Denmark and is headquartered in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk has operations in more than 80 countries, including production facilities in nine countries, and employs approximately 48,500 people worldwide.\n\nNovo Nordisk's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines to help people with chronic diseases lead longer, healthier lives. The company's key therapeutic areas include diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, growth hormone therapy, and other severe chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk is the world's largest producer of insulin and has been at the forefront of diabetes care for more than 95 years.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen is the President and CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S, a position he has held since 2017. J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets. The global diabetes market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in emerging markets, and the growing demand for innovative diabetes treatments. In the obesity market, the global prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing, and it is expected to continue to rise, driving demand for effective obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces intense competition from several large and small pharmaceutical companies in the diabetes and obesity markets. The company's main competitors in the diabetes market include Sanofi, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca, while its main competitors in the obesity market include Roche, Novartis, and Eisai.\n\n\n\nThe company's competitive position is based on factors such as the quality and effectiveness of its products, its research and development capabilities, its brand reputation, and ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also subject to various regulatory and political issues that can impact its operations and financial performance. The company must comply with strict regulatory requirements in each country it operates, including the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Changes in regulatory requirements, such as changes to reimbursement policies, can significantly impact the company's financial performance.\n\nNovo Nordisk has several growth opportunities to pursue in the coming years. The company is investing heavily in research and development to develop new and innovative treatments for diabetes and obesity, as well as other chronic diseases. Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline of potential products in development, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have shown promise in clinical trials for treating obesity.\n\nThe company also expands in emerging markets, such as China and India, with significant and growing demand for diabetes and obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk has established partnerships with local companies in these markets to help drive growth and increase product access.\n\nNovo Nordisk has pursued acquisitions and partnerships to expand its product offerings and capabilities. In 2021, the company acquired Prothena's ATTR amyloidosis program, a potential treatment for a rare and debilitating disease. This acquisition will strengthen Novo Nordisk's position in the rare disease market.\n\nNovo Nordisk faces several risks and challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance. The company's success is heavily dependent on the success of its products in the diabetes and obesity markets, and any setbacks in clinical trials or product launches could significantly impact its financial performance.\n\nIn addition, Novo Nordisk faces regulatory and political risks, as changes in regulations or policies could impact its ability to operate or sell its products in specific markets. The company is also subject to intellectual property risks, as competitors may seek to challenge its patents and market their products.\n\nNovo Nordisk also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions and production delays, as well as cybersecurity and data privacy risks.",

Concerns that the US government will push down prices for its weight loss drugs, including Wegovy and Ozempic, through Medicare's new pricing negotiations. Meanwhile, LVMH has been riding high, up nearly 9% over a month. The broader luxury sector got a boost from Richemont's stellar sales growth, reigniting investor confidence that the luxury goods market is bouncing back from its post-Covid slump.\n\nOn top of that, Bernard Arnault's wealth is soaring like never before. The LVMH CEO has added $15 billion to his net worth, making him the biggest wealth gainer so far this year. His fortune now sits at $190 billion, climbing him into the fourth spot on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, knocking out Larry Ellison. With brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany under its umbrella, Arnault is positioned to continue this winning streak. Even with the luxury sector taking hits in the past year, LVMH's broad brand portfolio and its rebound this year have set it up for sustained growth.\n\nThe contrast couldn't be clearer when you look at Novo Nordisk. Shares dropped over 5% after the US government announced it would negotiate prices for the company's blockbuster drugs. After a disappointing trial for its next-gen obesity treatment, the Danish drugmaker's future is looking a little less bright. LVMH, on the other hand, is thriving, and its resurgence is signaling that luxury is backmaking Arnault's stake in LVMH a shining example of where investors should be looking in 2025.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is in no way financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any final decision on investments.\n\nShares in the Danish leading global healthcare company Novo Nordisk (Ticker: NVO) have seen a 46% decline over the last 7 months. Is it time to buy the dip? Or is this enormous sell-off justified? Let\u2019s take a look:\n\nWho are Novo Nordisk?\n\nNovo Nordisk is a Danish company which manufactures pharmaceutical products and services, specifically regarding diabetes treatment. Its main product is the drug semaglutide, used to treat diabetes under the brand names Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity under the brand name Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk is one half of an effective duopoly over weight loss drugs, their only competitor being the American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. This is an extremely lucrative industry, with the adult obesity rate in the United States being estimated to be around 40% in 2024. This has caused an explosion in the popularity of weight loss drugs, causing NVO\u2019s revenue generated to more than double from $4.84B to $10.3B from 2020 to 2024 (an increase of 112%).\n\nLooking at the base business model they already look like a promising investment, so why the rapid decline in share price? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the company.\n\nThe Positives\n\nThe rapidly expanding GLP-1 market is expected to maintain double-digit CAGR over the next 10+ years (as shown below), and ageing global populations are creating immense strength in the healthcare sector as a whole. NVO is in position to take full advantage of both these tailwinds, given their dominance in the diabetes treatment market and participation in the current weight-loss duopoly.\n\nThe Diabetes and Obesity care segment is by far the largest contributor to NVO's recent financial success. This generated almost 94% of the company's total revenue during in Q3 2024. The segment is highly profitable as it boasts a roughly 50% operating margin, contributing to the rapid revenue growth the company has seen recently. NVO looks set to capitalise on this trend, holding a patent on semaglutide until 2032.\n\nEven once this patent expires, Novo has doubled and tripled down on Research and Development spending, meaning they aren\u2019t likely to be left behind after the patent\u2019s expiration. With the company\u2019s staggering nearly 85% gross margin, there is ample opportunity to reinvest in developing new products.\n\nWe have seen an average 74% ROIC over the last 10 years in Novo Nordisk, which gives me great confidence in NVO\u2019s ability to generate more intrinsic value growth from its recent R&D spending spree.\n\nThe company currently has $11.2B in cash, and $8.5B in total debt, the balance sheet of an extremely healthy and high quality company. We can perform a DCF calculation to estimate a fair value of shares.\n\nUsing a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 5%, Seeking Alpha\u2019s consensus Revenue estimate of 48B for 2025, 10% Revenue CAGR over the next 5 years, a 3% constant growth rate and Free Cash Flow (FCF) Margin of 18% we can calculate an estimated fair value of ~$128, presenting a 62.7% upside!!\n\nThis estimate of fair value combined with the strong fundamentals and flawless balance sheet makes Novo Nordisk look like the most undervalued company in the world, so why have we seen a nearly 50% decline in Market Cap in only 7 months? Let\u2019s take a look:\n\nThe Negatives:\n\nIn 2024 Novo Nordisk acquired Catalent in a deal valued at ~$16.5 billion. The purpose of this acquisition was to sell Catalent's manufacturing facilities to Novo Nordisk in an attempt to attempt to fix supply chain problems and expand production for Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nThe full benefits from this acquisition are not going to be realised immediately however. Management has said that that the integration of these sites is expected to have a negative impact in the low single digits on operating profit growth in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhen a drug is on the FDA\u2019s shortage list in the USA, compounding pharmacies can legally make copies of it. However once it's removed, compounding becomes restricted and stops within 60-90 days. Semaglutide shortages could cause this to happen, causing compounding pharmacies to increase their production of cheaper copies of the drugs to meet demand. This would be a massive hit to NVO\u2019s quarterly earnings and is a constant risk until production ramps up.\n\nSeparately from the shortage issues, on October 22 2024 Novo Nordisk submitted an FDA request to ask that semaglutide products be added to the Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding (DDC) list. This would prevent compounding pharmacies from making copies of Ozempic and Wegovy. The FDA has not made a decision on Novo Nordisk's DDC petition yet, and this will have to wait until after the new administration takes office under Trump. If the decision doesn't go Novo Nordisk's way, the market will most likely react negatively, creating more pain for investors.\n\nAfter such a large dip, I would expect to see insiders purchasing shares at a rapid pace, however there has been zero reported buying so far, which is something I do not like to see. That being said the company did just announce a massive buyback indicating they may believe they are currently undervalued. Numerous funds did sell out of their NVO positions in the middle of last year however, and we have not seen enormous buys in this dip either, another typically negative sign for the company.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nLooking at other large-cap Healthcare stocks, NVO trading at a TTM P/E of 25 certainly looks cheap, especially considering their promising future growth prospects, which seem much greater than other more expensive companies.\n\nOverall, I want to see a bottom for the company before buying in. There is currently a lot of negative momentum in the company\u2019s share price which could certainly carry the company down from it\u2019s current share price of $78.69 down to even $70.\n\nDollar Cost Averaging in looks like the most attractive option at the moment, as the company does look undervalued at current levels for a 2-5 years hold. This year there is definitely a chance of a sharp turnaround, but that currently does not look likely.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent\u2019s confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \u201cliked it.\u201d He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there\u2019s the process respecters and the process undoers,\u201d Cramer thinks. He \u201cfelt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he\u2019s talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\u201d While during their exchange, Cramer thought \u201cSanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\u201d However, Bessent and Sanders actually \u201chad common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\u201d according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect\u2019s potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \u201cI agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I\u2019m not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it\u2019s kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I\u2019m trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn\u2019t jump out at me.\u201d\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \u201d We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we\u2019d say they\u2019re amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\u201d believes Cramer. China needs \u201cexports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don\u2019t wanna help anyone,\u201d according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \u201cPresident-elect Trump was elected,\u201d he shared. Cramer shared that this is \u201cbecause the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\u201d China\u2019s hostility leads Cramer to \u201cthink that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that\u2019s smart to try.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \u201cWell look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn\u2019t Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That\u2019s a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\u201d he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \u201cWell, I liked that even though everything we\u2019ve ever read all our lives says that they\u2019re inflationary.\u201d\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \u201cBessent\u2019s a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you\u2019re close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I\u2019ll bet Bessent. He\u2019s really exciting. He\u2019s an exciting intellect.\u201d In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \u201cmay know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\u201d\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\u201cHe was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone\u2019s hacking you, you\u2019re blocked, because they don\u2019t have the eye, like you know it\u2019s vision, or it\u2019s finger. And we don\u2019t do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it\u2019s very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don\u2019t. Which is crazy.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 61\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that is one of the leading players in the global weight loss drug market. Cramer\u2019s recent comments about the firm wondered whether the incoming Trump administration could target it to negotiate with Denmark to cede Greenland to the US. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\u2019s shares are down by 26.8% over the past year after having dealt a hefty 17.8% blow in December after its weight loss drug trial missed investor expectations. Cramer\u2019s latest comments for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) surrounded its weight loss drugs being picked for Medicare price negotiations:\n\n\u201c[On weight loss drugs being part of Medicare] I think that there are a lot of people who felt that this had to happen. Uh, David Ricks, would be one of them, the CEO of Lilly. I think that you don\u2019t have comorbidities with these and it\u2019s going to be difficult. Otherwise they would, you know you talk about eight billion dollars, maybe for Novo, and Lilly\u2019s drug is superior in terms of weight reduction at the same dose. No one thought that they would be able to just run amok. And I think that while the stocks are down, it\u2019s going to be the greatest drug of all time. And everybody knows that. The persistence level of people who take it is much higher than what we\u2019re hearing about. Drug and exercise, exercise has failed us. Diet has failed us. So drug is the way to make it so that people who can\u2019t lose weight have to take it. But it\u2019s not a shock. You go sell it, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nOverall NVO ranks 8th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "A trial exploring the use of a higher dose of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 agonist semaglutide has shown that patients with obesity who were taking the drug were able to shed more than a fifth of their body weight.\n\nThe phase 3b STEP UP trial in more than 1,400 patients compared a 7.2mg weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide to the standard 2.6mg weekly dose sold as Wegovy or a matched placebo.\n\nAmong those who adhered to treatment, the high-dose group achieved an average weight loss of 20.7%, compared to 17.5% with the lower dose and 2.4% in the placebo group. For the overall group, including those who may have missed doses, the reduction was 18.7% with the high dose, 15.6% with the low dose, and 3.9% with placebo.\n\nThe increase in weight loss with the higher dose was impressive, but still lower than has been achieved in clinical trials of Eli Lilly's rival obesity therapy Zepbound (tirzepatide), which helped patients shed 20.9% of their weight at the same 72-week time point in its pivotal trial.\n\nMartin Holst Lange, Novo Nordisk's head of development, said that the safety and tolerability of the two doses of semaglutide were comparable, while around a third of patients treated with 7.2mg achieved more than 25% weight loss.\n\n\"Results from STEP UP further strengthen the clinical profile of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity, in addition to the health benefits already established with Wegovy, including cardiovascular risk reduction,\" he added.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the data will help Novo Nordisk in its tussle for market share in the obesity market with Lilly, which reported head-to-head data in December showing that Zepbound was 47% more effective than the current dose of Wegovy.\n\nShares in Novo Nordisk fell sharply after the announcement. However, that was likely driven by news that Wegovy and two other semaglutide products \u2013 Ozempic and Rybelsus for type 2 diabetes \u2013 have been included on the list of the next 15 drugs to be subject to what the government calls price negotiation and the industry calls price setting under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nTirzepatide will be protected from inclusion in the negotiation list until 2030, as it was first approved in 2022, while semaglutide has been on the market since 2017.\n\nThere was no word from Novo Nordisk on plans to file the high-dose version for approval, which clearly cuts the efficacy deficit with its main rival, although, the company said it would present the data in full at a scientific conference later this year.\n\nIt has other candidates in its late-stage obesity pipeline, headed by CagriSema, which combines dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist cagrilintide with semaglutide. Phase 3 results reported for CagriSema last month were a disappointment, however, with a 20.4% reduction in weight in the REDEFINE 1 study over 68 weeks that fell short of Novo Nordisk's hope of a 25% loss.\n\nAt the least, the new 7.2mg results point to scope for hiking the semaglutide dose in CagriSema to chase down that weight-loss target.\n\nThe company is also running a phase 3b trial of 7.2mg semaglutide in more than 500 patients with obesity and diabetes \u2013 STEP UP T2D \u2013 with data due in the next few months.\n\nImage by Helga from Pixabay",

            "content": "Having made waves the world over, revolutionary anti-obesity drugs Wegovy and Ozempic (manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk), and Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide are set to enter the Indian market this year. \u201cWe anticipate a positive response from the Indian market,\u201d Eli Lilly (India) told FE, as the company gets ready to bring its anti-obesity drug tirzepatide, or Mounjaro, to India this year. The company also said it will price its drug competitively for the Indian market.\n\nCompetitor Novo Nordisk had initially planned to bring its Wegovy to India in 2026, but reports say they will likely pre-pone their arrival to coincide with Eli Lilly, not wanting to miss out on the huge opportunity the Indian market brings. The company declined to comment when asked by FE on a possible launch date in India.\n\nThese drugs have made bank in the West so far, which is what makes their entry exciting here as well. In 2023, Novo Nordisk\u2019s share price increased by over four times from what it had been just five years ago \u2014 and it not only became Europe\u2019s most valuable company but also had a market capitalisation that was higher than its native country Denmark\u2019s GDP. In 2022, over 65% of all drug prescriptions in the US were for Ozempic alone.\n\nIn fact, in the second quarter of this financial year, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound made $1.24 billion and Mounjaro made $3.09 billion, far exceeding expectations.\n\nInterestingly, celebrities like Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey and Amy Schumer, among others, have also endorsed drugs like Ozempic after using them for weight loss. In India, too, the weight loss transition of celebrities like Karan Johar, Kusha Kapila, Tanmay Bhat, etc, have been linked to Ozempic, though they have denied taking these medicines.\n\n\u201cAs per the India Economic Survey 2024, obesity is a serious concern among India\u2019s adult population, with the adult obesity rate having more than tripled. It is critical that people with obesity are able to access comprehensive care that can prevent and treat the disease,\u201d the Eli Lilly spokesperson told FE.\n\nSensing the shake-up this will bring to the Indian pharma sector, domestic pharma companies are also in a race to come up with alternatives or prototype versions of these drugs that are more economical, more accessible, or have exclusivity benefits.\n\nSun Pharma is working on an anti-obesity drug utreglutide. Cipla is coming up with a generic and affordable version of Wegovy, and is eyeing a deal with Eli Lilly to market its drug in the country. Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories is also coming up with a generic version of Wegovy. Biocon, on the other hand, is working on GLP-1 therapies, and has got an approval for liraglutide. Similar to Cipla, Natco Pharma is also developing a generic version of Ozempic.\n\nThe interest in these drugs is justified. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) had stated that one in eight people in the world lived with obesity\u2014and that obesity was responsible for 44% of all diabetes cases, 23% of ischemic heart diseases, and 7-41% of all cancer cases. A 2024 Lancet study focused on India found that at least 44 million women and 26 million men who were over 20 years old, were clinically obese.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no specific data on how many people with obesity need surgical intervention or medication in India, Dr Anoop Misra, executive chairman and director, diabetes and endocrinology, Fortis C-Doc Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences, told FE that most patients with obesity are prescribed medication, adding, \u201cMore and more patients are coming with queries regarding anti-obesity medications now that they have become aware of it.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the problem is such that after all the acclaim that these drugs received, people were travelling to foreign countries to access them, resorting to grey markets, and even getting these imported from Europe, in a phenomenon dubbed \u2018Ozempic tourism\u2019.\n\nBecause of this huge scale, Eli Lilly said their \u201cpricing strategy in India will reflect the medicine\u2019s efficacy and the significant value it brings in reducing the overall health and economic burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity\u201d. The company\u2019s spokesperson added that however, \u201cwe have not yet finalised the pricing of tirzepatide\u201d.\n\nIn the US, without insurance, Wegovy can cost around $1,350, Ozempic can cost around $968, and Zepbound (or tirzepatide) can cost around $1,060 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nBut would insurance companies in India cover these medications? Pankaj Nawani, CEO of CarePal Secure, a medical insurance provider, said, \u201cTraditionally, health insurance policies in India exclude obesity treatments, considering them lifestyle-related rather than medically necessary. This stance may evolve as obesity gains recognition as a chronic condition linked to severe comorbidities, which already qualify for coverage.\u201d\n\nNawani goes on to add that insurance coverage will depend on other factors as well \u2014 regulatory clearance from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, doctors prescribing these drugs for managing obesity-related complications rather than for weight loss alone, competitive pricing, etc. \u201cA shift in public health narratives toward preventive care may encourage insurers to reconsider their stance, particularly if these drugs demonstrate cost savings by mitigating long-term healthcare expenditures,\u201d Nawani told FE.\n\nThe biggest benefit of these drugs would, of course, be to the patients. Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman and head of endocrinology and diabetes at Max Healthcare, Delhi, explained, \u201cThe existing anti-obesity drug choice in India is poor. Patients would take orlistat, sibutramine, etc, which weren\u2019t very effective or potent and had a lot of side effects. But the way these drugs work, especially the GLP-1 pathway, is exciting.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, a lot of people would qualify as candidates for these drugs too. Since Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are both essentially making anti-diabetic drugs that also have strong weight loss properties, the first candidates would be patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDr Mithal added that people with severe obesity and out of control weight problems that are causing comorbidities like sleep apnea and osteoarthritis, would be prescribed these drugs too. \u201cBut patients who have a medical history of pancreatitis and thyroid cancer in the family will not be prescribed any of these drugs,\u201d Dr Mithal went on to say.",

            "content": "It hasn't been a great period for investors in Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) despite its ongoing status as one of the pharmaceutical industry's apex competitors in the field of cardiometabolic drugs. Its shares are down by more than 20% in the last 12 months, and, given a few new competitive developments, the next 12 months might not see much in the way of relief for shareholders unless there's an upset of some kind.\n\nBut it's a mistake to write off this behemoth due to a weak year. Let's investigate what's going on and whether the stock is still worth buying for a long-term hold.\n\nThe bull thesis isn't what it used to be\n\nNovo is currently in a golden age of growth. Over the last five years, its trailing-12-month revenue grew by 109%, reaching $39.3 billion, thanks to its portfolio of potent drugs for cardiometabolic illnesses like diabetes and obesity.\n\nFor the company to continue to grow at the same pace it has been recently, its blockbuster drugs, specifically its weight loss drug Wegovy, need to continue to retain a sizable share of the market. As of the third quarter, it claimed to have a 73% share of the global market for anti-obesity medicines, though that sum includes its older drugs as well as Wegovy.\n\nThere's more than one way it could try to guarantee its hold on the market moving forward. Spending on additional research and development (R&D) programs to offer new formulations and expand the drug's total addressable market, offering customers coupons or better pricing terms depending on their insurance and ability to pay, and expanding its manufacturing facilities to ensure that Wegovy is in better supply than competing products are all avenues that Novo is pursuing already. And, if it were possible, it could also run new clinical trials directly comparing the safety and efficacy of its product against the medicines made by key competitors like Eli Lilly, (LLY 1.48%), which makes a newer weight loss drug called Zepbound.\n\nBut that would only make sense to do if management were confident that Wegovy is actually more effective than the other product. As of Dec. 4, there's no reason for it to be that confident, as Lilly took the initiative to run a direct comparison study, and the preliminary results do not appear to favor Novo Nordisk whatsoever.\n\nPer the partial data released from that phase 3b clinical trial, over 72 weeks of once-weekly treatment with either Zepbound or Wegovy, patients taking Zepbound lost 20.2% of their weight on average, whereas patients taking Wegovy lost just 13.7% on average. Lilly's drug also performed better on all five of the secondary endpoints in the study, which examined factors like waist circumference, among others. Side effect burdens were similar to earlier clinical trials for both medicines.\n\nThere's no way to interpret these results as being positive for Novo Nordisk.\n\nOne of its best-selling drugs is unambiguously not as effective at its intended purpose as a rival's. And that's a new reason to be much more cautious if you're thinking of investing in its stock, even when appreciating the fact that it has many other drug segments that are unaffected, and many other promising programs cooking in its pipeline.\n\nIt isn't all bad\n\nIt's true that Novo needs Wegovy to continue to perform strongly for its top line to do the same. But -- and this is a critical point -- it can and will continue to make billions from sales of Wegovy even if Zepbound is better in most respects.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: Eli Lilly can barely manufacture enough of its drug to meet demand, and it was in a state of shortage for most of this year and last year. It's still investing billions in spinning up new manufacturing facilities to ensure that supply capacity stops being a constraint on growth. What's more, Novo Nordisk is in exactly the same position with Wegovy, so its investments in manufacturing haven't stopped either.\n\nAt least for the moment, regardless of efficacy, there is a colossal amount of demand for weight loss medications. The amount of supply is becoming more proportional to the amount of demand. But even if 100% of patients on Wegovy suddenly asked their doctors to switch to Zepbound to get a faster rate of weight loss, they couldn't, as there simply isn't enough supply for that.\n\nIn other words, for now, Novo Nordisk will probably not even need to fight any harder than it was before to retain its market share with Wegovy despite the new study.\n\nThe implication of the above is that there is still plenty of growth on the way, so there's still a solid investment thesis for buying the stock, so long as you don't concentrate too much of your portfolio into it. Understand that its long-term performance is no longer assured, even if it isn't facing a bearish outlook either.\n\nJust appreciate that eventually the competitive landscape will shift, and, assuming that none of Novo's pipeline programs seeking to make even better weight loss medicines pan out, it'll then face some serious pressure.",

The 15 new drugs are the second group of medications set to undergo the process and are among the most expensive for the Medicare health program for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if President-elect Donald Trump plans to make any changes to the program. Biden administration officials suggested he would be unable to do so because the law outlines detailed selection criteria.\n\n\u201cThese 15 drugs, together with the 10 drugs that Medicare already negotiated, represent about a third of Medicare Part D spending on prescription drugs,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\n\nLast year, the U.S. government negotiated price cuts that ranged from 38% to 79% for 10 highly popular prescription drugs used by Medicare, which will be effective in 2026.\n\nGe Bai, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University and an advisor at conservative think tank Paragon Health Institute, said the Trump administration has the right to change the drugs subject to negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe IRA bestows the power of drug selection to the administration, not the past administration,\u201d Bai said in an email. \u201cDrug negotiation is being highly scrutinized, and the initial evidence does not support it being an effective and valuable policy, which gives the Trump administration reasons to at least seek changes through executive actions.\u201d\n\nNOVO TARGETED\n\nAround 2.3 million Medicare patients used Novo drugs made with semaglutide \u2013 which includes Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus \u2013 through its prescription drug plan program in the year ended October 2024, the government said. Total gross spending on all three topped $14 billion, it said.\n\nShares in Novo Nordisk were already down before the publication of the list due to new obesity data but fell further on the release and traded down 4.6%.\n\n\u201cNovo Nordisk remains opposed to government price setting through the IRA and has significant concerns about how the law is being implemented by this administration,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever \u2026 we will work with the incoming administration to deliver meaningful solutions for patients,\u201d it added.\n\nSince March, Wegovy use for reasons in addition to weight loss \u2013 like reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke \u2013 has been covered in the Medicare program.\n\nGovernment researchers predict that the use of diabetes drug Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss would raise the U.S. deficit over the next 10 years at its current price. Ozempic has a list price of around $935 a month while Wegovy has a list price of around $1,350 a month, though the company says it offers discounts.\n\nDrugmakers Bristol Myers, Pfizer and others whose medicines are on the list said they did not believe price negotiations could resolve barriers to access for patients.\n\nAstraZeneca said in a statement that it will urge the government to reconsider its decision to include its cancer drug Calquence on the list. Merck and Amgen did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWall Street analysts said Ozempic and Wegovy\u2019s inclusion on the list wasn\u2019t surprising.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych said the sales impact to Wegovy would probably be minimal because most prescriptions are covered by private health plans and the Medicaid program for people with low incomes.\n\nPHARMA COMPANIES DISLIKE LAW\n\nThe drug industry has fought the negotiation program, saying it will stifle innovation. They have been pushing the incoming Trump administration to ease the rules, asking, for example, to delay the timeline under which small molecule drugs become eligible for negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe IRA price setting process is dangerous for millions of Americans who rely on innovative treatments and created unnecessary, costly bureaucracy. In rushing out this list in their final days, the Biden administration once again fails to address the true challenges facing seniors and Medicare,\u201d Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) President and CEO Stephen J. Ubl said in a statement.\n\nThe announcement came just one day after the earliest possible date for doing so. The deadline for selecting the 15 drugs was Feb. 1 and makers of the selected drugs will have until Feb. 28 to decide if they will participate in the negotiations.\n\nNegotiations are due to take place through Nov. 1 of this year and the government will set prices by the end of that month.\n\nIt is unclear if the pharmaceutical industry can influence Trump on changes to the program.\n\n\u201cThe drug list is a nice mix of chronic disease, preferred branded drugs, which will impact a lot of beneficiaries,\u201d said Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy at Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University.\n\nDusetzina said that the law mandates that a minimum discount of at least 25% must be applied, and that could result in savings even if the Trump administration is \u201cless aggressive\u201d during the negotiations.

However, Eli Lilly recently surprised investors when it cut its full-year revenue guidance ahead of an investor conference after sales of its GLP-1 drugs fell short of expectations.\n\nEli Lilly now expects revenue to be approximately $13.5 billion for its fourth quarter and $45 billion for the full year 2024. The company had earlier forecast full-year revenue to come in between $45.4 billion to $46 billion. Analysts, meanwhile, were projecting Q4 revenue of $13.94 billion and full-year revenue of $45.49 billion, as compiled by LSEG.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nThe new forecast from Lilly reflects 44% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter and 32% for the year. So the company is still seeing strong growth -- just not as robust as anticipated. It is also worth noting that Lilly's original full-year revenue guidance was for $41 billion, so it handily surpassed that.\n\nGLP-1 drugs still lead the way for Eli Lilly\n\nTurning to its GLP-1 drugs, Lilly is looking for sales of Mounjaro to be $3.5 billion and $1.9 billion for Zepbound. Mounjaro is FDA-approved to help improve blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, but is commonly used off-label for weight loss. Zepbound has the same active ingredient, tirzepatide, but is approved for weight loss in obese adults or overweight adults with at least one weight-related condition, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure.\n\nA year ago, Mounjaro had sales of $2.2 billion, so that would be an increase of 59%. Zepbound had just been introduced and only had sales of $175.8 million a year ago.\n\nAt a JPMorgan conference following the announcement, the company said the revenue shortfall stemmed from weaker-than-expected scripts for diabetes in December. The company said December is usually a strong month, as people will often get two scripts to avoid deductible costs in January, but that this did not happen this year.\n\nLooking ahead, the company forecast 2025 revenue to come in between $58 billion to $61 billion, which would represent growth between 29% to 36%. It said it did not push its missed 2024 December sales into January, nor did it include a strong December in its 2025 guidance.\n\nLilly noted that it has spent aggressively to add more manufacturing capacity for its GLP-1 drugs, spending $23 billion over the last three years. It expects to be able to ship 60% more doses in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. The company said overall capacity growth for 2025 was uncertain, as there are regulatory and technical channels it needs to work through before seeing how much capacity it can add in the back half of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company discussed how its international opportunity in terms of volumes was about 9 times that of the U.S. market. However, it noted that international pricing comes in lower.\n\nOutside its incretin drugs, the company said it saw strong performances in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience medicines. It noted that sales of non-incretin drugs rose by 20% in the quarter. It is looking for several newer non-incretin drugs to also help drive revenue in 2025, as it has several new drugs to treat conditions like cancer, ulcerative colitis, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIs it time to buy the dip on Eli Lilly?\n\nIf Lilly is correct in its assessment that its revenue shortfall was due to a lack of patients doubling scripts in December, as is typical for some drugs, the company could see a stronger-than-expected Q1. Meanwhile, its overall 2025 forecast looks to be conservative, with the company not accounting for the potential of even more doses of its popular GLP-1 drugs being available in the second half.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are likely to remain popular, and the company has a big international opportunity ahead of it as well. Meanwhile, its non-weight loss drug portfolio is also growing nicely.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lilly trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 25.4 times 2025 analyst estimates, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 0.3. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, so on that basis, the stock is very cheap.\n\nGiven its valuation and the growth still in front of it with GLP-1 drugs, investors can look to buy the dip in Eli Lilly stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

The super-drug is made by Novo Nordisk, the most valuable company in Europe and worth more than the annual GDP of Denmark.\n\nCharlie Kirk, a conservative activist who visited Greenland with Donald Jr earlier this month, said: \"What a great negotiation tool trump has. He could be like, 'Oh, it would be a shame if Ozempic was banned in America. I mean, do you guys want Greenland that bad?'\"\n\nThe extraordinary tactic was revealed by Freddy Gray in The Spectator, who wrote: \"What could be more Trumpy than turning America's obesity epidemic into strategic leverage?\"\n\nREAD MORE:Putin\u2019s \u2018very quick\u2019 meeting with Trump is no coincidence amid the dictator\u2019s ill-health rumours\n\nAnother insider said: \"The Greenland stuff is like everything Trump does. He starts talking about it and everyone says that's random. And then they realise that it makes perfect sense. Denmark doesn't really have the scale to do anything meaningful with Greenland, but we really could.\"\n\nAccording to Gray, Trump is rumoured to use Ozempic himself and sales in the \"world's fattest market\" make up about 66% of the super-drug's global total, which hit $13.9bn in 2024.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe columnist writes: \"Inside MAGA circles, there's confidence that the threat of tariffs could force Denmark's hand. [Another] idea being discussed is to give Copenhagen a pass on increasing its Nato defence spending commitments in exchange for the handover of Greenland.\"\n\nTrump has also spoken about his intention to reassert American sovereignty over the Panama Canal, as well as renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Some see it as a response to China's Belt and Road initiative, one designed to secure US control over intercontinental trade routes.\n\nAnnexing mineral-rich Greenland would also allow the US to counter China and Russia's activities in the Arctic Circle. Under \"Trump 2.0\", writes Gray, the plan is to ignore the \"liberal rules-based order. China and Russia aren't playing by the rules anyway, runs the logic, so why should we?\"\n\nThe American right is tired of a strategy dubbed \"Globo Homo\", with Keir Starmer's decision to give away the Chagos Islands seen as the epitome of this limp approach to hard power politics.\n\nOne insider said: \"I keep speaking to Europeans and British embassy people and telling them he really means this stuff. And they are like, 'No, no, it's just a negotiating tactic'. I just think, are you guys never going to get it?\"\n\nFor more news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter but never miss the latest top headlines and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

            "content": "A high dose of Novo Nordisk\u2019s obesity drug Wegovy caused more weight loss than the approved regimen in a Phase III trial, the company said Friday. However, the data suggest Eli Lilly\u2019s rival GLP-1 drug Zepbound may still have an edge over Wegovy.\n\nWegovy, the weight-loss brand of semaglutide, has a recommended maintenance dose of 2.4 mg. Novo ran the Phase III STEP UP trial to evaluate the effect of increasing the maximum dose to 7.2 mg. The trial randomized 1,407 adults with obesity, but not diabetes, to receive either 7.2 mg or 2.4 mg of semaglutide or placebo.\n\nAfter 72 weeks of weekly injections, patients on the 7.2 mg dose had lost 18.7% of their body weight. Novo saw weight loss of 15.6% at the 2.4 mg dose and 3.9% on placebo. One-third of patients on the high dose lost at least 25% of their weight, compared to 16.7% of people taking the lower dose. The results suggest launching the higher dose could increase the weight loss people experience on Wegovy, Novo said.\n\nBoosting efficacy could help Novo in its fight for market share. Zepbound beat Wegovy in a head-to-head Phase IIIb trial in December. Data from that trial, SURMOUNT-5, showed that patients on Zepbound lost 20.2% of their weight over 72 weeks in a Phase III trial\u2014a bit higher than the new Wegovy results. Cross-trial comparisons can be misleading, however.\n\nMartin Holst Lange, executive vice president of development at Novo, set out his expectations for the 7.2 mg dose at the company\u2019s capital markets day last March. Lange said Novo\u2019s models showed the higher dose could achieve weight loss of 20% to 21% without compromising on safety and tolerability.\n\nNovo reported weight loss of 20.7% in STEP UP when evaluating the effects of semaglutide if all participants adhered to treatment. In that analysis, the 2.4 mg dose achieved weight loss of 17.5%. The placebo result was 2.4%.\n\n\u201cThe weight loss exhibited with 7.2 mg semaglutide compares cross-trial to LLY\u2019s Ph3 SURMOUNT-1 tirzepatide up to 22.5% (20.1% pbo-adj.) at the same time point using a similar measure (Jastreboff et. al NEJM 2022). The results give us greater confidence in long-term tirzepatide market share,\u201d Leerink Partners analysts wrote in a Friday note to investors, adding, \u201cWe await detailed results from the Ph3b STEP UP trial at a medical conference this year, but we note that historical data showed better cross-trial tolerability for tirzepatide compared to sema\u2019s 2.4 mg dose.\u201d\n\nIn its latest announcement, the Danish drugmaker said the 7.2 mg dose appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, as is typical for GLP-1 drugs, and the vast majority of side effects were mild to moderate and diminished over time. Novo said it will share detailed results, which could provide a clearer look at the tolerability implications of increasing the dose, later this year.\n\nNovo made no mention of CagriSema, its semaglutide combination therapy, in the topline data release, but the results may have implications for this investigational program. Lange said in March that the 7.2 mg data could enable Novo \u201cto go into even higher doses with CagriSema in the life cycle management space.\u201d However, Phase III CagriSema data disappointed investors late last year, sending Novo\u2019s stock down 20%.\n\nThe reveal of the 7.2 mg data coincided with the news that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has chosen semaglutide for its second cycle of price negotiations. The negotiations could lower the price the government pays for Wegovy and Ozempic, the diabetes brand of semaglutide, in 2027.",

These new drugs are going to be part of the consideration the next administration goes through,\" Becerra said.\n\nNovo's semaglutide drugs on the new list come as no surprise, as speculations were rampant about their inclusion in recent months.

Also on the list are Pfizer's (PFE) cancer blockbuster Ibrance, Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) Austedo, a treatment for movement disorder, and Merck's (MRK) diabetes treatment Janumet.\n\n\"Last year, we proved that negotiating for lower drug prices works,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. \"Now we plan to build on that record by negotiating for lower prices for 15 additional important drugs for seniors.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk stock skidded 5.3%, closing at 78.69.\n\nNovo Nordisk's Semaglutide Setback\n\nThe news is a major blow to Novo Nordisk, whose semaglutide products are expected to generate $28.19 billion in 2024 sales. That accounts for more than 70% of Novo's projected sales for the year.\n\nWegovy is the costliest of the three drugs. Patients without insurance or insurance coverage can pay up to $1,350 for a 28-day supply. Behind that, Ozempic and Rybelsus have list prices near $1,000.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted investors were closely tracking semaglutide and Teva's Austedo \u2014 a treatment for tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease \u2014 heading into the 2027 list.\n\n\"As a base case, investors (and the respective companies) were expecting them to be included,\" Raffat said in a client note.\n\nStill, Novo Nordisk continued the slump it began last June.\n\n$41 Billion In Drug Costs\n\nIn its news release, the Department of Health and Human Services said 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these drugs from November 2023 to October 2024. The drugs accounted for about $41 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs under Part D coverage \u2014 or about 14% during that time period.\n\nThe list is \"mostly as expected but some surprises,\" Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report.\n\nThe inclusion of Austedo could bolster Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), which makes a competitor drug called Ingrezza. Bausch Health Companies' (BHC) Xifaxan, which treats gastrointestinal issues, also landed on the list as did Trelegy Ellipta, an inhaler from GSK (GSK) that treats chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.\n\nRaffat of Evercore expected AstraZeneca's (AZN) lung cancer drug Tagrisso and Creon, an AbbVie (ABBV) treatment for a pancreatic condition, to make the list. But they didn't. He didn't expect Vraylar, an antipsychotic from AbbVie to make the list. But it did.\n\nA 'Wash' For AbbVie\n\nPiper Sandler's Raymond says the news is a wash for AbbVie. He expected leukemia treatment Venclexta to be on the list. Instead, it's Vraylar. For 2027, he expects $2 billion from Venclexta in the U.S., while he calls for Vraylar to generate more than double that at $4.8 billion.\n\nBut the exclusion of Pfizer's Xeljanz could benefit AbbVie's Rinvoq. Both belong to the same drug class, blocking a specific kinase tied to immunologic diseases. Now, a key player won't have a lower reference price, forcing competitors to lower their prices.\n\nLeerink Partners analyst Faisal Khurshid noted the inclusion of Linzess, which Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (IRWD) co-markets with AbbVie.\n\n\"The impact of price negotiations is uncertain given the Linzess is already high discounted,\" he said in a report. \"The bigger question for Linzess revenues in 2025 is the impact of Medicare Part D changes, and we remain on the sidelines given these uncertainties.\"\n\nIronwood stock, which trades around 4, fell 3.2%.\n\nMost of the bigger names traded up or down a fraction on the news. But Novo Nordisk stock hit its lowest point since August 2023.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIntuitive Surgical Breaks Out After Robotic Surgery Giant Crushes Quarterly Forecasts\n\nAfter Eli Lilly's 7% Slump On Its Guidance Cut, What's Left To Like?

As of 11 a.m. ET, shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) are down 4.2%, and Hims & Hers Health (HIMS 5.07%) stock is getting walloped for a 5.8% loss. In contrast, shares of Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 3.90%) are up a modest 3.3%.\n\nAnd why? As CNBC reports today, the Biden administration is using its last few days in office to add 15 prescription drugs to the list of medications on which Medicare can negotiate prices. And here's the kicker: Three weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk top this list.\n\nWhy Novo Nordisk investors are nervous today\n\nTaking aim at the sky-high price of semaglutide, Medicare plans to negotiate prices for Novo Nordisk products Ozempic (an injection to control diabetes), Wegovy (an injection more designed for weight loss), and Rybelsus (a pill for diabetes). CNBC notes that prices for these drugs have been impacted by a combination of high demand and low supply, as well as varied coverage by private insurance. Once negotiated, the prices reimbursed by Medicare would go into effect in 2027.\n\nCommenting on the move, Stephen Ubl's PhRMA pharmaceutical industry lobbying group called price negotiations \"dangerous for millions of Americans who rely on innovative treatments.\" But what investors are more worried about is whether these negotiations will be dangerous for corporate profits.\n\nSome 2.3 million Medicare enrollees use Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus combined, and Medicare spent $14.3 billion buying them between November 2023 and October 2024, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That's a big pile of profits for Novo that are now being put at risk.\n\nNovo may not like it, but as CNBC notes, the company will be required to choose between negotiating its prices lower, paying an excise tax of 95% of its sales on the drugs, or not having the drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid at all.\n\nWhat this means for Hims & Hers and Viking Therapeutics\n\nIt's less obvious why this is making Him & Hers investors nervous today, or, for that matter, why Viking Therapeutics stock is going up. None of their drugs seem to be implicated in the Medicare price negotiations, after all. In addition to Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, 14 other drugs are named as subject to negotiation, but there's nothing from Hims & Hers or Viking on the list.\n\nPotentially, though, investors could worry that if Medicare is concerned with the high cost of semaglutide in particular, a subsequent round of price negotiations could target semaglutide compounders like Hims & Hers.\n\nConversely, Viking stock may be getting a boost because, although it works much like semaglutide and targets the same hormone semaglutide targets, the GLP-1 drug it is developing (but not yet selling), VK2735, is not itself technically semaglutide. Instead, it's called tirzepatide. That could be a distinction with a difference and potentially remove the Medicare crosshairs from Viking -- making its stock a better bet than Novo Nordisk going forward.\n\nMore on Novo Nordisk\n\nIn other news, Novo Nordisk announced the results from its phase 3b STEP UP semaglutide trial today. Specifically, the company said semaglutide 7.2 milligram (mg) injections over a 72-week period resulted in an average weight loss of 20.7%, better than the 17.5% weight loss achieved in a prior trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg injections.\n\nNovo characterized these results as \"superior.\" Still, the results appear to fall short of the company's ultimate goal of finding a drug combination that can average 25% weight loss. Taken in conjunction with the Medicare news, this is a second reason for investors to sour on Novo Nordisk stock's prospects today.\n\nThat said, it's worth pointing out that Novo Nordisk stock is now down an astonishing 44% from its all-time high hit back in July. At a price-to-earnings ratio now approaching 28, and with most analysts still forecasting long-term earnings growth of about 19%, we may be approaching the point where all the \"bad\" news will be \"priced in,\" and there's nowhere left for Novo Nordisk stock to go but up.",

Besides semaglutide, which Novo Nordisk sells as Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, the agency also chose other diabetes drugs, respiratory therapies and several cancer treatments.\n\nCMS\u2019 treatment of semaglutide as one product is because the agency focuses on a drug\u2019s \u201cactive moiety,\u201d or the core compound that has a biological effect, rather than treat each use approved by the Food and Drug Administration separately.\n\n\u201cThe statute and our guidance [are] very clear that when a drug is selected for negotiation, all dosage forms and strengths with the same active ingredients are included, even if they are sold under different formulations or brand names,\u201d said Erin Richardson, CMS\u2019 chief of staff, on a call with reporters.\n\nOzempic was approved in 2017, making semaglutide subject to negotiation for the first time in 2025 under rules laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act. Eli Lilly\u2019s competing products Mounjaro and Zepbound, which contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, gained first approval in 2022, meaning they wouldn\u2019t be subject to price negotiation until 2030.\n\nWhile semaglutide is widely covered within Medicare for diabetes, the health insurance program is not currently permitted by law to reimburse for treating weight loss, where Novo has since 2021 sold semaglutide as Wegovy.\n\nWegovy is also approved to lower cardiovascular risk in people with heart disease and who are either overweight or have obesity, however. Medicare determined last March that this use could be covered under Part D plans. And the Biden administration last fall proposed a new rule permitting Medicare to cover obesity treatment more broadly.\n\nThe \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d the U.S. government negotiates under these talks will be a single cost. Dosage strengths, formulations and packaging prices for Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy would be adjusted to meet that monthly price.\n\nSemaglutide products in Medicare are also already likely to be discounted from their list prices \u2014 $998 a month for Ozempic and Rybelsus, $1,349 a month for Wegovy \u2014 although CMS officials wouldn\u2019t confirm that Part D insurance plans receive rebates. In 2023, Novo paid 62% of its gross sales back in rebates across its sales. Of roughly $88.3 billion in gross sales, about $32 billion was paid back in rebates to Medicare and U.S. managed care plans.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to working with policymakers to advance solutions to ensure access and affordability for all patients,\u201d a Novo spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cThat is why we are deeply concerned about the price-setting process, which could negatively impact patients\u2019 ability to access their medicines and threatens to stifle future scientific development of life-changing medicines for chronic diseases in which there is a real unmet need.\u201d\n\nNegotiations over semaglutide will be Novo\u2019s second time discussing price concessions with CMS. The first round of talks, which yielded prices set to take effect in 2026, included insulin aspart, which Novo sells as several different products.\n\nThat selection triggered a lawsuit from Novo, citing CMS inclusion of multiple products by way of selecting one active ingredient.\n\nThat suit could provide an opportunity, albeit a long shot, to exempt Wegovy and Rybelsus from this round of price negotiations. CMS in its guidance said it applies price negotiations across products using the same active ingredient or moiety because it reduces the incentive for companies to engage in \u201cproduct hopping,\u201d or making small changes in drug formulation to extend patent-protected exclusivity.\n\nNovo claimed the guidance went beyond what the IRA allowed because it interpreted the law\u2019s call for price negotiations on \u201cdrug products\u201d and \u201cbiological products\u201d to mean all those with the same active moiety or ingredient. By grouping together all of Novo\u2019s insulin products, CMS invoked negotiations on more than the 10 products permitted by the IRA in the initial round, Novo argued.\n\nThe courts so far have rejected Novo\u2019s lawsuit, ruling in July the company was effectively suing on behalf of other manufacturers when it made that claim, which it doesn\u2019t have standing to do. Novo has appealed.\n\nWhether CMS will be able to carry out its plans \u2014 and even whether the program will survive a Trump administration and Republican Congress seeking to undo the work of the Biden administration \u2014 is subject to some question. Already, drugmakers are reportedly planning to ask the Trump administration to pause negotiations.\n\nOn the call with reporters, CMS officials emphasized their selections were guided by the Inflation Reduction act, noting that any other team that followed statute would end up choosing the same slate of 15 medicines.",

Its drugs have become incredibly popular as Americans turn to GLP-1 medications to help them lose weight. Wegovy has also been approved for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes, while studies have found these dugs can help with several other conditions.\n\nNovo Nordisk saw its stock fall by more than 4% in pre-market trading Friday. Shares are also being affected by headline results from a new study that found patients who take a higher dose of Wegovy lost more weight than those on a lower dose without experiencing an increase in side effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study found that people who took a 7.2-milligram dose lost an average of 20.7% of their weight over 72 weeks. Patients who took a 2.4-milligram dose of the semaglutide lost 17.5% of their weight, while people given a placebo lost just 2.4% of their weight over that time. Over 33% of participants who took the higher dose also recorded a weight loss of 25% or more, compared to 16.7% of participants with the lower dose.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to demonstrate 20.7% weight loss and to see that 33% of patients achieved more than 25% weight loss with semaglutide 7.2 mg, with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to semaglutide 2.4 mg,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s head of development, Martin Holst Lange, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Bruce Gil contributed to this article.",

The Novo Nordisk Foundation is committing up to DKK 202 million over a seven-year period.\n\nWith the initiative, industry and educational partners are joining forces to make the Biotech city of Kalundborg an internationally leading hub for education, research and innovation within biomanufacturing and biosolutions.\n\nCentral to the initiative is the establishment of a new 11,000-12,000m\u00b2 campus building (preliminary estimate) that will include a pilot plant, laboratories and creation spaces, providing the facilities needed to conduct cutting-edge teaching, research and development.\n\nThe expanded physical campus settings will create a unique educational environment where students from a broad range of academic, vocational and professional programmes can collaborate across disciplines while gaining real-world experience through close interaction with industry professionals. The overall success criterion for the campus is to increase the local student population from approx. 500 students today to 1,500 by 2030.\n\n\u201dWith this initiative, Kalundborg prepares a significant step on the impressive journey towards becoming a leader in biotech and life science. The broad collaboration and the strong local support are both inspiring and a good example of how both education and business can be strengthened locally by connecting them more closely. With the government\u2019s new life science strategy and by opening up to more international students, I believe that we can help create a good framework for this brilliant local initiative,\u201d says Minister of Higher Education and Science Christina Egelund.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to support this initiative, which will strengthen the coherence and quality of education within the biomanufacturing and biosolutions sphere. Kalundborg provides the optimal location for bringing education at all levels together while ensuring close proximity to the industry,\u201d says Berith Bj\u00f8rnholm, Senior Vice President, Education & Outreach, the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nStrong group of partners\n\nThe new initiative has been developed in collaboration between numerous partners, including key organisations with activities in Kalundborg: University College Absalon, University of Copenhagen (UCPH), Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Teknika, Nordvestsj\u00e6llands Erhvervs- og Gymna-sieuddannelser (NEG), Royal Danish Academy, Helix Lab, Knowledge Hub Zealand, Novo Nordisk, Novonesis, Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Municipality of Kalundborg, and AP Pension. The diverse group of partners ensures a comprehensive and collaborative approach to the development and implementation of the new initiative.\n\nAP Ejendomme, a subsidiary of AP Pension, will build and own the new campus building, which will be used by the education partners for education and research purposes.\n\nIn addition to this, more than DKK 320 million has been committed to the Campus Kalundborg project. The Novo Nordisk Foundation is awarding up to DKK 202 million to fund the development of a unique teaching and training environment during 2025-2031. This includes establishment of new laboratories and makerspaces, the enhancement of recruitment and teaching activities, and the strengthening of collaboration with local industry for education and continuing education.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S is awarding DKK 120 million to fund the rent, for a seven-year period, starting when the new campus building has been finalised.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the newly established Campus Kalundborg Association, which includes all partners involved in the initiative, the Chairperson who is also Director at Absalon Health and Science, Daniel Schwartz Bojsen notes:\n\n\u201cWe will establish an educational symbiosis across institutions, with industry as an active partner. Kalundborg is the ideal location, due to the well-established industry cluster and its world-leading model of the Kalundborg Symbiosis. In addition, the existing local educational initiatives have seen very positive results \u2013 both regarding the recruitment of national and international students and the retention of graduates as employees in the industry. This is a truly visionary initiative, responding to several national agendas within education and research. This includes the importance of ensuring locally anchored educations in close proximity to and in collaboration with the industry, strengthening the pipeline for the growing life-science sector and Danish production industry in general as well as strengthening the pipeline for the vocational educations.\u201d\n\nDaniel Schwartz Bojsen concludes: \u201cNow the search for an innovative and collaborative Campus Director will start. The Director will lead the project and ensure together with the newly established board of directors that the ambitious vision of the partners will be realised.\u201d\n\nBuilding on a legacy of collaboration\n\nThe new initiative builds on a legacy of collaboration and success that spans 50 years. The Kalundborg Model, a unique culture of collaboration based on mutual trust and strong partnerships among public and private partners, has been the cornerstone of Kalundborg\u2019s growth and development.\n\n\u201cThis new initiative is taking our very successful partnership model to the next level. When the individual strength and competencies of each of these visionary partners come together, also taking into account the experience of operating educations in Kalundborg and the very strong collaboration between the industry and students in Kalundborg, I foresee that we will create a vibrant campus environment that not only fosters innovation and learning but also strengthens the vitality of Kalundborg\u2019s urban life, its educational landscape, its dynamic industries, and its engaged civil society. Together, these elements will create a community where knowledge, opportunity, and quality of life thrive side by side,\u201d says Mayor of the Municipality of Kalundborg Martin Damm.\n\nFacts\n\nKalundborg is the largest biotech industrial hub in Scandinavia with companies such as Novo Nordisk, Novonesis, Novo Nordisk Engineering (NNE), Unibio, Meliora Bio, Kalundborg Refinery and \u00d8rsted. These companies, along with an extensive ancillary industry of highly specialised subcontractors and a growing ecosystem of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups, contribute to the vibrant industrial hub in Kalundborg. The Kalundborg Symbiosis, BIOPRO Research and Innovation partnership, and Biotech City Alliance are also integral to the ongoing success and development of the region.\n\nAn impressive number of educational programmes from vocational to master\u2019s level have already been established at Campus Kalundborg:\n\n1992: Vocational programme as process operator and industrial operator at NEG Kalundborg (in Danish)\n\n2016: A specialisation in pharma and food ingredients on the vocational process operator programme at NEG Kalundborg (in Danish)\n\n2017: BEng in Biotechnology at University College Absalon (in Danish and in English)\n\n2018: Bachelor of Biomedical Laboratory Science at University College Absalon (in Danish)\n\n2020: BEng in Mechanical Engineering at University College Absalon (in Danish)\n\n2022: Helix Lab Research and Education Center2023: Bachelor of Technology Management and Marine Engineering at Teknika (in Danish)\n\n2023: BA in Architecture at the Royal Danish Academy (in Danish)\n\n2023: Industrial MSc in Biomanufacturing at DTU (in English)\n\n2024: MSc in Biosolutions at UCPH (in English).\n\nAdditional educational programmes are planned for the coming years.",

J\u00f8rgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and has held various management positions, including Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development, Strategy and Biopharmaceuticals.\n\nNovo Nordisk has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the past few years. Novo Nordisk's profit margin has remained consistently high, with a net margin of approximately 30%. In terms of debt, Novo Nordisk has maintained a conservative approach. Novo Nordisk's debt has kept pace with its assets for several years. The company's cash reserves have not always been healthy, but in 2022 Novo Nordisk made a profit for the first time since 2018.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's valuation metrics compare favorably to industry peers. It has a price-to-earnings ratio in line with its peers but a price-to-book ratio significantly higher than the industry average. Novo Nordisk's high P/B ratio reflects its strong brand, market position, and financial performance.\n\n\n\nNovo Nordisk's stock has performed well over the past few years, with a 3-year annualized return of around 23%. The stock price has shown some volatility, with significant price movements in response to regulatory and market news related to diabetes and obesity markets.\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving pharmaceutical industry, specifically in diabetes and obesity markets.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk\u2019s transformation from a small Danish company focused on insulin production to one of the biggest players in the pharma space is well-documented. The company\u2019s current portfolio is being driven by blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy (both semuglatide) for diabetes and weight loss, which pulled in DKK 86.5 billion ($12 billion) and DKK 38.3 billion ($5.4 billion) for the first nine months of 2024.\n\nSemaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drug, a receptor agonist designed to mimic the action of the naturally occurring hormone of the same name. The drug binds to GLP-1 receptors to promote insulin secretion, suppress glucagon release, and slow gastric emptying \u2013 an effect associated with weight loss.\n\nHowever, beneath the hood of Novo Nordisk\u2019s drug development engine, the company\u2019s ambitions go far beyond GLP-1s. Its research team has a wide breadth of modalities in its pipeline, including a host of nucleic acid-based therapies. \u201cWe are very much looking at established platforms within this field,\u201d Karina Thorn, corporate VP and head of Research, Global Nucleic Acid Therapies (GNAT) at Novo Nordisk, said at TIDES Europe in November 2024.\n\nCollaboration catalyst\n\nNovo Nordisk has launched one RNAi product \u2013 Rivfloza (nedosiran) for rare genetic condition primary hyperoxaluria type 1 \u2013 and has more than five nucleic acid-based candidates in the clinic, Thorn told a packed room in Hamburg, Germany. Nearly 40 other programs, meanwhile, are in preclinical development targeting metabolic diseases, rare conditions, and multifactorial disorders.\n\nThis pipeline grew from leveraging Novo Nordisk\u2019s internal R&D network, comprising hubs in Boston (Massachusetts), Boulder (Colorado), and Copenhagen (Denmark), with external partnerships. Whether with biotech, pharma, academic institutions, or even service providers, these collaborations focus on \u201cco-creation opportunities\u201d rather than straight up dealmaking.\n\n\u201cThat is way more than making a financial transaction between different collaborators,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cWe are leaning into marrying the scientific stronghold from the collaborators with what we may build internally.\u201d\n\nThorn spoke of five major investments and collaborations that demonstrate this approach and have helped grow Novo Nordisk into an RNA powerhouse. \u201cEach of them has a brilliant story, but also a different story.\u201d\n\nCardior and non-coding RNA\n\nIn March, Novo Nordisk acquired Cardior Pharmaceuticals for \u20ac1.03 billion ($1.08 billion) adding a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) technology and CDR132L, an antisense oligonucleotide candidate for the treatment of heart failure, based on the platform. While not translated into proteins, ncRNA does regulate critical cellular processes and acts on key disease pathways simultaneously, triggering a concerted therapeutic effect against key hallmarks of heart disease.\n\nThis \u201cexample of a nucleic acid-driven external engagement\u201d brought Novo Nordisk \u201ca mature technology,\u201d said Thorn. \u201cIt represented a clinical asset in Phase II for the investigation of heart function. This was really an acquisition driven by an interesting asset and the results that it had, but also a reflection that the RNA platform could be something that could inspire us earlier in the pipeline.\u201d\n\n2seventy and AAV\n\nAcquiring a nearly ready-made asset differs from the journey Novo Nordisk took with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based gene therapy developer 2seventy Bio.\n\nIn October 2019, Novo and bluebird bio inked a three-year collaboration to develop a hemophilia A gene therapy. This partnership also gave Novo Nordisk access to in vivo genome editing platform megaTAL: single-chain fusion enzymes that combines the natural DNA cleaving processes of Homing Endonucleases (HEs) with the DNA binding region of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors.\n\n\u201cIt was a true scientific cooperation. There was one component where the 2seventy team based in Boston were in charge and had that proprietary megaTAL nuclease technology for doing precise genomics. We at the Novo Nordisk side had a lot of knowledge about AAV and factor VIII \u2013 that was the antigen being applied.\u201d\n\n2seventy spun out from bluebird in 2021, and in 2024, Novo Nordisk acquired the candidate and gene editing tech in full.\n\nDicerna\u2019s GalXC\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s dealings with Lexington, Massachusetts-based Dicerna Pharmaceuticals represented a similar model of partnership that went from a feasibility study collaboration to a full-out acquisition in the RNA space.\n\nIn 2019, Novo Nordisk paid $175 million upfront to collaborate with Dicerna in the discovery and development of RNAi therapies for liver-related cardiometabolic diseases. The deal leveraged Dicerna\u2019s suite of GalXC technologies, which targeted specific genes to maximize pharmaceutical acceptability by enabling access to intracellular disease targets across hepatic and extrahepatic cell and tissue types.\n\n\u201cThis was an agreement that was based on the stronghold of what Dicerna had established with their GalXC platform targeting applications in the liver. This was a large investment going back to how we could apply our novel targets into the platform that had been developed within the GalXC RNAi space.\u201d\n\nTwo years into the collaboration, Novo Nordisk upped its interest in the platform and acquired Dicerna for $3.3 billion in what Thorn described as \u201cmarrying the internal investment with tissue targeting binders and what has been developed on the RNAi side.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThis is one of the main reasons that we went from the research collaboration working quite well to now creating a win-win situation, both for Novo Nordisk and for Dicerna, of how we can impact the portfolio even more broadly when we are together and not just collaborators.\u201d\n\nGene therapy expansion\n\nThe last two examples Thorn gave of Novo Nordisk\u2019s oligo-focused dealmaking sit in the gene therapy space.\n\nIn May 2023, the firm inked a $225-335 million R&D collaboration with ElevateBio subsidiary Life Edit Therapeutics, with the aim of developing therapies for both rare genetic disorders and more prevalent cardiometabolic diseases. The deal gave access to Life Edit\u2019s CRISPR base editing technology \u2013 a method of genome editing that converts one nucleotide base into another without cutting both strands of DNA.\n\nMeanwhile in September 2024, Novo Nordisk entered a collaboration with NanoVation, accessing the firm\u2019s long-circulating lipid nanoparticle (lcLNP) technology. The firm says lcLNPs have the ability to deliver RNA to cells outside of the liver by aiding functional nucleic acid delivery to extrahepatic cell types.\n\nBoth of these deals are focused on multiple targets, \u201cone of them being more cargo-focused, the other one more delivery-focused.\u201d Like its other deals in the space, Novo Nordisk\u2019s targets and expertise in biology complement the third-party tech platforms, Thorn said, with the question of how to \u201cmove that forward in the maturation into clinical candidates\u201d as a permanent horizon.",

Its annual revenues of $58.5 billion reflected a 41% decrease from the previous year.\n\nPfizer's best-selling product by far in 2023 was Comirnaty, its latest-generation Covid vaccine. It alone brought in about $11.2 billion.\n\nIts second most profitable product was Eliquis, an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots and prevent stroke.

            "content": "Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show,\" he stated. Cramer added \"Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower.\" He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being \"worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell\" the world's leading GPU designer.\n\nAs a result, Cramer shared \"I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains.\" Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants \"fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum.\"\n\nCramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the \"QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers.\" Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented \"But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher.\"\n\nIn a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, \"The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow.\"\n\nWe recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that \"He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared:\n\n\"When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with.\"\n\nHe added \"I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards.\"\n\nAs for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him \"A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired last Wednesday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company was dealt a setback when its recent trial of a weight loss drug missed investor expectations of reducing weight by 25% in December which sent the shares sinking by 17.8%. Cramer's remarks surrounded the potential for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) to be caught up in a diplomatic row between the US and Denmark:\n\n\"I was going to go to Navarro, because I'm long Eli Lilly with my charitable trust, and say what do got, are you guys going to slam Novo Nordisk? Denmark's biggest export. You wanna put, you wanna put the jugular? That's Denmark's jugular.\n\nOverall NVO ranks 8th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Lilly updated investors on its expected revenue for 2024 this morning, and gave new guidance for 2025 revenue as well -- and while its 2025 prediction was a bit more than Wall Street had expected, its prediction for 2024 was a bit less.\n\nAs of 10:45 a.m. ET, Lilly shares are shedding 6%. Archrival Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) is down 3.3% in sympathy, while Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 3.90%), which is hard at work on its own GLP-1 drugs but hasn't yet gotten them to market, is suffering worst of all -- down 8.1%.\n\nWhat Eli Lilly said on Tuesday\n\nIn a press release this morning, Eli Lilly was pleased to announce that 2024 revenues are tracking about $4 billion above what it had expected to receive at the start of this year, and that the company now expects to collect about $45 billion total for all of 2024 -- up 32% from 2023.\n\nThat's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that the bloom may be coming off the GLP-1 rose, which is presumably the reason why not only Eli Lilly but Novo Nordisk and Viking Therapeutics stock are suffering this morning. As Lilly notes, Q4 2024 revenue in particular is tracking to be \"approximately $400 million below the low end of recently issued financial guidance\" at $13.5 billion.\n\nOn the one hand, that's still an amazing amount of money. Management notes that it's 45% more than Lilly got in Q4 2023, and that fully 40% of its Q4 money haul, $5.4 billion, will come from sales of its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, $13.5 billion is still 3% less than what Lilly was hoping to receive, as stated in its Q3 earnings call guidance.\n\nTurning to 2025 guidance, Lilly noted that new medicines and new uses of existing medicines, expansion of production, and global expansion of sales of its diabetes and weight loss drugs should all add up to strong, 32% sales growth in the new year. The company forecasts 2025 sales of $58 billion to $61 billion.\n\nIs it time to sell Eli Lilly stock?\n\nSo taken as a whole, is this news bad enough to justify selling Eli Lilly stock -- and all the other GLP-1 stocks, too -- today?\n\nThat really depends on how you look at it. On the one hand, sales didn't rise as fast as Lilly might have liked in Q4. On the other hand, though, 32% quarterly growth isn't bad at all. And management's forecast for 2025 sales implies continued 32% growth throughout this new year.\n\nThat's hardly bad news for Eli Lilly. In fact, the company is forecasting about $1 billion more sales in 2025, than Wall Street was predicting.\n\nAs for the GLP-1 stocks not named Eli Lilly that are also falling today, the news there may be even better.\n\nAgain, on the one hand, worries that GLP-1 sales aren't growing as fast as hoped imply that the market for these drugs may not end up quite as big as investors would like it to. That said, Eli Lilly noted that in Q4 2024, the \"incretin market\" (basically, another name for GLP-1 drugs) \"grew 45% compared to the same quarter last year.\" Lilly's sales, too, grew 45% in the quarter. And this implies that in the final quarter of the year, at least, Lilly didn't gain any market share.\n\nIs it time to buy Novo Nordisk stock?\n\nWhile neither a positive nor a negative for Lilly, it also means that first-to-market Novo Nordisk didn't lose market share in the quarter, and I'd consider this a positive for that stock, not a reason to sell it.\n\nWith Novo Nordisk stock currently costing only 29 times earnings, or roughly one-third the 86 P/E ratio at Lilly, yet presumably growing about as fast as Lilly, I'd say the ultimate upshot of today's news is that Lilly stock isn't any more expensive today than it looked yesterday -- and Novo Nordisk stock may be a bit cheaper than it looks.",

They have also had mentors at Novo Nordisk to support research collaborations with the company. Thus, Fellows have gained insight into research conducted in both academia and industry. In order to increase coherence around the Fellowship programme, a number of events have been held throughout the years such as high profile lectures, symposia, etc. both at Karolinska Institutet and at Novo Nordisk in the Copenhagen area.\n\nBuilding Bridges: Diabetes and Metabolism Research at Karolinska Institutet and Novo Nordisk\n\nOur final symposium was held on March 19-20, 2024 to celebrate the fellowship program active from 2015-2024. The meeting was a success and summarized the research and work performed in the program over the 10 years. In addition to scientific presentations, the program highlighted the fruitful collaborations between KI and Novo Nordisk and provided career information sessions. As such, the theme for the event was \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d: building bridges to new people, to new environments, to new careers, to new knowledge, and to new treatments.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -19.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Novo Nordisk falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Novo Nordisk is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of +19.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.8%. This estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 indicates a change of +22.2% from what Novo Nordisk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Novo Nordisk.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Novo Nordisk, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $39.92 billion and $49.03 billion estimates indicate +18.4% and +22.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNovo Nordisk reported revenues of $10.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.5%. EPS of $0.90 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.61%. The EPS surprise was -1.1%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Novo Nordisk surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNovo Nordisk is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Novo Nordisk. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

            "content": "There are over 300 glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) drugs in an active stage of development as the astounding success of Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1R obesity drug, Wegovy, has ignited a surge in innovator drug obesity trials. Companies are hoping to disrupt the space and loosen the stronghold that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lily, whose obesity drugs accounted for 99% of the $37.2bn GLP-1R sales in 2023, have on the market.\n\n\n\nThe popularity of GLP-1R drugs has catapulted the treatment landscape of obesity into the spotlight. Reformation for the management of this disease is long overdue considering obesity was only recognised as a disease by the American Medical\n\nAssociation in 2013, despite affecting around 74% of the US population, according to the National Institutes of Health. This reinforces the World Health Organization\u2019s assessment of obesity as one of the most visible \u2013 yet most neglected \u2013 public health problems. However, the tide fortunately appears to be shifting thanks to the success of several high-profile GLP-1R drugs in recent years.\n\n\n\nA critical part of this reformation is providing effective, innovative, and accessible treatments, which the industry is currently excelling at. According to leading data and analytics company GlobalData\u2019s Trials Intelligence platform, 2024 was a record year for obesity clinical trials, with the number of trials increasing year-on-year since 2020. 2025 appears set to continue this trend with a substantial number of planned trials already announced, not even a full week into the year (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nOne way that sponsors appear to be keeping up with the growing demand for obesity trials is by utilising decentralised designs and virtual components; data derived from GlobalData\u2019s Trials Intelligence platform indicates that 13% of obesity\n\ntrials in 2024 were either decentralised or utilised at least one virtual component such as wearables, sensors, and apps. Utilisation of these technologies enables richer, more granular data collection and can increase patient engagement, as\n\nthey often receive real-time updates and progress updates, which sustains motivation, possibly increasing patient recruitment and retention.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, GlobalData\u2019s Trials Intelligence platform indicates that the percentage of these obesity trials investigating an innovator drug is increasing year-on-year, with 2024 also marking a momentous shift by being the first year with over half\n\nof trials, specifically 64%, being innovator drug trials. Again, 2025 may break this record, as 71% of the trials already announced are investigating innovator drugs (Figure 1). The market outlook for several of these innovator drugs looks\n\npromising, and GlobalData estimates that a number of these pipeline GLP-1Rs are likely to launch in 2030, subsequently contributing to the whopping $125bn GLP-1R expected sales by 2033, according to GlobalData.\n\nAlthough treatment is a significant part of supporting positive patient outcomes, gaps in the market remain as opportunities to address other factors. According to a high-prescribers survey conducted by GlobalData, key opinion leaders are calling on national healthcare authorities to provide structured guidelines regarding diagnostic methods and disease management. In terms of diagnostic methods, body mass index is not considered to be accurate in many cases, leaving a need for a more accurate and unified diagnostic criteria. Hopefully, with the newfound spotlight on obesity, the overall disease landscape will undergo reformation to tackle the global obesity epidemic.",

Developed by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide was first approved for type 2 diabetes in 2017 as Ozempic, then for obesity in 2021 as Wegovy. It\u2019s far from the first GLP-1 drug to reach the public, but semaglutide has been a game-changer for obesity treatment. It\u2019s been shown to help people lose somewhere between 10% to 15% of their weight in studies, well above the typical success seen with diet and exercise alone and even surpassing the typical results of older GLP-1 drugs.\n\nSemaglutide isn\u2019t the only new kid on the block, though. Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide mimics both GLP-1 and another hunger-related hormone called GIP\u2014a potent combination that has allowed it to dethrone semaglutide. In clinical trials, people on tirzepatide have lost as much as 20% of their baseline weight. There are dozens of other related obesity treatments in the pipeline as well, some of which have made it to human testing and are poised to overshadow even tirzepatide.\n\nThe McGill researchers analyzed data from 26 randomized clinical trials of single-agent GLP-1 drugs, double agonists like tirzepatide, and even triple-agonist drugs like retatrutide, which combines synthetic versions of three hunger-related hormones: GLP-1, GIP, and the glucagon. These trials involved people living with obesity but who did not have type 2 diabetes.\n\nAs expected, they found that today\u2019s approved drugs were generally safe and effective, with tirzepatide faring the best currently (participants lost up to 17% body weight after 72 weeks of therapy). But they also singled out retatrutide as performing even better in a shorter period of time, with participants losing up to 22% of their body weight after only 48 weeks of therapy.\n\n\u201cWe found that, of the 12 GLP-1 [drugs] identified by our search, the greatest mean body weight reduction was reported in randomized controlled trials of retatrutide, tirzepatide, and semaglutide,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper, published Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nRetatrutide is being developed by Eli Lilly, and it\u2019s now currently being tested in phase 3 trials\u2014trials that will reach their conclusion by 2026. And it won\u2019t be the only newcomer arriving in the near-future that could outslug today\u2019s existing drugs.\n\nLast year, for instance, early trial results of the drug amycretin (developed by Novo Nordisk) suggested that it could provide greater weight loss than semaglutide and tirzepatide. Other drug companies are working on their own competitors to Ozempic, such as Boehringer Ingelheim and Zealand Pharma\u2019s dual agonist survodutide. Expectations have gotten so high that Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock actually dropped when it announced that their drug candidate CagriSema (a mix of semaglutide with the experimental drug cagrilintide) only helped people lose 22% weight in a recent trial, rather than the 25% expected.\n\nThese drugs aren\u2019t free of its negatives, of course. They commonly cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting, and have been tied to rare but serious complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Another major concern is their price, with semaglutide and tirzepatide often costing around $1,000 per month without insurance coverage (which often isn\u2019t provided by private and public insurers). That cost and surging demand has fueled a grey and black market for these drugs, with people turning to cheaper, but less safe compounded and counterfeit versions.\n\nSome experts hope that the arrival of more GLP-1 related drugs will help curtail some of these issues, particularly cost and insurance coverage. Whether that actually happens, we\u2019ll have to see. But it\u2019s almost certain that there will be plenty of drugs coming for semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2019s current crown as the best obesity treatments around.",

The regulatory agency also asked Pfizer PFE and GSK GSK to include a new warning on the labels of their respective Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccines. Novo Nordisk NVO expanded its existing collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug development company Valo Health to develop novel treatments for obesity, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nHere's a recap of the week\u2019s most important stories.\n\nFDA Grants Priority Tag to J&J's Nipocalimab BLA\n\nThe FDA granted priority review designation to J&J\u2019s biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval of nipocalimab for antibody-positive patients with gMG, a rare, autoantibody-driven disease. The BLA was based on data from the phase III Vivacity-MG3 study. Nipocalimab is also under review in the EU for the gMG indication and is in mid and late-stage development for several rare autoantibody-driven rare diseases.\n\nJ&J\u2019s MedTech unit is temporarily pausing sales of Varipulse, its pulsed field ablation therapy to treat atrial fibrillation in the United States, as it investigates four reported cases of neurovascular events. The pause on Varipulse procedures began on Jan. 5. The FDA approved the Varipulse platform in November last year.\n\nThe cases were related to an external rollout plan conducted by J&J. The pause does not impact the rollout in outside U.S. markets.\n\nThe FDA granted Fast Track designation to posdinemab, J&J\u2019s phosphorylated tau-directed monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The FDA had granted Fast Track status to J&J\u2019s another candidate, JNJ-2056, anti-tau active immunotherapy for treating preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease in July 2024. Both posdinemab and JNJ-2056 are being developed in phase IIb studies.\n\nJ&J\u2019s phase III MARIPOSA study evaluating a combination of Rybrevant plus Lazcluze for the first-line treatment of certain patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met the final pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall survival. In the study, Rybrevant plus Lazcluze demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in overall survival versus the current standard of care osimertinib. Rybrevant plus Lazcluze is already approved for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC in the United States and EU based on progression-free survival data from the MARIPOSA study.",

            "content": "Potential blockbuster drugs to watch in 2025\n\n29 SHARES\n\nPosted: 10 January 2025 | European Pharmaceutical Review |\n\nEleven drugs are poised to make waves in the pharmaceutical industry in 2025, according to the annual report.\n\nEleven medicines, covering key areas such as gene therapy, as well as drugs for obesity and oncology, are anticipated to attain blockbuster status or be therapeutic game-changers globally within five years to 2030, according to the 2025 edition of the Drugs to Watch \u2122 report.\n\nThese therapies are either newly launched or are set to be marketed in 2025, Clarivate explained.\n\nKey therapeutic trends for 2025\n\nWhile 2024 saw major developments in obesity treatment driven by next-generation GLP-1 therapies, Clarivate remarked that radiopharmaceutical theranostics are \u201credefining\u201d cancer treatment with a \u201csee it and treat it\u201d paradigm. Moreover, gene editing technologies are expected to innovate personalised medicine in 2025, research in the Drugs to Watch report stated.\n\n[The year] 2025 represents a turning point for the life sciences sector as it embraces cutting-edge technologies such as AI and machine learning to enhance drug discovery and development\u201d\n\nOn the regulatory side, the report highlighted the growing impact of regulatory innovation and the industry\u2019s increased use of real-world data (RWD) as a tool to improve regulatory submissions. In addition, evolving regulatory frameworks are putting more emphasis on patient-reported outcomes and health equity, the authors noted.\n\nEPR covered this report in 2023, highlighting promising medicines such as lecanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s and an innovative gene therapy to treat haemophilia A. These treatments both achieved major developmental milestones in 2023.\n\n\u201cLast year [2024], we identified 13 molecules as Drugs to Watch, with 12 already approved and launched and one poised for launch,\u201d Henry Levy, President, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Clarivate reflected.\n\nGoing forward, \u201c2025 represents a turning point for the life sciences sector as it embraces cutting-edge technologies such as AI and machine learning to enhance drug discovery and development. This year\u2019s report captures the dynamic forces at play, including groundbreaking progress in precision oncology, the rise of radiopharmaceuticals, and the growing focus on addressing global health disparities,\u201d Mike Ward, Global Head of Thought Leadership, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Clarivate explained.\n\nDrugs to watch 2025 \u2013 what medicines are included in the report?\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s obesity and diabetes drugs\n\nAWIQLI\u00ae (LAI 287; insulin icodec)\n\nAWIQLI, the first once-weekly, subcutaneous insulin, is marketed in Australia, Canada, the EU, Mainland China, and Japan. The drug provides easier dosing compared to standard daily basil insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In its March 2024 meeting, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended AWIQLI for adults with this condition.\n\nCagriSema (cagrilintide + semaglutide)\n\nAs a next-generation GLP-1 therapy, CagriSema\u2026 will be the first fixed-dose combination of amylin and GLP-1 receptor agonists for [obesity and type 2 diabetes] if approved\u201d\n\nBy combining cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analog, with semaglutide, CagriSema has potential for superior efficacy over semaglutide (OZEMPIC/WEGOVY\u00ae) and tirzepatide (MOUNJARO/ZEPBOUND\u00ae) in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, according to the research.\n\nAs a next-generation GLP-1 therapy, CagriSema provides not only enhanced insulin secretion and appetite reduction, but also slowed glucose absorption and release. The report emphasised that the drug will be the first fixed-dose combination of amylin and GLP-1 receptor agonists for these diseases if approved.\n\nSchizophrenia and psychosis linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nCOBENFY\u2122 (KarXT; xanomeline-trospium)\n\nCOBENFY represents a key milestone as the first schizophrenia drug in over three decades with a novel mechanism of action\u201d\n\nApproval of Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s COBENFY represents a key milestone as the first schizophrenia drug in over three decades with a novel mechanism of action. The treatment targets an alternative pathway in the brain to traditional dopamine pathways, while minimising cholinergic side effects. The report cautioned that further data is needed to investigate its effectiveness in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related psychosis. However, COBENFY \u201cshows strong commercial potential if proven effective\u201d for these symptoms.\n\nAtopic dermatitis\n\nEBGLYSS\u2122 (lebrikizumab)\n\nEli Lilly and Company and Almirall\u2019s EBGLYSS, could be a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis when topical corticosteroids are inadequate, the report predicted.\n\nAfter DUPIXENT\u00ae (dupilumab) and ADBRY\u00ae/ADTRALZA\u00ae (tralokinumab), EBGLYSS is the third biologic targeting IL-13 for atopic dermatitis, the research stated. Its benefits include \u201cless frequent dosing, more selective IL-13 inhibition, and strong efficacy and safety data position\u201d.\n\nHaemophilia A and B\n\nThe [siRNA] therapy Fitusiran could become the first antithrombin-lowering therapy based on a double-stranded RNA molecule\u201d\n\nThe small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy Fitusiran from Sanofi and Alnylam\u00ae Pharmaceuticals Inc, \u201ccould become the first antithrombin-lowering therapy based on a double-stranded RNA molecule\u201d. For example, it has shown efficacy in Phase III trials for both haemophilia A and B, regardless of inhibitor status, the report noted.\n\nVaccines\n\nGSK-3536819 (MenABCWY)\n\nThe Drugs to Watch report included a first-generation vaccine from GSK. Its formulation targets the five groups of Neisseria meningitidis (A, B, C, W, and Y) responsible for most invasive meningococcal disease cases globally. GSK-3536819 candidate combines the antigenic components of GSK\u2019s licensed meningococcal vaccines, BEXSERO (MenB) and MENVEO (MenACWY).\n\nmRESVIA (mRNA-1345)\n\nFollowing approval by the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2024, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine mRESVIA\u00ae became available for adults aged 60 years old and over. RSV vaccines for this indication, AREXVY and ABRYSVO, are also featured in the Drugs to Watch report this year.\n\nBreast cancer\n\nVepdegestrant (ARV-471)\n\nVepdegestrant, developed though a collobation between Pfizer Inc and Arvinas Inc, could become the first PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC\u00ae) protein degrader on the market. It has potential to overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer, early clinical studies suggest, the report highlighted.\n\nData from the 2025 Drugs to Watch report was generated prior to 31 December 2024, Clarivate confirmed.",

DB\n\nArgos still a drag on Sainsbury\n\nJ Sainsbury (SBRY) was the latest retailer to see its share price fall despite reporting decent trading over the Christmas period.\n\nSales for the supermarket business were up 3.8 per cent for the six weeks to 4 Jan. Both grocery and general merchandise sales did well, and the Argos business was back in positive territory, up 1.1 per cent. However, over the entire third quarter decent grocery sales (up 4.1 per cent) were dragged down by a 1.4 per cent decline at Argos, meaning total retail like-for-like sales came in at 2.8 per cent, below consensus forecasts of 3.3 per cent.\n\nAlthough Sainsbury\u2019s maintained full-year guidance of generating a 7 per cent increase in retail underlying profit of between \u00a31.01bn-\u00a3106bn, the share price slipped by 2 per cent, with investors increasingly cautious about how the sector will contend with rising labour costs in a harsher economic environment. MF\n\nRead more: Where to find bargains (and growth) among struggling retailers\n\nAlliance Pharma approves \u00a3350mn bid Shares in consumer medicines specialist Alliance Pharma (APH) leapt 38 per cent after the company disclosed that it had accepted a bid valuing the company at nearly \u00a3350mn from Aegros Bidco, a vehicle indirectly owned by investment funds DBAY Affiliates and ERES IV. The deal values the shares at 62.5p each in an all-cash transaction. Shareholders who do not want to take up the offer will be given the option of an unlisted alternative by exchanging some or all their shares for loan notes which will ultimately be exchanged for ordinary B shares in the new company. The takeover is essentially in-house as DBY, which has been building a stake in Alliance Pharma for the past two years, was already the largest shareholder in the company with an existing 27 per cent stake. ERES IV stands for Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies IV, a French fund that invests in mid-sized companies in Europe and North America. Alliance Pharma has been battling with its identity over the years, as it seemed wedded to its legacy prescription medicines business. Before the takeover, the market had been expecting an update on its strategy. Broker Peel Hunt described the deal as an \u201cinevitable conclusion\u201d, as \u201cAlliance has seemingly been in the shop window for some time, yet the shares have been stuck\u201d. \u201cWe have, for a while, struggled to see how the company could extract full value from its acquired assets and doubted it could leverage further,\u201d the broker said. JH\n\nGSK shingles treatment gets FDA review\n\nGSK (GSK) announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the regulatory application for Shingrix (GSK's Zoster Vaccine) for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). The key difference is that this will be offered in a pre-filled syringe, which removes the need for mixing separated vials prior to injection.\n\nManagement described this as an important regulatory milestone for GSK's shingles vaccine, which has been approved in the US for the prevention of shingles in adults aged 50 and older since 2017. JH\n\nTeam Internet shares drop as TowerBrook abandons bid Shares at Team Internet Group (TIG) fell nearly 12 per cent this morning after private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners pulled out of the bid process. TowerBrook was one of two suitors vying for the Aim-traded advertising technology company, with each bid valuing TIG at 125p a share, or around \u00a3315mn. Now as the sole bidder, fund manager Verdane has until the end of play on 4 February to make a firm offer or walk away under the \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 takeover rules.

Massive ones.\n\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Trump vowed to slap \u201cvery high\u201d tariffs on Denmark if it doesn\u2019t sell the island to the United States. Greenland is a self-governing entity inside Denmark\u2019s kingdom. (Trump also declined to rule out military force to seize Greenland.)\n\nBroadly speaking, high tariffs on Denmark might not cause significant trouble for American consumers because Denmark is not a huge trading partner with the United States. Danish goods account for less than half of 1% of total US imports.\n\nHowever, the United States did import around $5.7 billion worth of pharmaceutical products from Denmark in 2023, according to the most recent annual United Nations trade data compiled by Trading Economics.\n\nThat figure is likely even higher for 2024 because Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical giant, makes one of the hottest drugs on the market: Ozempic.\n\nAmericans have increasingly turned to Ozempic and its sister drug, Wegovy, which have been approved to fight diabetes and obesity, respectively.\n\nOzempic is so popular that Novo Nordisk\u2019s market value has skyrocketed to almost $300 billion.\n\nIf Trump imposes steep tariffs on Denmark, it could at least temporarily increase the consumer price of the highly sought-after Ozempic and Wegovy, according to trade experts.\n\n\u201cNovo Nordisk retains a sizable monopoly power on the market,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIf Donald Trump decides it\u2019s going to cost 50% more, Novo Nordisk can say, \u2018Fine, we\u2019ll just charge American consumers that much more.\u2019\u201d\n\nEach package of Ozempic costs nearly $1,000, prior to discounts or insurance, according to Novo Nordisk. Wegovy is listed above $1,300 per package.\n\nAlready, the American price is many times higher than the drugs\u2019 prices in other countries. A key focus of Trump\u2019s first term was to close that gap. These tariffs could widen it.\n\n\u2018Trying to get their attention\u2019\n\nExperts say Novo Nordisk could find legal ways to circumnavigate the tariffs, though such moves may not be possible immediately.\n\nIn theory, the incoming Trump administration could exclude Wegovy and Ozempic from potential tariffs.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThere are many uncertainties, including how serious Trump is about buying Greenland or using tariffs to force a deal.\n\n\u201cWith Trump, tariffs are a go-to tool. He is trying to get their attention,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, a former trade official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration who is now a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.\n\nAnd he has gotten their attention. As CNN previously reported, Danish officials fear Trump is much more serious about acquiring Greenland than he was in his first term.\n\nRobots transport packages and goods at the Novo Nordisk A/S pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark, on November 27, 2024. Charlotte de la Fuente/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s also gotten the attention of officials at Novo Nordisk.\n\n\u201cWe will follow the situation closely,\u201d a company spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \u201cThe geopolitical landscape in today\u2019s world is very dynamic, and we remain focused on our commitment to deliver lifesaving medicines to the patients we serve.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk declined to comment on \u201chypotheticals and speculations.\u201d\n\nMost of the active ingredient for Ozempic and Wegovy, called semaglutide, is made in Denmark, according to investment bank BMO Capital Markets.\n\nHowever, Novo Nordisk has facilities that fill the containers and package them around the world, including in the United States. The company been ramping up its US footprint and does make some of the active ingredient in Clayton, North Carolina.\n\nEvan Seigerman, a biotech and pharma equity research managing director at BMO Capital Markets, said it\u2019s hard to know how much consumers would be impacted by US tariffs on Denmark. He said patients who pay out of pocket would be impacted more than insured patients.\n\nThe United States also imports various machinery, medical devices such as hearing aids and other goods from Denmark.\n\nEven just the threat of tariffs can cause stockpiling and increase prices, according to McDaniel, the Mercatus Center fellow.\n\n\u201cIt definitely won\u2019t decrease prices,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nThe injectable weight-loss medication Wegovy is available on April 24, 2024 in Chicago. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nTrade war risk\n\nUS workers could be hurt if Trump\u2019s tariffs on Denmark escalate into a tit-for-tat.\n\nKirkegaard, the Peterson Institute senior fellow, said that the entire European Union would be \u201ccompelled to respond\u201d to the tariffs with levies of its own on products made by Americans at US facilities.\n\nThe United States exported $351 billion of goods to the EU in 2022, the second-largest destination behind Canada, according to federal data.\n\n\u201cThis could spiral into a broader US-EU trade war,\u201d Kirkegaard said.\n\nKirkegaard expressed dismay at Trump\u2019s use of threatened tariffs to get Denmark to sell Greenland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. Denmark is a democracy and a treaty ally of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, Donald Trump is saying, \u2018Nice territory you have got there. I like it. If you don\u2019t sell it to me, bad things will happen to you.\u2019 It\u2019s reminiscent of how Vladimir Putin talked about Ukraine before 2022.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.",

Greenland, a North American island with a population of nearly 60,000, is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Denmark ranks just 41st on the list of top U.S. trading partners, the two countries exchanged over $16 billion worth of goods in 2023. Denmark\u2019s top export into the U.S. is packaged medicine, which makes sense considering it is home to pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.51% ) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is the maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH in 2023. The Danish pharma giant even helped boost the nation\u2019s GDP in 2023 and is expected to have done so again in 2024. The Nordic country\u2019s largest bank, Danske Bank, projects that Denmark\u2019s GDP will grow 2.1% in 2024, driven primarily by Novo Nordisk.\n\nThe popular drugs work by mimicking gut hormones that help regulate blood sugar and curb appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss benefits. According to Morgan Stanley (MS+3.23% ) analysts, the global market for this class of medications could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, the bank projects that around 31.5 million people \u2014 or nearly 10% of the population \u2014 will be using these type of drugs by 2035.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how tariffs on Denmark might affect the price of these medications, which can cost more than $1,000 without insurance, as Novo Nordisk manufactures them at facilities around the world. In June, the company announced it was investing over $4 billion to boost its manufacturing capacity in the U.S.",

Although Lilly\u2019s Zepbound outperformed Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy (20.2% compared with 13.7%, respectively) in a weight-loss head-to-head study last year, UBS analysts believe that the semaglutide drugs enjoy better brand recognition being an early mover in the diabetes and obesity care market space.\n\nAdditionally, Novo Nordisk faced a massive setback last month after it announced poorer-than-expected efficacy data from a late-stage study of its next-generation subcutaneous obesity candidate, CagriSema. Per the data readout from the phase III REDEFINE 1 study, a weight loss of 22.7% was observed in patients treated with CagriSema, which missed NVO\u2019s guidance of 25% weight loss at week 68, provided on the third-quarter earnings conference call.\n\nUBS analysts believe the stock's decline, primarily due to disappointing CagriSema study data, has been overly steep, creating an appealing entry opportunity for potential new investors.\n\nIn the past three months, Novo Nordisk\u2019s shares have plunged 27.1% compared with the industry\u2019s 14% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLilly has witnessed stupendous success with its tirzepatide medicines, Mounjaro for T2D and Zepbound for obesity.

However, both companies have been investing heavily in ramping up production capacity for their respective weight management drugs.\n\nNVO Expands Collaboration Agreement With Valo Health\n\nIn the last press release, Novo Nordisk announced expanding its partnership with Valo, leveraging the latter\u2019s extensive human dataset and AI-driven computational power to discover and develop innovative treatments for obesity, T2D and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe companies initially collaborated in September 2023 under an agreement enabling the development of up to 11 drug programs, primarily targeting cardiovascular disease.

The sales projection was lowered because of the upcoming expiration of patents for Novo Nordisk's drugs in 2031 in Europe and 2032 in the U.S., which they expect will lead to lower sales, along with the recent weak trial results.\n\nNovo Nordisk's Copenhagen-listed shares closed up roughly 2.8% Wednesday, while its U.S.-listed shares recently were up nearly 2% at $84.94.\n\n",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk\u2019s collaboration with artificial intelligence startup Valo Health has focused on developing new drugs for cardiovascular disease. The pharmaceutical giant likes what it\u2019s seen so far, and it\u2019s now committing $190 million to expand the alliance to more cardiometabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe sum announced Wednesday encompasses an upfront payment, equity investment, and a potential near-term payment for a milestone that was not disclosed. The initial agreement inked in 2023 spanned up to 11 cardiovascular disease programs. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Valo received $60 million up front and was in line for as much as $2.7 billion in milestone payments. The alliance now spans 20 programs. Milestone payments in the expanded pact could reach up to $4.6 billion.\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk has established a strong position in metabolic disease with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, marketed as Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for obesity, the pharmaceutical giant has also invested in the R&D of next-generation medicines that could offer better tolerability and perhaps even greater weight loss. One of the company\u2019s top prospects is CagriSema, a combination of semaglutide with cagrilintide. Last month, the once-weekly injection posted statistically significant Phase 3 results. But shares of Novo Nordisk still took a hit as the magnitude of weight loss was below expectations.\n\nNovo Nordisk has turned to business development to build its pipeline of metabolic medicines. These deals bring drug candidates in oral formulations that could expand the field to new targets. Specific targets covered by Novo Nordisk\u2019s agreement with Valo remain undisclosed, but the companies say the collaboration has already led to identification of \u201cseveral novel targets\u201d with the potential to lead to differentiated cardiometabolic drugs. They add that work is underway on multiple small molecule programs in preclinical development.\n\nValo launched in 2020, formed and initially financed by Flagship Pioneering, a firm that forms and invests in new startups based on platform technologies. The AI-driven simulations from its technology, called Opal Computational Platform, predict properties such as the safety and efficacy of a potential drug. Valo takes a human-centric approach to AI, CEO Brian Alexander said in an email. The company analyzes real-world human data to identify novel drug targets. Valo also utilizes human models to rapidly discover and develop small molecules that hit those targets.\n\nOpal is indication agnostic, but Valo has invested significantly in cardiometabolic disease as one of its focus areas, Alexander said. When Valo was preparing to go public in a SPAC merger in 2021, the company said it had 17 programs that spanned cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nValo is not currently disclosing pipeline details. All Alexander would say is that Valo is exploring additional therapeutic area opportunities where the company can leverage Opal and make a significant impact on human health. However, OPL-0401, a diabetic retinopathy drug candidate that was one of its most advanced programs, did not meet primary or secondary endpoints, Valo disclosed on New Year\u2019s Eve. That in-licensed molecule was not produced by Opal. The company said it would suspend the program\u2019s development and focus on leveraging Opal to develop new medicines. That effort includes medicines covered by the expanded Novo Nordisk pact.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\n\u201cOur experience with the Novo Nordisk partnership to date has demonstrated clear evidence of both the platform\u2019s technological capabilities as well as the human-centric approach to data and ways of working internally and with partners to deliver on new medicines in CVM (cardiovascular metabolism), but not limited to CVM,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThis expansion into obesity and type 2 diabetes is validating of that experience.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Liselotte Sabroe/Scanpix Denmark/AFP, via Getty Images",

That collaboration was valued at up to $2.7 billion in milestones, plus R&D funding and potential royalty payments.\n\nIn announcing their expanded partnership, Novo Nordisk and Valo said they had already identified \u201cseveral novel targets that may form the basis of differentiated cardiometabolic drug programs.\u201d The companies added that they were actively working on \u201cmultiple\u201d small molecule preclinical drug discovery programs, without offering details.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the progress we have made together with Valo during the first year of our collaboration, and we are excited to expand the scope to put a stronger focus on obesity and type 2 diabetes in addition to cardiovascular disease,\u201d Marcus Schindler, PhD, Novo Nordisk\u2019s executive vice president and CSO, said in a statement.\n\nThe expanded partnership, as with the original collaboration, will combine Novo Nordisk\u2019s expertise in cardiometabolic diseases, the companies\u2019 joint capabilities in human data and genetics, and Valo\u2019s Opal Computational Platform\u2122, in order to glean insights from human genetic and longitudinal patient data in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cThe partnership fully leverages the Opal Computational Platform by seeking to identify novel therapeutic targets in large real-world patient datasets, validate those targets using human preclinical models, and develop therapeutics against those targets with human-centric AI small molecule design,\u201d stated Brian Alexander, MD, CEO of Valo Health.\n\nOpal is an AI-based combined computational, chemistry, and tissue production platform that collects a combination of exclusive and publicly available patient data for use in developing machine learning models. The data and insights are combined using what Valo says are proprietary methodologies.\n\n\u201cJust getting started\u201d\n\n\u201cData are generated both to advance drug programs and to improve machine learning models, ensuring that the Opal platform increases in quality to enable precise, actionable pathophysiological insights,\u201d Valo states on its website. \u201cThese models help us to predict how and when a disease will progress, if and how a drug will perform before it even touches a person, to select the targets that address diseases, how to design a clinical study based on the data-driven nature of a disease\u2026 and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aim to become the standard technology platform for drug development,\u201d Valo declares.\n\nIn addition to data, Opal integrates wet lab chemistry and Valo\u2019s Biowire technology to provide more effective data generation and simulations. Biowire enables Valo to produce human-relevant tissue in the lab, which according to the company enables it to accurately test drug compounds before clinical trials, providing \u201ccrucial\u201d insight into mechanism and drug response.\n\nUnder the expanded partnership, Novo Nordisk has agreed to pay Valo $190 million upfront, up-to-$4.6 billion in milestones, plus R&D funding and potential royalty payments.\n\n\u201cThis level of investment is a testament to our close partnership in deploying human-centric artificial intelligence to rapidly discover and develop novel cardiovascular and metabolic disease therapeutics,\u201d added Alexander, who is also a CEO-partner with Flagship Pioneering.\n\nFlagship Pioneering is the venture/accelerator giant that founded and initially capitalized Valo in 2019. The following year, Flagship Pioneering formally announced the launch of privately-held Valo, joining with other undisclosed investors to bring the company\u2019s total financing to nearly $100 million.\n\nValo is headquartered in Lexington, MA, with offices in New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nNovo Nordisk, based in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, saw its shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen rise 3% on the news, from DKK 602.80 ($83.20) to DKK 619.50 ($85.50) at the close of trading today.\n\n\u201cWe have already begun to realize the potential of combining the capabilities of Valo and Novo Nordisk to advance multiple AI-powered, human-centric programs, and we believe this partnership will help Novo Nordisk fulfill our ambition to expand the number of new drug programs we bring to the clinic,\u201d Schindler added.",

The partners will be able to work collaboratively on up to 20 drug programs for which milestone payments could reach around $4.6 billion, in addition to R&D funding and potential royalties.\n\nNovo and Valo first entered into their partnership in September 2023. At the time, the obesity leader paid $60 million upfront and pledged up to $2.7 billion for the opportunity to collaborate on 11 cardiometabolic programs. At the center of the collaboration is Valo\u2019s AI-enabled preclinical capabilities, which allow the biotech to identify and validate druggable targets, as well as design and screen potentially therapeutic molecules against these targets.\n\nValo says its preclinical edge comes from its proprietary computational platform Opal, which leverages AI models built using high-quality human data. What the biotech calls its \u201cintegrated approach\u201d to drug discovery and development generates and uses data at every stage of the process\u2014from disease and target discovery through regulatory approval\u2014producing a \u201cself-reinforcing, active learning system\u201d that improves its performance with each experiment, the company says on its website.\n\nValo claims its human-centric data library is \u201cthe largest and densest in the world,\u201d and that models developed using these data can help Valo and its partners predict disease progression \u201cand how a drug will perform before it even touches a person.\u201d\n\nFor Novo, Valo\u2019s approach appears to be working well. Pharma CSO Marcus Schindler said in a statement on Wednesday that the company is \u201cvery pleased with the progress\u201d it has seen under the Valo partnership, leading to its decision to expand the agreement. Since launching in 2023, the collaboration has already identified several novel targets that could potentially serve as bases for \u201cdifferentiated cardiometabolic drug\u201d candidates, according to Wednesday\u2019s news release.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to expand the scope to put a stronger focus on obesity and type 2 diabetes,\u201d Schindler added.\n\nThe expanded Valo partnership is Novo\u2019s latest move in its quest to further entrench itself as a leader in the cardiometabolic space. Last month, the pharma put $186 million down to partner with Photys Therapeutics and potentially unlock a new drug class\u2014the bifunctional small molecules called PHICS, which leverage specific phosphorylation kinases.\n\nA month earlier, in November 2024, Novo linked up with fellow Danish company Ascendis Pharma to develop novel GLP-1 therapies with a lower dosing frequency, pledging $285 million in the deal. In January 2024, Novo signed back-to-back agreements with Flagship biotechs Omega Therapeutics and Cellarity, putting a total of $1 billion on the line.

As a result, there is still an unmet need in this space,\" said David Moller, Chief Scientific Officer at Variant Bio. \"We hope that a deeper understanding of the relationships between genetic variation and metabolic traits will yield novel targets and ultimately lead to better and more diverse treatment options for people around the globe.\"\n\n\"Through our partnership with Variant Bio, we aspire to gain a more complete understanding of the genetic causes of metabolic disease,\" said Bei Zhang, Corporate Vice President of Global Drug Discovery at Novo Nordisk. \"Having conducted over two dozen genomic research projects with diverse populations around the world, Variant Bio is well positioned to carry out genomic research on metabolic disease in places that have not yet been fully studied. We believe that the likelihood of discovering truly novel targets is higher because of the nature of these data. What is more, human genetic evidence should increase our odds of discovering and developing differentiated new therapies for metabolic diseases.\"\n\nThe collaboration leverages Variant Bio's innovative VB-Inference analysis platform to identify novel targets with strong genetic evidence and clear therapeutic hypotheses. VB-Inference maps the molecular mechanisms of disease by integrating whole genomes with deep phenotyping and rich multi-omic data using statistical genetics and machine learning. This mechanistic understanding has the potential to better inform drug discovery compared to genetic association studies alone and is made possible by extensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data. The platform has enabled several new R&D programs within Variant Bio's internal pipeline.\n\n\"We are excited to put our innovative VB-Inference platform to work in an area that impacts so many people globally,\" said Stephane Castel, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Variant Bio. \"Partnering with one of the most experienced metabolic disease drug discovery teams gives us the opportunity to translate our genetic findings into treatments that will have a real world impact.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk will pay Variant Bio an upfront payment and additional near-term R&D funding totaling up to $50 million, plus potential option and milestone payments on targets that arise from the collaboration. Consistent with Variant Bio's long-term benefit-sharing program , this partnership will trigger the distribution of financial benefits to partner communities around the world who contributed their data to genomic research.\n\nThe multi-year target discovery collaboration announced today signals a new chapter of growth for Variant Bio. The strategic partnership with Novo Nordisk demonstrates the value of Variant Bio's potential to enable the development of novel therapeutics based on results from its innovative genomic studies.\n\nAbout Variant Bio\n\nVariant Bio is developing life-saving therapies by studying the genes of people with exceptional health-related traits. By identifying communities with unique genetic architectures and outlier phenotypes, Variant Bio has identified novel human genetic evidence that is the basis for programs with breakthrough potential across multiple therapeutic areas.

            "content": "Novo Nordisk last month filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA asking the federal agency to exclude its type 2 diabetes injection Victoza (liraglutide) from a proposed list of drugs eligible for compounding.\n\nThe petition comes after the industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), which represents FDA-registered compounding pharmacies, nominated liraglutide to the 503B Bulks List, a database of bulk drug substances that can be compounded.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, outsourcing facilities are not allowed to compound bulk drug substances, according to the FDA\u2019s website. The 503B Bulks List enumerates substances that are exempted from this rule and is determined according to criteria such as the clinical need for compounding, supply constraints and safety and efficacy issues with the substance proposed for compounding. As per the regulator\u2019s drug shortages database, liraglutide is \u201ccurrently in shortage.\u201d\n\nIn its petition, Novo argued that there is no clinical need to compound liraglutide. \u201cOFA\u2019s nomination cites vague reasons to compound liraglutide,\u201d the company contended, noting that the trade group \u201crecites general attributes unrelated to liraglutide that may make a drug product medically unsuitable and makes broad, boilerplate statements about strength, inactive ingredients, and routes of administration.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Danish pharma claimed that liraglutide will not lend well to compounding, pointing to \u201cabundant scientific evidence\u201d that even slight tweaks in the manufacturing process \u201ccan substantially affect its chemical and physical stability, as well as its impurity profile.\u201d\n\nCompounded liraglutide also raises safety issues, according to Novo, including immunogenicity risks. In its Citizen Petition, the pharma highlighted the 44 documented cases of adverse events linked to unapproved liraglutide since 2017, of which 38 were classified as serious and one ended in death. Compounding might also compromise the efficacy of liraglutide, according to the pharma.\n\nTaken together, these issues suggest that the risks of allowing unapproved liraglutide into the market \u201cfar outweigh the purported need for these products\u201d to be compounded, the company argued.\n\nNovo made a similar argument in October 2024 for its star GLP-1 therapy semaglutide, which the pharma said is too complex to compound. In regulatory filings at the time, Novo nominated semaglutide to the FDA\u2019s Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding (DDC) list, which names drugs that could pose safety risks to the public if manufactured incorrectly\u2014and therefore are exempted from compounding.\n\nAside from liraglutide, the OFA has also set its sights on Eli Lilly\u2019s blockbuster weight-loss medication tirzepatide, which the FDA in October 2024 formally took off its shortage list. The OFA soon sued the agency, claiming that its decision was \u201carbitrary\u201d and did not have \u201cany semblance of lawful process.\u201d Last month, the FDA doubled down on its decision to end the shortage for tirzepatide, and on January 1 Lilly asked to join the lawsuit between the OFA and the agency.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk has filed another Citizen's Petition with the FDA seeking to block compounding pharmacies in the US from making versions of one of its GLP-1 agonist drugs.\n\nThe latest attempt focuses on liraglutide, an older, once-daily injectable product in Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 agonist franchise sold as Victoza and Xultophy for diabetes and Saxenda for obesity.\n\nWhile Victoza sales are falling as patients switch to newer, once-weekly drugs like semaglutide-based Ozempic and Wegovy \u2013 used for diabetes and obesity \u2013 the once-daily product still made more than $550 million in sales in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nIn its petition, Novo Nordisk says that the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), a trade organisation representing the compounding pharmacy industry, has incorrectly nominated liraglutide on the list of bulk substances with a \"clinical need\" to compound \u2013 for example, if there is a shortage in the marketplace.\n\nSome dosage strengths of both Victoza and Saxenda are included on the FDA's shortages list, mainly due to pressures on Novo Nordisk's production capacity for its entire GLP-1 franchise, but the company insists that this does not satisfy the requirements for compounding.\n\nIt argues that because generics of liraglutide are already available \u2013 specifically, Teva's authorised generic version of the drug, which launched in the middle of last year \u2013 there is \"no liraglutide attribute that must be addressed by compounding.\"\n\nMoreover, Novo Nordisk also claims that it is difficult to manufacture liraglutide and \"even small changes in the manufacturing process of liraglutide can substantially affect its chemical and physical stability, as well as its impurity profile,\" and this means that there could be safety concerns with compounding.\n\n\"The impurity profiles and, in particular, the evidence of fibril formation in the unapproved 'liraglutide' products raise significant immunogenicity risks and pose serious threats to patients' health,\" according to the petition. The formation of fibrils can also result in products with lower strengths than expected or indicated on the label, it says.\n\nNovo Nordisk made a similar case for semaglutide in a petition to the regulator last year, seeking to put the drug on an FDA list of compounds deemed to be difficult to compound, but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nThe new move comes as Eli Lilly has also taken action against compounders making copies of tirzepatide, its GLP-1 and GIP agonist sold as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity in the US.\n\nLilly has filed to lend its support to the FDA in a lawsuit filed against the agency by the OFA and FarmaKeio Custom Compounding, which are challenging a decision to remove tirzepatide from the shortages list and bring an end to compounding of the drug.\n\nAs it stands, pharmacies and outsourcing facilities are required to wind down production of tirzepatide by 18th February and 19th March, respectively.\n\nLilly has also argued that the presence of compounded products in the supply chain makes it harder for patients to ensure they buy a legally produced version, as the market has been flooded with illicit copies.\n\n\"Sometimes these knockoff medicines \u2013 which come from places like China and India \u2013 are sold by entities that cannot even legally sell them in their own countries,\" said Patrik Jonsson, president of Lily USA.",

            "content": "Out with the old and in with the new. Last year ended with one of my most valuable shares plunging 20 per cent in a single day, while a new holding gained 24 per cent in a month. If 2025 continues as it began, it\u2019s going to be interesting.\n\nRegular readers may have guessed that Novo-Nordisk (NOVO), the maker of the weight-loss wonder-drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, was the loser. Disappointing trial data for a new jab hit markets that were priced for perfection, causing Novo to plunge out of my top ten by value, leaving this fan of the pharmaceutical giant feeling queasy.\n\nAmid thin trading immediately before Christmas, reports that its new appetite suppressant, CagriSema, cut flab by only 22.7 per cent, rather than the 25 per cent hoped for, slashed an eye-watering $100 billion off its market weight. Never mind the medical details or the economics, even this fat capitalist lost pounds, but not in a nice way.\n\nFortunately even bad news can contain good lessons for investors. First, the highs and lows of this drug trip demonstrate how risky stock markets are for short-term speculators and why they can still deliver good returns to long-term investors. Second, paper profits are all very well but we haven\u2019t really made a penny until we sell.\n\nFor example, I first paid the equivalent of $36, allowing for a subsequent two-for-one stock split, in February 2021, for American depositary receipts (ADRs), hoping to avoid Scandinavian withholding tax. Then, when that didn\u2019t work, I dumped the ADRs in favour of investing 2 per cent of my life savings in the Stockholm-listed shares at 254 Danish krone in June 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy reasoning, as explained here at those times, was that Novo is the biggest producer in the world of insulin, a hormone used to control diabetes, an illness often associated with obesity. That was \u2014 and is \u2014 my core interest in this charity-controlled business that was founded in 1923, but the shares, which yield negligible dividends, always looked too pricey.\n\nThen rumours of how new weight-loss drugs could reduce a wide variety of illnesses made the shares seem more desirable and less expensive. So I invested on the basis that demand was likely to continue rising because millennia of evolution have equipped us to cope with the occasional scarcity of food but not perpetual plenty.\n\nMore recently, for purely personal reasons, I took profits by selling a substantial five-figure parcel of Novo at DKK 926 last August, as reported here at that time. They had been the second most valuable share among the fifty-odd holdings in the forever fund but that sale cut them to fifth place.\n\nThen the share price nightmare before Christmas reminded me how Mr Market is a manic depressive, prone to swing between excessive exuberance and gloom. So, on the basis that nothing has changed about the underlying need for Novo\u2019s medicines, I invested enough to make this my seventh most valuable holding again, paying DKK 623 for more shares on Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly a third less than I sold them for last August, providing a topical reminder about price volatility and why it makes sense to consider taking profits while they are there to be had. The latter point is perhaps most important for other investors who are sitting on substantial gains after a long bull run (a period of rising prices).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExceptions are more interesting than rules \u2014 and possibly more profitable too. The aircraft manufacturer Boeing (BA) was my winter winner after shares I bought for $139 in November, as reported here, gained altitude to trade at $172 on Friday.\n\nThis is an encouraging start but the longer view contains reasons to be fearful as well as cheerful. I first invested 2 per cent of my life savings in Boeing at $125 in November 2014 on rising demand for quick and convenient international travel.\n\nThen two horrific Boeing 737 Max crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, killed 346 people. Despite originally intending to own these shares for ever, I sold the lot at $410 and $397 in February and March 2019, as reported here at those times.\n\nLast month I discussed how this firm forms half of a global duopoly, alongside Europe\u2019s Airbus (AIR). Unfortunately Boeing also suffered from mismanagement, industrial strife and shoddy workmanship. Despite this, demand remained robust and I reasoned that things could not get much worse.\n\nThen, last Sunday, a Boeing 737-800 crashed in South Korea, killing 179 people. It remains to be seen what the investigation will find, although additional uncertainty reduced the share price 3 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I note that it is 15 years since the ill-fated jet left Boeing\u2019s factory, so it seems late in the day to blame the manufacturer. Some 4,400 other Boeing 737-800s are still in service, representing 15 per cent of the global total of passenger planes, and I have no intention of bailing out.\n\nWhat does all this drama demonstrate? The importance of diversification to diminish risk or, in plain English, not putting all our eggs in one basket. It\u2019s the only certainty for investors in a highly uncertain world, as we chart a course through 2025 and what could prove a very bumpy ride.\n\nWhy green energy boost can give us all a windfall\n\nHogmanay celebrations in Edinburgh and elsewhere were cancelled, ahead of gales forecast to hit on New Year\u2019s Eve, but it\u2019s an ill wind that blows no good. Believe it or not, winter storms spinning Britain\u2019s 11,000 wind turbines briefly meant electricity cost less than nothing last month, according to the National Energy System Operator (Neso).\n\nSupply exceeded demand so much that the wholesale price fell to minus \u00a36.57 per megawatt-hour, apparently. No, I can\u2019t see it in my household energy bills, either.\n\nNothing daunted, Neso, which is responsible for keeping the lights on, reported that wind power produced record electricity output of 22.5 gigawatts last month. Records are likely to be broken next year when the first phase of the world\u2019s biggest wind farm is due to be completed on the Dogger Bank in the North Sea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComing down from the clouds of macroeconomics, renewable energy can also generate good income for investors. Step forward Greencoat UK Wind (UKW), the self-descriptive \u00a32.2 billion investment trust where dividends paid to shareholders equal 7.9 per cent of the price. Better still, these distributions increased an annual average of 8.1 per cent over the past five years, according to the research company Morningstar.\n\nIt is important to be aware that dividends can be cut or cancelled without notice. However, if the present rate of ascent could be sustained, it would double investors\u2019 income in less than nine years.\n\nAgainst all that, rising installation and maintenance costs raise serious questions about how profitable wind power is and whether it can survive without government subsidies. However, this small shareholder in UKW is keen to help increase our output of clean energy and reduce our reliance on foreign dictators for fossil fuels. Happy new year!",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) and AstraZeneca (AZN 1.43%) are among the largest companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Both have generally produced strong financial results in 2024, but one wouldn't know it by looking at their stock market performances. AstraZeneca's shares are down by 2% over the trailing-12-month period, while Novo Nordisk's shares are in the red by 14%.\n\nIt just so happens that these drugmakers have encountered issues in recent months that sank their stock prices, although there is a good chance they will recover and still deliver strong returns to patient investors. But which one is likely to perform better than the other? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Novo Nordisk\n\nNovo Nordisk has been making breakthroughs in diabetes care for about 100 years. The company is still at it. As of August 2024, it had a 33.9% share of the diabetes care market, up from the 33.3% it held a year before. Novo Nordisk also boasted a 55.6% share of the GLP-1 drug space, compared to 54.4% as of August 2023. The company's most famous brands, Wegovy and Ozempic, are both GLP-1s. They have helped Novo Nordisk's financial results grow rapidly in recent years.\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThe weight loss market is projected to grow rapidly through the end of the decade. Few (if any) companies have a more attractive pipeline in this field than Novo Nordisk. True, one of the drugmaker's leading candidates, CagriSema, recently failed to impress investors in a phase 3 study. Upon closer inspection, though, Novo Nordisk's \"disappointing\" late-stage results for CagriSema weren't bad at all.\n\nIn fact, it could be the most effective weight loss treatment yet since it performed better than Wegovy in the trial against which it went head-to-head. CagriSema's 22.7% average weight loss by the end of the 68-week study was also better than what Eli Lilly's Zepbound accomplished in a similar trial. The market reacted the way it did because Novo Nordisk's management had promised a 25% average weight loss, but this miss means little to Novo Nordisk's long-term prospects.\n\nFurther, the company has several exciting candidates in other areas, including rare diseases and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. So, despite its recent dip, Novo Nordisk remains an excellent pharmaceutical stock to buy and hold.\n\nThe case for AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca's strategy is different from Novo Nordisk's. Whereas the latter derives most of its revenue from a few diabetes or obesity drugs, AstraZeneca has a large and diversified pipeline of medicines. The company's products span the field of oncology -- its most important and lucrative -- rare diseases; cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism; respiratory and immunology; and vaccine and immune therapies.\n\nThough the sale of COVID-19 products has somewhat disrupted AstraZeneca's revenue growth in recent years, it has generally been strong.\n\nAZN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nFurther, AstraZeneca has plenty of exciting pipeline candidates. The company is also going after the weight loss area, with several promising candidates, though they are still in the early stages of development. Beyond that, AstraZeneca's pipeline is as diversified as its lineup with 199 programs. With strong financial results and a robust pipeline, why is AstraZeneca's stock not performing well? The company has been the subject of an insurance fraud investigation in China, one of its most important international markets.\n\nAlso, AstraZeneca's president in China, Leon Wang, was recently arrested by Chinese authorities for charges unrelated to the insurance fraud, or so the company believes. While this issue will affect AstraZeneca's sales in China and introduces some uncertainty in its short- to mid-term prospects, if it can get around this headwind, it could deliver excellent returns to long-term investors.\n\nThe verdict\n\nDespite higher quarterly revenue, AstraZeneca's earnings per share are lower.\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nAlso, with Novo Nordisk's high-flying GLP-1 medicines -- and AstraZeneca's potentially lower sales in China in the coming quarters -- Novo Nordisk's revenue could grow faster than AstraZeneca's in the short to mid-term. Finally, Novo Nordisk's recent issue is less damaging to its prospects than AstraZeneca's. For all those reasons, the former looks like a far better buy than the latter right now.",

            "content": "The Danish drug company Novo Nordisk provided hundreds of thousands of pounds\u2019 worth of sponsorship to pharmacies including Boots and Lloyds as it sought to boost sales of its slimming drugs in Britain, the Observer can reveal.\n\nThe maker of Wegovy and Saxenda weight-loss injections gave money for Google ads to promote weight-loss services, staff training, and the creation of patient information content. In exchange it received detailed reports about website traffic, advertising hit rates and prescription numbers.\n\nThe company also struck up sponsorship deals with online pharmacies that in some cases went on to promote its products illegally \u2013 including giving \u00a330,000 to a firm later found to have broken rules banning the advertising of prescription-only medicines.\n\nNovo Nordisk said the sponsorships were for legitimate purposes and complied with industry standards. But the deals have been condemned by critics, one of whom said they were a \u201cmassive conflict of interest\u201d and raised concerns about the influence of the company over businesses that prescribe its products.\n\nDr Margaret McCartney, a GP and senior lecturer at the University of St Andrews who researches conflicts of interest in healthcare, said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that pharmaceutical companies were sponsoring pharmacies, and that it was particularly concerning that some of the money was for marketing.\n\nShe said the cases raised concerns about the effectiveness of the current regulatory regime, which relies on members of the public making complaints. She said professionals also needed to \u201ctake some responsibility\u201d. \u201cIf a drug company is offering you large sums of money to set up or run a service to prescribe their products, that is obviously a massive conflict of interest,\u201d she said.\n\nThe financial links between the clinics and Novo Nordisk \u2013 \u00adunreported until now \u2013 were \u00aduncovered through analysis of pharmaceutical industry payments and a ruling by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA). The analysis reveals that, between 2021 and 2023, Novo Nordisk provided sponsorship to several prominent pharmacy chains to \u201cdevelop and market their weight-loss services\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen An instructional video posted by Boots on YouTube. It said the video was provided by Novo Nordisk and not part of any sponsorship deal. Photograph: YouTube\n\nIn 2022 it signed a \u00a395,000 deal with Boots to fund internal training for store-based pharmacists about adult weight management and the provision of general weight-loss information on the Boots Health Hub page, as well as money for advertising the Boots Online Doctor weight-loss service. Two other pharmacy chains were given free needles, sharps bins, travel wallets and funding for the creation of marketing and patient information materials, including money to one company for a commercial photoshoot.\n\nIn exchange for the sponsorship, the pharmacies were each required to provide reports to Novo Nordisk including details such as web traffic, conversion and success rates from adverts, the number of people beginning prescriptions for its weight-loss drug Saxenda, the number of pens prescribed, and patients\u2019 geographical location.\n\nIn October, the PMCPA issued a ruling following a complaint from a healthcare professional that Novo\u2019s sponsorship of two pharmacy chains that received free needles amounted to an inducement to prescribe. It said it had \u201cbroad concerns\u201d about the arrangements, adding that the requirement for each pharmacy to provide the company with detailed reports meant the deals with Novo Nordisk were not at arm\u2019s length \u2013 which is what is required under the pharmaceutical industry code.\n\nIt subsequently upheld four breaches against Novo Nordisk of the 2021 industry code, including that it had brought discredit upon the sector and failed to uphold high standards. While it said it was concerned about marketing of prescription-only drugs, it did not uphold a complaint that money had been given to the pharmacies to \u201caggressively\u201d market weight-loss drugs, nor find that Novo Nordisk was responsible for Google listings by the pharmacies.\n\nBoots said the breaches identified by the PMCPA did not relate to it but the other two companies which are unnamed in the watchdog report. A Boots spokesperson said funding for the provision of \u201cfactual and balanced\u201d information was beneficial for patients and that all of its advertising complied with the rules. Lloyds Pharmacy, which received \u00a3246,303 worth of sponsorship from Novo Nordisk between 2021 and 2023, went into liquidation owing \u00a3293m in January 2024. Its former owner, Hallo Healthcare, declined to comment.\n\nAnalysis of data from the industry\u2019s own Disclosure UK initiative also reveals Novo Nordisk signed several sponsorship deals with lesser-known online clinics, which in some cases went on to promote its products illegally. Disclosures reveal it gave \u00a330,000 in sponsorship to the Slimming Clinic, which describes itself as an online medical weight-loss clinic prescribing Novo Nordisk products including Wegovy and Saxenda.\n\nLate last year the company was reprimanded by the medicines regulator after breaking rules on advertising pharmaceutical products. The MHRA said it had been found advertising weight-loss drugs including Wegovy to the public, in breach of rules banning the promotion of prescription-only drugs.\n\nSince then, it has continued posting promotions for weight-loss treatments \u2013 albeit not using product brand names. Posts that remained on the Slimming Clinic\u2019s Instagram page as of November 2024 included a picture of a woman next to a weight loss injection pen with the words: \u201cThere are so many benefits I\u2019m experiencing since losing weight.\u201d Another showed a photo of a grinning doctor holding a weight loss pen to the camera. The Slimming Clinic did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nView image in fullscreen A post from WebMed pharmacy, one of the companies that has received sponsorship from Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn another case, the Danish drug giant paid \u00a350,000 to WebMed pharmacy, which at the time had about \u00a3100,000 of assets. Disclosure UK entries show the money was received in 2022.\n\nIn early 2023, WebMed posted several times on Instagram promoting Saxenda by name. The posts included a video of a woman squeezing fat on her stomach alongside a caption inviting people to get in touch to \u201chear more about Saxenda and our new weight management programme due for imminent release\u201d. Another more recent post includes a picture of a woman alongside a box of Wegovy with the words: \u201cAre you ready to try a NEW approach \u2026\u201d. The posts appear to breach the ban on advertising prescription-only medicines. WebMed did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThere is no suggestion that Novo Nordisk was aware of, or is legally responsible for, the posts, which remained online last week. The firm said it monitored marketing and reported companies breaking rules even if it had a relationship with them. It said sponsorship deals with WebMed and the Slimming Clinic were to develop patient support materials, not for marketing, and that it \u201cnever \u00adcondones the promotion of prescription-only medicines to the public in the UK\u201d.\n\nBut the cases raise wider questions about systemic issues in the advertising of prescription-only weight-loss drugs. In December a Guardian analysis of rulings by the medicines regulator found that 46 companies \u2013 mostly online pharmacies and slimming clinics \u2013 had been reprimanded between January 2023 and September 2024 after breaking rules promoting prescription-only weight-loss treatments such as Wegovy.\n\nDavid Rowland, from the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, said social media advertising of these \u201chighly profitable, highly desirable lifestyle drugs\u201d posed a \u201cmassive challenge\u201d for the UK\u2019s regulatory regime. \u201cIt is essentially toothless in the current landscape, which is increasingly starting to resemble the wild west,\u201d he said. Novo Nordisk, which has previously faced scrutiny over its payments to healthcare professionals that went on to promote its products, also said the pharmacy sponsorships flagged by the Observer were \u201cprovided for legitimate purposes\u201d.\n\nIt said its practices aligned with industry standards and that its contracts with pharmacy partners stipulate they will comply with all laws.\n\nA spokesperson added that issues highlighted in the PMCPA ruling had now been addressed: \u201cWhere required, we took immediate steps to address the issues identified to ensure compliance with industry regulations.\u201d\n\nAn Observer investigation in 2023 found the company poured \u00a321.7m into the UK health sector as it sought to promote its weight-loss drugs, including paying experts who went on to praise Wegovy without always making clear their links to the firm. The company said it had \u201cnever deliberately acted\u201d outside legal or ethical standards.\n\nThat same year, the company apologised after being found in breach of pharmaceutical industry code over a \u201cdisguised promotional campaign\u201d of another of its weight-loss drugs, via online webinars for healthcare professionals.",

            "content": "In a market driven by innovation, it\u2019s counterintuitive to see a company with a less effective product outperform its competitors\u2014unless, of course, the answer lies in marketing.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy continue to outpace Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound, even though the latter are demonstrably more effective in clinical trials. The most recent earnings reports highlight this stark contrast: Novo reported $2.54 billion in sales last quarter for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, significantly exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.21 billion. In contrast, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound fell short, generating $1.26 billion in sales compared to the $1.69 billion analysts had expected.\n\nLilly attributed its earnings miss to high manufacturing costs and fluctuating inventory levels amid surging demand for its anti-obesity treatments. But Novo faces similar challenges, and despite grappling with supply constraints and production capacity issues, it not only met but exceeded sales expectations. Novo\u2019s edge is clear: it has mastered the art of making its products unforgettable.\n\nAs marketing consultants at the New England Consulting Group, we have a deep history in the weight-loss space and advise clients in the consumer weight-loss category. We\u2019ve seen one truth emerge repeatedly over decades: the best product doesn\u2019t always win; rather, it\u2019s the best-marketed one that often dominates.\n\nMarketing Over Metrics\n\nOne critical factor shaping Novo\u2019s dominance is the interplay between DTC advertising and physician prescribing behavior. While prescribing decisions are rarely driven by advertising alone, DTC campaigns like \u201cOh, Oh, Oh, Ozempic!\u201d are designed to resonate with consumers, and they influence the conversations patients have with their healthcare providers. For instance, a patient who has seen Ozempic advertisements may request the drug by name. Since Ozempic is primarily indicated for diabetes, physicians often pivot to prescribing Wegovy\u2014which has the same active ingredient, semaglutide, and is approved for weight loss. In this way, DTC advertising can act as a catalyst for dialogue, introducing brand familiarity and sparking patient interest, while clinical judgment ultimately guides the final decision.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, Lilly should be leading the GLP-1 category. The company recently released results from the SURMOUNT-5 trial, which demonstrated that tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, outperforms Novo\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy. Patients on tirzepatide lost an average of 20.2% of their body weight after 72 weeks, compared to 13.7% on a semaglutide product.\n\nSimilarly, in diabetes, tirzepatide has shown superior efficacy in reducing A1C levels, a measure of average blood sugar over three months. In the Phase 3 SURPASS-2 study, Mounjaro reduced A1C by 2% to 2.3% across its doses, compared to a 1.9% reduction for semaglutide at its 1 mg dose. A subsequent meta-analysis further reinforced these findings, showing that all doses of tirzepatide lowered A1C more effectively than semaglutide, with the highest dose of tirzepatide reducing A1C by 2% compared to 1.62% for semaglutide at its highest dose.\n\nSome argue that Novo\u2019s success stems from being a first mover in the GLP-1 market. However, this overlooks the history of earlier GLP-1 receptor agonists like Byetta and Bydureon, which were approved in 2005 and 2012, respectively\u2014years before Novo introduced Ozempic. While these drugs were originally approved for diabetes management, they also demonstrated significant weight loss. Novo itself entered the weight management space in 2014 with Saxenda, a GLP-1 drug that led to an average loss of 9.2% of initial body weight. In other words, the success of Ozempic and Wegovy lies not in their timing but in Novo\u2019s ability to elevate these products through a sophisticated and consistent marketing strategy.\n\nConsider this: If you\u2019ve seen a pharmaceutical ad recently, chances are you can hum along to the chorus of \u201cOh, Oh, Oh, Ozempic!\u201d or recall the empowering imagery in the Wegovy \u201cDiscover the Power\u201d campaign, featuring a reimagined version of The Greatest Showman\u2019s \u201cThis Is Me.\u201d These ads don\u2019t just inform\u2014they create emotional connections that stick. With nearly two billion ad impressions in June 2024 alone and an estimated $42 million media spend for Wegovy\u2019s latest campaign, Novo\u2019s advertising strategy is built to dominate both attention and consumer mindshare.\n\nNovo\u2019s ads consistently celebrate personal transformation, embedding the brand into cultural conversations and making its products feel relatable and empowering. For many consumers, Novo\u2019s brands are synonymous with GLP-1s or with weight loss drugs more broadly, a testament to the power of marketing that connects emotionally with its audience.\n\nBy contrast, while Lilly has made strides with its advertising, such as its Oscars \u201cBig Night\u201d ad for Mounjaro addressing accessibility and stigma, these efforts have been more sporadic. Additionally, the Oscars campaign dissuaded a large percentage of potential users (\u201cvanity\u201d users as Lilly calls them) from using the drug, saying, \u201csome people have been using medicine never meant for them. For the smaller dress or tux, for a big night, for vanity.\u201d The impact of Lilly\u2019s messaging hasn\u2019t matched the cultural resonance of Novo\u2019s campaigns. As a result, names like Ozempic and Wegovy are far more entrenched in public consciousness than Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nStriking the Right Tone\n\nWhile marketing has been pivotal, Novo\u2019s success isn\u2019t just about storytelling\u2014it\u2019s about execution.\n\nConsider the \u201cShame\u201d ads that Lilly has run this year, tackling serious themes like the societal perceptions around weight loss. While well-intentioned, the ads were dark and somber, emphasizing challenges like stigma and the complex emotions tied to dieting. They highlighted everything consumers might dread about starting a weight loss journey, inadvertently creating a negative association with the brand.\n\nIn contrast, Novo\u2019s ads for Wegovy and Ozempic were upbeat, aspirational and rooted in personal transformation. With empowering music, relatable characters and an emphasis on hope, Novo painted a picture of possibility. The ads didn\u2019t dwell on the struggles of dieting; instead, they invited consumers to see the outcome: a healthier, more confident version of themselves.\n\nBoth Novo and Lilly created exceptionally effective drugs, but only Novo has managed to translate that into an inviting and memorable brand experience. Ads that resonate emotionally and inspire action are far more effective than those that unintentionally amplify the difficulties of the journey.\n\nFurthermore, Novo\u2019s proactive investment in manufacturing capacity ensured that it maintained trust with prescribers and patients. The company\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises\u2014both in product availability and brand consistency\u2014has further solidified its position in the market.\n\nLessons for the Industry\n\nThe Novo vs. Lilly dynamic highlights an essential truth: Marketing isn\u2019t merely a complement to innovation but a critical driver of commercial success. Companies that focus exclusively on clinical data risk being outperformed by competitors who know how to connect with consumers on a deeper level.\n\nLilly\u2019s position underscores the importance of consistent and pervasive marketing. While its products are demonstrably more effective, its messaging hasn\u2019t resonated as broadly. Even well-received campaigns, such as the Mounjaro Oscars ad, haven\u2019t been enough to close the gap left by Novo\u2019s relentless focus on cultural relevance and emotional storytelling. Novo\u2019s success is a case study in how strategic, memorable marketing\u2014paired with strong execution\u2014can elevate a brand above even clinically superior competitors.\n\nThe challenge is clear: Make sure your marketing is as effective as your product, or risk remaining in the shadows of a competitor with a catchier tune.",

            "content": "Using data from the STEP 1 and STEP 2 phase 3 trials, we found broad effects from subcutaneous semaglutide treatment in people with overweight or obesity (with and without T2D) on the circulating proteome compared with placebo. By comparing our data with real-world genetics and proteomics, we have shown that the abundance of many of the top-ranked proteins changed by semaglutide are implicated across a range of biological processes underlying BMI and T2D, from body weight regulation to glycemic control, to lipid metabolism, inflammatory pathways, immune function, adipose tissue function and several other obesity-related complications. A proteomic signature was identified that robustly predicted semaglutide treatment status. Moreover, our data suggest that semaglutide might lower CVD risk, even in populations without established CVD. In addition, although Mendelian randomization evidence generated using summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in this analysis shows that some effects of semaglutide treatment on the proteome may be mediated through body weight reduction and reduced T2D liability, analyses of the clinical trial data also support effects of semaglutide beyond those that can be explained by the observed weight loss and HbA 1c reductions.\n\nTaken together, these clinical trial data of semaglutide pharmacotherapy for body weight reduction showcase the broad opportunities afforded by proteomic analyses, including offering insights into mechanisms of action and potential novel indications to be tested in clinical studies. Our findings also provide data supporting drug repurposing. Taking the impact of semaglutide on the whole proteome and comparing it with protein signatures identified with individual diseases from the deCODE analysis, we find that semaglutide might have a favorable impact on a variety of diseases and processes. For example, in both STEP 1 and STEP 2, semaglutide lowered proteins that are upregulated in fibromyalgia, hypertension, substance use disorders, neuropathic pain and depression, and increased proteins that are downregulated in these conditions. However, in patients without T2D (STEP 1), semaglutide also lowered proteins that are upregulated in osteoarthritis, psoriasis, asthma, breast cancer and reduced ejection fraction, and increased proteins that are downregulated in these conditions. A full comparison with deCODE is detailed in Supplementary Tables 11 and 12. As such, proteomic data from STEP 1 and STEP 2 provide insight into potential novel indications for semaglutide. However, such observations need to be considered as hypothesis generating, requiring testing in preclinical and clinical studies that confirm efficacy and ensure safety. For example, potential effects on alcohol dependency are supported by a recent real-world population propensity-score-matched study of 83,825 patients with obesity, which showed that semaglutide, compared with other non-GLP-1-based obesity medications, was associated with a 50% lower risk for incident and recurrent alcohol use disorders over a 12-month period regardless of T2D status24. These findings were replicated in a population of 598,803 patients with T2D24 and support the design of a clinical trial of semaglutide for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the top upregulated proteins following semaglutide treatment in STEP 1 and 2 (including in the weight-adjusted analysis) were related to digestive enzymes and the exocrine pancreas. It is well established that multiple GLP-1RA treatments increase levels of blood pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase) as measured by laboratory assay, including in the STEP 1 trial20. Such increases rarely exceed the upper normal limit and are reversible after treatment discontinuation25. In the LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) trial evaluating liraglutide (a GLP-1 analog), the observed mild elevations in pancreatic enzyme were not predictive of subsequent acute pancreatitis26. In addition, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that GLP-1RA treatment in people with T2D was not associated with increased risk of pancreatitis27,28 or pancreatic cancer28,29.\n\nWhile there was high concordance in the impact of semaglutide on the measured proteome between STEP 1 and 2, there were also some differences. Some proteins were regulated by semaglutide only in STEP 2 (Supplementary Table 8), while other proteins were regulated by semaglutide only in STEP 1. However, it is difficult to ascertain whether this was due to specific biology or the lack of statistical power after adjustment for multiplicity in STEP 2 due to a smaller sample size. Hence, we elected to list only the proteins that were regulated by semaglutide in STEP 2 but not STEP 1. Some of the differences might contribute to the variance in weight loss observed between patients without and with T2D (STEP 1 versus STEP 2). For example, metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was upregulated by semaglutide in STEP 2 but not STEP 1. Absence of TIMP4 ameliorated high-fat-diet-induced obesity in mice30. Polymorphisms in TIMP4 were also associated with weight loss responses to lifestyle behavioral interventions31. However, those differences need to be interpreted with caution considering the contrast in study populations and number, as well as the lower weight loss in STEP 2.\n\nWe used real-world omics from the deCODE study to gain a better understanding about the effects of semaglutide on other disease processes other than obesity. We used deCODE because it is the most contemporary and comprehensive resource of proteomic signatures of disease and health, and is a well-characterized cohort that has been extensively phenotyped and has contemporary proteomics data from the same platform used in our current study (albeit a previous version). Comparisons with proteomic profiles identified in the deCODE cohort (an observational cohort of 35,559 Icelanders23) allowed us to examine where semaglutide treatment might have benefits and assess its potential impact on a wide range of conditions, including CVD (atherosclerotic myocardial infarction and reduced ejection fraction on an echocardiogram); metabolic, inflammatory and mental health conditions; and cancer. Consistent with this, semaglutide treatment favorably reduced the cardiovascular disease 2 (CVD2) risk score calculated using a 27-protein proteomic model22. Although our analyses show that many of the proteomic perturbations resulting from semaglutide treatment are linked to changes in body weight and glycemia, the lack of a dose response on CVD risk with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.4 mg in STEP 2 supports semaglutide effects on CVD beyond weight loss. Furthermore, a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial presented at the European Congress of Obesity 2024 revealed that the magnitude of this treatment effect with semaglutide was independent of the extent of achieved weight loss32. In our analyses, after adjusting for weight loss, approximately 90% of the initially statistically significant markers were no longer significant, suggesting that the remaining 10% of markers are not changed as a consequence of weight loss; however, additional investigation is warranted. We have provided a comprehensive list of changes in the measured proteome, which can be accessed and used in further analyses should comparable data become available.\n\nSeveral GLP-1RAs, including semaglutide, have been shown to offer cardiovascular outcome benefit in people with T2D33,34,35. These benefits are now also evident in people with obesity at high CVD risk (or with known vascular disease) but without T2D, as shown by the favorable effects of semaglutide in the Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) clinical trial36. In our current analysis of the STEP 1 data, we found evidence that semaglutide might lower CVD risk even in populations not enriched for multiple CVD risk factors or with established CVD (primary prevention). Specific proteins reported to be upregulated in CVD (but downregulated with semaglutide treatment, after adjusting for effects of weight loss and HbA 1c reduction) include NPPB (NT-proBNP, released from cardiomyocytes on ventricular distension)37, ANGPT2 (involved in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis)38, CD93 (involved in cardiovascular homeostasis)39, MSR1 (involved in lipid metabolism and immune function)40,41, and THBS2 and TNC (both involved in extracellular matrix remodeling)42. Previous results indicate that TNC is downregulated by GLP-1RA treatment and correlates with incident CVD43, suggesting that TNC may act as a mediator, with downregulation contributing to the cardiovascular-protective effects of GLP-1RAs. This hypothesis will be tested using proteomic data from the SELECT trial36 for the six cardiovascular proteins listed above that were downregulated by semaglutide in STEP 1. Likewise, the favorable impact of semaglutide on inflammatory markers such as CRP and NT-proBNP levels might provide further insight into the potential benefit of semaglutide in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This has been evaluated in the STEP-HFpEF (people with obesity and HFpEF without diabetes) and STEP-HFpEF DM (people with obesity and HFpEF with T2D) trials44. Indeed, data from STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials have shown a significant reduction in inflammatory markers such as CRP with semaglutide compared with placebo45,46. Despite the differences in study populations, our findings offer additional insight to support published studies that report favorable effects with semaglutide on CV outcomes.\n\nThe proteomic signature of semaglutide could possibly serve to assess intentional and nonintentional nonadherence with prescribed treatment, especially in those with modest weight loss47. It has been shown previously that 14% weight loss due to a very-low-energy diet (VLED) resulted in counter-regulatory changes in appetite-regulating hormones, including a significant increase in fasting levels of ghrelin and significant reductions in the fasting levels of leptin, GLP-1, peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK) and amylin48. During 1 year of follow-up after the end of the VLED intervention, the direction of these changes remained, but only the increase in ghrelin levels and reduction in fasting PYY levels were significant. Unlike the VLED, semaglutide did not appear to downregulate levels of satiety hormones such as PYY and amylin, and upregulated CCK levels. Semaglutide is known to improve satiety and reduce cravings for savory food, as well as improve the control of eating49, resulting in sustained weight loss over 104 weeks50. These actions are thought to be primarily mediated through central brain populations of GLP-1 receptors; for example, in the hypothalamus, semaglutide affects the pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (POMC/CART) and neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related protein (NPY/AGRP) neurons known to suppress appetite and stimulate food intake, respectively51,52,53. Such changes in appetite-regulating hormones might have contributed to the sustained weight loss and changes in the control of eating questionnaire responses observed in STEP 5 over a 2-year period49,50. The findings we report here suggest an additional impact of long-term semaglutide treatment in preventing some of the counter-regulatory (adaptive) changes in gut-hormone secretion conducive to weight regain following low-calorie dieting. These findings need to be interpreted with caution, as conditions were not optimized to capture meal-induced changes. Overall, many of the proteomic changes observed with semaglutide treatment overlap with findings following gastric bypass surgery (GBS)54. This is expected given that weight change has a marked effect on the circulating proteome and durable increases in postprandial GLP-1 levels are thought to favorably contribute to both weight and metabolic outcomes after GBS55. However, it is important to highlight that the GBS study used an older version of the SomaScan\u00ae assay that included a smaller number of proteomic markers (1,297), and that the comparison used 2 year post-GBS data versus the 1-year follow-up data in the STEP trials. We confirmed that four CV proteins (NPPB, CD93, MSR1 and TNC) were not changed following GBS, thereby suggesting that these effects are unique to semaglutide. In addition, some of the proteomic changes after GBS were not observed following semaglutide treatment. For example, contactin-4 (CNTN4) was upregulated after GBS but not semaglutide. CNTN4 has been described as a risk factor for alcohol use56, and increased alcohol use disorder has been widely reported after GBS57. On the other hand, real-world data suggest that semaglutide use in obesity is associated with reduction in alcohol use disorders24.\n\nIn addition to the effects beyond weight loss of semaglutide on proteins related to CVD (as discussed above), other significantly regulated proteins in this analysis have previously been implicated in other conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (TNC58, granulin59,60), T2D (sFRP4 (refs. 61,62)) and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (LFABP63).\n\nThis study has several strengths. We used fasting samples from well-characterized populations from two large phase 3 randomized controlled trials. With a high retention rate and inclusion of participants with and without T2D, we could explore the potential effects of semaglutide on reduction in CVD risk, either linked to or beyond weight loss and HbA 1c , as well as potential novel indications that might help direct drug repurposing. Our study also has limitations. First, samples were collected only at baseline and the end of treatment for proteomic analyses. As a result, we did not have samples at early timepoints to compare the impact of semaglutide on the proteome during the weight loss and weight maintenance phases of treatment, nor in response to meal stimulation. Second, the methodology used for studying relative concentrations of protein-binding aptamers is semiquantitative; hence, we are not able to comment on absolute concentrations of proteins. Third, several of the differentially expressed proteins identified in our study have also been associated with BMI in a previously published observational study using the Olink affinity-based assay64, which supports our findings. In addition, while the NPPB SomaScan\u00ae aptamer has been shown to correlate with the NPPB immunoassay measurement65, we did not perform technical validation of individual markers. Therefore, we acknowledge the absence of paired data from the two different assays as a limitation of this study. To help overcome this limitation, our work focused on integrating data from multiple sources, including genetics, as well as complex signatures rather than individual proteins. For example, Mendelian randomization analysis using genetic instrumental variables was used to help validate some of the derived proteomic signatures for specific traits. Replication of the presented findings was also not performed. Lastly, a comparison of semaglutide-induced weight loss versus diet-induced proteomic changes would be highly valuable for this study; however, to our knowledge, such a dataset is not currently available.\n\nIn conclusion, we leveraged STEP 1 and STEP 2 clinical trial data to implicate semaglutide treatment in broad effects across the circulating proteome in people with obesity, with and without T2D. The observed effects highlight biological processes related to body weight regulation, glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. The proteomic perturbations observed with semaglutide treatment support favorable effects on a range of disease processes including CVD (as examined in the SELECT trial36). By triangulating with real-world evidence and Mendelian randomization analyses of GWAS summary data, the findings of this study collectively showcase the potential of randomized trial proteomic data for unraveling pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms of action and identifying novel indications.",

The Morningstar Europe NR index declined by a small 0.4%, but with differences between markets: Italy and France advanced by 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, while the UK market lost 2.1%. By country, Denmark was the hardest hit, losing a significant 11.1%.\n\nThe share price of Novo Nordisk NOVO B, which fell 17.6% in December after disappointing anti-obesity drug data, is the cause for the decline.\n\nThe slump in the Danish pharmaceutical giant, which is the European stock with the biggest market capitalization, was largely responsible for the Large Growth style losing 1.0% in December, compared with a rise of 0.9% for the Large Value style. It also explains why the healthcare sector was one of the worst sectors, down 3.7%.\n\nAnother large-cap growth company that had a very negative December was Spain\u2019s Inditex ITX, which lost 4.9%.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news in December for the growth segment. Technology companies SAP SE SAP and ASML Holding ASML managed to regain 5.1% and 3.1%, respectively, but one of the biggest risers within growth companies was French luxury company Hermes International SA RMS which gained a significant 12.5% last month.\n\nGerman Carmakers Recovered in December\n\nOn the Large Value side, December was the month of recovery for German automakers. BMW BMW and Volkswagen VOW were up 12.8% and 10.3%, respectively. It was also a good month for some of the big European banks such as HSBC Holdings HSBA, while Italian entities Intesa Sanpaolo ISP and UniCredit UCG each gained 6.5% and 5.9%, respectively.\n\nWithin this segment of the European market, some companies posted notable losses such as the two large London-listed basic materials companies, Rio Tinto RIO and Glencore GLEN, which gave up 3.8% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nA Positive Year for Growth Stocks\n\n2024 highlights the large difference in performance between European value and growth companies. The Large Growth style, for example, gained 26.8% compared to a 12.0% rise for the Large Value style.\n\nThe only segment of our European Style Box to finish negative was Small Value, which ended the year down 0.8%.\n\nCyclical Consumption on the Rise and Real Estate on the Fall\n\nAt the sector level, the consumer cyclical sector, dominated by automakers and luxury companies, stood out in December with a 4.5% gain, followed by the technology sector, which posted a 4% gain.\n\nHowever, if we look at the returns for the year as a whole, it was the financial sector that appreciated the most with a rise of 30.0%.\n\nOn the opposite side, not only did the healthcare sector perform poorly in December (due to Novo Nordisk), with a fall of 3.7%, but the real estate sector declined also, losing 4.7% over the same period. This sector was one of the two that ended the year in negative territory (-0.6%). The other was the energy sector, which lost 1.2%.\n\nLarge Value Remains Undervalued, While Technology is Overvalued\n\nIn terms of valuations, the Large Value segment ended the year with a Price/Fair Value of 0.84, which means it is undervalued by 16%. In contrast, the Large Growth segment trades at a premium of 13%.\n\nBy sector, the only European sector to show an overvaluation is the technology sector, which trades at a 6% premium. At the end of December, the cheapest sectors were the communications sector (Price/Fair Value of 0.79) and real estate (Price/Fair Value of 0.80).\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Drugs targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) demonstrated remarkable success in 2023, with approved products generating sales of $37.2 billion. Currently, there are 323 active GLP-1R agonists in the pipeline, with several estimated to deliver significant returns upon launch. While mega-cap companies dominate the GLP-1RA market and are expected to maintain their stronghold in 2030, three smaller biotechs \u2013 Viking Therapeutics, Altimmune, and Structure Therapeutics \u2013 are emerging as potential disrupters in this drug category, giving hope to innovative newcomers.\n\nThe popularity of GLP-1RA has exploded in recent years. Key drugs in this category include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic (semaglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide), and Eli Lilly\u2019s Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide). Due to their ability to effectively treat metabolic-related disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the 11 approved GLP-1RAs generated sales of $37.2bn in 2023 with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dominating the space, accounting for 99% of sales in 2023.\n\nThe success of these pharma giants has sparked significant interest in this sector. There are now more than 300 GLP-1RAs in an active stage of development, striving for their first approval. The market outlook for these products is equally promising, as GlobalData estimates that a number of these pipeline GLP-1RAs will ultimately launch in 2030, subsequently generating sales of $48.5 billion.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are expected to continue their dominance of the GLP-1RA space up to 2032. However, several smaller companies are also developing GLP-1RAs and positioning themselves to enter this market, disrupt the landscape and generate their fair share of returns (Figure 1). The emergence of these newcomers is set to reduce the GLP-1RA monopolisation by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, with the pharma giants forecast to only capture 78% ($37.6bn) of 2030 sales.\n\nBased on their market capitalisation, Viking Therapeutics ($5.2bn), Structure Therapeutics ($1.8bn) and Altimmune ($642m) are small- to mid-cap companies that are significantly dwarfed by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. All three US-based companies have no approved products to date. However, by 2030, GlobalData forecasts them to be ranked among the top 10 companies by GLP-1R sales.\n\nViking Therapeutics is expected to lead this group with its dual GLP-1RA/gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIP-R) agonist, VK-2735, which is in Phase II for obesity with an oral route of administration. Estimated to launch in 2028, this drug is forecast to deliver $2 billion in 2030, earning Viking a spot in the list of top 10 companies by GLP-1RA sales, after the industry heavyweights: Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Amgen. The fact that VK-2735 may be the first oral GLP-1RA to gain approval in obesity presents further commercial opportunities for Viking.\n\nAltimmune\u2019s pemvidutide is in Phase II for obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. With an expected launch in 2027, pemvidutide is forecast to generate sales of $1.21bn in 2030. Finally, Structure Therapeutics\u2019 GSBR-1290 is in Phase II for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Similarly to VK-2735, GSBR-1290 is also being developed as an oral formulation. This drug is expected to launch in 2028 and ultimately generate sales of $1.2bn in 2030.\n\nThe domination of the GLP-1RA landscape by large, mega-cap companies such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly is expected to continue until 2030. However, the entry of emerging biotechs into this space highlights the dynamic potential of the sector as Viking Therapeutics, Altimmune and Structure Therapeutics aim to disrupt this landscape. If the forecasts materialise, these three emerging companies will be catapulted onto the global stage, generating huge returns for shareholders. These estimations further highlight the lucrative potential offered by GLP-1Rs for both industry giants and innovative smaller players poised to make their mark on the global stage.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration ended 2024 with a quartet of notable drug approvals, including three of new medicines that Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk and Bristol Myers Squibb developed for cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and cancer, respectively.\n\nThe approvals concluded a year in which the agency\u2019s main review office cleared 50 novel medicines, less than the 55 in 2023 but toward the higher end of annual totals over the past several years. The record came in 2018, when 59 were cleared by the regulator\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA\u2019s biologics office also issued 10 new medicine approvals in 2024.\n\nThe Dec. 20 clearance of Alyftrek came a few weeks ahead of the agency\u2019s Jan. 2 decision deadline, and extends Vertex\u2019s dominance in the lung disease cystic fibrosis. Prior to Alyftrek\u2019s approval, Vertex had previously brought four cystic fibrosis medicines to market, building a business that generated nearly $10 billion in 2023. Sales are expected to surpass that total in 2024.\n\nLike Vertex\u2019s top-selling drug Trikafta, Alyftrek is a three-drug combination that uses a compound called tezacaftor as its chemical backbone. The two other components are different, allowing Alyftrek to be dosed less frequently \u2014 once daily instead of twice \u2014 and enabling Vertex to pay lower royalties on drug sales. Testing showed the drug was statistically \u201cnon-inferior\u201d to Trikafta on a measure of lung function, and better at lowering the amount of chloride in a person\u2019s sweat, a marker associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nAlyftrek\u2019s approval could also extend Vertex\u2019s market exclusivity in cystic fibrosis, as the drug\u2019s main U.S. patent expires in 2039, two years after Trikafta\u2019s. Vertex priced the therapy at about $370,000 per year, a 7% premium to Trikafta.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Alhemo, meanwhile, was approved on Dec. 20 to prevent bleeds in people at least 12 years of age who have either the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d forms of hemophilia. The decision came about a year and a half after an earlier rejection and makes Novo\u2019s drug available to those who develop an immune response, or \u201cinhibitors,\u201d to other therapies, unlike Pfizer\u2019s similar medicine Hympavzi.\n\nBristol Myers also joined Roche in bringing to market a type of cancer immunotherapy that can be administered via an under-the-skin injection, rather than an infusion. The drug, Opdivo Qvantiq, was approved on Dec. 27 for use in most of the solid tumors Bristol Myers\u2019 Opdivo is cleared to treat. Opdivo Qvantiq\u2019s OK follows the September clearance of a subcutaneous version of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq, and comes ahead of the potential availability of an under-the-skin form of Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda.\n\nThese newer versions are administered more quickly than their predecessors \u2014 in Opdivo Qvantiq\u2019s case, within three to five minutes, versus 30 to 60 minutes for Opdivo \u2014 and are protected by newer sets of patents. Opdivo\u2019s main patent is set to expire in 2028.\n\nFinally, Lilly on Dec. 20 added a new use for its fast-selling weight-loss drug Zepbound, securing the first clearance of a prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea. The drug has been specifically approved for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Its use is recommended alongside increased exercise and a lower-calorie diet.\n\nThe approval adds another new indication for so-called incretin medicines, which are also available for diabetes and have proven beneficial for heart failure, kidney disease and a common liver disorder.",

            "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Novo Nordisk\u2019s concizumab, which will be sold under the brand name Alhemo, as a daily treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in certain adults and adolescents with hemophilia.\n\nEligible patients are those with hemophilia A or B, who are 12 and older, and have inhibitors, a type of neutralizing antibody against blood clotting proteins that can render standard preventive (prophylactic) treatments less effective.\n\n\u201cThe approval of Alhemo signifies a remarkable achievement in prophylactic hemophilia treatment for individuals with inhibitors aged 12 years and older who, in some cases, currently have few options,\u201d Anna Windle, PhD, senior vice president of clinical development at Novo Nordisk, said in a company press release.\n\nAlhemo has also been granted marketing authorization in Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Japan, and the European Union, although the specific patient groups eligible for treatment vary by country.\n\nIn contrast to many other prophylactic treatments that are given via infusions into the bloodstream (intravenous), Alhemo is given via under-the-skin (subcutaneous) injections, the first subcutaneous treatment of its kind to be approved for this patient population, Novo Nordisk noted.\n\nRecommended Reading By giving back to our community, we can help dispel loneliness\n\nAlhemo comes in prefilled, premixed injection pens at various concentrations\n\nAlhemo can be administered by patients or caregivers after appropriate training. The treatment comes in prefilled, premixed injection pens at various concentrations and should be injected into the thigh or abdomen once daily.\n\n\u201cAs the first treatment of its kind for this population, Alhemo represents a significant step in helping to address the unmet needs of patients with hemophilia with inhibitors,\u201d Windle said.\n\nPeople with hemophilia lack functional blood clotting proteins, making them susceptible to prolonged, excessive, and spontaneous bleeding episodes. In hemophilia A, the deficient blood clotting protein is factor VIII (FVIII), and in hemophilia B, it\u2019s factor IX (FIX).\n\nFactor replacement therapies are standard prophylactic treatments that provide patients with a version of the clotting protein they lack via regular intravenous infusions.\n\nHowever, around 30% of people with severe hemophilia A and 5%-10% of those with severe hemophilia B develop inhibitors against FVIII or FIX, which can render factor replacement therapies less effective. Such patients may require nonfactor treatment options to prevent bleeds.\n\nRecommended Reading Study suggests Altuviiio may provide benefit over Hemlibra in preventing bleeds\n\nInhibitors \u2018most serious treatment-related complication\u2019 in hemophilia\n\n\u201cThe development of inhibitors remains the most serious treatment-related complication for people living with hemophilia,\u201d said Amy Shapiro, MD, CEO and co-medical director at the Indiana Hemophilia & Thrombosis Center. \u201cFor patients with inhibitors, especially in hemophilia B, their hemophilia may remain poorly controlled and pose a life-threatening risk.\u201d\n\nAlhemo works by blocking a protein called tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which normally inhibits blood clotting by interfering with the production of a blood clotting enzyme called thrombin. In doing so, the treatment is expected to increase thrombin production and enhance blood clotting, thereby preventing bleeds in hemophilia patients regardless of the presence of inhibitors.\n\nNovo Nordisk first applied to the FDA for Alhemo\u2019s approval in 2023, but at the time, the regulatory body requested more information about the dosing and manufacturing of the treatment.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s recent approval is based on data from the Phase 3 explorer7 trial (NCT04083781), where the treatment was found to reduce the rate of bleeds requiring treatment by 86% among hemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors relative to a group that received no prophylaxis treatment.\n\nThe median number of treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeds per year was zero for those given Alhemo, compared with 9.8 among those who were not on prophylaxis. Around two-thirds of patients (64%) on Alhemo experienced no spontaneous or traumatic bleeds that required treatment during the first six months, which was achieved by 11% of patients who were not on prophylaxis.\n\nThe most common side effects of Alhemo include injection site reactions and hives (urticaria). It shouldn\u2019t be used by people with a history of serious allergic reactions to Alhemo or any of its ingredients.\n\n\u201cThe approval of Alhemo \u2026 provides a much-needed alternative to the current standard of care in hemophilia B with inhibitors, while offering patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors more treatment options, ultimately providing more patients with inhibitors the opportunity to personalize their care and address current treatment gaps,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nAnother Phase 3 trial called explorer8 (NCT04082429) is testing Alhemo in patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors. Data from that study have indicated the preventive therapy similarly reduced bleeding episodes in that patient group relative to the group not on prophylaxis.",

            "content": "Shares of Novo Nordisk are in free fall following lackluster results from a new clinical trial.\n\nThe biggest talking point in the pharmaceutical industry at the moment revolves around treatments known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. GLP-1 agonists are used to treat diabetes and chronic weight management, although research suggests these medications could have other applications in areas such as sleep apnea, kidney disease, and cardiovascular complications.\n\nAt the moment, the hottest GLP-1 treatment is Ozempic. Danish pharmaceutical leader Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) is the brains behind Ozempic, as well as sibling GLP-1 medications including Wegovy, Rybelsus, and Saxenda. You'd think with such a robust lineup of options surrounding one of healthcare's biggest opportunities, shares of Novo Nordisk would be soaring.\n\nHowever, this is far from the case. I'm going to break down why a recent piece of news from Novo Nordisk caused the stock to tank. Moreover, I'll explore if now is an opportunity to buy the dip, or run for the hills.\n\nWhat happened with Novo Nordisk stock?\n\nOn Dec. 20, Novo announced results from a phase 3 clinical trial surrounding one of its new GLP-1 candidates, called CagriSema. The name CagriSema is simply an amalgamation of the two primary ingredients in the drug: cagrilintide and semaglutide. Of note, semaglutide is the leading ingredient in Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. Per the results of the study, patients who took CagriSema reached an averaged weight reduction of up to 22.7%.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, shares of Novo has declined by nearly 17% following the announcement of the CagriSema study. Clearly, investors were not pleased with the outcome of this trial.\n\nWhy is this development important?\n\nYou're probably wondering why investors reacted the way they did following Novo's latest clinical update. In my eyes, there are two main reasons:\n\nNovo's management had set a benchmark of 25% average weight reduction for the CagriSema study. As mentioned, the entire population of patients taking CagriSema only experienced about a 23% reduction in weight. It is important to note, however, that roughly 40% of patients \"reached a weight loss of 25% or more.\" The second reason I think investors were spooked by the CagriSema results is related to a recent study published by Novo's top rival in the weight loss space, Eli Lilly. Lilly is the maker of GLP-1 treatments Mounjaro and Zepbound. For comparison\u2019s sake, Mounjaro is essentially Lilly's answer to Ozempic, while Zepbound is the company's response to Wegovy. In a study published on Dec. 4, Lilly found that patients taking Zepbound experienced an average weight reduction of 20% versus those who took Wegovy reached an average weight loss of roughly 14%. When taking these figures into account, there's an argument to be made that CagriSema is not superior to Zepbound, leading some investors to question the strength of Novo's clinical pipeline.\n\nIs Novo Nordisk stock a buy right now?\n\nOn the surface, the results from the CagriSema trial appear underwhelming. But as I often encourage investors to do, it's important to zoom out and consider the bigger picture.\n\nIn a study from 2021, patients taking semaglutide experienced an average weight reduction of 14.9% over the course of a 68-week trial period. So even though CagriSema fell short of its goal in the phase 3 trial, there's an argument to be made that it is still a stronger treatment when benchmarked against semaglutide (i.e., Wegovy and Ozempic).\n\nTo me, I see the precipitous sell-off in Novo stock as emotional, panic-driven behavior. At the end of the day, I think CagriSema will become a blockbuster drug for Novo in the long run. For now, the company simply needs to go back to the drawing board and tweak some of its research and development (R&D) protocols in order to improve CagriSema's efficacy before it reaches approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nRight now, Novo stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22.5 -- its lowest level in well over a year. I think now is a terrific opportunity to scoop up shares of Novo on the dip and lower your cost basis if you're an existing investor, or initiate a position if you've been following the company for a while.\n\nAll told, Novo's long-term thesis still holds up, and I think the company will remain a leader in the GLP-1 space for years to come.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been competing in the obesity market for the past year, making it an opportune time to review the benefits of the two most prominent obesity medications. According to leading data and analytics company GlobalData, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (tirzepatide) is poised to surpass Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy (semaglutide), despite expectations for continued sales growth for both drugs.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy made a significant impact on the obesity market when it launched in 2021. Many key opinion leaders interviewed by GlobalData have highlighted its revolutionary effect. With an average weight loss of 14% of body weight in obese patients, Wegovy became the most effective obesity medication available, addressing a previously underserved market. Wegovy\u2019s success, coupled with the recognition of obesity as a chronic metabolic disease, spurred a wave of investment into obesity treatment. Currently, more than 400 companies are actively developing obesity treatments in phases of development ranging from discovery to clinical trials and preregistration, according to GlobalData\u2019s drug database.\n\nFollowing Wegovy\u2019s success, Eli Lilly introduced Zepbound after receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in November 2023. Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro outside the US, quickly emerged as Wegovy\u2019s primary competitor. Tirzepatide\u2019s dual agonism mechanism allows for 20% average body weight loss in patients. Recent head-to-head trial results demonstrated the superior efficacy of Zepbound over Wegovy, leading to a decline in Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock value. Zepbound\u2019s market entry has reduced Novo Nordisk\u2019s patient share over the past year, although drug shortages have also been a significant factor.\n\nNovo Nordisk has sought to maintain its market position by securing additional approvals for Wegovy, including for cardiovascular risk factors. Semaglutide, which was initially approved for type 2 diabetes under the name Ozempic, has since gained approvals for obesity and other metabolic indications. Currently, semaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for four additional indications, including chronic kidney disease. Similarly, tirzepatide has been approved for type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro and for obesity under the name Zepbound (or Mounjaro in some regions). On 20 December, tirzepatide also received FDA approval for obstructive sleep apnea. Tirzepatide is being investigated for four additional indications, including cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Both companies are aiming to expand the patient populations benefiting from their blockbuster drugs, leading to projected sales growth over the next decade. Thus, Eli Lilly appears to be following a strategy similar to Novo Nordisk\u2019s to further increase patient populations and sales.\n\nAdditionally, Eli Lilly is negotiating with various national health services regarding the pricing and prescription of tirzepatide. If tirzepatide proves to also be a more cost-effective option for patients, it may surpass Novo Nordisk in the obesity treatment market.\n\nDespite the recent launch of tirzepatide in many countries, the results from the past year indicate that Eli Lilly currently offers the most competitive option in the obesity market. This development represents a significant, albeit anticipated, challenge for its competitor Novo Nordisk.",

            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration ended 2024 with a quartet of notable drug approvals, including three of new medicines that Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk and Bristol Myers Squibb developed for cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and cancer, respectively.\n\nThe approvals concluded a year in which the agency\u2019s main review office cleared 50 novel medicines, less than the 55 in 2023 but toward the higher end of annual totals over the past several years. The record came in 2018, when 59 were cleared by the regulator\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA\u2019s biologics office also issued 10 new medicine approvals in 2024.\n\nThe Dec. 20 clearance of Alyftrek came a few weeks ahead of the agency\u2019s Jan. 2 decision deadline, and extends Vertex\u2019s dominance in the lung disease cystic fibrosis. Prior to Alyftrek\u2019s approval, Vertex had previously brought four cystic fibrosis medicines to market, building a business that generated nearly $10 billion in 2023. Sales are expected to surpass that total in 2024.\n\nLike Vertex\u2019s top-selling drug Trikafta, Alyftrek is a three-drug combination that uses a compound called tezacaftor as its chemical backbone. The two other components are different, allowing Alyftrek to be dosed less frequently \u2014 once daily instead of twice \u2014 and enabling Vertex to pay lower royalties on drug sales. Testing showed the drug was statistically \u201cnon-inferior\u201d to Trikafta on a measure of lung function, and better at lowering the amount of chloride in a person\u2019s sweat, a marker associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nAlyftrek\u2019s approval could also extend Vertex\u2019s market exclusivity in cystic fibrosis, as the drug\u2019s main U.S. patent expires in 2039, two years after Trikafta\u2019s. Vertex priced the therapy at about $370,000 per year, a 7% premium to Trikafta.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Alhemo, meanwhile, was approved on Dec. 20 to prevent bleeds in people at least 12 years of age who have either the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d forms of hemophilia. The decision came about a year and a half after an earlier rejection and makes Novo\u2019s drug available to those who develop an immune response, or \u201cinhibitors,\u201d to other therapies, unlike Pfizer\u2019s similar medicine Hympavzi.\n\nBristol Myers also joined Roche in bringing to market a type of cancer immunotherapy that can be administered via an under-the-skin injection, rather than an infusion. The drug, Opdivo Qvantig, was approved on Dec. 27 for use in most of the solid tumors Bristol Myers\u2019 Opdivo is cleared to treat. Opdivo Qvantig\u2019s OK follows the September clearance of a subcutaneous version of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq, and comes ahead of the potential availability of an under-the-skin form of Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda.\n\nThese newer versions are administered more quickly than their predecessors \u2014 in Opdivo Qvantig\u2019s case, within three to five minutes, versus 30 to 60 minutes for Opdivo \u2014 and are protected by newer sets of patents. Opdivo\u2019s main patent is set to expire in 2028.\n\nFinally, Lilly on Dec. 20 added a new use for its fast-selling weight-loss drug Zepbound, securing the first clearance of a prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea. The drug has been specifically approved for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Its use is recommended alongside increased exercise and a lower-calorie diet.\n\nThe approval adds another new indication for so-called incretin medicines, which are also available for diabetes and have proven beneficial for heart failure, kidney disease and a common liver disorder.",

So, Zepbound is expected to take the lead in the obesity market if it hasn\u2019t already done so.\u201d\n\nBased on SURMOUNT-5 results released last month, Zepbound was more effective in promoting weight loss. The trial demonstrated that Wegovy caused an average weight loss of 13.7% body weight, compared to 20.2% weight loss in patients using Zepbound.\n\nAlciati added: \u201cFrom the start, Zepbound emerged as the primary new competitor of Wegovy, and it seems that Eli Lilly has followed in some way Novo Nordisk\u2019s strategy to increase [the] patient population through investigating the drug in multiple indications.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide is also approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and those with cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for several additional indications such as chronic kidney disease.\n\n\u201cThe impact of Wegovy on the obesity market has been huge. key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData defined it as \u2018revolutionary\u2019. Now with Zepbound, the revolution continues,\u201d said Alciati.\n\nIndeed, Novo Nordisk\u2019s model is echoed by Eli Lilly\u2019s, and tirzepatide is currently being investigated for additional indications, including chronic kidney disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), as well as for patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Last month, it received FDA approval for treating obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\nRecord-high sales made by Novo Nordisk in the obesity treatment space have prompted a wave of investment in the sector over the last few years. According to GlobalData\u2019s Drugs Database, there are now more than 400 companies actively developing obesity drugs, from discovery to pre-registration candidates.\n\nThere is also significant demand in the area. GlobalData identified that obesity and overweight conditions were estimated to have caused a staggering $425.5bn in economic costs to businesses and employees in the US alone in 2023. It reported that, of the 158 million civilian employees on nonfarm payrolls, 30% (46.9 million) were classified as having obesity and 34% (53.8 million) had overweight in 2023.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned -21.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Novo Nordisk belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Novo Nordisk is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of +23.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.6%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +23.6% from what Novo Nordisk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Novo Nordisk.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Novo Nordisk, the consensus sales estimate of $11.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22.7%. The $40.62 billion and $50.16 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.5% and +23.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNovo Nordisk reported revenues of $10.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.5%. EPS of $0.90 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.61%. The EPS surprise was -1.1%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Novo Nordisk surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNovo Nordisk is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Novo Nordisk. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks Naming Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nWant to be tipped off early to our 10 top picks for the entirety of 2025?\n\nHistory suggests their performance could be sensational.\n\nFrom 2012 (when our Director of Research Sheraz Mian assumed responsibility for the portfolio) through November, 2024, the Zacks Top 10 Stocks gained +2,112.6%, more than QUADRUPLING the S&P 500\u2019s +475.6%.

According to MSN, the European Commission confirmed that it did not identify any potential competition concerns arising from the deal, paving the way for the transaction to proceed without regulatory hurdles in the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nThe deal, first announced by Novo Holdings in February, has now cleared all necessary regulatory scrutiny within the EU. The Commission stated that the merger would not harm competition in any of the markets it reviewed in the EEA, which includes the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. \u201cThe proposed merger would not raise competition concerns on any of the markets examined in the EEA or on any substantial part of it,\u201d the European Commission said, as reported by Reuters.\n\nRelated: Novo Holdings\u2019 $16.5 Billion Catalent Buyout Faces Final Countdown\n\nThe EU antitrust body emphasized that there are ample competing alternatives in the market, alleviating any fears of monopolistic behavior following the merger. With this approval, Novo Holdings is one step closer to finalizing its acquisition of Catalent, a company that plays a key role in providing manufacturing services for pharmaceutical firms.\n\nThe acquisition marks a significant development for Novo Holdings, the majority owner of Novo Nordisk, which has seen remarkable success with its weight-loss drug Wegovy. According to MSN, the soaring sales of Wegovy have catapulted Novo Nordisk to the top of Europe\u2019s corporate rankings, making it the continent\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalization.\n\nSource: MSN",

            "content": "The discovery of insulin was, in its day, a medical miracle that revived dying diabetes sufferers in mere minutes. Current medical miracles include potential cures for diabetes. Now we have a form of insulin that adjusts its activity to blood sugar levels, and is nearing trials for practical use as a Novo Nordisk product.\n\nScientists Just Created a Potential Cure For Diabetes - Breakthrough Explained\n\nThe starting point:\n\nNature Chemistry: A simple and accessible synthetic lectin for glucose recognition and sensing\n\nBinding carbohydrates from water is a difficult task, even for the natural carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins. The design of synthetic lectin mimics is correspondingly challenging, especially if good selectivities are required. In previous work we showed that success is possible, but only for complex polycyclic architectures that require lengthy and low-yielding syntheses; for example, one glucose-selective system was made in 21 steps and only 0.1% overall yield. Here we report the discovery of a simple monocyclic host that matches the earlier designs, but is far more accessible as it is prepared in just five steps and 23% overall yield. The new synthetic lectin binds glucose with excellent selectivity versus other common monosaccharides (for example, ~50:1 versus galactose) and sufficient affinity for glucose sensing at the concentrations found in blood. It also features a built-in signalling system in the form of strong and guest-dependent fluorescence emission. The effectiveness and simplicity of this molecule suggests the potential for development into a new methodology for practical glucose monitoring.\n\nI will pass over the travails of the startup, Ziylo, that set out to turn this bit of chemistry know-how into a practical medical tool. The idea was to find molecules like this lectin that could be bound to the ends of a glucose molecule, turning it on and off. (I pass over the biochemistry involved here, too.)\n\nAt this point, Novo Nordisk, one of the largest insulin suppliers in the world, joined in, buying Ziylo.\n\nNovo Nordisk Acquires Ziylo in Possible $800 Million-Plus Deal\n\nIt is believed that a glucose-responsive insulin might help eliminate the risks of low blood sugar, which is one of the primary risks associated with insulin treatment in diabetics. Before the acquisition, some of Ziylo\u2019s research activities were spun out of the company into a new company, Carbometrics. Carbometrics has inked a research collaboration with Novo Nordisk to help with optimization of the glucose binding molecules. Carbometrics licensed rights to develop non-therapeutic approaches of the glucose binding molecules with plans to focus on developing continuous glucose monitoring applications.\n\nNature: Glucose-sensitive insulin with attenuation of hypoglycaemia\n\nThe risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) constitutes the main challenge associated with insulin therapy for diabetes1,2. Insulin doses must be adjusted to ensure that blood glucose values are within the normal range, but matching insulin doses to fluctuating glucose levels is difficult because even a slightly higher insulin dose than needed can lead to a hypoglycaemic incidence, which can be anything from uncomfortable to life-threatening. It has therefore been a long-standing goal to engineer a glucose-sensitive insulin that can auto-adjust its bioactivity in a reversible manner according to ambient glucose levels to ultimately achieve better glycaemic control while lowering the risk of hypoglycaemia3. Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle4 and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations. The insulin receptor affinity for NNC2215 increased 3.2-fold when the glucose concentration was increased from 3 to 20 mM. In animal studies, the glucose-sensitive bioactivity of NNC2215 was demonstrated to lead to protection against hypoglycaemia while partially covering glucose excursions.\n\nIt took 6 years to tune this molecular system to activate at the precise level required for glucose control in humans. This means that blood glucose levels stop dropping at that level, even in the presence of excess NNC2215. If some form of this medication proves out in human clinical trials, it will mean that patients can take enough NNC2215 insulin to prevent blood glucose going too high, without fear of hypoglycemic attacks.\n\nIOW, hooray!",

Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Novo Nordisk (NVO)\n\nBagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company and a leader in the worldwide diabetes market with a full portfolio of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, modern insulins and human insulins. The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity.\n\nNVO is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. NVO has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 19.6% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $3.23 per share. NVO boasts an average earnings surprise of 1.5%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, NVO should be on investors' short list.\n\nZacks Naming Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nWant to be tipped off early to our 10 top picks for the entirety of 2025?\n\nHistory suggests their performance could be sensational.\n\nFrom 2012 (when our Director of Research Sheraz Mian assumed responsibility for the portfolio) through November, 2024, the Zacks Top 10 Stocks gained +2,112.6%, more than QUADRUPLING the S&P 500\u2019s +475.6%.

The art nouveau house was built in 1892 by Mr Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg. Since then, the brewer, which now uses the house for meetings, has become one of the biggest in the world. Sitting across the table, Mr Jacob Aarup-Andersen, Carlsberg\u2019s current boss, admits that the company\u2019s success is part of a bigger puzzle about Danish businesses. Just last night at dinner, he says, someone asked him how a country so small could produce so many large companies.\n\nWhat is true of Denmark is true of Sweden, Norway and Finland. The Nordic region accounts for about 1 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and 0.3 per cent of its population. Yet it has produced an impressive list of corporate giants. Lego is the planet\u2019s biggest toymaker by revenue; Ikea is its biggest maker of furniture (and, thanks to Swedish meatballs, its sixth-largest restaurant chain). The Nordics are home to leading manufacturers of everything from industrial machinery (Atlas Copco) and telecoms equipment (Nokia and Ericsson) to seat belts (Autoliv) and lifts (Kone). The region has also produced the world\u2019s biggest music-streaming company (Spotify) and its largest buy-now-pay-later provider (Klarna). Novo Nordisk, a Danish pioneer in weight-loss drugs, is Europe\u2019s most-valuable company, even after its shares slumped in December in response to disappointing trial results for a new drug.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical stalwart Novo Nordisk (NVO) can\u2019t seem to get anything good going these days. As TipRanks\u2019 Vince Condarcuri stated, NVO stock has slipped significantly due to a string of bad news. From competing drugs outperforming Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy weight-loss solution to an investigation linking its type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic to a rare eye condition, the company is in a world of hurt.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nNevertheless, NVO stock stands as one of the powerhouses in the broader healthcare industry, carrying a market capitalization of over $294 billion. Up until late September, circumstances appeared rather auspicious for Novo Nordisk. However, at the moment, NVO sits more than 14% down for the year. In the past six months, shares erased almost 40% of equity value.\n\nFor investors looking at this fallout as a glass half-full, they enjoy justification for their bullishness. Over the past five years, the number of weeks of unusual volatility incurred is quite small. Most of the time, the red ink typically signaled a comeback effort over the next four weeks. Therefore, I am bullish on NVO stock, and I believe that a near-term call option strategy could be lucrative.\n\nLaying the Statistical Framework of NVO Stock\n\nOne of the key advantages of considering a bullish contrarian position on NVO stock is that the security features an upward bias. Specifically, over the past 261 weeks, 148 of them carried a positive return. This stat is defined as the percentage difference between Monday\u2019s opening price and Friday\u2019s close. Stated differently, the success ratio (from the long position\u2019s perspective) comes out to 56.7%. Therefore, unless a compelling reason exists to short NVO, a trader should exercise restraint.\n\nIn normal circumstances, the fear-greed spectrum benefits the bulls. On any given week, there is simply a better chance that NVO stock will end up in the black by the end of it. However, my thesis is that the fear-greed spectrum is substantially impacted whenever an event pushes NVO\u2019s price action by multiple standard deviations from the mean. Notably, within the aforementioned 261-week period, there have only been 13 weeks where NVO lost 5% of value or worse.\n\nHere\u2019s where circumstances get very intriguing for the bulls. Out of these 13 weeks, there have been nine instances when the average return of the subsequent four weeks entered into positive, non-zero territory. Further, the average return itself clocked in at 1.43%. That gives the optimistic contrarian a contextual success ratio of 69.23. This also suggests that the average return can be utilized as a benchmark price target.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly's Zepbound drug holds potential to dominate the global obesity market due to its superior efficacy and strategic market expansion, a report showed on Tuesday.\n\nThe drug will likely dominate the obesity market, surpassing Novo Nordisk's Wegovy (semaglutide), according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\n\nIt has been a year since the launch of Zepbound (tirzepatide) for obesity, and Eli Lilly's competition with Novo Nordisk continues.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, Zepbound emerged as the primary new competitor of Wegovy, and it seems that Eli Lilly has followed in some way Novo Nordisk's strategy to increase patients' population through investigating the drug in multiple indications,\u201d said Costanza Alciati, pharma analyst at GlobalData.\n\nRecently, Eli Lilly announced the results from its SURMOUNT-5 trial, comparing Zepbound and Wegovy's efficacy on equal grounds.\n\nZepbound, as expected, was more effective in promoting weight loss. While Wegovy caused an average weight loss of 13.7 per cent body weight, Zepbound promoted around 20.2 per cent body weight loss in patients.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, tirzepatide also received US FDA approval for obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nTirzepatide is being investigated for four additional indications, including cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\n\u201cIndeed, semaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for four additional indications, including chronic kidney disease,\u201d said the report.\n\nAccording to GlobalData drugs database, more than 400 companies are actively developing obesity drugs, from discovery to pre-registration candidates.\n\nThe impact of Wegovy on the obesity market has been huge. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData defined it as \u201crevolutionary\u201d.\n\nWith Zepbound, the revolution continues, and Eli Lilly's drug is more potent, and perhaps negotiations with national health services will also make it more cost-effective than Wegovy, said Alciati. \u201cSo, Zepbound is expected to take the lead in the obesity market if it hasn't already done so\u201d.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

For 2025, competition and supply constraints are areas to watch.\n\nBetween Novo Nordisk's (NVO) slightly disappointing results for its latest GLP-1 candidate, CagriSema, and questions that remain about Amgen's (AMGN) highly anticipated once-monthly injectable, MariTide, some wonder if the weight-loss drug market has reached its peak.\n\nMizuho healthcare expert Jared Holz wrote in a note that it's doubtful \"patients are seeking to lose more weight than what drugs like Zepbound and Wegovy are providing.\"\n\nZepbound, Eli Lilly's (LLY) weekly injectable weight-loss treatment, provides up to 24% weight loss, while Wegovy from Novo Nordisk provides up to 16%.\n\nNovo's most recent clinical trial data for CagriSema showed 23% weight loss \u2014 putting it just under Lilly's ceiling for Zepbound. The company had indicated it expected higher results, and the stock slid on news of the disappointing results.\n\nMounjaro manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company packaging is seen in this illustration photo taken in a pharmacy in Krakow, Poland, on April 9, 2024. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \u00b7 NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAmgen, meanwhile, reported 20% weight loss for once-monthly MariTide but saw sustained weight loss in those using the drug as a maintenance treatment with longer intervals \u2014 marking a differentiation between its drug and others on the market.\n\nThe question facing investors is whether or not Lilly and Novo can keep their lead in the market or if incoming competition from other players dilutes the market.\n\nBMO Capital managing director Evan Seigerman told Yahoo Finance that he is less bullish on Novo than before and has taken Novo and Lilly off his top picks for the pharma sector outlook next year.\n\n\"We still like them, and the reaction last week [to CagriSema news] was a bit overdone, but we cut our price targets significantly,\" Seigerman said.\n\nBMO cut its price target for Novo from $156 per share to just $105 per share.\n\n\"Lilly's GOAT status becoming more clear? Competitive landscape more challenging for Novo, but not impossible to overcome (2025 commercial execution is a great place to start),\" he wrote.\n\nSupply constraints are also something to watch after the FDA declared Lilly's shortage over this month, starting a countdown between February and March for different producers of copycat drugs. When the drugs were in shortage, compounding pharmacies were able to produce similar products without applying for approval. Now, with the shortage declared over, any drug with Lilly's key ingredient, tirzepatide \u2014 found in both Mounjaro and Zepbound \u2014 will need to halt production by early next year.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nInnovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical stalwart Novo Nordisk (NVO) can\u2019t seem to get anything good going these days. As TipRanks\u2019 Vince Condarcuri stated, NVO stock has slipped significantly due to a string of bad news. From competing drugs outperforming Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy weight-loss solution to an investigation linking its type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic to a rare eye condition, the company is in a world of hurt.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers: Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nNevertheless, NVO stock stands as one of the powerhouses in the broader healthcare industry, carrying a market capitalization of over $294 billion. Up until late September, circumstances appeared rather auspicious for Novo Nordisk. However, at the moment, NVO sits more than 14% down for the year. In the past six months, shares erased almost 40% of equity value.\n\nFor investors looking at this fallout as a glass half-full, they enjoy justification for their bullishness. Over the past five years, the number of weeks of unusual volatility incurred is quite small. Most of the time, the red ink typically signaled a comeback effort over the next four weeks. Therefore, I am bullish on NVO stock, and I believe that a near-term call option strategy could be lucrative.\n\nLaying the Statistical Framework of NVO Stock\n\nOne of the key advantages of considering a bullish contrarian position on NVO stock is that the security features an upward bias. Specifically, over the past 261 weeks, 148 of them carried a positive return. This stat is defined as the percentage difference between Monday\u2019s opening price and Friday\u2019s close. Stated differently, the success ratio (from the long position\u2019s perspective) comes out to 56.7%. Therefore, unless a compelling reason exists to short NVO, a trader should exercise restraint.\n\nIn normal circumstances, the fear-greed spectrum benefits the bulls. On any given week, there is simply a better chance that NVO stock will end up in the black by the end of it. However, my thesis is that the fear-greed spectrum is substantially impacted whenever an event pushes NVO\u2019s price action by multiple standard deviations from the mean. Notably, within the aforementioned 261-week period, there have only been 13 weeks where NVO lost 5% of value or worse.\n\nHere\u2019s where circumstances get very intriguing for the bulls. Out of these 13 weeks, there have been nine instances when the average return of the subsequent four weeks entered into positive, non-zero territory. Further, the average return itself clocked in at 1.43%. That gives the optimistic contrarian a contextual success ratio of 69.23. This also suggests that the average return can be utilized as a benchmark price target.\n\nTaking the Guesswork Out of Novo Nordisk Bull Call Spreads\n\nWhen it comes to bullish multi-leg options strategies, the Bull Call Spread is incredibly popular because of its leverage and simplicity. Structurally, the Bull Call Spread involves (for the same options chain) buying a call and simultaneously selling a call at a higher strike price. The credit received from the short call partially offsets the debit paid for the long call. Basically, the trader\u2019s long position is discounted.\n\nHowever, the difficulty comes in identifying the best Bull Call Spread to consider. It\u2019s a frustrating proposition. Being too aggressive can easily cause the trader to suffer the maximum loss, while being too conservative can lead to incurring an opportunity cost. While a Bull Call Spread trader\u2019s aim is for the target security to hit the short strike price, the speculator also gets no extra payout for any swings above this price.\n\nTherefore, the name of the game is to find the most realistic call spread strategy. Here, many, if not most, traders rely on stochastic price modeling to identify probabilities of success. However, these stochastic models incorporate a Bayesian framework that updates information based on data frequency. The conditional probability analysis mentioned earlier updates information based on data context. Stated simply, the odds of success \u2014 given the context of Novo Nordisk\u2019s fear-greed continuum \u2014 may be better than advertised.\n\nA Specific Strike Price to Aim For\n\nHaving said all that, let\u2019s apply the statistical logic to NVO stock. At the end of the business week beginning Dec. 16, 2024, NVO closed at $85, or 22.23% below Monday\u2019s opening price of $109.29. Assuming the statistical trend over the past five years holds up, there\u2019s a 69.23% chance that over the next four weeks, the average return would land at 1.43%. That gives us a price target of around $86.22.\n\nFurther, four weeks out from Dec. 20 coincides with the options chain expiring Jan. 17. So, based on the empirical evidence, investors should seek Bull Call Spreads where the second leg (the short strike) is $86. As for selecting the first leg (long strike), it comes down to individual risk tolerance. Generally speaking, narrower spreads may offer greater payout since the debit paid for a higher strike is cheaper than a lower strike. However, a wider spread may offer a lower breakeven threshold.\n\nTo be sure, investors can get more aggressive with a short strike price of $87. However, you would be taking the risk knowing that, on average, the rebound isn\u2019t quite robust enough to hit that strike price. As for anything above $87, the probability of success becomes even more constrained.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Take on Novo Nordisk\n\nTurning to Wall Street, NVO stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVO price target is $147.80, implying 72.4% upside potential.\n\nSee more NVO analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway: NVO Stock\u2019s Fallout Offers a Compelling Undervalued Opportunity\n\nAs Vince Condarcuri remarked, Novo Nordisk can\u2019t catch a break \u2014 there\u2019s really no better way to say it. A series of setbacks have led to a worrying erosion in NVO stock. However, historical trends over the past five years demonstrate that these unusual incidences of red ink offer discounted bullish opportunities.\n\nEssentially, investors can deploy a dynamic Bayesian mathematical framework to calculate the impact of NVO stock during aberrant market sessions. Under this framework, the investor can formulate a more contextually realistic price and time target. With this intelligence, a speculator can deploy a Bull Call Spread with greater confidence.\n\nDisclosure",

            "content": "Investors worldwide are scouring for their next big win after the door to the extremely lucrative obesity market was opened by pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Now benefiting on the Swedish stock exchange is a smaller Nordic biotech company.\n\n\u00d7 Expand Pila Pharma\n\nPila Pharma, a smaller Nordic biotech company listed on the Nasdaq First North exchange in Stockholm, has enjoyed an unusually good stock market year. The company was founded by Dorte X. Gram, a former Novo Nordisk researcher who during her time at the company discovered a potentially new mechanism of action for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Pila Pharma, which went public in the summer of 2021, has experienced an impressive development on the stock exchange throughout 2024, seeing a triple-digit percentage gain from the beginning of the year to now.\n\nThe company\u2019s main asset is a TRPV1 antagonist, which is a drug class not previously associated for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Named XEN-D0501, the asset is formulated as an oral tablet and is currently undergoing clinical phase II testing as a treatment for overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. According to Pila Pharma CEO Gustav H. Gram, the company\u2019s stated belief in the drug\u2019s potential to treat obesity, is likely part of the driving force behind the stock increase.\n\n\"These years stock developments for a lot of companies in this segment, illustrates that obesity medication is on everybody\u2019s minds. We are of course pleased that investors are now looking at us as a potential player with an innovative approach, even though we still have progress to make, before we can potentially assess whether our unique and potential first-in-class drug, could become a player for the continuously growing and fragmenting obesity market\" said Gustav H. Gram. \" We potentially have a very interesting drug candidate, which could have helpful effects on these very common global diseases of diabetes and obesity and would differentiate itself from other, currently approved drugs. This is a tablet-based formulation for which we see broad demand on a global scale, and it has a different side-effect profile than the GLP-1 drugs that are known to cause nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\"\n\nInvestors are searching for stocks with high potential\n\nJ.P. Morgan has previously estimated that the global obesity market could exceed $100 billion by 2030. The market\u2019s development is primarily driven by the big diabetes and obesity rivals, US-based Eli Lilly and Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, and their GLP-1 drugs for obesity treatment. Besides the two big players, investors might recognize other Nordic players in the field such as Zealand Pharma and Gubra from Denmark, and US-based Viking Therapeutics, all of which are also developing complex peptide-based products for the next generation of obesity drugs.\n\n\"A trend seems to be forming where many investors are looking for new assets from companies that develop novel and innovative projects to address future demand in a fragmenting market. My guess is that our completely different approach, as well as our lower valuation compared to others, might be why many investors have taken an interest in us recently\" said Gustav H. Gram. \"The obesity market has experienced huge uptake and value growth but we\u2019re still far from reaching the point of saturation with current injectable products. The industry is actively looking for new molecules with mechanisms of action that can improve treatment options and increase competition on the market, provided they\u2019re able to show good efficacy and side-effect profiles.\"\n\nResults spark interest\n\nIn past months, Pila Pharma has experienced a large uptick in international shareholder numbers, and while the new co-owners are welcomed, the company is eyeing a future with more long-term investors at the table.\n\n\"The strength of being a stock that\u2019s attractive to private investors shouldn\u2019t be underestimated but we are hoping and of course working toward getting heavier and more long-term institutional investors on board as our valuation hopefully increases. However, in order to attract the interest of larger asset managers and pension funds, we need to be able to show more results. So of course, generating new data plays a central role in our long-term plan to increase our valuation and to make the stock more solid\" said Gustav. H. Gram.\n\nAt the moment, Pila Pharma is making the last preparations before a new, larger safety study in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity can commence. In addition to evaluating safety, the company will also look at efficacy parameters such as weight reduction.\n\nThe company\u2019s primary drug candidate, XEN-D0501, has in earlier studies shown promising effects in diabetes as well as a large reduction in a biomarker for heart failure. Pila Pharma is therefore also greatly focused on the molecule being tested as a treatment for other diseases that are associated with diabetes and obesity, including different cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the main diabetes track, the company has just initiated a new preclinical study to investigate decrease in progression of abdominal aorta aneurysms, which is a cardiovascular disease.",

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nA to Z of 2024: Ozempic, the breakthrough drug for diabetes and weight loss\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 In 2024, Ozempic gained global attention as ground-breaking treatment not just for Type 2 diabetes but also weight management, leading to widespread demand and media coverage.\n\nOriginally developed by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk to manage blood sugar levels, Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, was found to cause significant weight loss. This led to its adoption as a popular off-label treatment for obesity.\n\nSemaglutide mimics a natural hormone made in the small intestine called glucagon-like peptide-1.\n\nBesides regulating blood sugar levels, semaglutide works in the brain to create a feeling of fullness, helping users eat less by curbing their appetite.\n\nThis double benefit led to Ozempic being hailed as a game-changer and fuelled a surge in its popularity, which has been driven by endorsements from celebrities and social media influencers , as well as online weight-loss success stories.\n\nTech mogul Elon Musk, media personality Sharon Osbourne and influencer and plus-size model Remi Bader have stated publicly that they have used Ozempic.\n\nIn Singapore, it was approved in 2021 by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to treat \u201cadults with insufficiently controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as an adjunct to diet and exercise\u201d, says a spokesperson for the authority.\n\n\u201cAny prescription and use of the medicine outside of the approved indication is considered as \u2018off-label use\u2019 and will depend on the professional judgment of the medical practitioners when managing their patients to ensure that it is in the patients\u2019 best interests,\u201d says the HSA spokesperson.\n\nDr Ben Ng, director of Arden Endocrinology Specialist Clinic, says his main concern with Ozempic, which is a prescription-only medicine, is that it is being marketed on social media as the \u201cnext miracle drug\u201d.\n\n\u201cThough obesity is extremely prevalent and needs to be addressed, I don\u2019t think this drug should be considered the solution to all problems related to obesity,\u201d he says.\n\nControlling one\u2019s diet and making lifestyle changes should remain the primary approach for treating obesity and diabetes, he notes.\n\nIn patients with diabetes, Dr Ng says Ozempic can be considered for those with poorly controlled blood sugar.\n\nIn overweight patients without diabetes, he adds, it may also be considered for those with a body mass index of 27.5 and above who have at least one health complication, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nDr Tan Kok Kuan, medical director at Dr Tan Medical Center, prescribes Ozempic mostly to patients with Type 2 diabetes who are also obese. In very select cases, he prescribes it to patients with obesity even if they do not have diabetes.\n\nOne of his patients, who came in with a fungal infection on the foreskin of his penis and was obese, tested positive for diabetes. After being prescribed Ozempic, his sugar levels were normal after a month. He also lost 17kg in three months \u2013 dropping from 105kg to 88kg, and reaching a healthy weight range.\n\nDr Tan says his patients typically see significant improvements in their sugar levels within the first two months of taking Ozempic.\n\nDr Ng says weight loss tends to be progressive and usually starts within three to four weeks, and can last for up to four months. \u201cWe expect patients to lose anywhere from 5 to 12 per cent of their total body weight,\u201d he adds.\n\nHowever, not all who have diabetes will be prescribed Ozempic, notes Dr Tan.\n\nAs a first-line treatment for diabetes, he usually prescribes metformin, a more affordable and effective medication. In comparison, Dr Tan says, Ozempic can cost over 20 times more for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nAt Dr Ng\u2019s clinic, for example, one month\u2019s supply of metformin costs less than $30, while Ozempic can cost more than $400.\n\nDr Tan says Ozempic offers the convenience of a weekly injection, compared with other medications. It also provides end-organ protection, he adds, meaning it helps protect the kidneys and heart.\n\nHowever, the main drawback is its high cost, and some patients are reluctant to use it due to the need for self-injections, he notes.\n\nAnd, like any medication, Ozempic can have side effects.\n\nDr Ng says the most common ones tend to be related to the gastrointestinal tract. He advises patients to look out for symptoms such as nausea, constipation and gastric reflux.\n\nIn some patients, the nausea can be so severe that they are unable to drink water, making them more prone to dehydration, he adds. Pancreatitis, which is the inflammation of the pancreas, can also occur in a small proportion of patients, he adds.\n\nThe HSA spokesperson says the authority has a post-market surveillance programme to monitor the safety of registered medicines. This includes a review of adverse events reported by healthcare professionals and safety concerns detected globally.\n\nIf safety concerns are detected, HSA will take appropriate action to safeguard public health, adds the spokesperson.\n\nDr Tan says: \u201cI think one thing the medical community is very careful with is that we don\u2019t want patients to think of Ozempic as some kind of weight-loss medicine that can simply be bought over the counter and used without supervision.\n\n\u201cPatients may have side effects, so we will reserve it for those who are suffering from obesity and its complications, and for whom other treatments have failed .\u201d\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

            "content": "The global obesity treatment market is expected to expand from 27.3 trillion won last year to 53.64 trillion won by 2028. (Reuters)\n\nObesity treatment drugs have emerged as a significant focus in the pharmaceutical and bio industry this year, driven by high public interest and substantial market growth. The release of Novo Nordisk's \"Wegovy\" in Korea last October exemplifies this trend, with domestic pharmaceutical companies like Hanmi Pharmaceutical and Daewoong Pharmaceutical accelerating their research and development (R&D) efforts in this area.\n\nThe annual sales of leading companies in the obesity treatment market, such as Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, have seen remarkable increases this year. Novo Nordisk's third-quarter sales reached approximately 14.247 trillion won, marking a 21.4% rise from the previous year. Similarly, Eli Lilly's sales grew by 20.5% to 16.2104 trillion won over the same period. Notably, Wegovy's third-quarter sales surged by 77% year-on-year to approximately 7.6519 trillion won. Industry experts predict that Wegovy will rank among the top 10 global drug sales next year.\n\nThe growth trend in obesity treatment drugs is expected to continue, reflecting a broader megatrend in the global pharmaceutical and bio industry. The Korea Health Industry Development Institute forecasts that the global obesity treatment market will expand from 27.3 trillion won last year to 53.64 trillion won by 2028, with an average annual growth rate of 14.4%.\n\nDomestic companies are also making significant strides in developing obesity treatment drugs to secure global competitiveness. Hanmi Pharmaceutical, for instance, is focusing on six areas of obesity treatment, including overweight and severe obesity. Their drug \"Efeglenatide,\" currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in Korea, is tailored to the characteristics of Koreans, who generally have fewer cases of severe obesity compared to Westerners. This drug is optimized for weight loss in patients ranging from overweight to stage 1 obesity, with a target launch in the second half of 2026. Another promising candidate from Hanmi, \"HM17321,\" aims to mitigate the side effects of GLP-1 class treatments, such as muscle loss, by selectively reducing fat while increasing muscle. This drug is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical trials in the second half of 2024.\n\nMetavia, a subsidiary of Dong-A ST, is conducting global Phase 1 clinical trials for the GLP-1/GCG dual agonist \"DA-1726.\" This drug works by suppressing appetite through GLP-1 activation and increasing basal metabolic rate via glucagon receptor activation.\n\nEfforts to enhance the convenience of obesity treatment drugs are also underway. Progen is developing \"PG-102,\" an obesity drug that can be administered biweekly or once a month by improving the drug's half-life. Progen recently began administering PG-102 to patients in Phase 2 clinical trials in Korea, with results expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nDaewoong Pharmaceutical is collaborating with TionLab Therapeutics, Daehan New Pharm, and Darim Biotech to develop a once-a-month obesity treatment drug. They aim to leverage TionLab Therapeutics' long-acting drug delivery platform technology, \"Microsphere,\" to extend the administration cycle. Additionally, Daewoong Pharmaceutical is developing a patch-type obesity treatment drug \"DW-1022\" using microneedles in collaboration with Raphas. This patch form reduces the pain and risk of secondary infections associated with conventional injections. The Phase 1 clinical trial for DW-1022 was completed earlier this month, and the clinical results are currently being analyzed.",
